AB Droughts are a rising concern for terrestrial ecosystems, particularly for forests where drought-induced reductions in tree growth and survival are reported. Biodiversity has long been acknowledged as an important component modulating ecosystem functions, including mitigating their vulnerability to climate-related stresses. Yet the impact of tree diversity on forest vulnerability to drought is unclear. In this review, consistent mechanisms are identified by which tree diversity could reduce vulnerability to drought and emerging evidence is revealed that tree diversity is not systematically positively related to drought resistance in forests. A path is suggested to further increase our knowledge on this subject in the face of climate change, proposing standardization of methods to quantitatively establish diversity impacts on the drought resistance of forests.

AB The global urbanization rate is accelerating; however, data limitations have far prevented robust estimations of either global urban expansion or its effects on terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP). Here, using a high resolution dataset of global land use/cover (Globe-Land30), we show that global urban areas expanded by an average of 5694 km(2) per year between 2000 and 2010. The rapid urban expansion in the past decade has in turn reduced global terrestrial NPP, with a net loss of 22.4 Tg Carbon per year (Tg C year(-1)). Although small compared to total terrestrial NPP and fossil fuel carbon emissions worldwide, the urbanization-induced decrease in NPP offset 30% of the climate-driven increase (73.6 Tg C year(-1)) over the same period. Our findings highlight the urgent need for global strategies to address urban expansion, enhance natural carbon sinks, and increase agricultural productivity.

AB Improved soil management is increasingly pursued to ensure food security for the world's rising global population, with the ancillary benefit of storing carbon in soils to lower the threat of climate change. While all increments to soil organic matter are laudable, we suggest caution in ascribing large, potential climate change mitigation to enhanced soil management. We find that the most promising techniques, including applications of biochar and enhanced silicate weathering, collectively are not likely to balance more than 5% of annual emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion.

AB BackgroundNeonicotinoids are a class of systemic insecticides widely used on food crops globally. These pesticides may be found in off-target food items and persist in the environment. Despite the potential for extensive human exposure, there are limited studies regarding the prevalence of neonicotinoid residues in foods sold and consumed in the United States.MethodsResidue data for seven neonicotinoid pesticides collected between 1999 and 2015 by the US Department of Agriculture's Pesticide Data Program (PDP) were collated and summarized by year across various food commodities, including fruit, vegetable, meat, dairy, grain, honey, and baby food, as well as water to qualitatively describe and examine trends in contamination frequency and residue concentrations.ResultsThe highest detection frequencies (DFs) for neonicotinoids by year on all commodities were generally below 20%. Average DFs over the entire study period, 1999-2015, for domestic and imported commodities were similar at 4.5%. For all the samples (both domestic and imported) imidacloprid was the neonicotinoid with the highest overall detection frequency at 12.0%. However, higher DFs were observed for specific food commodity-neonicotinoid combinations such as: cherries (45.9%), apples (29.5%), pears (24.1%) and strawberries (21.3%) for acetamiprid; and cauliflower (57.5%), celery (20.9%), cherries (26.3%), cilantro (30.6%), grapes (28.9%), collard greens (24.9%), kale (31.4%), lettuce (45.6%), potatoes (31.2%) and spinach (38.7%) for imidacloprid. Neonicotinoids were also detected in organic commodities, (DF<6%). Individual commodities with at least 5% of samples testing positive for two or more neonicotinoids included apples, celery, and cherries. Generally, neonicotinoid residues on food commodities did not exceed US Environmental Protection Agency tolerance levels. Increases in detection trends for both finished and untreated water samples for imidacloprid were observed from 2004 to 2011.ConclusionsAnalysis of PDP data indicates that low levels of neonicotinoids are present in commonly-consumed fruits and vegetables sold in the US. Trends in detection frequencies suggest an increase in use of acetamiprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam as replacements for imidacloprid. Given these findings, more extensive surveillance of the food and water supply is warranted, as well as biomonitoring studies and assessment of cumulative daily intake in high risk groups, including pregnant women and infants.

AB Land-management options for greenhouse gas removal (GGR) include afforestation or reforestation (AR), wetland restoration, soil carbon sequestration (SCS), biochar, terrestrial enhanced weathering (TEW), and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). We assess the opportunities and risks associated with these options through the lens of their potential impacts on ecosystem services (Nature's Contributions to People; NCPs) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We find that all land-based GGR options contribute positively to at least some NCPs and SDGs. Wetland restoration and SCS almost exclusively deliver positive impacts. A few GGR options, such as afforestation, BECCS, and biochar potentially impact negatively some NCPs and SDGs, particularly when implemented at scale, largely through competition for land. For those that present risks or are least understood, more research is required, and demonstration projects need to proceed with caution. For options that present low risks and provide cobenefits, implementation can proceed more rapidly following no-regrets principles.

AB Ethnobotany has evolved from a discipline that largely documented the diversity of plant use by local people to one focused on understanding how and why people select plants for a wide range of uses. This progress has been in response to a repeated call for theory-inspired and hypothesis-driven research to improve the rigor of the discipline. Despite improvements, recent ethnobotanical research has overemphasized the use of quantitative ethnobotany indices and statistical methods borrowed from ecology, yet underemphasized the development and integration of a strong theoretical foundation. To advance the field of ethnobotany as a hypothesis-driven, theoretically inspired discipline, it is important to first synthesize the existing theoretical lines of research. We review and discuss 17 major theories and hypotheses in ethnobotany that can be used as a starting point for developing research questions that advance our understanding of people-plant interactions. For each theory or major hypothesis, we identify its primary predictions and testable hypotheses and then discuss how these predictions have been tested. Developing research to test these predictions will make significant contributions to the field of ethnobotany and create the critical mass of primary literature necessary to develop meta-analyses and to advance new theories in ethnobotany.

AB Planning for green space is guided by standards and guidelines but there is currently little understanding of the variety of values people assign to green spaces or their determinants. Land use planners need to know what values are associated with different landscape characteristics and how value elicitation techniques can inform decisions. We designed a Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) study and surveyed residents of four urbanising suburbs in the Lower Hunter region of NSW, Australia. Participants assigned dots on maps to indicate places they associated with a typology of values (specific attributes or functions considered important) and negative qualities related to green spaces. The marker points were digitised and aggregated according to discrete park polygons for statistical analysis. People assigned a variety of values to green spaces (such as aesthetic value or social interaction value), which were related to landscape characteristics. Some variables (e.g. distance to water) were statistically associated with multiple open space values. Distance from place of residence however did not strongly influence value assignment after landscape configuration was accounted for. Value compatibility analysis revealed that some values co-occurred in park polygons more than others (e.g. nature value and health/therapeutic value). Results highlight the potential for PPGIS techniques to inform green space planning through the spatial representation of complex human-nature relationships. However, a number of potential pitfalls and challenges should be addressed. These include the non-random spatial arrangement of landscape features that can skew interpretation of results and the need to communicate clearly about theory that explains observed patterns.

AB Background: Understanding the patterns of biodiversity distribution and what influences them is a fundamental pre-requisite for effective conservation and sustainable utilisation of biodiversity. Such knowledge is increasingly urgent as biodiversity responds to the ongoing effects of global climate change. Nowhere is this more acute than in species-rich tropical Africa, where so little is known about plant diversity and its distribution. In this paper, we use RAINBIO - one of the largest mega-databases of tropical African vascular plant species distributions ever compiled - to address questions about plant and growth form diversity across tropical Africa.
   Results: The filtered RAINBIO dataset contains 609,776 georeferenced records representing 22,577 species. Growth form data are recorded for 97% of all species. Records are well distributed, but heterogeneous across the continent. Overall, tropical Africa remains poorly sampled. When using sampling units (SU) of 0.5 degrees, just 21 reach appropriate collection density and sampling completeness, and the average number of records per species per SU is only 1.84. Species richness (observed and estimated) and endemism figures per country are provided. Benin, Cameroon, Gabon, Ivory Coast and Liberia appear as the botanically best-explored countries, but none are optimally explored. Forests in the region contain 15,387 vascular plant species, of which 3013 are trees, representing 5-7% of the estimated world's tropical tree flora. The central African forests have the highest endemism rate across Africa, with approximately 30% of species being endemic.
   Conclusions: The botanical exploration of tropical Africa is far from complete, underlining the need for intensified inventories and digitization. We propose priority target areas for future sampling efforts, mainly focused on Tanzania, Atlantic Central Africa and West Africa. The observed number of tree species for African forests is smaller than those estimated from global tree data, suggesting that a significant number of species are yet to be discovered. Our data provide a solid basis for a more sustainable management and improved conservation of tropical Africa's unique flora, and is important for achieving Objective 1 of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation 2011-2020. In turn, RAINBIO provides a solid basis for a more sustainable management and improved conservation of tropical Africa's unique flora.

AB Quantitative analysis of the response of ecosystem health to rural land use change is required to comprehend the human-nature coupling mechanism and to explore the process of global environmental change, which can interpret the ecological effects of regional land use and land cover change comprehensively. However, the existing regional ecosystem health assessment largely ignored either the internal connection of ecosystem health to land use patterns or the internal representation of ecosystem services to ecosystem health. Using Lijiang City of China as a study area, the average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), landscape metrics, and ecosystem elasticity coefficient based on different land use types were used as quantitative indicators. Then the coefficient of spatial neighboring effect was introduced to characterize the adjacency effect on ecosystem services, and to generate the index of integrated ecosystem health. The results showed the change of land use was close to 30% at county level from 1986 to 2006, and forest land was the primary land use type. With respect to the declining physical health of ecosystems in all the four counties, the integrated health experienced a slight increase in Lijiang County. The vast majority of towns' ecosystem physical health and integrated health declined, while more than 70% of towns did not change distinctly. Ecosystem physical health had distinct influence on the integrated ecosystem health, and ecosystem vitality was the main factor affecting the condition of physical health. Emphasized in the interconnection of pattern and process, this study provided an ecosystem health approach to assessing the integrated ecological effects of regional land use change.

AB Many studies suggest that biodiversity may be particularly important for ecosystem multifunctionality, because different species with different traits can contribute to different functions. Support, however, comes mostly from experimental studies conducted at small spatial scales in low-diversity systems. Here, we test whether different species contribute to different ecosystem functions that are important for carbon cycling in a high-diversity human-modified tropical forest landscape in Southern Mexico. We quantified aboveground standing biomass, primary productivity, litter production, and wood decomposition at the landscape level, and evaluated the extent to which tree species contribute to these ecosystem functions. We used simulations to tease apart the effects of species richness, species dominance and species functional traits on ecosystem functions. We found that dominance was more important than species traits in determining a species' contribution to ecosystem functions. As a consequence of the high dominance in human-modified landscapes, the same small subset of species mattered across different functions. In human-modified landscapes in the tropics, biodiversity may play a limited role for ecosystem multifunctionality due to the potentially large effect of species dominance on biogeochemical functions. However, given the spatial and temporal turnover in species dominance, biodiversity may be critically important for the maintenance and resilience of ecosystem functions.

AB A plant's growth rate is seen as a central element of its ecological strategy, and as determined by its traits. Yet the literature is inconsistent about the empirical correlation between functional traits and growth, casting doubt on the capacity of some prominent traits to influence growth rate.
   We propose that traits should influence growth in a way that depends on the size of individual plants. We outline mechanisms and hypotheses based on new theoretical work and test these predictions in tree species using a meta-analysis of 103 studies (>500 correlations) for five traits (specific leaf area, wood density, maximum height, seed mass and maximum assimilation rate). We also recorded data for 14 other traits commonly used in the trait literature. To capture the effects of plant size, we tested for a shift in the direction of correlation between growth rates and each trait across three ontogenetic stages: seedling, sapling and adult.
   Results were consistent with predictions, although there were some limitations arising from unequal numbers of observation across ontogenetic stages. Specific leaf area was correlated with relative growth rate in seedlings but not in adult plants. Correlations of growth with wood density were not affected by ontogenetic stage. Seed mass, assimilation rate and maximum height were correlated with relative growth rate only in one ontogenetic stage category: seedlings, seedlings and adults, respectively.
   Although we were able to confirm several of our theoretical predictions, major knowledge gaps still exist in the trait literature. For example, for one-third of the traits considered, the majority (>75%) of reported correlations with growth came from the same ontogenetic stage.
   Synthesis. We show for some traits, how trait-growth correlations change in a predictable way with plant size. Our understanding of plant strategies should shift away from describing species as having a fixed growth strategy throughout their life (on a continuous axis from slow to fast growth), in favour of a size-dependent growth trajectories.

AB Successful conservation needs to be informed by social science because it is closely linked to socio-economic processes and human behaviour. Limited knowledge about ecosystems' interactions with these processes currently undermines conservation efforts. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of social science concerning the world's largest multinationally-coordinated conservation infrastructure: the European Ecological Network - 'Natura 2000'. Based on a review of 149 publications, we analyse and discuss the main findings and outline key social-science research gaps with regard to the Natura 2000 network. The review shows that human dimension of the Natura 2000 network is complex and varies among EU Member States. In general, low level and quality of public participation in implementation of the Natura 2000 network and its management, negative public perceptions of the network, lack of flexibility of responsible authorities and insufficient consideration of the local context pose the greatest challenges to the network's functioning. Important but hitherto little studied research topics include: evaluation of participation; effects of education on potential to raise public awareness; effects of potential financing mechanisms for compensating private land-owners; economic studies on cost-effectiveness; and benefits from conservation and ecosystem services. These knowledge gaps will need to be filled for the Natura 2000 network to reach its goals. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Understanding the effects of scale is essential to the understanding of natural ecosystems, particularly in marine environments where sampling is more limited and sporadic than in terrestrial environments. Despite its recognized importance, scale is rarely considered in benthic habitat mapping studies. Lack of explicit statement of scale in the literature is an impediment to better characterization of seafloor pattern and process. This review paper highlights the importance of incorporating ecological scaling and geographical theories in benthic habitat mapping. It reviews notions of ecological scale and benthic habitat mapping, in addition to the way spatial scale influences patterns and processes in benthic habitats. We address how scale is represented in geographic data, how it influences their analysis, and consequently how it influences our understanding of seafloor ecosystems. We conclude that quantification of ecological processes at multiple scales using spatial statistics is needed to gain a better characterization of species-habitat relationships. We offer recommendations on more effective practices in benthic habitat mapping, including sampling that covers multiple spatial scales and that includes as many environmental variables as possible, adopting continuum-based habitat characterization approaches, using statistical analyses that consider the spatial nature of data, and explicit statement of the scale at which the research was conducted. We recommend a set of improved standards for defining benthic habitat. With these standards benthic habitats can be defined as 'areas of seabed that are (geo)statistically significantly different from their surroundings in terms of physical, chemical and biological characteristics, when observed at particular spatial and temporal scales'.

AB Understanding how different plants prioritize carbon gain and drought vulnerability under a variable water supply is important for predicting which trees will maximize woody biomass production under different environmental conditions. Here, Populus balsamifera (BS, isohydric genotype), P. simonii (SI, previously uncharacterized stomatal behaviour), and their cross, P. balsamifera x simonii (BSxSI, anisohydric genotype) were studied to assess the physiological basis for biomass accumulation and water-use efficiency across a range of water availabilities. Under ample water, whole plant stomatal conductance (g(s)), transpiration (E), and growth rates were higher in anisohydric genotypes (SI and BSxSI) than in isohydric poplars (BS). Under drought, all genotypes regulated the leaf to stem water potential gradient via changes in g(s), synchronizing leaf hydraulic conductance (K-leaf) and E: isohydric plants reduced K-leaf, g(s), and E, whereas anisohydric genotypes maintained high K-leaf and E, which reduced both leaf and stem water potentials. Nevertheless, SI poplars reduced their plant hydraulic conductance (K-plant) during water stress and, unlike, BSxSI plants, recovered rapidly from drought. Low g(s) of the isohydric BS under drought reduced CO2 assimilation rates and biomass potential under moderate water stress. While anisohydric genotypes had the fastest growth under ample water and higher photosynthetic rates under increasing water stress, isohydric poplars had higher water-use efficiency. Overall, the results indicate three strategies for how closely related biomass species deal with water stress: survival-isohydric (BS), sensitive-anisohydric (BSxSI), and resilience-anisohydric (SI). Implications for woody biomass growth, water-use efficiency, and survival under variable environmental conditions are discussed.

AB The tenet that ecological opportunity drives adaptive diversification has been central to theories of speciation since Darwin, yet no widely accepted definition or mechanistic framework for the concept currently exists. We propose a definition for ecological opportunity that provides an explicit mechanism for its action. In our formulation, ecological opportunity refers to environmental conditions that both permit the persistence of a lineage within a community, as well as generate divergent natural selection within that lineage. Thus, ecological opportunity arises from two fundamental elements: (1) niche availability, the ability of a population with a phenotype previously absent from a community to persist within that community and (2) niche discordance, the diversifying selection generated by the adaptive mismatch between a population's niche-related traits and the newly encountered ecological conditions. Evolutionary response to ecological opportunity is primarily governed by (1) spatiotemporal structure of ecological opportunity, which influences dynamics of selection and development of reproductive isolation and (2) diversification potential, the biological properties of a lineage that determine its capacity to diversify. Diversification under ecological opportunity proceeds as an increase in niche breadth, development of intraspecific ecotypes, speciation, and additional cycles of diversification that may themselves be triggered by speciation. Extensive ecological opportunity may exist in depauperate communities, but it is unclear whether ecological opportunity abates in species-rich communities. Because ecological opportunity should generally increase during times of rapid and multifarious environmental change, human activities may currently be generating elevated ecological opportunity - but so far little work has directly addressed this topic. Our framework highlights the need for greater synthesis of community ecology and evolutionary biology, unifying the four major components of the concept of ecological opportunity.

AB The current distribution of forest genetic resources on Earth is the result of a combination of natural processes and human actions. Over time, tree populations have become adapted to their habitats including the local ecological disturbances they face. As the planet enters a phase of human-induced climate change of unprecedented speed and magnitude, however, previously locally-adapted populations are rendered less suitable for new conditions, and 'natural' biotic and abiotic disturbances are taken outside their historic distribution, frequency and intensity ranges. Tree populations rely on phenotypic plasticity to survive in extant locations, on genetic adaptation to modify their local phenotypic optimum or on migration to new suitable environmental conditions. The rate of required change, however, may outpace the ability to respond, and tree species and populations may become locally extinct after specific, but as yet unknown and unquantified, tipping points are reached. Here, we review the importance of forest genetic resources as a source of evolutionary potential for adaptation to changes in climate and other ecological factors. We particularly consider climate-related responses in the context of linkages to disturbances such as pests, diseases and fire, and associated feedback loops. The importance of management strategies to conserve evolutionary potential is emphasised and recommendations for policy-makers are provided. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The increasing research interest in multi-stakeholder analysis in urban planning reflects a growing recognition that stakeholders can and should influence the decision-making of urban development projects. Methods for identifying and prioritising stakeholders and their interests are explored in this study, and two perspectives (empiricism and rationalism) for stakeholder analysis are proposed. Two case studies, one regional renewal project and the other an infrastructure project, are presented to verify the usefulness of these two analysis perspectives. The results from the case studies show that no one method for stakeholder analysis is perfect; the selection of analytical perspective is an art with extensive considerations of 'when, what, and how' to choose methods to achieve the project objectives. Applying both empirical and rationalistic perspectives and comparing the analysis results when necessary are proposed as the best way to analyse stakeholders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

AB Many risks are involved in software development and risk management has become one of the key activities in software development. Bayesian networks (BNs) have been explored as a tool for various risk management practices, including the risk management of software development projects. However, much of the present research on software risk analysis focuses on finding the correlation between risk factors and project outcome. Software project failures are often a result of insufficient and ineffective risk management. To obtain proper and effective risk control, risk planning should be performed based on risk causality which can provide more risk information for decision making. In this study, we propose a model using BNs with causality constraints (BNCC) for risk analysis of software development projects. Through unrestricted automatic causality learning from 302 collected software project data, we demonstrated that the proposed model can not only discover causalities in accordance with the expert knowledge but also perform better in prediction than other algorithms, such as logistic regression, C4.5, Naive Bayes, and general BNs. This research presents the first causal discovery framework for risk causality analysis of software projects and develops a model using BNCC for application in software project risk management.

AB Big data is often discussed in the context of improving medical care, but it also has a less appreciated but equally important role to play in preventing disease. Big data can facilitate action on the modifiable risk factors that contribute to a large fraction of the chronic disease burden, such as physical activity, diet, tobacco use, and exposure to pollution. It can do so by facilitating the discovery of risk factors for disease at population, sub-population, and individual levels, and by improving the effectiveness of interventions to help people achieve healthier behaviors in healthier environments. In this article, we describe new sources of big data in population health, explore their applications, and present two case studies illustrating how big data can be leveraged for prevention. We also discuss the many implementation obstacles that must be overcome before this vision can become a reality.

AB Forests are expected to expand into alpine areas because of climate warming, causing land-cover change and fragmentation of alpine habitats. However, this expansion will only occur if the present upper treeline is limited by low-growing season temperatures that reduce plant growth. This temperature limitation has not been quantified at a landscape scale. Here, we show that temperature alone cannot realistically explain high-elevation tree cover over a >100-km(2) area in the Canadian Rockies and that geologic/geomorphic processes are fundamental to understanding the heterogeneous landscape distribution of trees. Furthermore, upslope tree advance in a warmer scenario will be severely limited by availability of sites with adequate geomorphic/topographic characteristics. Our results imply that landscape-to-regional scale projections of warming-induced, high-elevation forest advance into alpine areas should not be based solely on temperature-sensitive, site-specific upper-treeline studies but also on geomorphic processes that control tree occurrence at long (centuries/millennia) timescales.

AB Aim Species distribution modelling (SDM) has increasingly been used to predict palaeodistributions at regional and global scales in order to understand the response of vegetation to climate change and to estimate palaeodistributions for the testing of biogeographical hypotheses. However, there are many sources of uncertainty in SDM that may restrict the ability of models to hindcast palaeo-distributions and provide a basis for hypothesis testing in molecular phylogenetics and phylogeographical studies. Location Seasonally dry forests (SDFs) in South America. Methods We addressed the problem of using palaeodistribution modelling for SDFs based on the projection of their current distribution into past environments (21 ka) using 11 methods for SDMs and five coupled atmosphereocean global circulation models (AOGCMs) for 16 species. Results We observed considerable uncertainty in the hindcasts, with the most important effects for AOGCM (median 12.2%), species (median 15.6%) and their interaction (median 13.6%). The effects of AOGCMs were stronger in the Amazon region, whereas the species effect occurred primarily in the dry areas of central Brazil. The log-linear model detected significant effects of the three sources of variation and their interaction on the classification of each map in supporting alternative hypotheses. An expansion scenario combining the Pleistocene arc and Amazonian expansion, and Pennington's Amazonian expansion alone, were the most frequently supported palaeodistribution scenarios. Main conclusions As a basis for evaluating a given hypothesis, hindcast distributions must be used in direct association with other evidence, such as molecular variation and the fossil record. We propose an alternative framework concerning hypothesis testing that couples SDM and phylogeographical work, in which palaeoclimatic distributions and other sources of information, such as the pollen fossil record and coalescence modelling, must be weighted equally.

AB Aim A long-standing challenge in ecology is to identify the suite of factors that lead to turnover in species composition in both space and time. These factors might be stochastic (e.g. sampling and priority effects) or deterministic (e.g. competition and environmental filtering). While numerous studies have examined the relationship between turnover and individual drivers of interest (e.g. primary productivity, habitat heterogeneity, or regional gamma diversity), few studies have disentangled the simultaneous influences of multiple stochastic and deterministic processes on both temporal and spatial turnover. If turnover is governed primarily by stochastic sampling processes, removing the sampling effects of gamma diversity should result in non-significant relationships between turnover and environmental variables. Conversely, if deterministic processes govern turnover patterns, removing sampling effects will have little influence on turnover gradients. Here, we test these predictions. Location The United States. Methods Continental-scale, multidecadal data were used to quantify spatial and temporal turnover in avian community composition within 295 survey routes. A series of regression and structural equation models were coupled with a null model to construct statistical models describing turnover patterns. Results Examining explanatory variables alone or in combination showed that spatial and temporal turnover increased together, decreased with primary productivity and increased with habitat heterogeneity. The relationships between turnover and all variables became weaker when sampling effects were removed, but relationships with primary productivity and habitat heterogeneity remained relatively strong. In addition, spatial turnover increased strongly with spatial gamma diversity after sampling effects were removed. Main conclusions Our results show that spatial and temporal turnover are related to each other through a stochastic sampling process, but that each type of turnover is further influenced by deterministic processes. The relative influence of deterministic processes appears, however, to decrease with primary productivity and increase with habitat heterogeneity across an eastwest longitudinal gradient in North America.

AB We present a benchmark system for global vegetation models. This system provides a quantitative evaluation of multiple simulated vegetation properties, including primary production; seasonal net ecosystem production; vegetation cover; composition and height; fire regime; and runoff. The benchmarks are derived from remotely sensed gridded datasets and site-based observations. The datasets allow comparisons of annual average conditions and seasonal and inter-annual variability, and they allow the impact of spatial and temporal biases in means and variability to be assessed separately. Specifically designed metrics quantify model performance for each process, and are compared to scores based on the temporal or spatial mean value of the observations and a "random" model produced by bootstrap resampling of the observations. The benchmark system is applied to three models: a simple light-use efficiency and waterbalance model (the Simple Diagnostic Biosphere Model: SDBM), the Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ) and Land Processes and eXchanges (LPX) dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). In general, the SDBM performs better than either of the DGVMs. It reproduces independent measurements of net primary production (NPP) but underestimates the amplitude of the observed CO2 seasonal cycle. The two DGVMs show little difference for most benchmarks (including the inter-annual variability in the growth rate and seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2), but LPX represents burnt fraction demonstrably more accurately. Benchmarking also identified several weaknesses common to both DGVMs. The benchmarking system provides a quantitative approach for evaluating how adequately processes are represented in a model, identifying errors and biases, tracking improvements in performance through model development, and discriminating among models. Adoption of such a system would do much to improve confidence in terrestrial model predictions of climate change impacts and feedbacks.

AB In many current dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), including those incorporated into Earth system models (ESMs), terrestrial vegetation is represented by a small number of plant functional types (PFTs), each with fixed properties irrespective of their predicted occurrence. This contrasts with natural vegetation, in which many plant traits vary systematically along geographic and environmental gradients. In the JSBACH DGVM, which is part of the MPI-ESM, we allowed three traits (specific leaf area (SLA), maximum carboxylation rate at 25 degrees C (Vcmax(25)) and maximum electron transport rate at 25 degrees C (Jmax(25))) to vary within PFTs via trait-climate relationships based on a large trait database. The R-adjusted(2) of these relationships were up to 0.83 and 0.71 for Vcmax(25) and Jmax(25), respectively. For SLA, more variance remained unexplained, with a maximum R-adjusted(2) of 0.40. Compared to the default simulation, allowing trait variation within PFTs resulted in gross primary productivity differences of up to 50% in the tropics, in > 35% different dominant vegetation cover, and a closer match with a natural vegetation map. The discrepancy between default trait values and natural trait variation, combined with the substantial changes in simulated vegetation properties, together emphasize that incorporating climate-driven trait variation, calibrated on observational data and based on ecological concepts, allows more variation in vegetation responses in DGVMs and as such is likely to enable more reliable projections in unknown climates.

AB The identification of the main factors driving phytoplankton community structure is essential to understand and adequately manage freshwater ecosystems. We hypothesize that differences in morphological traits reflect phytoplankton functional properties that will be selected under particular environmental conditions, namely their habitat template. We apply a morphology-based functional groups (MBFG) approach to classify phytoplankton organisms and define each group template. We use machine learning techniques to classify a large number of phytoplankton communities and environmental variables from different climate zones and continents. Random forest analysis explained well the distribution of most groups' biovolume and the selected variables reflected ecological preferences according to morphology. By means of a classification tree it was also possible to identify thresholds of the environmental variables promoting groups dominance in different lakes. For example group III (filaments with aerotopes and high surface/volume including potentially toxic species) was dominant when light attenuation coefficient was > 3.9 m(-1) and total nitrogen was > 2,800 mu g l(-1). We demonstrate that morphology captures ecological preferences of phytoplankton groups and provides empirical values to describe their habitat template.

AB Behavioral effects of living under predation risk may influence the dynamics of prey species more than direct demographic effects. Human recreation, especially hunting, can also force prey to increase their vigilance and can influence distribution and habitat use even more than natural predators. However, behavioral effects do not play a prominent role in conservation or wildlife management. Whereas the demographic consequences of hunting are documented for large carnivores, behavioral effects of hunting on their dynamics remain unexplored. We studied the movement patterns of brown bears (Ursus arctos) in Scandinavia as a model species, before and after the start of the annual bear hunting season. Bears were expected to become more active at daytime as the season progressed due to shortening daylight. However, the start of hunting disrupted this pattern. Solitary bears subject to hunting increased movements during the dark hours after hunting started, losing their nocturnal rest, probably to compensate for decreased daytime activity. Females with cubs-of-the-year, which are protected from hunting, also modified their movement pattern, but much less than hunted bears. Bears altered their movement pattern at a critical time of the year, during hyperphagia, when they must store fat reserves before hibernation, which is critical for reproduction. Behavioral effects of hunting should be a relevant issue for the conservation and management of large carnivores, especially when hunting occurs during highly sensitive periods of the year. This concern applies to many species managed under hunting regimes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Local adaptation experiments are widely used to quantify the levels of adaptation within a heterogeneous environment. However, theoretical studies generally focus on the probability of fixation of alleles or the mean fitness of populations, rather than local adaptation as it is commonly measured experimentally or in field studies. Here, we develop mathematical models and use them to generate analytical predictions for the level of local adaptation as a function of selection, migration and genetic drift. First, we contrast mean fitness and local adaptation measures and show that the latter can be expressed in a simple and general way as a function of the spatial covariance between population mean phenotype and local environmental conditions. Second, we develop several approximations of a population genetics model to show that the system exhibits different behaviours depending on the rate of migration. The main insights are the following: with intermediate migration, both genetic drift and migration decrease local adaptation; with low migration, drift decreases local adaptation but migration speeds up adaptation; with high migration, genetic drift has no effect on local adaptation. Third, we extend this analysis to cases where the trait under selection is continuous using classical quantitative genetics theory. Finally, we discuss these results in the light of recent experimental work on local adaptation.

AB Tigers Panthera tigris continue to decline despite the best efforts of the worldwide scientific and conservation communities. Prey depletion has been linked to this decline, but a clear definition of what constitutes preferred prey and preferred prey weight range does not exist. This is critical information if we are to assess tiger reintroduction potential, monitor unforeseen poaching of predators and prey, and successfully conserve the species. Here we reviewed the available literature on tiger diet and prey availability and calculated Jacobs's electivity index scores from 3187 kills or scats of 32 prey species. We found that wild boar and sambar deer are significantly preferred by tigers, with red deer and barasingha likely to be significantly preferred also with a larger sample size. Prey body mass was the only variable that related to tiger prey preference with species weighing between 60 and 250?kg preferred by tigers yielding a ratio of predator to preferred prey of 1:1, which is similar to other solitary felids. This information can be used to predict tiger diet, carrying capacity and movement patterns, as it has been for Africa's large predator guild, and has important implications for tiger conservation throughout its distribution.

AB The synoptic quantification of crop gross primary productivity (GPP) is essential for studying carbon budgets in croplands and monitoring crop status. In this study, we applied a recently developed model, which relates crop GPP to a product of total crop chlorophyll content and incoming photosynthetically active radiation, for the remote estimation of GPP in two crop types (maize and soybean) with contrasting canopy architectures and leaf structures. The objective of this study was to evaluate performances of twelve vegetation indices used for detecting different vegetation biophysical characteristics, in estimating GPP of rainfed and irrigated crops over a period from 2001 through 2008. Indices tested in the model exhibited strong and significant relationships with widely variable GPP in each crop (GPP ranged from 0 to 19 gC/m(2)/d for soybean and 0 to 35 gC/m(2)/d for maize), however, they were species-specific. Only three indices, which use MERIS red edge and NIR spectral bands (i.e. red edge chlorophyll index, MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index and red edge NDVI), were found to be able to estimate GPP accurately in both crops combined, with root mean square errors (RMSE) below 3.2 gC/m(2)/d. It was also shown that two indices, red edge chlorophyll index and red edge NDVI with a red edge band around 720 nm, were non-species-specific and yielded a very accurate estimation of GPP in maize and soybean combined, with RMSEs below 2.9 gC/m(2)/d and coefficients of variation below 21%.

AB The functional diversity index has shown that the functional diversity of the macrobenthic community increased along a spatial gradient of distance from the Po river delta (Emilia-Romagna coast, Italy, North-Adriatic Sea), which suggests that riverine inputs have a detrimental effect on community functioning. This study focuses on two different depths along a southward gradient of increasing distance from the Po river delta where the Po river is the main source of freshwater and nutrient inputs in the North-Adriatic Sea. A Biological Traits Analysis (BTA) was used to examine a dataset of 156 soft-bottom macrobenthic species that were collected at eight stations in this area. Instead of comparing communities on the basis of their taxonomic composition, BTA uses a series of life history, morphological and behavioural characteristics of species to indicate aspects of their ecological functioning. The variability of the Emilia-Romagna dataset was governed by relatively few biological traits: growth form, trophic group, type of movement, habit, adult mobility and bioturbation activity. The community closer to the coastline was mainly composed of moderately mobile vermiform organisms with burrowing or tube-dwelling behaviour, and deposit feeding behaviour. However, the offshore community was mainly characterized by organisms with a laterally compressed or globose body and tube-dwelling behaviour; filter feeders and deposit feeders were dominant.

AB Crop gross primary productivity (GPP) is an important characteristic for evaluating crop nitrogen content and yield, as well as the carbon exchange. Based on the close relationship observed between GPP and total chlorophyll content in crops, we applied a model that relies on a product of chlorophyll-related vegetation index and incoming photosynthetically active radiation for remote estimation of GPP in maize. In this study, we tested the performance of this model for maize GPP estimation based on spectral reflectance collected at a close range, 6 m above the top of the canopy, over a period of eight years from 2001 through 2008. Fifteen widely used chlorophyll-related vegetation indices were employed for GPP estimation in irrigated and rainfed maize, and accuracy and uncertainties of the models were compared. We also explored the possibility of using a unified algorithm in estimating maize GPP in fields that are different in irrigation, field history and climatic conditions. The results showed that vegetation indices that closely relate to total canopy chlorophyll content and/or green leaf area index were accurate in GPP estimation. Both green and red edge Chlorophyll Indices, MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index as well as Simple Ratio were the best approximations of the widely variable GPP in maize under different crop managements and climatic conditions. They were able to predict daily GPP reaching 30 gC/m(2)/d with RMSE below 2.75 gC/m(2)/d. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a new disease of bats that has devastated populations in eastern North America. Infection with the fungus, Geomyces destructans, is thought to increase the time bats spend out of torpor during hibernation, leading to starvation. Little is known about hibernation in healthy, free-ranging bats and more data are needed to help predict consequences of WNS. Trade-offs presumably exist between the energetic benefits and physiological/ecological costs of torpor, leading to the prediction that the relative importance of spring energy reserves should affect an individual's use of torpor and depletion of energy reserves during winter. Myotis lucifugus mate during fall and winter but females do not become pregnant until after spring emergence. Thus, female reproductive success depends on spring fat reserves while male reproductive success does not. Consequently, females should be "thrifty" in their use of fat compared to males. We measured body condition index (BCI; mass/forearm length) of 432 M. lucifugus in Manitoba, Canada during the winter of 2009/2010. Bats were captured during the fall mating period (n = 200), early hibernation (n = 125), and late hibernation (n = 128). Adult females entered hibernation with greater fat reserves and consumed those reserves more slowly than adult males and young of the year. Consequently, adult females may be more likely than males or young of the year to survive the disruption of energy balance associated with WNS, although surviving females may not have sufficient reserves to support reproduction.

AB The field of Participatory Integrated Assessment (PIA) is still very young, having evolved from the broader field of Integrated Assessment (IA) in the mid to late 1990s. Like IA, PIA is a problem-based field, with a focus on interdisciplinary research. Fundamental to PIA, however, is the assertion that the quality of decisions is improved by the direct involvement of stakeholders in the assessment process-particularly when those decisions pertain to complex, intractable problems. Climate change presents just such a problem, and it is in the domains of climate change and related sustainability issues where PIA has seen its broadest application. Previous reviews have focused primarily on the mechanisms of participation in PIAs. The purpose of this review is to take a broader look at the field of PIA, focusing on components and cross-cutting themes that appear to be defining the conduct of PIA exercises. The review first looks at common components of PIA, including methods (future scenarios and models), participation (mechanisms of participation, representation, and stages of involvement), and outcomes (policy outcomes and process outcomes). The review then turns to an examination of cross-cutting themes in the field of PIA. These themes include the tension between qualitative and quantitative information, the role of interactivity in PIA, the importance of institutions and institutional change, and navigating the space defined by choice, uncertainty, and constraints. As governments at all levels move toward response options for climate change, PIA is increasingly becoming an approach for providing meaningful participation in the selection of those options.

Canopy radiance spectra were collected under clear sky conditions using high resolution spectrometers which made it possible to estimate sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence at the oxygen absorption band O-2-A located at 760 nm (F-760) as well as spectral vegetation indices. Spectral observations were collected in a rice field monitored with an eddy covariance (EC) flux tower measuring the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the crop.
   Estimation of gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) from remotely sensed data was based on the widely used light-use efficiency model (LUE), which states that carbon uptake is a function of the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (APAR) and light-use efficiency (epsilon) which represents the conversion efficiency of energy to fixed carbon.
   Hyperspectral data were used to derive both the APAR and the e term. Different versions of the LUE model were formalized and tested with EC fluxes during two growing seasons. We started using a LUE model in which epsilon is held constant and remote sensing data are used to estimate APAR. We then investigated the improvements in GEP modelling provided by the partitioning between photosynthetic (PV) and non-photosynthetic (NPV) components of vegetation in APAR estimation, holding epsilon constant. The use of spectral indices related to APAR(PV) instead of APAR resulted in an improvement in midday GEP estimation of about 50% with respect to the basic LUE model, average root mean square error in cross-validation (RMSECV) of the model class from 9.69 to 4.49 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Afterwards, we tested the use of the apparent fluorescence yield (Fy*(760)) and the scaled Photochemical Reflectance Index (sPRI) to derive epsilon. Modelling epsilon further improved the estimation of GEP up to an RMSECV of 3.81 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) using Fy*(760) and the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) and 3.67 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) using sPRI and F760 to estimate E and APAR(PV), respectively.

AB The evolutionary history of the endemic Lake Tanganyika cichlid tribe Tropheini, the sister group of the species flocks of Lake Malawi and the Lake Victoria region, was reconstructed from 2009 bp DNA sequence of two mitochondrial genes (ND2 and control region) and from 1293 AFLP markers. A period of rapid cladogenesis at the onset of the diversification of the Tropheini produced a multitude of specialized, predominantly rock-dwelling aufwuchs-feeders that now dominate in Lake Tanganyika's shallow habitat. Nested within the stenotopic rock-dwellers is a monophyletic group of species, which also utilize more sediment-rich habitat. Most of the extant species date back to at least 0.7 million years ago. Several instances of disagreement between AFLP and mtDNA tree topology are attributed to ancient incomplete lineage sorting, introgression and hybridization. A large degree of correspondence between AFLP clustering and trophic types indicated fewer cases of parallel evolution of trophic ecomorphology than previously inferred from mitochondrial data.

AB The rate at which different components of reproductive isolation accumulate with divergence time between species has only been studied in a limited, but growing, number of species. We measured premating isolation and hybrid inviability at four different ontogenetic stages from zygotes to adults in interspecific hybrids of 26 pairs of African cichlid species, spanning the entire East African haplochromine radiation. We then used multiple relaxed molecular clock calibrations to translate genetic distances into absolute ages to compare evolutionary rates of different components of reproductive isolation. We find that premating isolation accumulates fast initially but then changes little with increasing genetic distance between species. In contrast, postmating isolation between closely related species is negligible but then accumulates rapidly, resulting in complete hybrid inviability after 4.4/8.5/18.4 million years (my). Thus, the rate at which complete intrinsic incompatibilities arise in this system is orders of magnitude lower than rates of speciation within individual lake radiations. Together these results suggest divergent ecological adaptations may prevent populations from interbreeding and help maintain cichlid species diversity, which may be vulnerable to environmental degradation. By quantifying the capacity to produce viable hybrids between allopatric, distantly related lineages our results also provide an upper divergence time limit for the "hybrid swarm origin" model of adaptive radiation.

AB Mosquitoes are serious biting pests and obligate vectors of many vertebrate pathogens. Their immature larval and pupal life stages are a common feature in most, tropical aid many temperate water bodies and often form a significant proportion of the biomass. Control strategies rely primarily on the use of lavicides and environmental modification to reduce recruitment and adulticides during periods of disease transmission. Lavicides are usually chemical but. car involve biological toxins, agents or organisms. The use of insect predators in mosquito control has been exploited in a limited fashion and there is much room for further investigation and implementation. Insects that are recognized as having predatorial capacity with regard to mosquito prey have been identified in the Orders Odonata, Coleoptera, Diptera (primarily aquatic predators), ail Hemiptera (primarily surface predators). Although their capacity is affected by certain biological and physical factors, they could play a major role in mosquito control. Furthermore, better understanding for the mosquitoes-predators relationship(s) could probably lead to satisfactory reduction of mosquito-borne diseases by utilizing either these predators in control programs, for instance biological and/or integrated control, or their kairomones as mosquitoes' ovipoisting repellents. This review covers the predation of different insect species on mosquito larvae, predator-prey-habitat relationships, co-habitation developmental issues, survival and abundance, oviposition avoidance, predatorial capacity and integrated vector control.

AB Mixtures of genotypes are the norm in natural and seminatural ecosystems and subsistence agriculture but have been replaced by pure genotypes in modern agriculture to maximise profitability in high-input systems. However, crop function with respect to the stability of yield and quality in particular tends to be lost in this process. Diversity can be reintroduced into cropping systems as a trait not only to confer stability but also to exploit synergies between component genotypes, compensating for potential performance losses against the best performing genotype in any given season or location. Quality need not be compromised, and research has demonstrated practical development and deployment approaches, which challenge the assumed benefits of current approaches to agronomy and achieve enhanced crop function.

AB 1. The production of food for human consumption has led to an historical and global conflict with terrestrial carnivores, which in turn has resulted in the extinction or extirpation of many species, although some have benefited. At present, carnivores affect food production by: (i) killing human producers; killing and/or eating (ii) fish/shellfish; (iii) game/wildfowl; (iv) livestock; (v) damaging crops; (vi) transmitting diseases; and (vii) through trophic interactions with other species in agricultural landscapes. Conversely, carnivores can themselves be a source of dietary protein (bushmeat).
   2. Globally, the major areas of conflict are predation on livestock and the transmission of rabies. At a broad scale, livestock predation is a customary problem where predators are present and has been quantified for a broad range of carnivore species, although the veracity of these estimates is equivocal. Typically, but not always, losses are small relative to the numbers held, but can be a significant proportion of total livestock mortality. Losses experienced by producers are often highly variable, indicating that factors such as husbandry practices and predator behaviour may significantly affect the relative vulnerability of properties in the wider landscape. Within livestock herds, juvenile animals are particularly vulnerable.
   3. Proactive and reactive culling are widely practised as a means to limit predation on livestock and game. Historic changes in species' distributions and abundance illustrate that culling programmes can be very effective at reducing predator density, although such substantive impacts are generally considered undesirable for native predators. However, despite their prevalence, the effectiveness, efficiency and the benefit:cost ratio of culling programmes have been poorly studied.
   4. A wide range of non-lethal methods to limit predation has been studied. However, many of these have their practical limitations and are unlikely to be widely applicable.
   5. Lethal approaches are likely to dominate the management of terrestrial carnivores for the foreseeable future, but animal welfare considerations are increasingly likely to influence management strategies. The adoption of non-lethal approaches will depend upon proof of their effectiveness and the willingness of stakeholders to implement them, and, in some cases, appropriate licensing and legislation.
   6. Overall, it is apparent that we still understand relatively little about the importance of factors affecting predation on livestock and how to manage this conflict effectively. We consider the following avenues of research to be essential: (i) quantified assessments of the loss of viable livestock; (ii) landscape-level studies of contiguous properties to quantify losses associated with variables such as different husbandry practices; (iii) replicated experimental manipulations to identify the relative benefit of particular management practices, incorporating (iv) techniques to identify individual predators killing stock; and (v) economic analyses of different management approaches to quantify optimal production strategies.

AB Aim To develop a systematic and generic framework for biogeographical regionalizations that can assist in reconciling different approaches and advance their application as a research tool.
   Location The Australian continent is used as a case study.
   Methods A review of approaches to biogeographical regionalization revealed two basic methodologies: the integrated survey method and the parametric approach. To help reconcile these different approaches, we propose a simple, four-step, flexible and generic framework. (1) Identification of the thematic foci from the three main themes (composition and evolutionary legacy; ecosystem drivers; ecosystem responses). (2) Proposal of a theory defining the purpose. (3) Application of a numeric agglomerative classification procedure that requires the user to make explicit assumptions about attributes, the number of classification groups, the spatial unit of analysis, and the metric for measuring the similarity of these units based on their attribute values. (4) Acquisition of spatial estimates of the required input attribute data. For this case study, an agglomerative classification strategy was applied using the functions within PATN 3.03, a software package facilitating large-scale, multivariate pattern analysis. The input data to the classifications were continental coverages of 11 environmental variables and three indices of gross primary productivity stored at a grid cell resolution of c. 250 m. The spatial units of analysis were surface hydrological units (SHU), which were derived from a continental digital elevation model based on the contributing areas to stream segments or the area draining into a local sink where there is no organized drainage. The Minkowski series (Euclidean distance) was selected as the association measure to allow weightings to be applied to the variables.
   Results Two new biogeographical regionalizations of the Australian continent were generated. The first was an environmental domain classification, based on 11 climatic, terrain and soil attributes. This regionalization can be used to address hypotheses about the relationship between environmental distance and evolutionary processes. The classification produced 151 environmental groups. The second was a classification of primary productivity regimes based on estimates of the gross primary productivity of the vegetation cover calculated from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data and estimates of radiation. This classification produced 50 groups, and can be used to examine hypotheses concerning productivity regimes and animal life-history strategies. The productivity classification does not capture all the properties related to biological carrying capacity, process rates and differences in the characteristic biodiversity of ecosystems. Some of these ecologically significant properties are captured by the environmental domain classification.
   Main conclusions Our framework can be applied to all terrestrial regions, and the necessary data for the analyses presented here are now available at global scales. As the spatial predictions generated by the classifications can be tested by comparison with independent data, the approach facilitates exploratory analysis and further hypothesis generation. Integration of the three themes in our framework will contribute to a more comprehensive approach to biogeography.

AB Studies examining the relationship between species richness and the productivity of ecological communities have taken one of two opposite viewpoints, viewing either productivity as a primary driver of richness or richness as a driver of productivity. Recently, verbal and graphical hypotheses have been proposed that attempt to merge these perspectives by clarifying the causal pathways that link resource supply, species richness, resource use, and biomass production. Here we present mathematical models that formalize how these pathways can operate simultaneously in a single ecological system. Using a meta-community, framework in which classic consumer-resource competition theory governs species interactions within patches, we show that the mechanisms by which resource supply influences species richness are inherently linked to the mechanisms by which species richness controls resource use and biomass production. Unlike prior hypotheses, our models show that resource supply can affect species richness and that richness can affect productivity simultaneously at a single spatial scale. Our models also reproduce scale-dependent associations between species richness and community biomass that have been reported elsewhere. By detailing the pathways by which resource supply, species richness, biomass production, and resource use are connected, our models move closer to resolving the nature of causality in diversity-productivity relationships.

AB Five cultured populations of Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, were examined at seven polymorphic microsatellite loci to assess the levels of allelic diversity and heterozygosity within and differentiation among the populations. The genetic variability of the seven loci was high for all the populations. The average numbers of alleles per locus ranged from 19.1 to 26.0, while the average observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.474 to 0.616, and from 0.916 to 0.949, respectively. F-st and R-st values showed significant genetic differentiation among the five cultured populations. Genetic differences between the populations were also detected by pairwise comparison based on allelic distribution. The Neighbor-joining tree topology constructed on the basis of genetic distances between populations showed a clear separation of the northern three populations and southern two populations, suggesting that geographically separated cultured populations of C gigas could be genetically differentiated unless seeds are transplanted among them. The useful information on the genetic variation and differentiation in cultured populations obtained in this study can be applied for future genetic improvement by selective breeding, and to design suitable management guidelines for the Pacific oyster.

AB A new Norway spruce ( Picea abies ( L.) Karst.) tree-ring width chronology based on living and historic wood spanning the AD 1108-2003 period is developed. This composite record combines 208 high elevation samples from 3 Swiss subalpine valleys, i.e., Lotschental, Goms, and Engadine. To retain potential high- to low-frequency information in this dataset, individual spline detrending and the regional curve standardization are applied. For comparison, 22 high elevation and 6 low-elevation instrumental station records covering the greater Alpine area are used. Previous year August-September precipitation and current year May-July temperatures control spruce ring width back to similar to 1930. Decreasing ( increasing) moving correlations with monthly mean temperatures ( precipitation) indicate instable growth/climate response during the 1760 2002 period. Crucial June-August temperatures before similar to 1900 shift towards May-July temperature plus August precipitation sensitivity after similar to 1900. Numerous of comparable subalpine spruce chronologies confirm increased late-summer drought stress, coincidently with the recent warming trend. Comparison with regional-, and large-scale millennial-long temperature reconstructions reveal significant similarities prior to similar to 1900 ( 1300-1900 mean r=0.51); however, this study does not fully capture the commonly reported 20th century warming ( 1900-1980 mean r=-0.17). Due to instable growth/climate response of the new spruce chronology, further dendroclimatic reconstruction is not performed.

AB The weedy potential of deliberately introduced plants has been a growing concern in Australia since the late 1980s. Although introduced plants are critical to Australia's agricultural and livestock production, many species that were praised in the past are now declared agricultural and environmental weeds. Nevertheless, weeds researchers appear largely ignorant of the magnitude and intent of plant introductions for agricultural purposes as well as the legacy of unwanted plants. Across more than 70 years, Commonwealth Plant Introductions comprised 145 000 accessions of more than 8200 species. These species include more than 2200 grass ( Poaceae) and 2200 legume species ( Fabaceae sensu stricto), representing about twice the indigenous. ora in those families and about 22 and 18%, respectively, of the global. ora of grasses and legumes. For most of the 20th century, these and other introductions supported research into continental-scale transformation of Australian landscapes to support greatly increased pastoral productivity in order to achieve policy goals of maximum density of human population. This paper documents some of the scientific developments and debates that affected the plant-introduction program. We argue that recent developments in weed science and policy need to be informed by a better understanding of plant-introduction history.

AB Despite intensive recent research on the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on bird population., our understanding of underlying demographic causes of population declines is limited. We reviewed avian demography in relation to habitat fragmentation. Then, through a meta-analysis, we compared specific demographic responses by forest birds to habitat fragmentation, providing a general perspective of factors that make some species and populations more. vulnerable to fragmentation than others. We obtained data from the scientific literature on dispersal, survival, fecundity, and nesting success of birds. Birds were divided into subgroups on the basis of region, nest site, biogeographical history, and migration strategy. Species most sensitive to fragmentation were ground- or open-nesters nesting in shrubs or trees. Residents were equally sensitive to fragmentation in the Nearctic and Palearctic regions, but Nearctic migrants were more sensitive than Palearctic migrants. Old World species were less sensitive than New World species, which was predicted based on the history of forest fragmentation on these two continents. Pairing success was the variable most associated with fragmentation, suggesting an important role of dispersal. Fledgling number or condition, timing of nesting, and clutch size were not associated with sensitivity to fragmentation, suggesting that negative fragmentation effects on birds do not generally result from diminished food resources with increasing level of fragmentation. Future studies on demographic responses of birds to habitat fragmentation-would be more effective if based on a combination of measures that can distinguish among the demographic mechanisms underlying population changes related to habitat fragmentation.

AB The main components of species diversity are richness and evenness. Species richness has been the subject of biodiversity studies more often than species evenness. Some simulated models suggest that the relationship between these two components is equal and predictable in a stable environment. This study was conducted in a human-shaped and unstable environment in arable field boundaries. A total of 30 sampling plots were laid out at random in the boundaries. Vegetation at the sites was of meadow type. The relationship between species richness and evenness, and their responses to edaphic nutrient factors in the field boundaries, were examined by correlation analysis and an ordination method. Correlation analyses demonstrated that no consistent pattern was present in the relationship between species evenness and species richness in this human-shaped ecosystem. Species richness and evenness also had different responses to edaphic factors, with species richness being negatively correlated with phosphorus, and species evenness negatively correlated with the ratio of organic carbon to total nitrogen in soil. The results indicate that different and independent ecological processes determine species richness and evenness. The relationship between these two components may be site-specific, reflecting variation in resource utilization by plant species. The pattern thus reflects the spatial heterogeneity of disturbances or 'patchiness' of resources between sites in a semi-natural ecosystem.

AB The concept of niche overlap appears in studies of the mechanisms of the maintenance of species diversity, in searches for assembly rules, and in estimation of within-community species redundancy. For plant traits measured on a continuous scale, existing indices are inadequate because they split the scale into a number of categories thus losing information. An index is easy to construct if we assume a normal distribution for each trait within a species, but this assumption is rarely true. We extend and apply an index, NOK, which is based on kernel density functions, and can therefore work with distributions of any shape without prior assumptions. For cases where the ecologist wishes to downweight traits that are inter-correlated, we offer a variant that does this: NOKw. From either of these indices, an index of the mean niche overlap in a community can be calculated: NOK,community and NOKw,community. For all these indices, the variance can be calculated and formulae for this are given. To give examples of the new indices in use, we apply them to a coastal fish dataset and a sand-dune plant dataset. The former exhibits considerable non-normality, emphasising the need for kernel-based indices. Accordingly, there was a considerable difference in index values, with those for an index based on a normal distribution being significantly higher than those from an index which, being based on kernel fitting, is not biased by an assumption for the distribution. The NOK values were ecologically consistent for the fish species concerned, varying from 0.02 to 0.53. The sand-dune plant data also showed a wide range of overlap values. Interestingly, the least overlap was between two graminoids, which would have been placed in the same functional group in the coarse classification often used in functional-type/ecosystem-function work.

AB Large models are commonly used for simulations of past results or future scenario's of ecosystems. However, such models have been criticized, mainly because the causes of their results are hard to understand. Simple models have contributed more to the development of ecological theory. However, simple models usually neglect important aspects such as spatial heterogeneity and individual variability, and may focus too much on one of several possible causes of a phenomenon. In this paper, we present a strategy that we have found useful for improving our understanding of the way in which complex models generate their results. The strategy consists of three phases. The first phase is a thorough analysis of the model behavior with respect to a selected set of parameters ('scrutinizing'). Secondly, similar analyses are done with several simplified versions of the model ('simplifying'). In this step, relationships between state variables or species that may potentially cause incomprehensible behavior are replaced by fixed values or highly simplified relations. The last step is to explain the differences between the full and the simplified versions and to discuss the results in the light of the existing ecological theory ('synthesizing'). We argue that this way of combining analyses of simple and more elaborate models is a powerful way to gain understanding of complex systems. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Factors affecting the establishment of trees in subalpine meadows are important to population dynamics of trees in the alpine tree- line ecotone ( ATE). Interactive effects of tree and herb cover on conifer seedlings were investigated in the ATE of the Snowy Range, Wyoming, USA. Microclimate, physiology, and survivorship of first- year conifer seedlings of Pinus albicaulis Engelm., Picea engelmannii Parry, and Abies lasiocarpa Hook. were measured in response to manipulations of surrounding herb and tree cover, as well as water availability. Tree and herb cover had nearly additive effects on survivorship and photosynthesis of conifer seedlings, except under alleviated water stress. In P. albicaulis, photosynthesis was greater near compared with away from trees and herbs, and photosynthetic efficiency ( F-v/ F-m) increased under herb cover. Tree cover led to greater nighttime temperatures, soil water contents, and, like herb cover, shade from solar radiation for seedlings. We did not detect any negative responses of conifer seedlings to surrounding vegetation. Furthermore, the effect of surrounding vegetation on conifer establishment appeared dependent on the type of surrounding vegetation, the species of conifer, and microsite stress level. These factors may lead to variation in the way conifer seedlings interact with surrounding vegetation and could explain changes in the relative abundances of tree species during forest succession in ATEs.

AB For each of three nuclear Pile loci. intraspecific- as well as trans-specific shared polymorphisms were detected in UNA among three distantly related species in the genus Picea. Few fixed interspecific polymorphisms were observed. Allele genealogies did not match species phylogenies. and species lineages were not reciprocally rnonophyletic. Based on molecular clocks and morphological evidence from the fossil record. the divergence time between species was estimated at 13-20 million years (my). and a, mutation rate of 2.23 X 10(-11) to 3.42 X 10(-10) per site per year was estimated. Large historical population sizes in excess of 100000 were inferred, which would have delayed the fixation of polymorphisms. These numbers translated into allele coalescence times in the order of 10 to 18 my, which implies the sharing of polymorphisms since common ancestry. These results suggest that transpecific shared Amorphisms might be frequent at plant nuclear gene loci. leading to high allelic diversity. Such a trend is more likely in trees and plants characterized by ecological and life-history determinants favoring large population sizes Such as an outcrossing mating wind pollination, and a dominant position in ecosystem. These polyniorphisnis also call for caution in estimating. congernic Species phylogenies from nuclear gene sequences in Such plant groups.

AB Carnivore home-range sizes vary profoundly between populations within a species. One commonly cited reason for this is variation in prey population density and environmental productivity. However, obtaining reliable measures of prey density in the field is both time and effort consuming. Therefore, a methodology that enabled scientists and managers to extrapolate home-range sizes across areas would be a valuable tool. So far, the potentials of different remote-sensing indices to represent environmental productivity have been poorly evaluated in this context. In this study, we have evaluated the utility of a readily available remote-sensing index, the Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation absorbed by vegetation canopies (FPAR), to explain interpopulation variation in home-range size for 12 carnivore species. In multiple regression models, evaluated by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), we found that the FPAR index added predictive power to the models for eight of the species. The explanatory power varied between 16% and 71% for the different species. We suggest that using remote-sensing indices such as FPAR to predict area specific home-range sizes for carnivores could potentially be a powerful tool, but that the methodology needs to be further developed in order to add more explanatory power for some species.

AB Question: What was the change in diversity of urban synantropic vegetation in a medium-sized Central European city during the period of increasing urbanization (1960s-1990s)?
   Location: The city of Plzen, an industrial centre of the western part of the Czech Republic.
   Methods: Sampling of various types of synanthropic vegetation, conducted in the 1960s, was repeated by using the same methods in the 1990s. This yielded 959 releves, of which 623 were made in the 1960s and 336 in the 1990s. The releves were assigned to the following phytosociological classes: Chenopo-dietea, Artemisietea vulgaris, Galio-Urticetea, Agropyretea repentis and Plantaginetea majoris. Total number of vascular plant species, evenness index J, number of alien species (classified into archaeophytes and neophytes), and mean Ellenberg indicator values for light, temperature, continentality, moisture, soil reaction, and nutrients were obtained for each releve.
   Results: From 1960s to 1990s, there was a significant decrease of species richness and diversity in synanthropic vegetation. The proportion of archaeophytes decreased in most vegetation types, indicating the contribution of this group of species, often confined to specific rural-like habitats, to the observed impoverishment of ruderal vegetation. The proportion of neophytes did not change between the two periods. Comparison between 1960s and 1990s indicated a decrease in light, temperature, moisture, soil reaction and nutrient indicator values in some vegetation types. In both periods, Artemisieta, Galio-Urticetea and Chenopodietea formed a distinct group harbouring more species than Agropyretea and Plantaginetea. Neophytes, i.e. recently introduced species, were most represented in the early successional annual vegetation of Chenopodietea, rather than in perennial vegetation of the other classes.
   Conclusions: Synanthropic vegetation of Plzen exhibited a general trend of decrease in species diversity.

AB Species in biological communities respond to environmental variation simultaneously across a range of organizational levels. Accordingly, it is important to quantify the effects of environmental factors at multiple levels on species distribution and abundance. Hierarchical methods that explicitly separate the independent and confounded influences of environmental variation across several levels of organization are powerful tools for this task. Our study used a hierarchical approach to partition explained variance in an Oregon Coast Range bird community among plot-, patch-, and landscape-level factors. We used a series of partial canonical ordinations to decompose species-environment relationships across these levels of organization to test four hypotheses about the importance of environmental control over community structure. We found that plot-level factors were better predictors of community structure than patch- or landscape-level factors. In addition, although landscape-level variables contributed substantial independent explanatory power, there was little evidence that patch-level environmental variability provided additional explanation of community structure beyond that provided by plot- and landscape-level factors. At higher levels of the hierarchical analysis, we found that, among plot-level factors, vegetation cover type was as powerful a predictor of community structure as detailed floristics, and more powerful than vegetation structure. At the landscape level, we found that landscape composition and configuration both provided substantial independent explanatory power, with landscape composition being the better overall predictor. Our results have a number of implications for sampling, analysis, and conservation. For example, misleading results could be obtained by studies conducted at a single organizational level. Also, the high degree of confounding among several levels of our analysis suggests that there is a lack of independence between the influences of environmental structure at different organizational levels. Due to this confounding, our results suggest that patch-based studies of forest-bird ecological relationships in the Oregon Coast Range may be equivocal. In addition, the power of mapped cover class as a plot-level predictor variable suggests that coarse-filter, multiscale approaches utilizing remote sensing and GIS may be nearly as effective at predicting local patterns as expensive field surveys of habitat conditions at the plot level, and more effective at predicting patterns continuously across large regions.

AB We manipulated the quantity of food provided to hand-reared song sparrows Melospiza melodia from 3 to 18 days post-hatching, a period when young birds in the wild are especially likely to experience nutritional stress. A control group was given unlimited food, while an experimental group was limited to 60% of the intake of the controls. Both groups showed excellent survival. The controls had significantly higher growth rates than the experimentals and fledged significantly earlier. At the end of treatment, controls were significantly larger than experimentals in body mass, tarsus length, and length of the third primary. After treatment ended, when all birds were receiving the same diet, both groups showed a recession in body mass, but the amount of mass lost was significantly greater in the controls. Consequently the difference in body mass between the treatment groups was much reduced after the period of weight recession. As adults, the controls were significantly larger than experimentals in a principal component measure of size that combined six post-mortem bone measurements. Controls and experimentals did not differ in the number of fault bars in tail feathers grown in part during the period of nutritional manipulation, nor did they differ in the degree of asymmetry in bone measurements. We conclude that early nutrition affects growth rates in young song sparrows, with effects on skeletal size that carry over into adulthood. These results are consistent with the nutritional stress hypothesis, which posits that early nutrition affects adult phenotypic quality as well as display attributes.

AB 1. In long-lived species, such as seabirds, the allocation of resources between self-maintenance and reproduction is of particular interest because only a small reduction in adult survival may have a large negative effect on lifetime reproductive success. There is much debate about whether seabirds have a fixed or flexible level of investment in their current reproduction, and it has been proposed that parents can regulate the risk of an increase in mortality under the control of a mass threshold.
   2. Body mass change as response to experimental manipulations of parental effort was examined in blue-footed boobies (Sula nebouxii Mine-Edwards), a sexually size-dimorphic seabird, with females approximately 31% heavier than males.
   3. First, paternal effort was manipulated by trimming the flight feathers and thereby handicapping males during the chick-rearing period. Mass remained stable in handicapped males, while there was a reduction of female body mass as response to the handicapped partner. The handicapping of males had a significant effect on chick mass.
   4. Secondly, an experiment was made by enlarging and decreasing broods of two chicks to three and one during the first week after hatching. Body mass of females, but not males, was lower in enlarged broods, and body mass of males, but not females, was higher in the reduced broods when the chicks were 45 days old. Chick body masses were lower among enlarged broods than among reduced and control broods.
   5. Overall, these and other results revealed that blue-footed boobies have a sex-specific body mass regulation. Males had a fixed body mass at the end of experiments; they were working at some physiological maximum or were unwilling to pay the cost in terms of future survival, when the effort demanded was increased. Females performed a flexible effort and were working with a buffer of nutritional reserves that they used when necessary. Below a critical level, females preferentially allocated resources to the maintenance of their body condition at the expense of investment in current reproduction.

AB Among-individual variation of life history traits in a given population of deer has most often been accounted for by differences among sex and age classes and by current environmental variation (mostly changes in density and climatic conditions). However. among-individual differences in fitness can also be generated by differences in environmental conditions during the year of birth. Such cohort effects can be divided into two different components. First, among-year differences in environmental conditions at birth may produce large yearly variation in recruitment that generates a direct numerical effect (i.e., a high proportion of newborns are recruited in good years, whereas very low proportions are recruited when environmental conditions encountered by newborns during their first weeks of life are poor). Second, when recruited into the population, individuals born in a good year may reproduce earlier, reach a larger body mass, and have a higher reproductive success than individuals born in a poor year. We call the long-lasting influence on individual fitness of environmental conditions during the year of birth a delayed quality effect. Here, we first review briefly evidence of numerical and quality effects recently accumulated in deer populations. Then, by using long-term monitoring (> 20 y) of two contrasted roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) populations, we assess the influence of the among-cohort differences in reproductive traits, age- and sex-specific survival rates, and population growth rate. Results show that cohort effects (1) are widespread in deer populations and (2) may have a major influence on population dynamics, especially in low-performance populations. Cohort effects should therefore be accounted for in management plans of deer populations.

AB Previous experiments that tested whether diverse plant communities have lower invasibility have all varied species richness. We experimentally varied evenness of four grassland species (three grasses and one forb) by planting a field experiment in Texas, and monitored the number of unplanted dicot and monocot species that invaded plots for two growing seasons. By varying evenness, we eliminated any sampling effect in our diversity treatment, because all plots contained the same plant species. Experimentally reducing evenness led to a greater number of dicot invaders, which emerged in plots throughout the growing season, but had less of an effect on monocot invaders, which emerged in flushes when experimental plants were semi-dormant. Frequency of Solidago canadensis (altissima ) stems with spittle bugs significantly increased with reductions in evenness during the first year, apparently because the greater number of Solidago stems in high evenness plots diluted the spittle-bug effect. These results support the view that higher diversity plant communities are more resistant to dicot invaders and insect herbivores.

AB Export of microbially produced nitrate from an ecosystem is expected to increase delta(15)N in the remaining soil organic matter and NH4+. To test the hypothesis that nitrification and nitrate loss induced by clear-cutting cause an increase in soil and foliar delta(15)N, we measured delta(15)N in a clear-cut watershed at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. delta(15)N ranged from -0.02parts per thousand in the Oie horizon to 7.7% in the Bs2 horizon prior to clear-cutting, and increased significantly by 1.3parts per thousand in the Oie horizon and 0.9parts per thousand in the Oa horizon 3 years after clear-cutting. Fifteen years after clear-cutting, delta(15)N in both O horizons decreased to near-initial values. No significant temporal changes in the Bs2 and C horizons delta(15)N were observed. Foliar delta(15)N was highest (1.7parts per thousand) the first 2 years after clear-cutting and was significantly higher than in the reference watershed (mean delta(15)N = -1.2parts per thousand), decreasing to 0.0parts per thousand 3-5 years after clear-cutting and to -1.3parts per thousand 9-11 years after clear-cutting. Increased foliar delta(15)N coincided with increased stream-water nitrate concentration, suggesting that the increased nitrification responsible for elevated stream-water nitrate may also have caused an enrichment of the plant-available ammonium pool. The response observed in this catchment also suggests that sampling of soil or foliar delta(15)N may provide a practical alternative to long time series of stream chemistry for evaluating nitrogen saturation of forested ecosystems.

AB Many studies have compared songbird nesting success between forest edge and interior; but few have addressed potential factors underlying variation in nest predation pressure in relation to edge. We examined the relative abundance and species richness of songbird nest predators and the abundance of Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) in forest edge and interior within a fragmented, agricultural landscape in central Missouri, USA. Avian predators and cowbirds were more abundant in forest edges. There were no differences in small- or medium-sized mammalian predator abundance between edge and interior. Almost twice as many snakes were captured in edge as in interior. Predator species richness was significantly higher in forest edge. Forest vegetation structure was very similar between edge and interior, suggesting that differences in predator abundance and species richness were not driven by variation in habitat structure. Nest predator distribution in relation to habitat edge may therefore depend on factors at larger spatial scales, such as landscape context. We suggest that in areas fragmented by agriculture, nest predator assemblages in forest edges may differ from those in forest interior. Edges may attract a greater number of predator species, and some nest predators may be more abundant near the edges of forest patches, although the trend does not apply across all predator taxa. Generalizations about nest predators and edges should thus be made with caution, and conservation plans should consider the composition of local nest predator assemblages in order to predict potential impacts on nesting birds in edge habitat.

AB The search for pattern in the geographic occurrence of salt lake flora and fauna often reveals strong associations of specific taxa with certain types of water chemistry. Solute composition, along with salinity and habitat stability, may provide a templet shaping the distribution of many organisms inhabiting saline lakes. A review of studies demonstrating habitat associations, specific solute tolerance, and ionic and osmotic adaptations provide evidence of fidelity to particular conditions of environmental chemistry across a wide taxonomic spectrum. Under low salinity conditions, some species show osmoregulatory adaptability to varied solute composition but the capacity for such flexibility is reduced with increased salinity and only certain taxa are found in hypersaline waters dominated by a particular solute. Anionic ratios of chloride, bicarbonate-carbonate, and sulfate appear to be especially important determinants of distribution. Specific solute tolerance presents an alternative explanation to disrupted hydrographic connections in describing how biogeographic distributions may be restricted to certain aquatic habitats in arid regions. Physiological adaptations to chemistry, exemplified in the brine fly genus Ephydra, may be an integral part of the evolution, ecology and diversification of saline water organisms.

AB 1. Because predators threaten the survival of endangered prey in many places, predator management is a widespread conservation tool. At the same time, the effects of predators on their prey are greatly influenced by landscape structure. Therefore, the management of landscapes could be an alternative to predator regulation.
   2. A spatially explicit presence/absence model (a stochastic one-layer cellular automaton) was used to investigate two different predator-prey systems that were subject to changes in the number and size of habitat patches in a model landscape.
   3. The first scenario included grey-sided voles Clethrionomys rufocanus, Norwegian lemmings Lemmus lemmus and small mustelids (stoats Mustela erminea and weasels M. nivalis) interacting in a tundra landscape. In the second scenario, the effect of habitat perforation by human settlements with subsidized predators (house cats Felis silvestris catus) on the dynamics of lemmings (as surrogate for endangered prey) was studied.
   4. Both the total area of lemming habitat and the degree of fragmentation were important determinants of the population size and persistence of lemmings. A qualitative change in the effect of fragmentation was observed when the area of lemming habitat decreased from 70% (positive effect) to 50% (negative effect). When lemming habitat covered 50% or less of the landscape, fragmentation had a negative effect on lemming population size and viability, even though habitat area did not decrease.
   5. The spatial configuration of settlements as predator sources was important. A few evenly spaced predator sources had less negative effect on lemming populations than the same proportion of predator habitat that was randomly distributed, which in turn had less effect than many evenly spaced patches.
   6. Including predator management in the model did not decrease the predators' negative impact on the population size and persistence of the endangered prey when settlements occurred in many small patches.
   7. It is concluded that predator management is not a viable strategy to combat the threat to the survival of endangered prey, but that careful planning of landscape pattern could compensate for negative predation effects. The location and size of patches of predator habitat should be optimized in order to minimize the negative effects of predators visiting adjacent areas of natural habitat.

AB Microsatellite amplification was performed on cassava (Manihot esculenta) and six other different species tall wild) of the Manihot genus. We used ten pairs of microsatellite primers previously developed from cassava. detecting 124 alleles in a sample of 121 accessions of the seven species. The number of alleles per locus ranged from four to 21 alleles, and allelic diversity was greater in the wild species than in cassava. Seventy-nine alleles, including unique ones, were detected in the wild species but were not found in the crop. The lower level of heterozygosity in some wild species probably resulted from a combination of fine-scale differentiation within the species and the presence of null alleles. Overall, microsatellite primers worked across the genus. but, with increasing genetic distance, success in amplifying loci tended to decrease. No accession of M. aesculifolia, M. carthaginensis, and M, brachyloba presented a banding pattern at locus Ga-140; neither did one appear for M. aesculifolia at locus Ga-13. Previous work with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers and this microsatellite analysis show that these three wild taxa are the most distant relatives of the crop, whereas the wild forms M. esculenta subsp. flabellifolia and M. esculenta subsp. peruviana appear to be the closest.

AB Throughout the western states, riparian ecosystems have been affected by water diversions or spring and seep developments that decrease the quantity of instream flows and result in lowered water-tables. Water extraction is especially damaging in arid and semi-arid regions where the presence of instream and ground-water flows are crucial to riparian vegetation. We examined the temporal and spatial relationships between hydrologic gradients, vegetation, and soils in two central Nevada riparian meadows in order to identify plant species and environmental variables that can serve as indicators of water-table status. Species frequency and aerial cover, ground-cover composition, depth to water-table, and soil morphological and physical properties were measured along hydrologic gradients within two riparian meadow complexes. TWINSPAN, cluster, and multivariate discriminant analyses classified the vegetation into four ecosystem types. These occurred along the hydrologic gradient and included, from wettest to driest, wet meadow, mesic meadow, dry meadow, and basin big sagebrush meadow types. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that the variables most strongly related to plant species frequency within both meadows were those associated with depth to water-table. Integrative variables, including the number of days that depth to watertable was less than 30 cm and less than 70 cm, and degree-days of anaerobiosis were most closely related to the wet and mesic meadow vegetation types. The range in depth to water-table, elevation, and aerial cover of gravel and litter were all related to the dry and sagebrush meadow vegetation types. Indicator species associated with particular water-table regimes were identified for each vegetation type based on two-way ordered tables. Carer nebrascensis, an obligate riparian species, occurred at water-tables of 0-30 cm below the surface and was the most reliable indicator of shallow water-tables. Large temporal and spatial variability in water-table depths for the mesic and dry meadow types suggests that species associated with these types could be used only to indicate broad ranges in water-table depth. Integrative environmental variables that incorporated the temporal variation in water-tables (i.e., days that depth to water-table was less than 30 and 70 cm; degree days of anaerobiosis; range in water-table depth during the growing season) demonstrated closer relationships to the vegetation types than water-table alone. They were also more sensitive to the spatial and temporal differences in water-tables than individual plant species or vegetation types. Environmental and integrative environmental variables may respond more quickly to changes in local hydrology than plant species and are possibly more sensitive indicators of both current water-table status and potential vegetation.

   Location North America Methods Regressions after independent contrasts of geographical range size, body size, habitat breadth, and local abundance.
   Results Species with large range sizes tend to be larger-bodied, be more locally abundant, and have higher habitat breadths. Character reconstructions support the prediction that variables associated with rarity (small geographical range size, low local abundance, low niche breadth, and large body size) evolve in unison, although large body size was associated with the opposite traits in these taxa. Gaston & Blackburn (1996a) suggested using visual identification of the lower boundary of the geographical range-body size relationship to identify extinction-prone species; this resulted in thirteen species that are potentially extinction-prone.
   Main conclusions Similar evolutionary mechanisms appear to operate on body size and other variables related to rarity, even in distantly related taxa.

AB 1. Three independent methods were used to investigate population structure in the butterfly Plebejus argus. First, migration and dispersal ability were measured by mark-release-recapture in seven adjacent habitat patches, and by release of butterflies in unoccupied habitat. Secondly, colonization of newly created habitat was observed over 7 years. Finally, genetic differentiation of local populations within a metapopulation was investigated. Sampled local populations included parts of the mark-release-recapture study area.
   2. Plebejus argus is relatively sedentary: the maximum movement detected was 395 m, and only 2% of individuals moved further than 100 m between recaptures on different days. None the less, adjacent local populations in the mark-release-recapture study area were linked by occasional migration, with approximate to 1.4% of individuals moving between patches separated by 13-200 m.
   3. Despite low mobility, observed colonizations occurred rapidly over distances of less than or equal to 1 km. Because P. argus occurs at high population densities, 1.4% migration can generate enough migrants to colonize newly suitable habitat quickly at this spatial scale.
   4. Mark-release-recapture data were used to predict that there would be limited genetic differentiation through drift between local populations at this spatial scale. The prediction was supported by allele frequency data for the same local populations.
   5. Genetic differentiation often indicates higher levels of migration than are revealed by the movements of marked individuals. This study shows that when experimental releases and extensive marking are undertaken in areas that are large relative to most movements, indirect measures of gene flow and direct measures of dispersal can concur.
   6. Evidence from the three different approaches was complementary, indicating that P. argus occurs as metapopulations within the study area.

ID CENTRAL ENGLAND; PYRONIA-TITHONUS; CLIMATE; WALES
AB This paper examines the first appearance of butterflies using two sources; historical data from the former phenological reports of the Royal Meteorological Society and recent data from the extant Butterfly Monitoring Scheme. Using regression techniques mean dates of appearance are related to Manley's central England temperatures and are then examined for other, unexplained, trends over time. The observed relationships suggest that, in the absence of evolutionary change, climate warming of the order of 3 degrees C could advance butterfly appearance by two to three weeks. The flowering of two of the larval foodplants of the orange tip butterfly is also examined, with the conclusion that synchrony is likely to be maintained by a similar advance in timing. The consequences of such changes to the phenology of British butterflies are discussed.

AB We examine the potential of standardised data, mainly collected in the laboratory, to elucidate mechanisms of species coexistence, using a south-facing, infertile, species-rich limestone grassland at Miller's Dale, Derbyshire, Eng land as a model system. Standardised autecological data for 15 of the more important Miller's Dale species were obtained from the Integrated Screening Programme (ISP), and their functional attributes were reviewed in the context of a larger database, broadly representative of the British flora. Ordination of adult plant attributes demonstrated that the Miller's Dale species are strategically relatively uniform; most are slow-growing, evergreen and tolerant of mineral nutrient deficiency. Ordination of seed attributes revealed more variety among the Miller's Dale species; the main axis of variation was from species with large, transient seeds (mostly grasses) to species with small, persistent seeds (mostly dicots). From the ordination we derive the predictions that germination of the latter species will be more temporally opportunistic and more inhibited by the presence of vegetation than the former. These predictions are consistent with data collected in experimental studies of seed persistence and germination at the site. These data suggest that spatial and temporal variation in opportunities for regeneration is an important mechanism contributing to the high species richness of dry limestone grasslands.

DT Article
ID CARABIDAE; COLEOPTERA
AB The immediate changes caused by forest fire in the beetle fauna were studied at three sites in boreal coniferous forest in Finland. In general the number of individuals and species increased after fire. The species attracted to the burnt forest included wood-borers (Cerambycidae, Curculionidae, Anobiidae, some Elateridae), species developing under bark of damaged trees, species associated with fungi (Lathrididae, Cryptophagidae, Nitidulidae, Leiodidae) and certain soil- and litter-dwelling groups: Carabidae, Byrrhidae and some Elateridae. Predators utilizing diptera larvae in mushrooms increased strongly after the fire as well. Many of the species presumed to be associated with wood-fungi peaked immediately after the fire, i.e. many cryptophagids, lathridids and nitidulids, whereas the leiodids Anisotoma spp. and Agathidium spp. became commoner two years after the fire. Several species previously known to strongly prefer burnt forests were captured. The fire specialists form a hetergenous ecological group, indicating that a substantial portion of the forest species have adapted to fire cycles. A large group of species normally found only in man-made, microclimatically warm habitats, e.g. compost, were attracted to two of the burnt sites. Their absence from the third site was probably due to lack of suitable source areas in the immediate surroundings. Cholevidae associated with rodents and many litter-dwelling Staphylinidae were drastically reduced by the fire. In most cases, their numbers had not returned to previous levels two years after the burning.

AB In 1990 and 1991, we determined the proportion of Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus) territorial males that were paired in a 25-ha plot in an extensive forest (>350 km2) in Quebec, and compared it to pairing success in populations breeding in nearby forest fragments (4.5-53.0 ha) in Quebec and Ontario. We tested the hypotheses that pairing success would increase with population density, and decrease with the degree of fragmentation of the habitat. Pairing success was higher in the extensive forest in both years, although the difference was only marginally significant (P < 0.10) in 1990 (82.4 vs. 58.6%), and not significant (P > 0.25) in 1991 (76.5 vs. 58.3%). The density of territorial males was twice as high in the extensive forest as in the forest fragments. When including data from similar studies conducted in New Jersey and Missouri, we found that pairing success increased and gradually levelled off with the density of territorial males. Although we lacked a common parameter for measuring habitat fragmentation across all three studies, pairing success appeared to decrease with the isolation of forest fragments from surrounding woodland, while it remained stable around 80% in extensive forests of all three studies. The effect of habitat fragmentation on pairing success was particularly severe in the Missouri study area, at the periphery of Ovenbird's breeding range. A general linear model showed that woodland configuration-the location of a study site in an extensive or fragmented forest-was the best predictor of pairing success, and that geographical location also had a significant effect. We conclude that habitat fragmentation reduces pairing success by altering dispersal dynamics or habitat selection by females.

AB Detrimental effects of vines on tree growth in successional environments have been frequently reported. Little is known, however, about the relative importance of below and aboveground competition from vines on tree growth. The objective of this study was to quantify and compare the growth responses of Liquidambar styraciflua saplings to below and/or aboveground competition with the exotic evergreen vine, Lonicera japonica (Japanese honeysuckle), and the native deciduous vine, Parthenocissus quinquefolia (Virginia creeper). Soil trenching and/or vine-trellising were used to control the type of vine competition experienced by trees. Comparisons among untrenched treatments tested for effects of belowground competition, singly or in combination with aboveground competition. Comparisons among trenched treatments tested for effects of aboveground competition. After two growing seasons, Lonicera japonica had a greater effect on the growth of L. styraciflua than did P. quinquefolia. This effect was largely due to root competition, as canopy competition only had a negative effect on tree growth when it occurred in combination with root competition. Leaf expansion was consistently and similarly affected by all treatments which involved belowground competition.

AB In this paper, the butterfly community of the Tam Dao montane rain forest in northern Vietnam is described ecologically and biogeographically. A negative correlation between the size of species geographic range and maturity of the successional stage of its preferred habitat was found. This means that butterflies confined to the climax forest tend to have a small range of distribution of endemitic type, whereas species associated with disturbed ruderal and similar habitats are much more widely distributed. Within the forest, understorey species are most habitat specific and endemitic, with the most important conservation value. Canopy fauna is much more heterogeneous and diverse, containing also non-forest components. The pronounced temporal change in the forest community is determined by the relatively higher seasonality of species with biogeographical affinities to the seasonal 'East Himalayan' region. Apart from this historical component, the irregular migratory behaviour and response to the seasonal change in local environmental factors seem to be important. In the ruderal habitat, butterflies with large geographic range tend to have the highest population sizes; the reverse is true for the forest community. Differences in current and historical habitat commonness and disturbance intensity are proposed to explain this pattern. The present investigations of the butterfly community indicate the great importance of the Tam Dao rain forest for preservation of the biodiversity on frontiers between the Oriental and Palaearctic Regions.

AB Caterpillars of Maculinea arion are obligate predators of the brood of Myrmica sabuleti ants. In the laboratory, caterpillars eat the largest available ant larvae, although eggs, small larvae and prepupae are also palatable. This is an efficient way to predate. It ensures that newly-adopted caterpillars consume the final part of the first cohort of ant brood in a nest, before this pupates in early autumn and becomes unavailable as prey. At the same time, the fixed number of larvae in the second cohort is left to grow larger before being killed in late autumn and spring. Caterpillars also improve their feeding efficiency by hibernating for longer than ants in spring, losing just 6% of their weight while the biomass of ant larvae increases by 27%. Final instar caterpillars acquire more than 99% of their ultimate biomass in Myrmica nests, growing from 1.3 mg to an estimated 173 mg. A close correlation was found between the weights of caterpillars throughout autumn and the number of large ant larvae they had eaten. This was used to calculate the number of larvae eaten in spring, allowing both for the loss of caterpillar weight during winter and the increase in the size of their prey in spring. It is estimated that 230 of the largest available larvae, and a minimum nest size of 354 M. sabuleti workers, is needed to support one butterfly. Few wild M. sabuleti nests are this large: on one site, it was estimated that 85% of nests were too small to produce a butterfly, and only 5% could support two or more. This prediction was confirmed by the mortalities of 376 caterpillars in 151 wild M. sabuleti nests there. Mortalities were particularly high in nests that adopted more than two caterpillars, apparently due to scramble competition and starvation in autumn. Survival was higher than predicted in wild nests that adopted one caterpillar. These caterpillars seldom exhaust their food before spring, when there is intense competition among Myrmica for nest sites. Ants often desert their nests in the absence of brood, leaving the caterpillar behind. Vacant nests are frequently repopulated by a neighbouring colony, carrying in a fresh supply of brood. Maculinea arion caterpillars have an exceptional ability to withstand starvation, and sometimes survive to parasitize more than one Myrmica colony. Despite these adaptations, predation is an inefficient way to exploit the resources of a Myrmica nest. By contrast, Maculinea rebeli feeds mainly at a lower trophic level, on the regurgitations of worker ants. Published data show that Myrmica nests can support 6 times more caterpillars of Maculinea rebeli than of M. arion in the laboratory. This is confirmed by field data.

AB How insects promote crop pollination remains poorly understood in terms of the contribution of functional trait differences between species. We used meta-analyses to test for correlations between community abundance, species richness and functional trait metrics with oilseed rape yield, a globally important crop. While overall abundance is consistently important in predicting yield, functional divergence between species traits also showed a positive correlation. This result supports the complementarity hypothesis that pollination function is maintained by non-overlapping trait distributions. In artificially constructed communities (mesocosms), species richness is positively correlated with yield, although this effect is not seen under field conditions. As traits of the dominant species do not predict yield above that attributed to the effect of abundance alone, we find no evidence in support of the mass ratio hypothesis. Management practices increasing not just pollinator abundance, but also functional divergence, could benefit oilseed rape agriculture.

AB In this study, the sorption, desorption and degradation of three neonicotinoids, imidacloprid (IMI), clothianidin (CLO) and thiacloprid (THI), and their effects on microorganisms in four different agricultural soils were systematically evaluated. The sorption of neonicotinoids on the soils was generally low with distribution coefficients (K-d) up to 16.2 L/kg at C-e of 0.05 mg/L following the order THI > IMI approximate to CLO, and the sorption were mainly influenced by the soil organic carbon content. The percentage degradation rates of the pesticides in different soils ranged from 25.4% to 80.9%, all following the order THI > IMI approximate to CLO. All the three neonicotinoids degraded much faster under non-sterilized conditions than sterilized conditions, indicating considerable contribution of biodegradation. The total degradation or biodegradation of neonicotinoids was the fastest in the soil with the highest organic carbon content, and the neonicotinoids' bioavailability was not the primary influencing factor due to their weak sorption. The chemical degradation was mainly affected by pH and cation exchange capacity. The degradation of neonicotinoids occurred mainly via nitrate reduction, cyano hydrolysis and chloropyridinyl dechlorination. High-throughput sequencing data showed that the microbial community structure and abundance changed greatly in neonicotinoid-spiked soils as compared to the control, which might influence their degradation pathways. Some microbe families associated with the biodegradation of neoniconoids were found, which were all belonging to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. The degradation of neoniconoids influenced the soil nitrifying process. The present study provides valuable information for comprehensively understanding the fate of neonicotinoids in soils.

AB Neonicotinoid insecticides (NIs) and their transformation products were detected in honey, pollen and honey bees, (Apis mellifera) from hives located within 30 km of the City of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Clothianidin and thiamethoxam were the most frequently detected NIs, found in 68 and 75% of honey samples at mean concentrations of 8.2 and 17.2 ng g(-1) wet mass, (wm), respectively. Clothianidin was also found in >50% of samples of bees and pollen. Concentrations of clothianidin in bees exceed the LD50 in 2 of 28 samples, while for other NIs concentrations were typically 10-100-fold less than the oral LD50. Imidaclorpid was detected in similar to 30% of samples of honey, but only 5% of pollen and concentrations were <LOD in bees. Transformation products of Imidaclorpid, imidaclorpid-Olefin and imidacloprid-5-Hydroxy were detected with greater frequency and at greater mean concentrations indicating a need for more focus on potential effects of these transformation products than the untransformed, active ingredient NIs. Results of an assessment of the potential dietary uptake of NIs from honey and pollen by bees over winter, during which worker bees live longer than in summer, suggested that, in some hives, consumption of honey and pollen during over-wintering might have adverse effects on bees.

AB Telomeres play a fundamental role in the maintenance of genomic integrity at a cellular level, and average leukocyte telomere length (LTL) has been proposed as a biomarker of organismal aging. However, studies tracking LTL across the entire life course of individuals are lacking. Here, we examined lifelong patterns of variation in LTL among four birth cohorts of female Soay sheep (Ovis aries) that were longitudinally monitored and sampled from birth to death. Over the first 4 months of life, there was within-individual loss of LTL, consistent with findings in the human and primate literature, but there was little evidence of consistent LTL loss associated with age after this point. Overall, we observed only weak evidence of individual consistency in LTL across years and over the entire lifespan: Within-individual variation was considerable, and birth cohorts differed markedly in their telomere dynamics. Despite the high levels of LTL variation within the lifetimes of individuals, there remained significant associations between LTL and longevity. Detailed analysis of the longitudinal data set showed that this association was driven by improved survival of individuals with longer LTL over the first 2 years of life. There was no evidence that LTL predicted survival in later adulthood. Our data provide the first evidence from a mammal that LTL can predict mortality and lifespan under natural conditions, and also highlight the potentially dynamic nature of LTL within the lifetimes of individuals experiencing a complex and highly variable environment.

AB Species distribution models (SDMs) predict the probability of species occurrence based on their statistical relationships with environmental variables. Many studies have compared SDM algorithms and accuracies, but few have compared transferability of SDMs across disjunctive geographic areas and the impact of the number of variables on their performance and transferability. We compared the predictive power and transferability of ten SDM algorithms using Phytophthora cinnamomi point locations. P. cinnamomi Rands is an oomycete associated with Oak Decline in Spain and Jarrah Dieback in Australia. The environmental similarity between the two areas was assessed using Mahalanobis distances. Model performance was evaluated by area under the curve (AUC). The spatial distribution of P. cinnamomi was predicted satisfactorily (AUC>0.7) in Spain by nine algorithms, but only marginally (AUC>0.55) by all except one in Australia. Further, three machine-learning methods showed relatively high predictive power in the calibration areas combined with low transferability to the other continent, while two of the five regression models achieved reasonable accuracies within the calibration areas combined with a better intercontinental transferability compared to machine-learning methods. The SDM algorithms generated diverse responses to using less than five environmental variables. The most desirable combinations of model performance and transferability were achieved by General Linear Models (GLM) and Generalized Additive Models (GAM). MaxEnt performed at par with GLM and GAM in-situ as well as in transferring for one of the two directions. Moreover, MaxEnt provided the most robust response across the number of environmental variables tested. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Searching for sustainable growth opportunities, manufacturing firms are increasingly embedding sustainability concerns into their relationships with supply chain partners. In the present paper, we explore the potential of environmental collaboration with suppliers and customers to induce environmentally sustainable improvements to internal processes to address external sustainability pressures and to contribute to business performance. Grounded in resource based view spin-offs, this study claims that environmental collaboration can enhance the performance of the focal firm not only directly, but also indirectly - by stimulating the focal firm to implement more environmentally sustainable processes that in turn contribute to firm's performance. Providing manufacturing managers with a better understanding of the direct and indirect relationships between environmental collaboration and firm performance can gain them more control over the outcomes of environmental. collaboration. Proposed relationships were tested in a sample of 139 Dutch food and beverage processors using structural equation modelling. The results indicate that environmental collaboration with suppliers can improve the performance of Dutch food and beverage processors directly as it induces cost savings. Nevertheless, such collaboration is not likely to assist firms seeking to improve environmental sustainability of their internal processes as one of the outcomes of environmental collaboration. On the contrary, environmental collaboration with customers induces performance indirectly, by stimulating food and beverage processors to implement sustainable process improvements that subsequently bring about cost savings and market gains.

AB We argue that human-mediated invasions are part of the spectrum of species movements, not a unique phenomenon, because species self-dispersing into novel environments are subject to the same barriers of survival, reproduction, dispersal and further range expansion as those assisted by people. Species changing their distributions by human-mediated and non-human mediated modes should be of identical scientific interest to invasion ecology and ecology. Distinctions between human-mediated invasions and natural colonisations are very valid for management and policy, but we argue that these are value-laden distinctions and not necessarily an appropriate division for science, which instead should focus on distinctions based on processes and mechanisms. We propose an all-encompassing framework of species range expansion. This does not detract from the importance of invasion biology as a discipline, but instead will help bring together research being conducted on multiple taxa, and by multiple disciplines, including epidemiology, that are often focused on an identical phenomenon: colonisation.

AB Accurate modelling of drought-induced mortality is challenging. A steady-state model is presented integrating xylem and phloem transport, leaf-level gas exchange and plant carbohydrate consumption during drought development.
   A Bayesian analysis of parameter uncertainty based on expert knowledge and a literature review is carried out. The model is tested by combining six data compilations covering 170 species using information on sensitivities of xylem conductivity, stomatal conductance and leaf turgor to water potential.
   The possible modes of plant failure at steady state are identified (i. e. carbon (C) starvation, hydraulic failure and phloem transport failure). Carbon starvation occurs primarily in the parameter space of isohydric stomatal control, whereas hydraulic failure is prevalent in the space of xylem susceptibility to embolism. Relative to C starvation, phloem transport failure occurs under conditions of low sensitivity of photosynthesis and high sensitivity of growth to plant water status.
   These three failure modes are possible extremes along two axes of physiological vulnerabilities, one characterized by the balance of water supply and demand and the other by the balance between carbohydrate sources and sinks. Because the expression of physiological vulnerabilities is coordinated, we argue that different failure modes should occur with roughly equal likelihood, consistent with predictions using optimality theory.

AB Projections of ecosystem and biodiversity change for Africa under climate change diverge widely. More than other continents, Africa has disturbance-driven ecosystems that diversified under low Neogene CO2 levels, in which flammable fire-dependent C-4 grasses suppress trees, and mega-herbivore action alters vegetation significantly. An important consequence is metastability of vegetation state, with rapid vegetation switches occurring, some driven by anthropogenic CO2-stimulated release of trees from disturbance control. These have conflicting implications for biodiversity and carbon sequestration relevant for policymakers and land managers. Biodiversity and ecosystem change projections need to account for both disturbance control and direct climate control of vegetation structure and function.

AB With increasing urbanization, some animals are adapting to human-dominated systems, offering unique opportunities to study individual adaptation to novel environments. One hypothesis for why some wildlife succeed in urban areas is that they are subsidized with anthropogenic food. Here, we combine individual-level movement patterns with diet composition based on stable isotope analysis to assess the degree to which a rapidly growing population of coyotes (Canis latrans) in Chicago consumes anthropogenic resources. We used telemetry to classify coyotes into three groups based on social class and home range composition: (1) residents with home ranges in urban nature preserves; (2) residents with home ranges that had a high proportion of urban land; and (3) transients that had relatively large home ranges and variable use of urban land. We found that natural and anthropogenic resources in this system can be reliably partitioned with carbon isotopes. Mixing models revealed that resident coyotes associated with most urban nature preserves consumed trace to minimal amounts of anthropogenic resources, while coyotes that live in the urban matrix consume moderate (30-50 %) to high (>50 %) proportions of anthropogenic resources. Lastly, we found evidence of prey switching between natural and anthropogenic resources and a high degree of inter-individual variation in diet among coyotes. In contrast to the expectation that urban adaptation may dampen ecological variation, our results suggest individuality in movement and diet exemplifies the successful establishment of coyotes in urban Chicago. Our study also suggests that direct anthropogenic food subsidization is not a prerequisite for successful adaptation to urban environments.

AB The ongoing expansion of shrub cover in response to climate change represents a unique opportunity to explore the link between soil microbial communities and vegetation changes. This link is particularly important in peatlands where shrub expansion is expected to feed back negatively on the carbon sink capacity of these ecosystems. Microbial community structure and function were measured seasonally in four peatlands located along an altitude gradient representing a natural gradient of climate and associated vascular plant abundance. We show that increased soil temperature and reduced water content are associated with greater vascular plant biomass, in particular that of ericoids, and that this, in turn, is correlated with greater microbial biomass. More specifically, microbial community structure is characterized by an increasing dominance of fungi over bacteria with improved soil oxygenation. We also found that the carbon and nitrogen stoichiometry of microbial biomass differs in relation to soil microbial community structure and that this is ultimately associated with a different investment in extracellular enzymatic activity. Our findings highlight the fact that the determination of the structural identity of microbial communities can help to explain the biogeochemical dynamics of organic matter and provide a better understanding of ecosystem response to environmental changes.

AB Urban areas, in particular, present unique challenges for the conservation of ecosystems. Allotment gardens (AGs) are an important greenspace feature of urban landscapes in Europe which have the potential to offer multiple social and bio-physical ecosystem services in addition to food production. This study is an attempt to assess and compare the ecosystem services provided by AGs in Manchester, UK, and Poznan, Poland as well as a comparison to city parks. The surveys included a detailed land cover characterisation and an assessment of cultivated and spontaneous plant species. There are differences in the land use characteristics in the two cities with a preference for vegetable growing and water recycling in Manchester, and a greater number of trees and a higher focus on recreation in Poznan. The consequences of these basic differences are discussed in terms of the ecosystem services that are provided by the two different AG types, and parks. In terms of ecology, there is higher species richness on AGs with a greater proportion of neophytes, which may potentially spread into cities. The species recorded in parks and AGs contained a lot of native characteristics of urban, ruderal plant communities. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB High-intensity and fast-spreading wildfires are natural in the Mediterranean basin. However, since 1960, wildfire occurrence has increased because of changes in land use, which resulted in extensive land abandonment, increases in the fuel load and continuity in the landscape. The level of soil degradation related to wildfire occurrence depends on fire recurrence, topography of the site, intensity of the soil erosion processes and plant cover post-fire regeneration rate. Therefore assessing fire impacts on soil properties is critical to quantify land degradation processes and to assess post-fire restoration plans. This article reviews the changes in soil nutrient status of Mediterranean ecosystems affected by wildfires by focusing on the interactions between the different drivers and factors, and the underlying processes of these changes. Articles dealing with wildfires in areas belonging to the Mediterranean basin and characterized by an annual average rainfall of 300-900 mm and a mean annual temperature around 14-19 degrees C, have been reviewed. The data show that the soil nutrient content in Mediterranean drylands affected by wildfires depends on the vegetation type, fire recurrence and fire intensity. Immediately after a fire, the nutrient content in both the O and A horizons often increases because of ash deposition, nutrient release from the burnt vegetation and formation of stable nutrient forms. Ash deposition persistence on the soil surface is one of the most important factors in determining the soil nutrient content both immediately after a fire and for the long-term. For the restoration of burned habitats it is important to know the content and the spatial distribution of nutrients in the soil because this can act as a limiting factor to vegetation recovery. Carbon and nitrogen pools in the soil have been recognized as fundamental to vegetation recuperation after a fire. To promote the accumulation and retention of nutrients in soil after a fire, it is important to stabilize the burnt site by applying post-fire measures that limit soil erosion, surface runoff and wind loss of the ash. Depending on the plant species and the time elapsing between consecutive wildfires, fire is responsible for the transition from mature ecosystems (i.e. conifer forests) to shrublands, which are poorer in soil nutrient status. Wildfire occurrence can be reduced by planting fire-resilient plants in fire-prone areas. To define the best post-fire and restoration treatments, the impacts of fire on both the O and the A horizon as well as the impacts of different post-fire treatments on the soil nutrient content require further study.

AB AimHuman activities and the consequent extirpations of native species and introductions of non-native species have been modifying the composition of species assemblages throughout the world. These anthropogenic impacts have modified the richness of assemblages as well as the biological dissimilarity among them. However, while changes in taxonomic dissimilarity (i.e. accounting for species composition) have been assessed intensively during the last decade there are still few assessments of changes in functional dissimilarity (i.e. accounting for the diversity of biological traits). Here, we assess the temporal changes in both taxonomic and functional dissimilarities for freshwater fish assemblages across Europe.
   LocationWestern Palaearctic, 137 river basins.
   MethodsThe Jaccard index was used to quantify the changes in both taxonomic and functional dissimilarity. We then partitioned dissimilarity to extract its turnover component and measured the changes in the contribution of turnover to dissimilarity.
   ResultsFunctional homogenization exceeded taxonomic homogenization six-fold. More importantly, we found only a moderate positive correlation between these changes. For instance, 40% of assemblages that experienced taxonomic differentiation were actually functionally homogenized. Taxonomic and functional homogenizations were stronger when the historical level of taxonomic dissimilarity among assemblages was high and when a high number of non-native species were introduced in the assemblages. Moreover, translocated species (i.e. non-native species originating from Europe) played a stronger role than exotic species (i.e. those coming from outside Europe) in this homogenization process, while extirpation did not play a significant role.
   Main conclusionsChange in taxonomic diversity cannot be used to predict changes in functional diversity. In addition, as functional diversity has been proven to be a better indicator of ecosystem functioning and stability than taxonomic diversity, further studies are required to test the potential effects of functional homogenization at the local scale.

AB The oceanographic drivers of marine vertebrate habitat use are poorly understood yet fundamental to our knowledge of marine ecosystem functioning. Here, we use composite front mapping and high-resolution GPS tracking to determine the significance of mesoscale oceanographic fronts as physical drivers of foraging habitat selection in northern gannets Morus bassanus. We tracked 66 breeding gannets from a Celtic Sea colony over 2 years and used residence time to identify area-restricted search (ARS) behaviour. Composite front maps identified thermal and chlorophyll-a mesoscale fronts at two different temporal scales-(i) contemporaneous fronts and (ii) seasonally persistent frontal zones. Using generalized additive models (GAMs), with generalized estimating equations (GEE-GAMs) to account for serial autocorrelation in tracking data, we found that gannets do not adjust their behaviour in response to contemporaneous fronts. However, ARS was more likely to occur within spatially predictable, seasonally persistent frontal zones (GAMs). Our results provide proof of concept that composite front mapping is a useful tool for studying the influence of oceanographic features on animal movements. Moreover, we highlight that frontal persistence is a crucial element of the formation of pelagic foraging hotspots for mobile marine vertebrates.

AB Direct contact with biodiversity is culturally important in a range of contexts. Many people even join conservation organisations to protect biodiversity that they will never encounter first-hand. Despite this, we have little idea how biodiversity affects people's well-being and health through these cultural pathways. Human health is sensitive to apparently trivial psychological stimuli, negatively affected by the risk of environmental degradation, and positively affected by contact with natural spaces. This suggests that well-being and health should be affected by biodiversity change, but few studies have begun to explore these relationships. Here, we develop a framework for linking biodiversity change with human cultural values, well-being, and health. We argue that better understanding these relations might be profoundly important for biodiversity conservation and public health.

AB Previous syntheses on the effects of environmental conditions on the outcome of plant-plant interactions summarize results from pairwise studies. However, the upscaling to the community-level of such studies is problematic because of the existence of multiple species assemblages and species-specific responses to both the environmental conditions and the presence of neighbors. We conducted the first global synthesis of community-level studies from harsh environments, which included data from 71 alpine and 137 dryland communities to: (i) test how important are facilitative interactions as a driver of community structure, (ii) evaluate whether we can predict the frequency of positive plant-plant interactions across differing environmental conditions and habitats, and (iii) assess whether thresholds in the response of plant-plant interactions to environmental gradients exists between "moderate" and "extreme" environments. We also used those community-level studies performed across gradients of at least three points to evaluate how the average environmental conditions, the length of the gradient studied, and the number of points sampled across such gradient affect the form and strength of the facilitation-environmental conditions relationship. Over 25% of the species present were more spatially associated to nurse plants than expected by chance in both alpine and chyland areas, illustrating the high importance of positive plant-plant interactions for the maintenance of plant diversity in these environments. Facilitative interactions were more frequent, and more related to environmental conditions, in alpine than in dryland areas, perhaps because drylands are generally characterized by a larger variety of environmental stress factors and plant functional traits. The frequency of facilitative interactions in alpine communities peaked at 1000 mm of annual rainfall, and globally decreased with elevation. The frequency of positive interactions in dtyland communities decreased globally with water scarcity or temperature annual range. Positive facilitation-drought stress relationships are more likely in shorter regional gradients, but these relationships are obscured in regions with a greater species turnover or with complex environmental gradients. By showing the different climatic drivers and behaviors of plant-plant interactions in dryland and alpine areas, our results will improve predictions regarding the effect of facilitation on the assembly of plant communities and their response to changes in environmental conditions.

AB There is no consensus about how stresses such as low water availability and temperature limit tree growth. Sink limitation to growth and survival is often inferred if a given stress does not cause non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations or levels to decline along with growth. However, trees may actively maintain or increase NSC levels under moderate carbon stress, making the pattern of reduced growth and increased NSCs compatible with carbon limitation. To test this possibility, we used full and half defoliation to impose severe and moderate carbon limitation on 2-year-old Quercus velutina Lam. saplings grown in a common garden. Saplings were harvested at either 3 weeks or 4 months after treatments were applied, representing short- and longer-term effects on woody growth and NSC levels. Both defoliation treatments maintained a lower total leaf area than controls throughout the experiment with no evidence of photosynthetic up-regulation, and resulted in a similar total biomass reduction. While fully defoliated saplings had lower starch levels than controls in the short term, half defoliated saplings maintained control starch levels in both the short and longer term. In the longer term, fully defoliated saplings had the greatest starch concentration increment, allowing them to recover to near-control starch levels. Furthermore, between the two harvest dates, fully and half defoliated saplings allocated a greater proportion of new biomass to starch than did controls. The maintenance of control starch levels in half defoliated saplings indicates that these trees actively store a substantial amount of carbon before growth is carbon saturated. In addition, the allocation shift favouring storage in defoliated saplings is consistent with the hypothesis that, as an adaptation to increasing carbon stress, trees can prioritize carbon reserve formation at the expense of growth. Our results suggest that as carbon limitation increases, reduced growth is not necessarily accompanied by a decline in NSC concentrations. Therefore, a lack of NSC decline may not be evidence that reduced tree growth under cold or water stress is caused by sink limitation.

AB Aim Urbanization as a major global trend profoundly changes biodiversity patterns, and homogenization of urban biota due to expanding exotic species and declining native species is of increasing concern. Previous studies on this topic have mostly taken place at large scales that include high habitat heterogeneity. Here, we aimed at disentangling the effects of urbanization and plant invasion on species composition through the analysis of similarity patterns of urban plant assemblages at the community scale where species interact. Location Berlin, Germany. Methods We analysed how different levels of urbanization, specific components of the urban matrix and the dominance of a native (Betula pendula) versus an exotic tree species (Robinia pseudoacacia) affect alpha and beta diversity of urban woodland understorey vegetation in sixty-eight 100-m2 plots. Results Exotic dominance reduced alpha diversity, but not beta diversity of the total species pool. Comparing beta diversity among different species groups revealed significant but divergent effects of exotic dominance, habitat connectivity and levels of urbanization in native and non-native species assemblages. In particular, urbanity proved to homogenize the native species pool, whereas the beta diversity of the non-native species pool showed a more pronounced response to exotic dominance. Main conclusions Our data provide evidence that both the urban context and the dominance of exotic species can modify homogenization processes at the community level. These novel insights into the mechanisms of biotic homogenization of urban floras may contribute to mitigating the effects of urbanization on biodiversity.

AB Microbial diversity is generally far higher than plant diversity, but the relationship between microbial diversity and plant diversity remains enigmatic. To shed light on this problem, we examined the diversity of a key guild of root-associated microbes, that is, ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi along a plant diversity gradient in a Chinese subtropical forest. The results indicated that EM fungal diversity was positively correlated with host plant diversity. Furthermore, this relationship was best predicted by host genus-level diversity, rather than species-level diversity or family-level diversity. The generality of this finding was extended beyond our study system through the analyses of 100 additional studies of EM fungal communities from tropical and temperate forests. Here as well, EM fungal lineage composition was significantly affected by EM plant diversity levels, and some EM fungal lineages were co-associated with some host plant genera. These results suggest a general diversity maintenance mechanism for host-specific microbes based on higher order host plant phylogenetic diversity.

AB In this paper, by using a stochastic reaction-diffusion-taxis model, we analyze the picophytoplankton dynamics in the basin of the Mediterranean Sea, characterized by poorly mixed waters. The model includes intraspecific competition of picophytoplankton for light and nutrients. The multiplicative noise sources present in the model account for random fluctuations of environmental variables. Phytoplankton distributions obtained from the model show a good agreement with experimental data sampled in two different sites of the Sicily Channel. The results could be extended to analyze data collected in different sites of the Mediterranean Sea and to devise predictive models for phytoplankton dynamics in oligotrophic waters.

AB One subject of spatial epidemiology is spatial variation in disease risk or incidence. The spread of epidemics can result in strong spatial patterns of such risk or incidence: for example, pathogen dispersal might be highly localized, vectors or reservoirs for pathogens might be spatially restricted, or susceptible hosts might be clumped. Here, spatial pattern of an epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rates is investigated. The conditions for Hopf bifurcation and Turing bifurcation are gained and, in particular, exact Turing domain is found in the two parameters space. Furthermore, numerical results show that force of infection, namely beta, plays an important role in the spatial pattern. More specifically, different patterns emerge as beta increases. The mathematical analysis and numerical results well extend the finding of pattern formation in the epidemic models and may well explain the field observed in some areas.

AB I introduce the software jml that tests for the presence of hybridization in multispecies sequence data sets by posterior predictive checking following Joly, McLenachan and Lockhart (2009, American Naturalist e54). Although their method could potentially be applied on any data set, the lack of appropriate software made its application difficult. The software jml thus fills a need for an easy application of the method but also includes improvements such as the possibility to incorporate uncertainty in the species tree topology. The jml software uses a posterior distribution of species trees, population sizes and branch lengths to simulate replicate sequence data sets using the coalescent with no migration. A test quantity, defined as the minimum pairwise sequence distance between sequences of two species, is then evaluated on the simulated data sets and compared to the one estimated from the original data. Because the test quantity is a good predictor of hybridization events, departure from the bifurcating species tree model could be interpreted as evidence of hybridization. Software performance in terms of computing time is evaluated for several parameters. I also show an application example of the software for detecting hybridization among native diploid North American roses.

AB Species-area relationships (SARs) have mostly been treated from an ecological perspective, focusing on immigration, local extinction and resource-based limits to species coexistence. However, a full understanding across large regions is impossible without also considering speciation and global extinction. Rates of both speciation and extinction are known to be strongly affected by area and thus should contribute to spatial patterns of diversity. Here, we explore how variation in diversification rates and ecologically mediated diversity limits among regions of different sizes can result in the formation of SARs. We explain how this area-related variation in diversification can be caused by either the direct effects of area or the effects of factors that are highly correlated with area, such as habitat diversity and population size. We also review environmental, clade-specific and historical factors that affect diversification and diversity limits but are not highly correlated with region area, and thus are likely to cause scatter in observed SARs. We present new analyses using data on the distributions, ages and traits of mammalian species to illustrate these mechanisms; in doing so we provide an integrated perspective on the evolutionary processes shaping SARs.

AB Increasing demands for firewood owing to rising energy costs have accelerated discussions about the amount of dead wood needed for conservation. A sharp increase in dead wood caused by bark beetles in a German national park provides lessons for management of commercial and protected forests. We investigated the effects of dead wood due to bark beetle infestation as well as tree senility on abundance and richness of saproxylic species of beetles. Increasing amounts of spruce dead wood and opening of the canopy by bark beetles had positive effects on the abundance of host-generalist, conifer-specialist, and red-listed saproxylic beetles. Broadleaf specialists were positively associated with the amount of broadleaf dead wood and negatively associated with canopy openness. Gradient analysis of beetle assemblages revealed two major environmental axes: canopy openness and amount of dead wood. We found a threshold for community divergence at a canopy openness of 23% (confidence interval CI: 11-49) and at an amount of dead wood of 64 m(3) ha(-1) (CI: 35-160). Critically endangered species served as indicators of dense and open forests, but only when the amount of dead wood was high. Our results suggest that, to maintain saproxylic beetle assemblages, the amount of dead wood in commercial montane forests (at present approximate to 15 m(3) ha(-1)) needs to be tripled, with a focus on broadleaf wood in dense stands and spruce wood in open stands. For large protected areas in Europe, our data suggest that bark beetle infestation and senescence without active forest management improves habitat conditions for saproxylic beetles.

AB Charcoal added to soil by wildfires is usually considered to be part of the most stable pool of soil organic matter (SOM). It consists of a continuum of slightly burned plant residues to completely charred material. We sampled the macroscopic charcoal pool produced by a moderate intensity wildfire in a pine coastal forest in Tuscany (Central Italy) with the aim of assessing the relationship between its particle size and chemical composition as well as its reactivity. Our conceptual approach included particle size separation by dry sieving and analysis of four size fractions (>2 mm, 2-1 mm, 1-0.5 mm and <0.5 mm) for elemental composition. The composition of the charcoal fractions was studied using solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared (DRIFT) spectroscopy, analytical pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and CuO oxidation. The reactivity of the fractions was assessed using acid dichromate oxidation, while the morphology was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). There were clear differences in chemistry and reactivity between the fractions. The different fractions are probably the result of both type of original plant material and the fire conditions. In fact, wood-derived charcoal largely prevalent in the largest fraction, while pine needles and herbs were most probably precursors of charcoal in the smallest fractions. The degree of charring was greatest for the coarse fraction, which represented 56% of the total charcoal, and decreased gradually to the finest fraction. The composition was completely aromatic for the coarsest fraction, whereas the finest fraction showed a greater contribution from aliphatic C- and N-containing components. The greatest reactivity was found for the smallest fraction, which represented 24% of the total charcoal. It is particularly rich in N and potentially susceptible to microbial decomposition. The study demonstrates that properties of charcoal added to soil during wildfires may be reliably discriminated on the basis of particle size. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Urban sprawl (dispersed urban development) has increased at alarming rates in Europe and North America over the last 50 years. Quantitative data are urgently needed in monitoring systems for sustainable development. However, there is a lack of reliable measures of urban sprawl that take into account the spatial configuration of the urban areas (not just total amount). This paper introduces four new measures of urban sprawl: degree of urban dispersion (DIS), total sprawl (TS), degree of urban permeation of the landscape (UP), and sprawl per capita (SPC). They characterize urban sprawl from a geometric point of view. The measures are related through TS = DIS x urban area, UP = TS/size of the landscape studied, and SPC = TS/number of inhabitants.
   The paper investigates the properties of the new measures systematically using 13 suitability criteria which were derived from a clear definition of urban sprawl as discussed in a previous paper. The scale of analysis is specified by the so-called horizon of perception. Second, the new measures are applied to three examples from Switzerland. Subsequently, the measures are briefly compared to other measures of urban sprawl from the literature. We demonstrate that UP is an intensive and area-proportionately additive measure and is suitable for comparing urban sprawl among regions of differing size, while SPC is most appropriate when comparing sprawl in relation to human population density. The paper also provides practical advice for calculating the new measures. We conclude that the new method is more suitable than previous methods to quantify the indicator "urban sprawl" in monitoring systems as this method distinguishes the phenomenon of urban sprawl from its various causes and consequences. This article is part II of a set of two papers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over the past 100 years, Arctic temperatures have increased at almost twice the global average rate. One consequence is the acceleration of glacier retreat, exposing new habitats that are colonized by microorganisms whose diversity and function are unknown. Here, we characterized bacterial diversity along two approximately parallel chronosequences in an Arctic glacier forefield that span six time points following glacier retreat. We assessed changes in phylotype richness, evenness and turnover rate through the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences recovered from 52 samples taken from surface layers along the chronosequences. An average of 4500 sequences was obtained from each sample by 454 pyrosequencing. Using parametric methods, it was estimated that bacterial phylotype richness was high, and that it increased significantly from an average of 4000 (at a threshold of 97% sequence similarity) at locations exposed for 5 years to an average of 7050 phylotypes per 0.5 g of soil at sites that had been exposed for 150 years. Phylotype evenness also increased over time, with an evenness of 0.74 for 150 years since glacier retreat reflecting large proportions of rare phylotypes. The bacterial species turnover rate was especially high between sites exposed for 5 and 19 years. The level of bacterial diversity present in this High Arctic glacier foreland was comparable with that found in temperate and tropical soils, raising the question whether global patterns of bacterial species diversity parallel that of plants and animals, which have been found to form a latitudinal gradient and be lower in polar regions compared with the tropics.

AB P> Mosses are an understudied group of plants that can potentially confirm or expand principles of plant function described for tracheophytes, from which they diverge strongly in structure.
   We quantified 35 physiological and morphological traits from cell-, leaf- and canopy-level, for 10 ground-, trunk- and branch-dwelling Hawaiian species. We hypothesized that trait values would reflect the distinctive growth form and slow growth of mosses, but also that trait correlations would be analogous to those of tracheophytes.
   The moss species had low leaf mass per area and low gas exchange rate. Unlike for tracheophytes, light-saturated photosynthetic rate per mass (A(mass)) did not correlate with habitat irradiance. Other photosynthetic parameters and structural traits were aligned with microhabitat irradiance, driving an inter-correlation of traits including leaf area, cell size, cell wall thickness, and canopy density. In addition, we found a coordination of traits linked with structural allocation, including costa size, canopy height and A(mass). Across species, A(mass) and nitrogen concentration correlated negatively with canopy mass per area, analogous to linkages found for the 'leaf economic spectrum', with canopy mass per area replacing leaf mass per area.
   Despite divergence of mosses and tracheophytes in leaf size and function, analogous trait coordination has arisen during ecological differentiation.

AB In studies of phylogeography and taxonomy, strong emphasis is usually placed on the study of mitochondrial (mt)DNA. In the present study, we present a remarkable case in which highly phenotypically divergent species have almost no divergence in mtDNA. Yellowhammers (Emberiza citrinella Linnaeus) and pine buntings (Emberiza leucocephalos S. G. Gmelin) differ noticeably in appearance and song but hybridize in some areas of contact. They share a variety of closely-related mtDNA haplotypes, with little divergence in frequencies, indicating a mitochondrial divergence time sometime during or after the last major glacial period. By contrast, nuclear DNA (amplified fragment length polymorphism markers and CHD1Z gene sequences) differs more strongly between the species, and these differences can be used to identify intermediate genetic signatures of hybrids. The combined amount of mitochondrial diversity within yellowhammers and pine buntings is very low compared to other Emberiza species pairs, whereas the level of variation at the nuclear gene CHD1Z is comparable to that within other species pairs. Although it is difficult to completely reject the possibility that the two species split extremely recently and experienced rapid nuclear and phenotypic differentiation, we argue that the evidence better supports another possibility: the two species are older and mtDNA has recently introgressed between them, most likely as a result of a selective sweep. Mismatches between mitochondrial and nuclear phylogeographic patterns may occur more commonly than previously considered, and could have important implications for the fields of phylogeography and taxonomy.

AB Mycorrhizas (fungal roots) play vital roles in plant nutrient acquisition, performance and productivity in terrestrial ecosystems. Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) and ectomycorrhizas (EM) are mostly important since soil nutrients, including NH4+, NO3- and phosphorus, are translocated from mycorrhizal fungi to plants. Individual species, genera and even families of plants could be interconnected by mycorrhizal mycelia to form common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs). The function of CMNs is to provide pathways for movement or transfer of nutrients from one plant to another. In the past four decades, both N-15 external labeling or enrichment (usually expressed as atom%) and N-15 naturally occurring abundance (delta N-15, parts per thousand) techniques have been employed to trace the direction and magnitude of N transfer between plants, with their own advantages and limitations.
   The heavier stable isotope N-15 is discriminated against N-14 during biochemical, biogeochemical and physiological processes, due to a greater atomic mass. In general, non-N-2-fixing plants had greater delta N-15 values than N-2-fixing (similar to 0 parts per thousand) ones. Foliar delta N-15 often varied by 5 to 10 parts per thousand in the order: non-mycorrhizas/AMs > EMs >= ericoid mycorrhizas. Differences in delta N-15 (parts per thousand) or N-15 (atom%) values could thus provide N transfer information between plants. A range of between 0 to 80% of one-way N transfer had been observed from N-2-fixing mycorrhizal to non-N-2-fixing mycorrhizal plants, but generally less than or around 10% in the reverse direction. Plant-to-plant N transfer may provide practical implications for plant performance in N-limited habitats. Considering that N translocation or cycling is crucial, and the potential benefits of N transfer are great in both agricultural and natural ecosystems, more research is warranted on either one-way or two-way N transfers mediated by CMNs with different species and under field conditions.

AB Palace Leas, a long-term experiment at Cockle Park Farm, Northumberland, UK was established in winter 1896-1897 since when the 13 plots have received regular and virtually unchanged mineral fertiliser and farm yard manure inputs. Fertilisers have had a profound impact on soil pH with the organically fertilised plots showing a significantly higher pH than those receiving mineral fertiliser where ammonium sulphate has led to soil acidification. Here, we investigate the impact of organic and mineral fertilisers on the actinobacterial community structure of these soils using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and 16S rRNA gene analysis. To differentiate fertiliser effects from seasonal variation, soils were sampled three times over one growing season between May and September 2004 and January 2005. Community profiles obtained using T-RFLP were analysed using multivariate statistics to investigate the relationship between community structure, seasonality and fertiliser management. Soil pH was shown to be the most significant edaphic factor influencing actinobacterial communities. Canonical correspondence analysis, used to investigate the relationship between the 16S rRNA gene community profiles and the environmental parameters, showed that actinobacterial communities also responded to soil water content with major changes evident over the summer months between May and September. Quantitative PCR of the actinobacterial and fungal 16S and 18S rRNA genes, respectively suggested that fungal rRNA gene copy numbers were negatively correlated (P = 0.0131) with increasing actinobacterial signals. A similar relationship (P = 0.000365) was also evident when fatty acid methyl esters indicative of actinobacterial biomass (10-methyloctadecanoic acid) were compared with the amounts of fungal octadecadienoic acid (18:2 omega 9,12). These results show clearly that soil pH is a major driver of change in actinobacterial communities and that genera such as Arthrobacter and Micrococcus are particularly abundant in soils receiving organic inputs whilst others such as Streptomyces, Acidimicrobium and Actinospica are more prevalent in acid soils. The importance of these findings in terms of fungal abundance and potential disease suppression are discussed.

AB Studying hybridization is crucial to understanding speciation and almost all our knowledge comes from terrestrial and freshwater environments. Marine hybrids are considered rare, particularly on species-rich coral reefs. Here, we report a significant marine hybrid zone at Christmas and Cocos Islands (eastern Indian Ocean) with 11 hybrid coral reef fishes (across six families); the most recorded hybrids of any marine location. In most cases, at least one of the parent species is rare (less than three individuals per 3000 m 2), suggesting that hybridization has occurred because individuals of the rare species have mated with another species owing to a scarcity of conspecific partners. These islands also represent a marine suture zone where many of the hybrids have arisen through interbreeding between Indian and Pacific Ocean species. For these species, it appears that past climate changes allowed species to diverge in allopatry, while recent conditions have facilitated contact and subsequent hybridization at this Indo-Pacific biogeographic border. The discovery of the Christmas-Cocos hybrid zone refutes the notion that hybridization is lacking on coral reefs and provides a natural laboratory for testing the generality of terrestrially derived hybridization theory in the marine environment.

AB 1. Disturbance histories derived from old-growth forest remnants in Europe and eastern North America have shaped many of our current theories of forest dynamics and succession. Yet the small size typical of these remnants suggests they might not capture the full range of variability that may emerge at larger scales.
   2. We investigated the frequency and severity of natural disturbance in a 2000-ha old-growth landscape (Big Reed Forest Reserve) in northern Maine, USA. Given its size, the Reserve provides an ideal opportunity to study, at multiple scales, natural forest processes in a region that has otherwise been dramatically altered by human activities. Using dendrochronological methods, we reconstructed disturbance histories for 37 randomly located plots stratified by five forest types (hardwood forests, mixed woods forests, red spruce forests, northern white-cedar seepage forests and northern white-cedar swamps).
   3. We found no evidence of stand replacing disturbance on any plot during the last 120-280 years (depending on plot). The overall mean disturbance rate was 9.6% canopy loss per decade (median 6.5%, maximum 55%, plots pooled), yet the distribution was strongly skewed toward the lower rates.
   4. We found little differences in disturbance rates between forest types, save a slightly lower rate in the northern white-cedar swamps. However, if we ignore forest-type classifications, we see that disturbance rates are clearly influenced by gradients in the relative abundance of component tree species, owing to species' relative susceptibilities to particular disturbance agents.
   5. Synthesis. Relatively low rates of canopy disturbance allow the accrual of shade-tolerant saplings. The abundance of this advance regeneration, coupled with the absence of stand-replacing disturbance, has maintained canopy dominance by shade-tolerant species in all plots, all forest types and throughout the entire landscape. Disturbance histories from individual plots coalesce to form a picture of a landscape in which pulses of moderate-severity disturbance are interposed upon a background of scattered small-scale canopy gaps. The landscape-level mosaic resulting from this disturbance regime consists of patches in various stages of structural development, not various stages of compositional succession.

AB Compared to other ecosystem types, a wide variety of biomonitoring methods are available for rivers. Few studies have, however, compared the response of bioindicators (i.e. different river inhabiting taxonomic groups) to different types of environmental stress.
   We regressed diversity, taxonomic distinctness and assemblage composition of fish, invertebrates, macrophytes and benthic diatoms to multivariate gradients in nutrient enrichment and habitat degradation using data from 66 lowland and 77 mountain streams.
   In lowland streams, the composition of benthic diatom assemblages, measured by Detrended Correspondence Analysis, showed the strongest response to elevated nutrient concentrations (R(2) = 0.830), followed by macrophytes (0.711), fish (0.443) and invertebrates (0.391). Macrophyte richness was slightly better correlated with the habitat gradient (0.253) than diatom richness (0.235) and both were better predictors than either fish (0.147) or invertebrate (0.140) assemblage composition.
   For mountain streams, invertebrate assemblage composition was the best predictor of changes in nutrient concentrations (R(2) = 0.749), followed by macrophyte (0.396) and benthic diatom (0.325) assemblages and fish diversity (0.099). Invertebrate assemblage composition was also slightly better correlated with the habitat gradient (0.391) compared to macrophyte richness (0.323) and both were better than either benthic diatom assemblage composition (0.206) or fish abundance (0.161).
   Macrophyte and benthic diatom assemblages in lowland streams and fish and invertebrate assemblages in mountain streams were correlated with the other taxonomic groups, implying that these taxonomic groups may be used as surrogates for indicating wholesale change in diversity.
   Synthesis and applications. Our findings show that response trajectories differ between taxonomic groups and stressor, and even with stream type. For this reason, streams and other ecosystem type's response signatures and first and second principle relations should be considered in the selection of robust, complementary and cost-effective measures for biomonitoring. For instance, our findings of asymmetric response to stress show how different taxonomic groups can be used to strengthen inference of change.

AB 1. This review highlights the status of the European wild rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus, which is threatened within its native range and yet is a highly successful colonizer across its worldwide, introduced range.
   2. The European wild rabbit is a keystone species in Iberia, and the survival of a range of threatened predator species, including the Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus and Spanish imperial eagle Aquila aldabertii, is dependent upon the restoration of rabbit populations. Although not native to the UK, the rabbit also performs significant ecosystem services for nationally rare UK species, by maintaining short sward heights in heathland and grassland ecosystems, and serving as a prey item for populations of predators.
   3. We identify the European wild rabbit as an excellent model to demonstrate the wide range of complex effects that an introduced mammalian species may exert on ecosystems to which it has been introduced. These effects include habitat degradation following overgrazing, competition with native mammals and facilitating meso-predator release and hyperpredation.
   4. We also show that rabbit eradication from some sites may generate more problems than are solved because of the impacts of trophic cascades stemming from dependence on rabbits by native predator assemblages.

AB To understand the demographic history of Arabidopsis thaliana within its native geographical range, we have studied its genetic structure in the Iberian Peninsula region. We have analyzed the amount and spatial distribution of A. thaliana genetic variation by genotyping 268 individuals sampled in 100 natural populations from the Iberian Peninsula. Analyses of 175 individuals from 7 of these populations, with 20 chloroplast and nuclear microsatellite loci and 109 common single nucleotide polymorphisms, show significant population differentiation and isolation by distance. In addition, analyses of one genotype front 100 populations detected significant isolation by distance over the entire Iberian Peninsula, as well as among six Iberian subregions. Analyses of these 100 genotypes with different model-based Clustering algorithms inferred four genetic clusters, which show a clear-cut geographical differentiation pattern. On the other hand, clustering analysis of a worldwide sample showed a west-east Eurasian longitudinal spatial gradient of the commonest Iberian genetic cluster. These results indicate that A. thaliana genetic variation displays significant regional structure and consistently support the hypothesis that Iberia has been a glacial refugium for A. thaliana. Furthermore, the Iberian geographical structure indicates a complex regional Population dynamics, suggesting that this region contained multiple Pleistocene refugia with a different contribution to the postglacial colonization of Europe.

AB Large-scale sequencing of short mtDNA fragments for biodiversity inventories ('DNA barcoding') indicates that sequence variation in animal mtDNA is highly structured and partitioned into discrete genetic clusters that correspond broadly to species-level entities. Here we explore how the migration rate, an important demographic parameter that is directly related to population isolation, might affect variation in the strength of mtDNA clustering among taxa. Patterns of mtDNA variation were investigated in two groups of beetles that both contain lineages occupying habitats predicted to select for different dispersal abilities: predacious diving beetles (Dytiscidae) in the genus Bidessus from lotic and lentic habitats across Europe and darkling beetles (Tenebrionidae) in the genus Eutagenia from sand and other soil types in the Aegean Islands. The degree of genetic clustering was determined using the recently developed 'mixed Yule coalescent' (MYC) model that detects the transition from between-species to within-population branching patterns. Lineages from presumed stable habitats, and therefore displaying lower dispersal ability and migration rates, showed greater levels of mtDNA clustering and geographical subdivision than their close relatives inhabiting ephemeral habitats. Simulations of expected patterns of mtDNA variation under island models showed that MYC clusters are only detected when the migration rates are much lower than the value of Nm=1 typically used to define the threshold for neutral genetic divergence. Therefore, discrete mtDNA clusters provide strong evidence for independently evolving populations or species, but their formation is suppressed even under very low levels of dispersal.

AB Environmental change alters ecosystem functioning and may put the provision of services to human at risk. This paper presents a spatially explicit and quantitative assessment of the corresponding vulnerability for Europe, using a new framework designed to answer multidisciplinary policy relevant questions about the vulnerability of the human-environment system to global change. Scenarios were constructed for a range of possible changes in socio-economic trends, land uses and climate. These scenarios were used as inputs in a range of ecosystem models in order to assess the response of ecosystem function as well as the changes in the services they provide. The framework was used to relate the impacts of changing ecosystem service provision for four sectors in relation to each other, and to combine them with a simple, but generic index for societal adaptive capacity. By allowing analysis of different sectors, regions and development pathways, the vulnerability assessment provides a basis for discussion between stakeholders and policymakers about sustainable management of Europe's natural resources.

AB The knowledge gained from studying diverse populations should help to address inequities and prepare us to deal with the needs of the increasing number of older minorities in this country. At the same time, research that is not properly conducted threatens to lead us astray and misconstrue relationships and outcomes related to behavioral aspects of aging. In this article, we propose that simple comparisons between groups are neither necessary nor sufficient to advance our understanding of ethnic minorities. We discuss common pitfalls conducted in group-differences research, including a specific treatment on the issue of statistical power issues. Our goal is to encourage the use of multiple methodological designs in the study of issues related to racial and ethnic minorities by demonstrating some of the advantages of lesser employed approaches.

AB This study uses a comparative genome scan to evaluate the contributions of host plant related divergent selection to genetic differentiation and ecological speciation in maple- and willow-associated populations of Neochlamisus bebbianae leaf beetles. For each of 15 pairwise population comparisons, we identified "outlier loci" whose strong differentiation putatively reflects divergent selection. Of 447 AFLP loci, 15% were outliers across multiple population comparisons, and low linkage disequilibrium indicated that these outliers derived from multiple regions of the genome. Outliers were further classified as "host-specific" if repeatedly observed in "different-host" population comparisons but never in "same-host" comparisons. Outliers exhibiting the opposite pattern were analogously classified as "host-independent." Host-specific outliers represented 5% of all loci and were more frequent than host-independent outliers, thus revealing a large role for host-adaptation in population genomic differentiation. Evidence that host-related selection can promote divergence despite gene flow was provided by population trees. These were structured by host-association when datasets included host-specific outliers, but not when based on neutral loci, which united sympatric populations. Lastly, three host-specific outliers were highly differentiated in all nine different-host comparisons. Because host-adaptation promotes reproductive isolation in these beetles, these loci provide promising candidate gene regions for future molecular studies of ecological speciation.

AB While much research has focused on the evolution of conspicuous male displays, ornaments and behaviours, less is understood about the evolution of similar traits in females. To determine whether females express these traits as nonadaptive by-products of sexual selection favouring the same traits in males or whether females are directly selected to express such traits, the benefits of these traits must be understood. The prevalence of aggression in female-female competition suggests that females may experience direct sexual selection for aggressiveness, but data are lacking. I used the tree swallow, Tachycineta bicolor, to test the hypothesis that selection directly favours aggressiveness in females during intrasexual competition over nesting sites. After assaying the aggressiveness of a population of tree swallows, I experimentally reduced the number of nesting cavities, a resource required for female reproductive success. More aggressive females were more likely to obtain nesting cavities after the experimental reduction, while female age and male aggressiveness did not predict nesting cavity acquisition. Aggressive behaviour in female tree swallows is therefore beneficial in the context of female-female competition for a critical breeding resource. These results indicate that the processes favouring aggressiveness in intrasexual competition among females may not be very different from the processes shaping aggressive behaviour in males.

AB We present an overview of a process-based modelling approach for predicting how change in flow affects drift density, net rate of energy intake (NREI) and numbers of drift-feeding salmonids. It involves linking an existing two-dimensional flow model (River2D) with models of invertebrate drift transport and drift-foraging which we have developed. We describe, demonstrate and partially test our models in an application on a 80 m x 20 m pool on a New Zealand river. We show how these models realistically capture hydraulic, drift dispersion and bioenergetics drift-foraging processes to predict the relationship between stream flow, habitat quality and quantity (in terms of NREI), and carrying capacity for drift-feeding salmonids. Overall, the 2D hydraulic model made good predictions of water levels, depths and water velocity at the calibration flow and a lower (validation) flow. The drift transport model made good predictions of the spatial distribution of invertebrate drift density throughout the pool at low flow after it was calibrated against observed drift density at the higher flow. The model correctly predicted that drift density would decline downstream and into the margins due to the process of settling dominating over entry from the stream bed, and that drift would be carried further downstream and laterally as flow increased. The foraging model made a reasonable prediction (6-7) of the numbers of 0.5 m adult brown trout observed (5) in the pool. It accurately predicted that trout should be distributed down the thalweg where net rate of energy intake (NREI) was highest, but when NREI was adjusted for depletion by feeding fish the predicted drift-feeding locations were more closely spaced (bunched) than observed fish locations. Our processbased modelling approach has important implications for improving biological realism in predictions of the response of drift-feeding fishes to flow change within the context of the IFIM.

AB To fully understand the contemporary genetic structure of plants, both nuclear and plastid markers are needed. Three chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) lineages, which probably diverged before the major Pleistocene glaciations, have been identified in the circumpolar/circumboreal Vaccinium uliginosum. Here we investigate its nuclear DNA variation using nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, DNA ploidy level measurements and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). We also extend the cpDNA dataset. Two ITS lineages, corresponding to diploids and tetraploids, respectively, were identified. However, both main sequence types apparently occurred in most individual plants but showed ploidy-biased homogenization and possibly reflect paralogy predating the origin of V. uliginosum. The ploidy levels were largely consistent with the cpDNA lineages, suggesting that the initial cpDNA divergence followed early polyploidizations. Five main AFLP groups were identified, consistent with recent glacial refugia in Beringia, western Siberia, the southern European mountains and areas south/east of the Scandinavian and Laurentide ice sheets. Except from the southern European mountains, there has been extensive expansion from all refugia, resulting in several contact zones. Surprisingly, the presumably older ploidy and cpDNA patterns were partly inconsistent with the main AFLP groups and more consistent with AFLP subgroups. A likely major driver causing the inconsistencies is recent nuclear gene flow via unreduced pollen from diploids to tetraploids. This may prevent cytoplasmic introgression and result in overlayed patterns formed by processes dominating at different time scales. The data also suggest more recent polyploidizations, as well as several chloroplast capture events, further complicating this scenario. This study highlights the importance of combining different marker systems to unravel intraspecific histories.

AB We examined the community-environment relationships of lotic macroinvertebrates in near-pristine headwater streams, and the correlation between patterns in taxonomic and functional structure at two regional extents. The across-ecoregion scale comprised five ecoregions spanning all of Finland, while the within-ecoregion scale comprised of north boreal and middle boreal ecoregions. We expected that taxonomic structure should exhibit stronger relationships than functional structure to spatial gradients, while the reverse should be true for local environmental factors. We found some support for this notion, because spatial variables were marginally more important for taxonomic than functional structure. Furthermore, within the two ecoregions, local environmental variables were slightly more important for functional than taxonomic structure. Geographical location (i.e. spatial variables) was more influential at the across-ecoregions extent than within the two ecoregions. Largely the same local environmental variables accounted for variation in both taxonomic and functional structure, including water pH, nutrients, colour, and stream size. Similar responses to local environmental features likely contributed to the significant correlation between patterns in taxonomic and functional structure. It has been suggested that functional traits may be rather insensitive to natural variation, yet our functional categorization showed distinct variation along local environmental, catchment, and spatial gradients across near-pristine streams. Thus, natural ecological filters should be accounted for prior to the examination of the effects of anthropogenic filters on stream macroinvertebrate community composition.

AB The foraging related capacities, energy requirements and the ability of individuals to withstand starvation are strongly dependent on body size and temperature. In this study, we estimated size-dependent foraging rates and critical resource density (CRD) in small Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) under winter conditions and compared these with previous observations under summer conditions. We investigated if starvation mortality is size-dependent in the laboratory, and we assessed the potential for winter growth and the occurrence and size dependency of winter mortality both in a large scale pond experiment and in natural lakes. The efficiency of foraging on macroinvertebrates increased with size but was lower at 4 than 12 degrees C, still CRD was lower at 4 than 12 degrees C as metabolic rates decreased faster than foraging efficiency with temperature. When starved, small char died before large and at rates which suggest that YOY char need to feed during winter to avoid starvation. Results from both our pond experiment and field study indicate that survival of YOY char over winter is high, despite severe winter conditions, because YOY char are able to feed and grow during winter. In seasonal environments with declining resources, the size scaling and temperature dependency of foraging and metabolic demands may provide conditions which can favour either small or large individuals. This size advantage dichotomy relates to that larger individual's by having a higher CRD are more likely to start starving, but once resource levels are below CRD for all size classes, small individuals starve to death at a higher rate. Negative size-dependent winter mortality from starvation is suggested to be more pronounced in species that are not adapted to feed at low temperatures and in species feeding on zooplankton, since zooplankton abundance, in contrast to macroinvertebrate abundance, is generally low during winter.

AB Recurrent, low-severity fire in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)linterior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) forests is thought to have directly influenced nitrogen (N) cycling and availability. However, no studies to date have investigated the influence of natural fire intervals on soil processes in undisturbed forests, thereby limiting our ability to understand ecological processes and successional dynamics in this important ecosystem of the Rocky Mountain West. Here, we tested the standing hypothesis that recurrent fire in ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forests of the Inland Northwest decreases total soil N, but increases N turnover and nutrient availability. We compared soils in stands unburned over the past 69-130 years vs. stands exposed to two or more fires over the last 130 years at seven distinct locations in two wilderness areas. Mineral soil samples were collected from each of the seven sites in June and July of 2003 and analyzed for pH, total C and N, potentially mineralizable N (PMN), and extractable NH4+, NO3, PO4-3, Ca+2, Me, and K+. Nitrogen transformations were assessed at five sites by installing ionic resin capsules in the mineral soil in August of 2003 and by conducting laboratory assays of nitrification potential and net nitrification in aerobic incubations. Total N and PMN decreased in stands subjected to multiple fires. This loss of total N and labile N was not reflected in concentrations of extractable NH4+ and NO3-. Rather, multiple fires caused an increase in NO3- sorbed on ionic resins, nitrification potential, and net nitrification in spite of the burned stands not having been exposed to fire for at least 12-17 years. Charcoal collected from a recent fire site and added to unburned soils increased nitrification potential, suggesting that the decrease of charcoal in the absence of tire may play an important role in N transformations in fire-dependent ecosystems in the long term. Interestingly, we found no consistent effect of fire frequency on extractable P or alkaline metal concentrations. Our results corroborate the largely untested hypothesis that frequent fire in ponderosa pine forests increases inorganic N availability in the long term and emphasize the need to study natural, unmanaged sites in far greater detail.

AB Climatic oscillations during the Pleistocene ice ages produced great changes in species' geographical distribution and abundance, which could be expected to have genetic consequences. Living in the temperate upwelling zones of the northwestern Pacific, Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) might have been affected by these severe climatic oscillations. To investigate the effects of Pleistocene climatic changes on the evolution in Japanese anchovy, fragments of 522bp at the 5' end of mitochondrial DNA control region were sequenced for 241 individuals from 13 localities and 37 individuals of Australian anchovy. Japanese anchovy and Australian anchovy are reciprocally monophyletic and a late Pleistocene transequatorial divergence between the two species was indicated. High levels of haplotype diversity (> 0.99) were found for all samples, indicating a high level of genetic diversity. Analyses of molecular variance and the conventional population statistic F-ST revealed no significant genetic structure throughout the range of Japanese anchovy. Both mismatch distribution analyses and neutrality tests suggested a late Pleistocene population expansion for both Japanese anchovy (79,000-317,000 years ago) and Australian anchovy (45,000-178,000 years ago).

AB Leaf morphology, longevity, and demography were examined in Quercus ilex and Phillyrea latifolia growing in a holm oak forest in Prades mountains (northeast Spain). Four plots (10 x 15 m) of this forest were submitted to an experimental drought during three years (soil moisture was reduced about 15 %). Leaf area, thickness and leaf mass per area ratio (LMA) were measured in sun and shade leaves of both species. Leaf longevity, the mean number of current-year shoots produced per previous-year shoot (Sn/Sn-1), the mean number of current-year leaves per previous-year shoot (Ln/Sn-1), and the percentage of previous-year shoots that developed new ones were measured once a year, just after leaf flushing. LMA and leaf thickness increased since leaf unfolding except in summer periods, when stomatal closure imposed low photosynthetic rates and leaves consumed their reserves. LMA, leaf area, and leaf thickness were higher in Q. ilex than in P. latifolia, but leaf density was higher in the latter species. Drought reduced the leaf thickness and the LMA of both species ca. 2.5 %. Drought also increased leaf shedding up to ca. 20 % in Phillyrea latifolia and decreased it up to ca. 20 % in Q. ilex. In the later species, Sn/Sn-1 decreased by 32 %, Ln/Sn-1 by 41 %, percentage of shoots developed new ones by 26 %, and leaf area by 17 %. Thus the decrease of leaf number and area was stronger in the less drought-resistant Q. ilex, which, under increasingly drier conditions, might lose its current competitive advantage in these Mediterranean holm oak forests.

AB Predation risk influences prey use of space. However, little is known about how predation risk influences breeding habitat selection and the fitness consequences of these decisions. The nest sites of central-place foraging predators may spatially anchor predation risk in the landscape. We explored how the spatial dispersion of avian predator nests influenced prey territory location and fitness related measures. We placed 249 nest boxes for migrant pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca, at distances between 10 and 630 in, around seven different sparrowhawk nests Accipiter nisus. After closely monitoring flycatcher nests we found that flycatcher arrival dates, nest box occupation rates and clutch size showed a unimodal relationship with distance from sparrowhawk nests. This relationship suggested an optimal territory location at intermediate distances between 330 and 430 in from sparrowhawk nests. Furthermore, pied flycatcher nestling quantity and quality increased linearly with distance from sparrowhawk nests. These fitness related measures were between 4 and 26% larger in flycatcher nestlings raised far from, relative to those raised nearby, sparrowhawk nests. Our results suggest that breeding sparrowhawk affected both flycatcher habitat selection and reproductive Success. We propose that nesting predators create predictable spatial variation in predation risk for both adult prey and possibly their nests, to which prey individuals are able to adaptively respond. Recognising predictable spatial variation in perceived predation risk may be fundamental for a proper understanding of predator-prey interactions and indeed prey species interactions.

AB The family Brassicaceae is well known for its large variation in chromosome numbers, common occurrence of polyploids and many reports of interspecific gene flow. The present review summarizes studies from the past decades on polyploidization and hybridization events, recognizing them as important evolutionary forces in the family. Attention is drawn to the issue of the reconstruction of reticulated pattern of evolution resulting from allopolyploid and homoploid hybrid speciation. The research of various authors on several Brassicaceae genera is presented and discussed in the context of our current understanding of polyploid and hybrid evolution. Model species, Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica taxa, are referred to only marginally, major focus is on a comprehensive survey of studies on about a dozen best explored non-model genera (e.g. Cardamine, Draba, Rorippa, Thlaspi). The increasing amount of genetic and genomic resources available for Brassicaceae model species provides excellent opportunities for comparative genetic and genomic studies. Future research directions and challenges are thus outlined, in order to obtain more detailed insights into the evolution of polyploid and hybrid genomes.

AB The swordlike exaggerated caudal fin extensions of male swordtails are conspicuous traits that are selected for through female choice. Swords are one of only few examples where the hypothesis of a pre-existing bias is believed to apply for the evolution of a male trait. Previous laboratory experiments demonstrated that females prefer males with longer swords and even females from some swordless species show an affiliation for males of sworded species. Earlier phylogenetic studies based on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA placed the sworded southern swordtail Xiphophorus clemenciae with swordless platies, contradicting its morphology-based evolutionary affinities. The analyses of new nuclear DNA markers now recover its traditional phylogenetic placement with other southern swordtails, suggesting that this species was formed by an ancient hybridization event. We propose that sexual selection through female choice was the likely process of hybrid speciation, by mating of platy females with males of an ancestral swordtail lineage. In artificial crosses of descendent species from the two potential ancestral lineages of X. clemenciae the hybrid and backcross males have swords of intermediate lengths. Additionally, mate choice experiments demonstrate that hybrid females prefer sworded males. These experimental lines of evidence make hybridization through xeno-specific sexual selection by female choice the likely mechanism of speciation.

AB Tree establishment is a potentially important factor affecting tree populations in alpine-treeline ecotones. Patterns of seedling establishment of Abies lasiocarpa, Punts albicaulis, and Picea engelmannii were evaluated relative to neighbouring trees and herbs over two years and three treelines of the Rocky Mountains, USA. The greatest mortality rates were observed in seedlings that had just emerged from seed and were in their first year of growth and in seedlings that had the least amount of cover provided by trees or other landscape features, that block exposure to the sky. Although herb cover promoted survivorship in microsites that were not near trees, no seedlings were detected at or above the upper limit of the treeline ecotone. Microsite tree cover was greatest for A. lasiocarpa and least for P albicaulis seedlings, which matches predictions based on their relative photosynthetic tolerances to the bright sunlight and frequent frost that occur in exposed microsites. Interspecific differences in seedling requirements for neighbouring plant cover likely contribute to the apparent coexistence and possible interdependency of these conifers along a continuum of colonization and succession within treelines.

AB We carried out a two-part investigation that revealed habitat differences in marine invertebrate invasions. First, we compared invasion levels of hard vs soft substrata in Elkhorn Slough, an estuary in Central California, by comparing abundance and richness of native vs exotic species in quantitative samples from each habitat type. Our results revealed that the hard substrata were much more heavily invaded than the soft substrata. Nearly all the hard substrata in Elkhorn Slough, as in most estuaries along the Pacific coast of North America, are artificial (jetties, rip-rap, docks). Some exotic species may by chance be better adapted to this novel habitat type than are natives. Two major vectors responsible for marine introductions, oyster culturing and ship-hull fouling, are also more likely to transport species associated with hard vs soft substrata. Secondly, we compared estuarine and open coast invasion rates. We examined species richness in Elkhorn Slough and adjacent rocky intertidal habitats along the Central California coast. The absolute number of exotic species in the estuary was an order of magnitude higher than along the open coast (58 vs 8 species), as was the percentage of the invertebrate fauna that was exotic (11% vs 1%). Estuaries on this coast are geologically young, heavily altered by humans, and subject to numerous transport vectors bringing invasive propagules: all these factors may explain why they are strikingly more invaded than the open coast. The finding that the more species rich habitat - the open coast - is less invaded is in contrast to many terrestrial examples, where native and exotic species richness appear to be positively correlated at a broad geographic scale.

AB To study the possible impact of alien introgression on a recipient plant genome, we examined >6000 unbiased genomic loci of three stable rice recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from intergeneric hybridization between rice (cv. Matsumae) and a wild relative (Zizania latifolia Griseb.) followed by successive selfing. Results from amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis showed that, whereas the introgressed Zizania DNA comprised <0.1 % of the genome content in the RILs, extensive and genome-wide de novo variations occurred in up to 30 % of the analyzed loci for all three lines studied. The AFLP-detected changes were validated by DNA gel-blot hybridization and/or sequence analysis of genomic loci corresponding to a subset of the differentiating AFLP fragments. A BLAST analysis revealed that the genomic variations occurred in diverse sequences, including protein-coding genes, transposable elements, and sequences of unknown functions. Pairwise sequence comparison of selected loci between a RIL and its rice parent showed that the variations represented either base substitutions or small insertion/deletions. Genome variations were detected in all 12 rice chromosomes, although their distribution was uneven both among and within chromosomes. Taken together, our results imply that even cryptic alien introgression can be highly mutagenic to a recipient plant genome.

AB Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a highly flexible technique that allows the estimation of parameters under demographic models that are too complex to be handled by full-likelihood methods. We assess the utility of this method to estimate the parameters of range expansion in a two-dimensional stepping-stone model, using samples from either a single deme or multiple demes. A minor modification to the ABC procedure is introduced, which leads to an improvement in the accuracy of estimation. The method is then used to estimate the expansion time and migration rates for five natural common vole populations in Switzerland typed for a sex-linked marker and a nuclear marker. Estimates based on both markers suggest that expansion occurred < 10,000 years ago, after the most recent glaciation, and that migration rates are strongly male biased.

AB Pollinators often sequentially visit one flower type while bypassing other equally rewarding flower types in the process. Many explanations for this pattern of flower choice in pollinators, known as flower constancy, have been proposed; yet, a sufficient answer to the question of why pollinators are constant still remains elusive. We tested the hypothesis that flower constancy in pollinators is related to the number of traits distinguishing available flowers by measuring the floral selectivity (both constancy and preference) of bumblebees, Bombus impatiens, when artificial flower types differed in either colour only (variation in a single trait) or colour and other floral traits (variation in multiple traits). As expected, bees showed increased degrees of selectivity (constancy and preference) when available flower types differed in colour and other floral traits compared with when available flower types differed in colour only. In addition, bee foraging rates (measured in flowers visited per min) varied inversely with the number of variable floral traits added to colour but not with the number of colours. Together, these results are consistent with the idea that the mechanism underlying flower constancy in bumblebees is a limitation on their ability to effectively search for and/or remember multiple combinations of floral traits at the same time. We discuss the roles of floral-trait variation, flower constancy and pollinator cognitive limitations in the coevolution of flowering plants and their animal pollinators.

AB Cyperaceae (sedges) are an important component of many ecosystems. To understand better their regeneration, we examined seed ecology, including dispersal, seed characteristics, and germination behavior that relate to seed bank development and persistence. We also evaluated sedge seed banks from 104 studies, representing a wide array of habitats. Sedge seed bank development and persistence were associated with germination and dormancy traits, namely: dormancy level, seasonal dormancy patterns, and requirement for light, alternating temperatures, and aerobic conditions. Interplay of traits appears to have resulted in low-risk germination strategies adapted to exploit infrequent occurrence of gaps and facilitate formation of persistent seed banks. A variety of dispersal modes and morphological adaptations occurred, but many species had no apparent specialized structures. The main dispersal vectors were water and then animals. About 216 species, in 21 genera, were recorded in the seed bank survey. High densities (> 50,000 m(-2)) occurred occasionally in wet habitats, but generally values were low (< 500 m(- 2) in 70% of entries). Species richness was also generally low (mean 4.8 species study'), but ranged -from 10 to 33 species in certain wetlands. Our studies showed varied reproductive strategies within habitats, persistence, and ability of many species to colonize disturbed habitats. Overall, seed banks tended to be persistent (> 1 year). Maximum longevity ranged between 10 and 295 years, but for certain species viability was lost in < 3 years. Seeds of many sedges occurred in deeper soil layers to depths > 1 m. Seed production, low in rhizomatous species, ranged between 0 and 345,000 seeds m(-2) year(-1). Amphicarpy or pseudo-viviparous plantlets occurred in limited numbers of species. The relation between' seed production, seed rain, and seed bank is largely obscure and awaits further investigation. For successful restoration and species conservation projects, seed banks (or a source of seeds) are necessary, combined with suitable germination and establishment conditions. Future seed bank studies are considered. (c) 2005 Rubel Foundation, ETH Ziirich. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Human introduction of nonindigenous species constitutes a serious threat to many ecosystems, particularly lakes. Recent attempts to predict invasions have focused on the supply of propagules of nonindigenous species to recipient ecosystems from source populations. Here we develop a spatially explicit "gravity" model to test this concept for Bythotrephes longimanus, a crustacean waterflea from Eurasia that is rapidly invading lakes in Ontario, Canada. The gravity model predicted spread of Bythotrephes based upon seven identified risk factors (e.g., use of contaminated fishing or boat anchor line) that may allow dispersal of either live individuals or their resting eggs from invaded to noninvaded lakes, as well as based on the spatial arrangement of invaded and noninvaded lakes in Ontario. Discriminant analysis of lake gravity scores successfully identified invasion status for 74% of 170 inland lakes. A retrospective analysis of 31 invaded lakes revealed that the order in which lakes were invaded was directly related to the magnitude of vector inflows from invaded sources. Analysis of the dominant vector inflow to each invaded lake revealed a "stepping stone" pattern in which at least five lakes were sequentially invaded from the source population in Lake Huron. One invaded lake (Muskoka) apparently served as an invasion "hub," resulting in up to 18 additional direct and 17 indirect invasions. Species spread occurred via a combination of dominant, local diffusion (median distance 12.5 km) and rare, long-distance (>100 km) dispersal. Eleven of 131 lakes that were not invaded in 2000 were reported invaded in 2001. Gravity scores of these lakes were significantly higher than those of other noninvaded systems, indicating that susceptibility to invasion can be related to the magnitude of vector inflows. A GIS model based on gravity scores indicated that distribution of Bythotrephes is expected to expand to eastern and northwestern Ontario, although most new invasions are expected to occur in the central region of the province. Our results indicate that quantitative analysis of human dispersal vectors provides a robust starting point with which to assess vulnerability of discrete ecosystems to invasion. Management efforts focused on reducing the number and magnitude of human-mediated dispersal vectors may reduce the rate of invasion of new ecosystems.

AB Ten functional traits of fish species were related to habitat, diet or food acquisition, to propose a classification of 21 lagoon Fishes into 10 functional groups. The selection of traits was based on their functional interest and the ease of measurement. Some groups were taxonomically related containing species belonging to the same genus, e.g. Syngnathus, Atherina or Pomcaochistus. Species with a flat body shape constituted another group and three species (Anguilla anguilla, Gambusia affinis and Callionymus pusillus) formed individual groups. These results could be used to constitute functional units and to simplify such complex ecosystems and their interactions. (C) 2004 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

AB Analysis of a multi-species network of western Siberian ecotone sites revealed pulses of tree invasion into genuine treeless tundra environments in the 1940s and 1950s and after the early 1970s. In addition, increases in radial stem growth synchronous to the late 20th century treeline change are observed. Both treeline changes and growth increases correspond with decadal-scale periods of temperature that are warmer than in any other period since observations started, suggesting - even if indirect - the sensitivity of large-scale treeline changes to this climatic forcing. The mid 20th century recruitment period reported here for the western Siberian network is compared with local findings from Europe and North America suggesting a circumpolar trend perhaps related to climate warming patterns. For western Siberia, the presence of relict stumps, nevertheless, indicates that this present colonization is reoccupying sites that had tree cover earlier in the last millennium.

AB To investigate how anthropogenic activity might affect large carnivores, We studied the behaviour Of spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) during two time periods. From 1996 to 1998, we documented the ecological correlates of space utilization patterns exhibited by adult female hyenas defending a territory at the edge of a wildlife reserve in Kenya. Hyenas preferred areas near dense vegetation but appeared to avoid areas containing the greatest abundance of prey, perhaps because these were also the areas of most intensive livestock grazing. We then compared hyena behaviour observed in 1996-98 with that observed several years earlier and found many differences. Female hyenas in 1996-98 were found farther from dens, but closer to dense vegetation and to the edges of their territory, than in 1988-90. Recent females also had larger home ranges, travelled farther between consecutive sightings, and were more nocturnal than in 1988-90. Finally, hyenas occurred in smaller groups in 1996-98 than in 1988-90. We also found several changes in hyena demography between periods. We next attempted to explain differences observed between time periods by testing predictions of hypotheses invoking prey abundance, climate, interactions with lions, tourism and livestock grazing. Our data were consistent with the hypothesis that increased reliance on the reserve for livestock grazing was responsible for observed changes. That behavioural changes were not associated with decreased hyena population density suggests the behavioural plasticity typical of this species may protect it from extinction.

AB Aim Human land use, especially urbanization, might homogenize the world's biota. The objective of this study is to find out if urbanization homogenizes wintering bird communities, and if habitat type affects the spatial variation of urban bird communities across spatial scales.
   Location We compared the quantitative similarity of winter bird communities between town centres, apartment block areas and single-family house areas across regional and local scales in five towns in northern Finland.
   Methods The wintering birds were surveyed using a single-visit study plot (30 ha) method in January and February 2001. The validity of single-visit and single-year data was confirmed by using data from several-visit surveys and multi-year data set. The level of urbanization was measured according to the number of inhabitants and general structure of the habitat.
   Results Temporal variability in species richness and total number of individuals was low, both between winters and within winter. Bird community similarity between different habitat types within a single town was about the same as that in similar habitats in different towns. At the regional scale, bird community similarity between town centres (30%) was lower than between areas of apartment blocks (54%) or between areas of single-family houses (54%). We detected a threshold point between towns of 35,000 and 105,000 inhabitants and between town sizes of 5.0-8.5 km in diameter where human impact causes marked changes in bird community structure. At the local scale, bird community similarity level between apartment block areas (49%) and single-family house areas (62%) were about the same. Passer domesticus, Parus major and Pica pica dominated the bird communities in residential areas. Different habitat factors affected bird species abundances on the local and regional scales.
   Conclusions Urbanization cannot be seen as a process that monotonically increases the similarity of bird communities. Our results indicate that the similarity between urban bird communities is dependent on the size of the town, location of the study site within the town and especially the local habitat structure. Because different habitat factors affected bird species abundances, it is difficult to extrapolate bird-habitat relationships derived from one scale to other scales. In wintertime, single-family house areas are important biodiversity hotspots in cities. Therefore, it is especially important to understand the factors affecting the occurrence of birds in the single-family house area in order to maintain or even increase diversity on winter birds in other urban habitats.

AB Delimitation of vegetation units in phytosociology is traditionally based on expert knowledge. Applications of expert-based classifications are often inconsistent because criteria for assigning releves to vegetation units are seldom given explicitly. Still. there is, e.g. in nature conservation, an increasing need for a consistent application of vegetation classification using computer expert systems for unit identification.
   We propose a procedure for formalized reproduction of an expert-based vegetation classification, which is applicable to large phytosociological data sets. This procedure combines Bruelheide's Cocktail method with a similarity-based assigninent of releves to constancy columns of a vegetation table. As a test of this method we attempt to reproduce the expert-based phytosociological classification of subalpine tall-forb vegetation of the Czech Republic which has been made by combination of expert judgement and stepwise numerical classification of 718 releves by TWINSPAN. Applying the Cocktail method to a geographically stratified data set of 21794 releves of all Czech vegetation types, we defined groups of species with the statistical tendency of joint occurrences in vegetation. Combinations of 12 of these species groups by logical operators AND. OR and AND NOT yielded formal definitions of 14 of 16 associations which had been accepted in the expert-based classification. Application of these formal definitions to the original data set of 718 releves resulted in an assignment of 376 releves to the associations. This assignment agreed well with the original expert-based classification. Releves that remained unassigned because they had not met the requirements of any of the formal definitions, were subsequently assigned to the associations by calculating similarity to releve groups that had already been assigned to the associations. A new index, based on frequency and fidelity, was proposed for calculating similarity. The agreement with the expert-based classification achieved by the formal definitions was still improved after applying the similarity-based assignment. Results indicate that the expert-based classification can be successfully formalized and converted into a computer expert system.

AB Mosaic hybrid zones arise when ecologically differentiated taxa hybridize across a network of habitat patches. Frequent interbreeding across a small-scale patchwork can erode species differences that might have been preserved in a clinal hybrid zone. In particular, the rapid breakdown of neutral divergence sets an upper limit to the time for which differences at marker loci can persist. We present here a case study of a mosaic hybrid zone between the fire-bellied toads Bombina bombina and B. variegata (Anura: Discoglossidae) near Apahida in Romania. In our 20 X 20 km study area, we detected no evidence of a clinal transition but found a strong association between aquatic habitat and mean allele frequencies at four molecular markers. In particular, pure populations of B. bombina in ponds appear to cause massive introgression into the surrounding B. variegata gene pool found in temporary aquatic sites. Nevertheless, the genetic structure of these hybrid populations was remarkably similar to those of a previously studied transect near Pescenica (Croatia), which had both clinal and mosaic features: estimates of heterozygote deficit and linkage disequilibrium in each country are similar. In Apahida, the observed strong linkage disequilibria should stem from an imperfect habitat preference that guides most (but not all) adults into the habitats to which they are adapted. In the absence of a clinal structure, the inferred migration rate between habitats implies that associations between selected loci and neutral markers should break down rapidly. Although plausible selection strengths can maintain differentiation at those loci adapting the toads to either permanent or temporary breeding sites, the divergence at neutral markers must be transient. The hybrid zone may be approaching a state in which the gene pools are homogenized at all but the selected loci, not dissimilar from an early stage of sympatric divergence.

AB Aim To (1) describe termite functional diversity patterns across five tropical regions using local species richness sampling of standardized areas of habitat; (2) assess the relative importance of environmental factors operating at different spatial and temporal scales in influencing variation in species representation within feeding groups and functional taxonomic groups across the tropics; (3) achieve a synthesis to explain the observed patterns of convergence and divergence in termite functional diversity that draws on termite ecological and biogeographical evidence to-date, as well as the latest evidence for the evolutionary and distributional history of tropical rain forests.
   Location Pantropical.
   Methods A pantropical termite species richness data set was obtained through sampling of eighty-seven standardized local termite diversity transects from twenty-nine locations across five tropical regions. Local-scale, intermediate-scale and large-scale environmental data were collected for each transect. Standardized termite assemblage and environmental data were analysed at the levels of whole assemblages and feeding groups (using components of variance analysis) and at the level of functional taxonomic groups (using correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis).
   Results Overall species richness of local assemblages showed a greater component of variation attributable to local habitat disturbance level than to region. However, an analysis accounting for species richness across termite feeding groups indicated a much larger component of variation attributable to region. Mean local assemblage body size also showed the greater overall significance of region compared with habitat type in influencing variation. Ordination of functional taxonomic group data revealed a primary gradient of variation corresponding to rank order of species richness within sites and to mean local species richness within regions. The latter was in the order: Africa > south America > south-east Asia > Madagascar > Australia. This primary gradient of species richness decrease can be explained by a decrease in species richness of less dispersive functional taxonomic groups feeding on more humified food substrates such as soil. Hence, the transects from more depauperate sites/regions were dominated by more dispersive functional taxonomic groups feeding on less humified food substrates such as dead wood. Direct gradient analysis indicated that 'region' and other large-scale factors were the most important in explaining patterns of local termite functional diversity followed by intermediate-scale geographical and site variables and, finally, local-scale ecological variables.
   Synthesis and main conclusions Within regions, centres of termite functional diversity lie in lowland equatorial closed canopy tropical forests. Soil feeding termite evolution further down food substrate humification gradients is therefore more likely to have depended on the long-term presence of this habitat. Known ecological and energetic constraints upon contemporary soil feeders lend support for this hypothesis. We propose further that the anomalous distribution of termite soil feeder species richness is partly explained by their generally very poor dispersal abilities across oceans. Evolution, radiation and dispersal of soil feeder diversity appears to have been largely restricted to what are now the African and south American regions. The inter-regional differences in contemporary local patterns of termite species richness revealed by the global data set point to the possibility of large differences in consequent ecosystem processes in apparently similar habitats on different continents.

AB High rainfall associated with El Nino events significantly increases runoff and stream discharge in southern Brazil. High freshwater discharge changes salinity, temperature, and water circulation patterns that can affect the fish estuarine assemblage. Using long-term data obtained from standardized surveys, we analyzed fish assemblage structure and dynamics in shallow waters of the Patos Laeoon estuary in southern Brazil before, during, and after the 1997-1998 El Nino event. Overall, the relative abundance of all the fish groups in the estuary was about five times lower during the El Nino than before and after. Freshwater vagrants were the only group with greater abundance during El Nino. Fish species richness was hi her in the estuary during the El Nino event, 9 when many freshwater species expanded their ranges into the Patos Lagoon estuary, than before or after the El Nino. El Nino-induced assemblage changes were not highly persistent, and the estuarine fish assemblage returned to its pre-El Nino state within Is months after the El Nino period. Densities of many marine and estuarine fishes increased to pre-El Nino levels within 3-6 months of the end of the El Nino period. We suggested that the rapid recovery of fish estuarine populations after the 1997-1998 El Nino may have been caused by one or some combination of. (a) enhanced productivity stimulated by nutrients contained in newly deposited alluvial sediments, and (b) enhanced larvae transport in the large saltwater intrusion that followed the El Nino event. Clearly, fish population dynamics and assemblage structure of the Patos Lagoon estuary can neither be interpreted nor predicted on a long-term basis without explicit consideration of El Nino Southern Oscillation patterns.

AB Phytosociology is a subdiscipline of plant ecology that describes the co-occurrence of plant species in communities. Gradient analysis and classification are its complementary tools. Various peculiarities and anachronisms of Central European phytosociology conceal its similarity with Anglo-American approaches. Phytosociology deserves to be updated as a part of modem vegetation science that can build on a vast heritage of high-quality data and the tools to store and analyse them in ways that go beyond syntaxonomy. By providing a context to more specialized pure and applied research, it has a crucial role to play in understanding community structure, ecosystem functioning and biological evolution.

AB Basic information on where nonnative plant species have successfully invaded is lacking. We assessed the vulnerability of 22 vegetation types (25 sets of four plots in nine study areas) to nonnative plant invasions in the north-central United States. In general, habitats with high native species richness were more heavily invaded than species-poor habitats, low-elevation areas were more invaded than high-elevation areas, and riparian zones were more invaded than nearby upland sites. For the 100 1000-m(2) plots (across all vegetation types), 50% of the variation in nonnative species richness was explained by longitude, latitude, native plant species richness, soil total percentage nitrogen, and mean maximum July temperature (n = 100 plots; P < 0.001). At the vegetation-type scale (n = 25 sets of four 1000-m(2) plots/ type), 64% of the variation in nonnative species richness was explained by native plant species richness, elevation, and October to June precipitation (P < 0,001). The foliar cover of nonnative species (log) was strongly positively correlated with the nonnative species richness at the plot scale (r = 0.77, P < 0.001) and vegetation-type scale (r = 0.83, P < 0.001). We concluded that, at the vegetation-type and regional scales in the north-central United States, (1) vegetation types rich in native species are often highly vulnerable to invasion by nonnative plant species; (2) where several nonnative species become established, nonnative species cover can substantially increase; (3) the attributes that maintain high native plant species richness (high light, water, nitrogen, and temperatures) also help maintain nonnative plant species richness; and (4) more care must be taken to preserve native species diversity in highly vulnerable habitats.

AB In the 1950s and 1960s, the first data sets were assembled to examine whether or not there was a latitudinal gradient of species richness in the sea. These data comprised very few species and were from very small areas. However, recent data from large species lists covering broad geographical ranges suggest strongly that there is a gradient of increasing species richness from the Arctic to the tropics. However, the Southern Ocean has high species richness and in the southern hemisphere there is no clear evidence of a cline of increasing richness from pole to tropic. The great richness of the Southern Ocean compared with the Arctic is probably due to its great age, the fact that it covers a much larger area and that it has higher structural heterogeneity formed by living organisms. The importance of area as a determinant of species richness needs to be studied in more detail since most studies have been confined to small areas. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the species:area relationship and these are discussed. An alternative explanation for the latitudinal cline in the northern hemisphere is the energy-input hypothesis. but again this has not been adequately tested. Two studies on the relationship between local and regional species richness show a significant positive correlation. These findings suggest that local assemblages are not tightly organised and saturated with species but are open to recruitment from the regional species pool. Whether or not such a relationship holds in Antarctica is unknown. It is concluded that further studies of the Southern Ocean are likely to provide new findings fundamental to the "new" discipline of macroecology, which examines patterns and processes at the geographic scale.

AB The adjustment of the parameters in mechanistic crop models to field data, using an automatic procedure, is essential to ensure efficient and objective use of measured data. However, it is in general numerically impossible, and in any case undoubtedly unwise, to adjust all the model parameters to the measured data. There is currently no widely accepted solution to this problem. This paper proposes a new approach to parameter adjustment, and applies it to a model of corn growth and development. One begins by defining a criterion of model goodness-of-fit, which should be adapted to the goal of the modeling exercise, and a corresponding criterion of model prediction error. For the latter we propose a cross validation version of the goodness-of-fit criterion. In Step 1 of the algorithm, one orders the parameters according to how much each improves the goodness-of-fit of the model. In the second step, the number of parameters actually adjusted is chosen to minimize the prediction error criterion. This approach has the advantage of explicitly using prediction quality as a criterion. As a by-product, it leads to adjusting relatively few parameters tin our example, 3 out of the 26 potentially adjustable parameters), which considerably reduces the numerical problems. The procedure is quite straightforward to apply, although it does require substantial computing, time.

AB Chironomid-temperature inference models based on North American, European and combined surface sediment training sets were compared to assess the overall reliability of their predictions. Between 67 and 76% of the major chironomid taxa in each data set showed a unimodal response to July temperature, whereas between 5 and 22% of the common taxa showed a sigmoidal response. July temperature optima were highly correlated among the training sets, but the correlations for other taxon parameters such as tolerances and weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) and partial least squares (PLS) regression coefficients were much weaker. PLS, weighted averaging, WA-PLS, and the Modern Analogue Technique, all provided useful and reliable temperature inferences. Although jack-knifed error statistics suggested that two-component WA-PLS models had the highest predictive power, intercontinental tests suggested that other inference models performed better. The various models were able to provide good July temperature inferences, even where neither good nor close modern analogues for the fossil chironomid assemblages existed. When the models were applied to fossil Lateglacial assemblages from North America and Europe, the inferred rates and magnitude of July temperature changes varied among models. All models, however, revealed similar patterns of Lateglacial temperature change. Depending on the model used, the inferred Younger Dryas July temperature decrease ranged between 2.5 and 6 degrees C.

AB We examine global patterns of benthic macroinvertebrate biomass and its distribution among functional feeding guilds in marine intertidal communities. Variation in ash-free dry biomass was related to physical variables (mean annual air and water temperatures, sediment grain size, intertidal slope, tide range and type, wave height and exposure) by least-squares regression analysis of data for 36 rocky shores and 245 sedimentary shores. Linear combinations of physical variables explain up to 44% of the variance in total biomass on sedimentary shores and 40% of the variance in the biomass on rocky shores. Grain size and wave exposure are the best single predictors of total biomass for sedimentary shores and rocky shores, respectively. Biomass estimates peak in temperate regions and are an order of magnitude higher on rocky shores than on sedimentary shores. In fact, macroinvertebrate biomass on temperate rocky shores attains levels 10 to 100 times higher than those documented for other benthic marine environments. Suspension feeders tend to dominate temperate intertidal communities (they typically comprise > 30 to 60% of the macroinvertebrate biomass), reflecting the importance of benthic-pelagic coupling in these ecosystems. Contrary to consumer stress models for rocky shores, there is no compelling evidence for biomass limitation of grazers and carnivores at high wave exposure.

AB Heterogeneous patterns of species diversity are rarely linked to the processes that maintain them on spatial scales larger than tens of meters. In this study, subtidal landscapes of a New Zealand fjord were used to study the spatial patterns of epifaunal invertebrate species diversity and to test hypotheses about the mechanisms maintaining the patterns. Patterns of species diversity were quantified along 1000-m(2) sections of vertical rock wall habitat at three sites separated by 3-6 km of horizontal distance during April-August 1993. Species diversity data from random 0.25-m(2) quadrats at four depth strata (3, 5, 10, and 18 m) within a 20 x 50 m area were contoured to reveal spatial patterns at each site. General patterns consisted of localized patches of 300-660 m(2) of high diversity (i.e., H' [Shannon-Weiner diversity index] of 2.0-3.2/0.25 m(2) and S [species richness] of 28-32 species/0.25 m(2)) centered at 10 m depth. High-diversity patches, dominated by bryozoans, sponges, and ascidians, were bounded vertically by low-diversity mussel assemblages and horizontally by low-diversity assemblages dominated by encrusting calcareous algae with areas of bare rock. Vertical patterns of diversity were attributed to physical stress from a low-salinity surface layer impinging on shallow areas (e.g., 0-5 m depth) of the landscapes, while horizontal patterns could be partly attributed to large-scale landslides and severe grazing by sea urchins.
   The hypothesis that the areas of high diversity could be maintained by larval recruitment was tested by deploying an array of recruitment tiles with predator exclusion treatments. Experiments were conducted on the same spatial scale as the documented patterns of diversity (e.g., at 3, 5, 10, and 18 m depth), with tiles placed in and out of the high-diversity patches. Recruitment densities of calcareous polychaetes, bryozoans, and hydroids showed significant depth and habitat effects (i.e., in vs. out of the high-diversity areas) after 3 mo, but no significant effects of predator exclusion treatment. A positive linear relationship between species diversity and number of recruit species in adjacent areas of wall explained 27-57% of the variance. These data also suggested that the size of the high-diversity patches and location within the fjord are important factors affecting this relationship.
   We suggest that the localized patches of high diversity over hundreds of meters of continuous habitat can be maintained on temporal scales of months either by spatially limited recruitment of short-lived larvae from the patches or by recruitment near established conspecifics. Additionally, there may be a feedback mechanism involving the interaction of increased biogenic structure provided by the high-diversity patches enhancing recruitment. This feedback would then serve to maintain localized areas of high diversity within the extensive areas of low diversity on scales of hundreds to thousands of meters.

AB 1. Using world-wide data on the reproductive biology of 131 species (in eight orders) of aquatic insects, we used multivariate analyses to examine: (i) relationships among reproductive traits determining life cycle, fecundity, morphology, behaviour and physiology; (ii) relationships among traits determining spatial and temporal habitat characteristics at different scales; and (iii) the relationship between reproductive and habitat-use traits. This provided a test of predictions of the habitat templet concept on trends of species traits along gradients of habitat heterogeneity.
   2. The major trends observed in the relationships among reproductive traits were that larger females had larger eggs, which were more vulnerable to perturbations such as droughts and often laid in cocoons. In addition, they laid the eggs in larger numbers of smaller clutches than smaller females. Other traits (e.g. egg number or incubation time) did not show clear trends.
   3. Females that deposited eggs at sites of low local temporal heterogeneity (within plants) used, at the same time, gross habitats of high temporal heterogeneity (temporary waters). In contrast, traits in habitat use hardly differed on well-known gradients of temporal heterogeneity along running waters (from source to estuary). The number of habitat units used by ovipositing females generally increased with the spatial scale considered, most species oviposited in a single small habitat unit but in several gross habitats.
   4. A significant (P < 0.01) relationship between traits in reproduction and habitat use demonstrated that habitat acted as a templet for reproductive strategies. This relationship was dominated by larger females having larger, unattached eggs which were more vulnerable to droughts and were oviposited in temporally more stable small-scale habitats (within wood or macrophytes, or within cocoons spun by the female) but more unstable large-scale habitats (primarily temporary waters). Thus, only on the small habitat scale did some of our observations correspond to the predictions of the habitat templet concept (e.g. larger size or higher vulnerability in more stable habitats). However, many species had traits in reproduction that did not show trends as predicted by the concept.
   5. This and other recent studies of the relationships between traits of freshwater organisms and the heterogeneity of their habitats have shown that habitat acts as a templet for species life history traits. However, many of the details observed in these studies did not correspond to predictions of the templet concept because of trade-offs among the traits and scale problems in the description of habitat heterogeneity. Therefore, future studies should focus on groups of organisms which are as similar as possible in the trade-offs among their species traits and on the potential relationships of habitat heterogeneity across multiple scales.

AB Butterfly assemblages within lowland monsoon forest were compared at four sites on Sumba, Indonesia that differed in terms of protection and exhibited associated differences in levels of human disturbance. A numerical method employing principal components analysis was devised for describing forest structure at each site. The first principal component (PRIN1) grouped attributes tending towards dense forest with closely-spaced trees, a closed canopy and a poorly developed held layer, with trees that tended to be large with the point of inversion in the upper half of the trunk. The highest values for PRIN1 were recorded within protected forest, and PRIN1 values were considered to be a useful index of forest disturbance at each site. Species diversity of butterflies was highest in unprotected secondary forest, but was not affected by lower levels of disturbance. Those species occurring at highest density in secondary forest generally had wide geographical distributions, whereas those species occurring at highest density in undisturbed primary forest had restricted ranges of distribution, in most cases with a separate subspecies on Sumba. Overall, an index of biogeographical distinctiveness decreased with increasing disturbance, and this supports the hypothesis that the most characteristic species of undisturbed climax forest have the smallest geographical ranges of distribution. Species abundance data for butterflies fitted a log-normal distribution at all but the most disturbed site. These results indicate that the pattern of proportional abundance of tropical butterfly species may be used as an 'instantaneous' indicator of forest disturbance, and that changes in the structure of tropical forests in S.E. Asia resulting from human disturbance, even within partially-protected forest, may result in the presence of butterfly assemblages of higher species diversity but of lower biogeographical distinctiveness, and therefore of lower value in terms of the conservation of global biodiversity.

AB Self-renewal is generally thought to play a major role in the maintenance of the T-cell repertoire. Here we develop a set of mathematical models for T-cell activation by peptides on antigen presenting cells (APCs). We show that competition between T cells is inherent to the processes involved in T cells binding APCs. We prove that for each dominant peptide only one T-cell clone can ultimately survive the competition. This is analogous to a classical result from theoretical ecology known as the principle of ''competitive exclusion''. These findings allow for three main results. First, competitive exclusion during an immune response to antigen implies that the clone(s) with the highest affinity for the dominant peptide(s) will outcompete all others. This allows for a form of ''affinity selection''. Second, the competition for binding antigen gives rise to regulation of T-cell numbers within a single done. This allows for a regulated form of T-cell memory when T cells are continuously activated by a persisting antigen. Third, competitive exclusion implies that for each peptide only one T-cell specificity can be maintained in the repertoire. If the T-cell repertoire is largely maintained owing to cross-reactivities with various antigens, competitive exclusion means that the diversity of the T-cell repertoire is limited by the number of antigens stimulating the system. If the cross-reactivities were to involve activation by self antigens this would confirm an earlier result suggesting that the T-cell repertoire is diverse owing to the diversity of the self environment.

AB Billions of hectares of natural ecosystems have been degraded through human actions. The global community has agreed on targets to halt and reverse these declines, and the restoration sector faces the important but arduous task of implementing programmes to meet these objectives. Existing and emerging genomics tools offer the potential to improve the odds of achieving these targets. These tools include population genomics that can improve seed sourcing, meta-omics that can improve assessment and monitoring of restoration outcomes, and genome editing that can generate novel genotypes for restoring challenging environments. We identify barriers to adopting these tools in a restoration context and emphasize that regulatory and ethical frameworks are required to guide their use.

AB Biochar application to croplands has been proposed as a potential strategy to decrease losses of soil-reactive nitrogen (N) to the air and water. However, the extent and spatial variability of biochar function at the global level are still unclear. Using Random Forest regression modelling of machine learning based on data compiled from the literature, we mapped the impacts of different biochar types (derived from wood, straw, or manure), and their interactions with biochar application rates, soil properties, and environmental factors, on soil N losses (NH3 volatilization, N2O emissions, and N leaching) and crop productivity. The results show that a suitable distribution of biochar across global croplands (i.e., one application of <40 t ha(-1) wood biochar for poorly buffered soils, such as those characterized by soil pH<5, organic carbon<1%, or clay>30%; and one application of <80 t ha(-1) wood biochar, <40 t ha(-1) straw biochar, or <10 t ha(-1) manure biochar for other soils) could achieve an increase in global crop yields by 222-766 Tg yr(-1) (4%-16% increase), a mitigation of cropland N2O emissions by 0.19-0.88 Tg N yr(-1) (6%-30% decrease), a decline of cropland N leaching by 3.9-9.2 Tg N yr(-1) (12%-29% decrease), but also a fluctuation of cropland NH3 volatilization by -1.9-4.7 Tg N yr(-1) (-12%-31% change). The decreased sum of the three major reactive N losses amount to 1.7-9.4 Tg N yr(-1), which corresponds to 3%-14% of the global cropland total N loss. Biochar generally has a larger potential for decreasing soil N losses but with less benefits to crop production in temperate regions than in tropical regions.

AB It has been shown that the spatial configuration of a green area can strongly influence its cooling effect. However, the specific correlation has not been sufficiently studied. To systematically clarify the correlation between the spatial configuration and the cooling effect of green areas, 25 idealized scenarios are designed and simulated using the microclimate model ENVI-met. These 25 scenarios represent green areas with five different spatial configurations (integrated green area, sparse dotted green areas, dense dotted green areas, belt-shaped green areas parallel to wind direction, and belt-shaped green areas vertical to wind direction) and five vegetation types (trees with big canopies, trees with small canopies, hedges and shrubs, 50 cm grass, and 10 cm grass). The human thermal comfort of each scenario is evaluated by means of physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) using Rayman. The results reveal the influence of the fragmentation degree (quantified by the patch density and edge density), shape complexity (quantified by the land shape index), orientation of green belt, and vegetation type on the cooling effect of a green area. The spatial configuration and the vegetation type of green areas were found jointly affecting the efficiency of the green areas' cooling effect. The highest cooling effect appears at 2 pm, reaching 6.3 K in the scenario of belt-shaped green areas parallel to the wind direction and with big canopy trees. The conclusions of this paper can provide suggestions for the climate-adaptive design and planning of urban green areas in the future.

AB Though polyploidy is an important aspect of the evolutionary genetics of both plants and animals, the development of population genetic theory of polyploids has seriously lagged behind that of diploids. This is unfortunate since the analysis of polyploid genetic data-and the interpretation of the results-requires even more scrutiny than with diploid data. This is because of several polyploidy-specific complications in segregation and genotyping such as tetrasomy, double reduction, and missing dosage information. Here, we review the theoretical and statistical aspects of the population genetics of polyploids. We discuss several widely used types of inferences, including genetic diversity, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, population differentiation, genetic distance, and detecting population structure. For each, we point out how the statistical approach, expected result, and interpretation differ between different ploidy levels. We also discuss for each type of inference what biases may arise from the polyploid-specific complications and how these biases can be overcome. From our overview, it is clear that the statistical toolbox that is available for the analysis of genetic data is flexible and still expanding. Modern sequencing techniques will soon be able to overcome some of the current limitations to the analysis of polyploid data, though the techniques are lagging behind those available for diploids. Furthermore, the availability of more data may aggravate the biases that can arise, and increase the risk of false inferences. Therefore, simulations such as we used throughout this review are an important tool to verify the results of analyses of polyploid genetic data.

AB Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is the only biomedical imaging method that can noninvasively detect endogenous signals from the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the human brain. Its increasing popularity has been aided by improvements in scanner hardware and acquisition methodology, as well as by broader access to pulse sequences that can selectively detect GABA, in particular J-difference spectral editing sequences. Nevertheless, implementations of GABA-edited MRS remain diverse across research sites, making comparisons between studies challenging. This large-scale multi-vendor, multi-site study seeks to better understand the factors that impact measurement outcomes of GABA-edited MRS. An international consortium of 24 research sites was formed. Data from 272 healthy adults were acquired on scanners from the three major MRI vendors and analyzed using the Gannet processing pipeline. MRS data were acquired in the medial parietal lobe with standard GABA+ and macromolecule- (MM-) suppressed GABA editing. The coefficient of variation across the entire cohort was 12% for GABA+ measurements and 28% for MM-suppressed GABA measurements. A multilevel analysis revealed that most of the variance (72%) in the GABA+ data was accounted for by differences between participants within-site, while site-level differences accounted for comparatively more variance (20%) than vendor-level differences (8%). For MM-suppressed GABA data, the variance was distributed equally between site-(50%) and participant-level (50%) differences. The findings show that GABA+ measurements exhibit strong agreement when implemented with a standard protocol. There is, however, increased variability for MM-suppressed GABA measurements that is attributed in part to differences in site-to-site data acquisition. This study's protocol establishes a framework for future methodological standardization of GABA-edited MRS, while the results provide valuable benchmarks for the MRS community.

AB Leaf dry mass per unit leaf area (LMA) is a central trait in ecology, but its anatomical and compositional basis has been unclear. An explicit mathematical and physical framework for quantifying the cell and tissue determinants of LMA will enable tests of their influence on species, communities and ecosystems. We present an approach to explaining LMA from the numbers, dimensions and mass densities of leaf cells and tissues, which provided unprecedented explanatory power for 11 broadleaved woody angiosperm species diverse in LMA (33-262 g m(-2); R-2 = 0.94; P < 0.001). Across these diverse species, and in a larger comparison of evergreen vs. deciduous angiosperms, high LMA resulted principally from larger cell sizes, greater major vein allocation, greater numbers of mesophyll cell layers and higher cell mass densities. This explicit approach enables relating leaf anatomy and composition to a wide range of processes in physiological, evolutionary, community and macroecology.

AB Stomatal conductance directly modifies plant water relations and photosynthesis. Many environmental factors affecting the stomatal conductance have been intensively studied but temperature has been largely neglected, even though it is one of the fastest changing environmental variables and it is rising due to climate change. In this study, we describe how stomata open when the temperature increases. Stomatal conductance increased by ca 40% in a broadleaf and a coniferous species, poplar (Populus deltoides x nigra) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) when temperature was increased by 10 degrees C, from 30 degrees C to 40 degrees C at a constant vapor pressure deficit of 1 kPa. The mechanism of regulating stomatal conductance by temperature was, at least partly, independent of other known mechanisms linked to water status and carbon metabolism. Stomatal conductance increased with rising temperature despite the decrease in leaf water potential, increase in transpiration, increase in intercellular CO2 concentration and was decoupled from photosynthesis. Increase in xylem and mesophyll hydraulic conductance coming from lower water viscosity may to some degree explain temperature dependent opening of stomata. The direct stomatal response to temperature allows plants to benefit from increased evaporative cooling during the heat waves and from lower stomatal limitations to photosynthesis but they may be jeopardized by faster depletion of soil water.

AB Agent-based models (ABMs) are increasingly recognized as valuable tools in modelling human environmental systems, but challenges and critics remain. One pressing challenge in the era of "Big Data" and given the flexibility of representation afforded by ABMs, is identifying the appropriate level of complicatedness in model structure for representing and investigating complex real-world systems. In this paper, we differentiate the concepts of complexity (model behaviour) and complicatedness (model structure), and illustrate the non-linear relationship between them. We then systematically evaluate the trade-offs between simple (often theoretical) models and complicated (often empirically-grounded) models. We propose using pattern-oriented modelling, stepwise approaches, and modular design to guide modellers in reaching an appropriate level of model complicatedness. While ABMs should be constructed as simple as possible but as complicated as necessary to address the predefined research questions, we also warn modellers of the pitfalls and risks of building "mid-level" models mixing stylized and empirical components.

AB Methods for inference and interpretation of evolutionary quantitative genetic parameters, and for prediction of the response to selection, are best developed for traits with normal distributions. Many traits of evolutionary interest, including many life history and behavioral traits, have inherently nonnormal distributions. The generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) framework has become a widely used tool for estimating quantitative genetic parameters for nonnormal traits. However, whereas GLMMs provide inference on a statistically convenient latent scale, it is often desirable to express quantitative genetic parameters on the scale upon which traits are measured. The parameters of fitted GLMMs, despite being on a latent scale, fully determine all quantities of potential interest on the scale on which traits are expressed. We provide expressions for deriving each of such quantities, including population means, phenotypic (co)variances, variance components including additive genetic (co)variances, and parameters such as heritability. We demonstrate that fixed effects have a strong impact on those parameters and show how to deal with this by averaging or integrating over fixed effects. The expressions require integration of quantities determined by the link function, over distributions of latent values. In general cases, the required integrals must be solved numerically, but efficient methods are available and we provide an implementation in an R package, QGglmm. We show that known formulas for quantities such as heritability of traits with binomial and Poisson distributions are special cases of our expressions. Additionally, we show how fitted GLMM can be incorporated into existing methods for predicting evolutionary trajectories. We demonstrate the accuracy of the resulting method for evolutionary prediction by simulation and apply our approach to data from a wild pedigreed vertebrate population.

AB AimSpatial analysis of the distribution and density of species is of continuing interest within theoretical and applied ecology. Species distribution models (SDMs) are being increasingly used to analyse count, presence-absence and presence-only data sets. There is a growing literature on dynamic SDMs (which incorporate temporal variation in species distribution), joint SDMs (which simultaneously analyse the correlated distribution of multiple species) and geostatistical models (which account for similarity between nearby sites caused by unobserved covariates). However, no previous study has combined all three attributes within a single framework.
   InnovationWe develop spatial dynamic factor analysis for use as a joint, dynamic SDM' (JDSDM), which uses geostatistical methods to account for spatial similarity when estimating one or more factors'. Each factor evolves over time following a density-dependent (Gompertz) process, and the log-density of each species is approximated as a linear combination of different factors. We demonstrate a JDSDM using two multispecies case studies (an annual survey of bottom-associated species in the Bering Sea and a seasonal survey of butterfly density in the continental USA), and also provide our code publicly as an R package.
   Main conclusionsCase study applications show that that JDSDMs can be used for species ordination, i.e. showing that dynamics for butterfly species within the same genus are significantly more correlated than for species from different genera. We also demonstrate how JDSDMs can rapidly identify dominant patterns in community dynamics, including the decline and recovery of several Bering Sea fishes since 2008, and the flight curves' typical of early or late-emerging butterflies. We conclude by suggesting future research that could incorporate phylogenetic relatedness or functional similarity, and propose that our approach could be used to monitor community dynamics at large spatial and temporal scales.

AB A thorough knowledge of soil functionality is critical to successful restoration of disturbed ecosystems, and its evaluation involves the assessment of soil properties and processes as a component of a healthy ecosystem. Here, we propose a set of soil quality indicators to assess the soil status in restored soils (topsoil and waste material) and test new methods that are easy to apply, interpret, and cost-effective for the analysis of soil biological indicators in restored ecosystems. We show that in addition to organic carbon and C:N ratio, biological indicators (microbial diversity and activity in particular) are the most sensitive indicators to detect differences among reconstructed soils and analogue undisturbed soils in semiarid areas. The use of the 1-day CO2 test is proven to be an alternative cost-and time-effective method to measure microbial activity and assess soil functionality of restored soils. Our results show a positive effect of vegetation on reconstructed soils and a recovery of soil functionality in waste material to levels similar to topsoil once vegetation is established. However, soil functionality in both restored waste materials and topsoils is still far from that in undisturbed native soils. We conclude that soil functionality is critical in the restoration process, particularly in semiarid areas, and the methods used here could be effectively applied in a broad range of restoration projects in arid and semiarid environments.

AB Clines in chromosomal inversion polymorphisms-presumably driven by climatic gradients-are common but there is surprisingly little evidence for selection acting on them. Here we address this long-standing issue in Drosophila melanogaster by using diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to estimate inversion frequencies from 28 whole-genome Pool-seq samples collected from 10 populations along the North American east coast. Inversions In(3L)P, In(3R)Mo, and In(3R)Payne showed clear latitudinal clines, and for In(2L)t, In(2R)NS, and In(3R) Payne the steepness of the clinal slopes changed between summer and fall. Consistent with an effect of seasonality on inversion frequencies, we detected small but stable seasonal fluctuations of In(2R) NS and In(3R) Payne in a temperate Pennsylvanian population over 4 years. In support of spatially varying selection, we observed that the cline in In(3R) Payne has remained stable for >40 years and that the frequencies of In(2L) t and In(3R) Payne are strongly correlated with climatic factors that vary latitudinally, independent of population structure. To test whether these patterns are adaptive, we compared the amount of genetic differentiation of inversions versus neutral SNPs and found that the clines in In(2L) t and In(3R) Payne are maintained nonneutrally and independent of admixture. We also identified numerous clinal inversion-associated SNPs, many of which exhibit parallel differentiation along the Australian cline and reside in genes known to affect fitness-related traits. Together, our results provide strong evidence that inversion clines are maintained by spatially-and perhaps also temporally-varying selection. We interpret our data in light of current hypotheses about how inversions are established and maintained.

AB Native to Australasia, Eucalyptus (sensu lato) is one of the most planted genera of trees in the world. However, the sustainability of Eucalyptus species as plantation trees in non-native areas is increasingly threatened by the introduction and spread of Eucalyptus-feeding insects from Australia. We examine patterns and potential trends with respect to the global spread of Eucalyptus-feeding insects. Likely pathways of introduction and drivers of the rapid distribution of these insects, as well as management options are considered. The rate of introductions is shown to have increased nearly fivefold since the 1980s. As a result, the number of non-native pests of eucalypts outside of Australia has doubled in less than three decades. Furthermore, the rate of secondary spread among continents has also increased. Surprisingly, we found no association between area planted and the number of pests or new introductions. Only a small number of countries have been the points of first detection outside the native range; these countries have acted as bridgeheads to other regions. Quarantine regulations aimed at reducing the spread of invasive organisms appear to be ineffective at a global scale, and pathways allowing these invasions to occur are poorly understood or unknown. An expanded suite of management options are needed to provide resilience against the rapid accrual and homogenization of eucalypt pests, thereby ensuring the sustainability of eucalypt forestry worldwide.

AB Relatively anisohydric species are predicted to be more predisposed to hydraulic failure than relatively isohydric species, as they operate with narrower hydraulic safety margins. We subjected co-occurring anisohydric Juniperus monosperma and isohydric Pinus edulis trees to warming, reduced precipitation, or both, and measured their gas exchange and hydraulic responses. We found that reductions in stomatal conductance and assimilation by heat and drought were more frequent during relatively moist periods, but these effects were not exacerbated in the combined heat and drought treatment. Counter to expectations, both species exhibited similar gs temporal dynamics in response to drought. Further, whereas P. edulis exhibited chronic embolism, J. monosperma showed very little embolism due to its conservative stomatal regulation and maintenance of xylem water potential above the embolism entry point. This tight stomatal control and low levels of embolism experienced by juniper refuted the notion that very low water potentials during drought are associated with loose stomatal control and with the hypothesis that anisohydric species are more prone to hydraulic failure than isohydric species. Because direct association of stomatal behaviour with embolism resistance can be misleading, we advocate consideration of stomatal behaviour relative to embolism resistance for classifying species drought response strategies.

AB Faced with an accelerating rate of environmental change and the associated need for a more sustainable, low-input agriculture, the urgent new challenge for crop science is to find ways to introduce greater diversity to cropping systems. However, there is a dearth of generic formalism in programs seeking to diversify crops. In this opinion, we propose a new framework, derived from ecological theory, that should enable diversity targets to be incorporated into plant-breeding programs. While ecological theory provides criteria for maintaining diversity and optimizing the production of mixtures, such criteria are rarely fully realized in natural ecosystems. Conversely, crop breeding should optimize both agronomic value and the ability of plants to perform and live alongside one another. This framework represents an opportunity to develop more sustainable crops and also a radical new way to apply ecological theory to cropping systems.

AB Symbiosis has significantly contributed to organismal adaptation and diversification. For establishment and maintenance of such host-symbiont associations, host organisms must have evolved mechanisms for selective incorporation, accommodation, and maintenance of their specific microbial partners. Here we report the discovery of a previously unrecognized type of animal organ for symbiont sorting. In the bean bug Riptortus pedestris, the posterior midgut is morphologically differentiated for harboring specific symbiotic bacteria of a beneficial nature. The sorting organ lies in the middle of the intestine as a constricted region, which partitions the midgut into an anterior nonsymbiotic region and a posterior symbiotic region. Oral administration of GFP-labeled Burkholderia symbionts to nymphal stinkbugs showed that the symbionts pass through the constricted region and colonize the posterior midgut. However, administration of food colorings revealed that food fluid enters neither the constricted region nor the posterior midgut, indicating selective symbiont passage at the constricted region and functional isolation of the posterior midgut for symbiosis. Coadministration of the GFP-labeled symbiont and red fluorescent protein-labeled Escherichia coli unveiled selective passage of the symbiont and blockage of E. coli at the constricted region, demonstrating the organ's ability to discriminate the specific bacterial symbiont from nonsymbiotic bacteria. Transposon mutagenesis and screening revealed that symbiont mutants in flagella-related genes fail to pass through the constricted region, highlighting that both host's control and symbiont's motility are involved in the sorting process. The blocking of food flow at the constricted region is conserved among diverse stinkbug groups, suggesting the evolutionary origin of the intestinal organ in their common ancestor.

AB Ecologists urgently need a better ability to predict how environmental change affects biodiversity. We examine individual-based ecology (IBE), a research paradigm that promises better a predictive ability by using individual-based models (IBMs) to represent ecological dynamics as arising from how individuals interact with their environment and with each other. A key advantage of IBMs is that the basis for predictions-fitness maximization by individual organisms-is more general and reliable than the empirical relationships that other models depend on. Case studies illustrate the usefulness and predictive success of long-term IBE programs. The pioneering programs had three phases: conceptualization, implementation, and diversification. Continued validation of models runs throughout these phases. The breakthroughs that make IBE more productive include standards for describing and validating IBMs, improved and standardized theory for individual traits and behavior, software tools, and generalized instead of system-specific IBMs. We provide guidelines for pursuing IBE and a vision for future IBE research.

AB Insects are often associated with symbiotic micro-organisms, which allow them to utilize nutritionally marginal diets. Adult fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) associate with extracellular bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae) that inhabit their digestive tract. These flies obtain nutrients by foraging for plant exudates, honeydew and bird droppings scattered on leaves and fruit - a nutritional niche which offers ample amounts of carbohydrates, but low quantities of available nitrogen. We identified the bacteria resident in the gut of the olive fly (Bactrocera oleae) - a worldwide pest of olives and examined their contribution to nitrogen metabolism in the adult insect. By suppressing bacteria in the gut and monitoring female fecundity, we demonstrate that bacteria contribute essential amino acids and metabolize urea into an available nitrogen source for the fly, thus significantly elevating egg production. In an ecological context, bacteria were found to be beneficial to females subsisting on bird droppings, but not on honeydew - two natural food sources. We suggest that a main gut bacterium (Candidatus Erwinia dacicola) forms an inseparable, essential part of this fly's nutritional ecology. The evolution of this symbiosis has allowed adult flies to utilize food substrates which are low or imbalanced in assimilable nitrogen and thereby to overcome the nitrogen limitations of their natural diet.

AB The relative importance of contemporary and historical processes is central for understanding biodiversity patterns. While several studies show that past conditions can partly explain the current biodiversity patterns, the role of history remains elusive. We reconstructed palaeo-drainage basins under lower sea level conditions (Last Glacial Maximum) to test whether the historical connectivity between basins left an imprint on the global patterns of freshwater fish biodiversity. After controlling for contemporary and past environmental conditions, we found that palaeo-connected basins displayed greater species richness but lower levels of endemism and beta diversity than did palaeo-disconnected basins. Palaeo-connected basins exhibited shallower distance decay of compositional similarity, suggesting that palaeo-river connections favoured the exchange of fish species. Finally, we found that a longer period of palaeo-connection resulted in lower levels of beta diversity. These findings reveal the first unambiguous results of the role played by history in explaining the global contemporary patterns of biodiversity.

AB Statistical correlations of biodiversity patterns across multiple trophic levels have received considerable attention in various types of interacting assemblages, forging a universal understanding of patterns and processes in free-living communities. Host-parasite interactions present an ideal model system for studying congruence of species richness among taxa as obligate parasites are strongly dependent upon the availability of their hosts for survival and reproduction while also having a tight coevolutionary relationship with their hosts. The present meta-analysis examined 38 case studies on the relationship between species richness of hosts and parasites, and is the first attempt to provide insights into the patterns and causal mechanisms of parasite biodiversity at the community level using meta-regression models. We tested the distinct role of resource (i. e. host) availability and evolutionary co-variation on the association between biodiversity of hosts and parasites, while spatial scale of studies was expected to influence the extent of this association. Our results demonstrate that species richness of parasites is tightly correlated with that of their hosts with a strong average effect size (r. 0.55) through both host availability and evolutionary co-variation. However, we found no effect of the spatial scale of studies, nor of any of the other predictor variables considered, on the correlation. Our findings highlight the tight ecological and evolutionary association between host and parasite species richness and reinforce the fact that host-parasite interactions provide an ideal system to explore congruence of biodiversity patterns across multiple trophic levels.

AB Global change is driving a massive rearrangement of the world's biota. Trajectories of distributional shifts are shaped by species traits, the recipient environment and driving forces with many of the driving forces directly due to human activities. The relative importance of each in determining the distributions of introduced species is poorly understood. We consider 11 Australian Acacia species introduced to South Africa for different reasons (commercial forestry, dune stabilization and ornamentation) to determine how features of the introduction pathway have shaped their invasion history. Projections from species distribution models (SDMs) were developed to assess how the reason for introduction influences the similarity between climatic envelopes in native and alien ranges. A lattice model for an idealized invasion was developed to assess the relative contribution of intrinsic traits and introduction dynamics on the abundance and extent over the course of simulated invasions. SDMs show that alien populations of ornamental species in South Africa occupy substantially different climate space from their native ranges, whereas species introduced for forestry occupy a similar climate space in native and introduced ranges. This may partly explain the slow spread rates observed for some alien ornamental plants. Such mismatches are likely to become less pronounced with the current drive towards 'eco gardens' resulting in more introductions of ornamental species with a close climate match between native and newly introduced regions. The results from the lattice model showed that the conditions associated with the introduction pathway (especially introduction pressure) dominate early invasion dynamics. The placement of introduction foci in urban areas limited the extent and abundance of invasive populations. Features of introduction events appear to initially mask the influence of intrinsic species traits on invasions and help to explain the relative success of species introduced for different purposes. Introduction dynamics therefore can have long-lasting influences on the outcomes of species redistributions, and must be explicitly considered in management plans.

AB Habitat reserves can promote ecological resilience to climate variability by supporting intact trophic webs and large-bodied individuals(1-3). Protection may also alter community responses to long-term climate change by offering habitat for range-shifting species(4). Here we analyse the species richness, diversity and functional traits of temperate reef fish communities over 20 years in a global warming hotspot and compare patterns in a marine reserve with nearby sites open to fishing. Species richness and diversity oscillated strongly on the decadal scale. Long-term warming signatures were also present as increasing functional trait richness and functional diversity, driven in part by a general increase in herbivores. Nevertheless, reserve sites were distinguished from fished sites by displaying: greater stability in some aspects of biodiversity; recovery of large-bodied temperate species; resistance to colonization by subtropical vagrants; and less pronounced increases in the community-averaged temperature affinity. We empirically demonstrate that protection from fishing has buffered fluctuations in biodiversity and provided resistance to the initial stages of tropicalization.

AB The majority of species in ecosystems are rare, but the ecosystem consequences of losing rare species are poorly known. To understand how rare species may influence ecosystem functioning, this study quantifies the contribution of species based on their relative level of rarity to community functional diversity using a trait-based approach. Given that rarity can be defined in several different ways, we use four different definitions of rarity: abundance (mean and maximum), geographic range, and habitat specificity. We find that rarer species contribute to functional diversity when rarity is defined by maximum abundance, geographic range, and habitat specificity. However, rarer species are functionally redundant when rarity is defined by mean abundance. Furthermore, when using abundance-weighted analyses, we find that rare species typically contribute significantly less to functional diversity than common species due to their low abundances. These results suggest that rare species have the potential to play an important role in ecosystem functioning, either by offering novel contributions to functional diversity or via functional redundancy depending on how rare species are defined. Yet, these contributions are likely to be greatest if the abundance of rare species increases due to environmental change. We argue that given the paucity of data on rare species, understanding the contribution of rare species to community functional diversity is an important first step to understanding the potential role of rare species in ecosystem functioning.

AB Background: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine which is triggered by dietary gluten in genetically predisposed (HLA-DQ2/DQ8 positive) individuals. Only a fraction of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 positive individuals develop CD indicating that other factors have a role in the disorder. Several studies have addressed intestinal microbiota aberrancies in pediatric CD, but the results are inconsistent. Previously, we demonstrated that pediatric CD patients have lower duodenal expression of TLR2 and higher expression of TLR9 as compared to healthy controls (HC) indicating that microbiota may have a role in CD.
   Methods: We used bacterial phylogenetic microarray to comprehensively profile the microbiota in duodenal biopsies of CD (n = 10) and HC (n = 9) children. The expression of selected mucosa-associated genes was assessed by qRT-PCR in CD and HC children and in treated CD adults (T-CD, n = 6) on gluten free diet.
   Results: The overall composition, diversity and the estimated microbe associated molecular pattern (MAMP) content of microbiota were comparable between CD and HC, but a sub-population profile comprising eight genus-like bacterial groups was found to differ significantly between HC and CD. In HC, increased TLR2 expression was positively correlated with the expression of tight junction protein ZO-1. In CD and T-CD, the expression of IL-10, IFN-g and CXCR6 were higher as co5mpared to HC.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that microbiota and altered expression of mucosal receptors have a role in CD. In CD subjects, the increased expression of IL-10 and IFN-g may have partly resulted from the increased TLR9 expression and signaling.

AB We present an integrated modeling framework for simulating land-use decision making under the influence of payments for ecosystem services. The model combines agent-based modeling (ABM) with Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) and opinion dynamics models (ODM). The model endows agents with the ability to make land-use decisions at the household and plot levels. The decision-making process is captured with the BBNs that were constructed and calibrated with both qualitative and quantitative information, i.e., knowledge gained from group discussions with stakeholders and empirical survey data. To represent interpersonal interactions within social networks, the decision process is further modulated by the opinion dynamics model. The goals of the model are to improve the ability of ABM to emulate land-use decision making and thus provide a better understanding of the potential impacts of payments for ecosystem services on land use and household livelihoods. Our approach provides three important innovations. First, decision making is represented in a causal directed graph. Second, the model provides a natural framework for combining knowledge from experts and stakeholders with quantitative data. Third, the modular architecture and the software implementation can be customized with modest efforts. The model is therefore a flexible, general platform that can be tailored to other studies by mounting the appropriate case-specific "brain" into the agents. The model was calibrated for the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP) in Yunnan, China using data from participatory mapping, focus group interviews, and a survey of 509 farm households in 17 villages.

AB It is now common for population geneticists to estimate FST for a large number of loci across the genome, before testing for selected loci as being outliers to the FST distribution. One surprising result of such FST scans is the often high proportion (>1% and sometimes >10%) of outliers detected, and this is often interpreted as evidence for pervasive local adaptation. In this issue of Molecular Ecolog, Fourcade etal. () observe that a particularly high rate of FST outliers has often been found in river organisms, such as fishes or damselflies, despite there being no obvious reason why selection should affect a larger proportion of the genomes of these organisms. Using computer simulations, Fourcade etal. () show that the strong correlation in co-ancestry produced in long one-dimensional landscapes (such as rivers, valleys, peninsulas, oceanic ridges or coastlines) greatly increases the neutral variance in FST, especially when the landscape is further reticulated into fractal networks. As a consequence, outlier tests have a high rate of false positives, unless this correlation can be taken into account. Fourcade etal.'s study highlights an extreme case of the general problem, first noticed by Robertson (,b) and Nei & Maruyama (), that correlated co-ancestry inflates the neutral variance in FST when compared to its expectation under an island model of population structure. Similar warnings about the validity of outlier tests have appeared regularly since then but have not been widely cited in the recent genomics literature. We further emphasize that FST outliers can arise in many different ways and that outlier tests are not designed for situations where the genetic architecture of local adaptation involves many loci.

AB Flexibility in scheduling varies throughout an organism's annual cycle, reflecting relative temporal constraints and fitness consequences among life-history stages. Time-selection can act at different scales, either by limiting the range of alternative strategies in the population, or by increasing the precision of individual performance. We tracked individual bar-tailed godwits Limosa lapponica baueri for two full years (including direct observation during non-breeding seasons in New Zealand and geolocator tracking of round-trip migrations to Alaska) to present a full annual-cycle view of molt, breeding, and migration schedules. At both population and individual scales, temporal variation was greater in post-breeding than pre-breeding stages, and greater in molts than in movements, but schedules did not tighten across successive stages of migration toward the breeding grounds. In general, individual godwits were quite consistent in timing of events throughout the year, and repeatability of pre-breeding movements was particularly high (r = 0.82-0.92). However, we demonstrate that r values misrepresent absolute consistency by confounding inter- and intra-individual variation; the biological significance of r values can only be understood when these are considered separately. By doing so, we show that some stages have considerable tolerance for alternative strategies within the population, whereas scheduling of northbound migratory movements was similar for all individuals. How time-selection simultaneously shapes both individual and population variation is central to understanding and predicting adaptive phenological responses to environmental change.

AB Dispersal is one of the principal mechanisms influencing ecological and evolutionary processes but quantitative empirical data are unfortunately scarce. As dispersal is likely to influence population responses to climate change, whether by adaptation or by migration, there is an urgent need to obtain estimates of dispersal distance. Cross-species correlative approaches identifying predictors of dispersal distance can provide much-needed insights into this data-scarce area. Here, we describe the compilation of a new data set of natal dispersal distances and use it to test life-history predictors of dispersal distance in mammals and examine the strength of the phylogenetic signal in dispersal distance. We find that both maximum and median dispersal distances have strong phylogenetic signals. No single model performs best in describing either maximum or median dispersal distances when phylogeny is taken into account but many models show high explanatory power, suggesting that dispersal distance per generation can be estimated for mammals with comparatively little data availability. Home range area, geographic range size and body mass are identified as the most important terms across models. Cross-validation of models supports the ability of these variables to predict dispersal distances, suggesting that models may be extended to species where dispersal distance is unknown.

AB A set of landscape metrics is used to study the long-term environmental transformation of a typical coastal Mediterranean area from 1850 to 2005. Our figures show a dramatic environmental deterioration between 1950 and 2005. The main proximate drivers of this landscape degradation are the effects of urban sprawl on former agricultural areas located in the coastal plains, together with the abandonment and reforestation of hilly slopes intercepted by low-density residential areas, highways, and other linear infrastructures. Then, a statistical redundancy analysis (RDA) is carried out to identify certain ultimate socioeconomic and political drivers of these environmental impacts. The results confirm, from a quantitative perspective, our main hypothesis that some ultimate geographical endowments and socioeconomic or political drivers have determined land cover changes which, in turn, have altered both structural and functional landscape properties.

AB Measurements of eddy fluxes are premised on the assumption that wind velocities are measured accurately by an ultrasonic anemometer. Recently, Gill ultrasonic anemometers have been shown to suffer errors depending on the angle of attack, which is the angle between the wind vector and the horizontal. The correction of these errors results in general eddy flux increases. However, since calibration for error dependent on angle of attack was carried out in a wind tunnel experiment under conditions of nearly laminar flow, the applicability of this correction to the field data under turbulent conditions has been questioned. In this study, angle of attack errors from a Gill WindMaster ultrasonic anemometer were assessed by field experiment, over meadow and under turbulent conditions. By using five identical anemometers, two configurations were evaluated: two pairs of anemometers for reference and one between the pairs for tilt. The dependence of anemometer (co)sine response on 0 to -90 degrees angles of attack in 10 degrees steps and at 45 degrees were checked. It was clarified that errors dependent on angle of attack occur even under turbulent conditions, with results similar to the wind tunnel experiments. Sine responses of vertical wind velocities here depended not only on vertical angle of attack but also on horizontal wind direction, a dynamic not considered in previous studies. For a more robust correction, alternative calibration functions were obtained empirically, so as to reasonably explain our field experimental results. Applying this new correction, eddy fluxes increased substantially even over meadow, which is somewhat aerodynamically smooth compared with forests or agricultural fields. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Within transitional/estuarine environments 'ecosystem functioning' has been mostly investigated with "traditional" taxonomic analysis, based on the taxonomic composition of benthic invertebrate communities. However, 'ecosystem functioning' depends also greatly on the functional characteristics (biological traits) of organisms.
   It was a priori suggested that the biological traits of the subticlal benthic invertebrate communities within an estuarine environment would respond to the high variability of environmental pressures (natural and human induced) within this type of ecosystem.
   For this study, traditional taxonomic analysis (species richness, species density and Shannon-Wiener diversity) as well as biological trait analysis were used together for the first time to investigate the response of the subtidal benthic invertebrate communities to the environmental pressures within the Mondego estuary (Portugal).
   Biological trait analysis, in addition to traditional taxonomic analysis provided a more comprehensive understanding of the functioning within this type of ecosystem. Some of the most important outcomes are: (i) the trait "salinity preference" was the most important trait that distributed the species along the estuary, (ii) the central part of the estuary appeared to be under higher environmental stress levels than the other areas, as suggested by a dominance of some "opportunistic" traits (e.g. small short-lived species), (iii) the ratio between functional diversity (FD) and Shannon-Wiener diversity (H') indicated lower functional redundancy at the upper reaches of the estuary. Our results, suggest that the ratio (FD/H') might be a helpful tool to visualize this functional attribute and could potentially be applied to different communities from distinct environments. Using the traditional taxonomic analysis alone, this last functional aspect would not be detectable. Therefore, the inclusion of biological traits analysis is recommendable for estuarine ecological studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soil pollution with heavy metals is a worldwide environmental problem. Phytoremediation through phytoextraction and phytostabilization appears to be a promising technology for the remediation of polluted soils. It is important to strongly emphasize that the ultimate goal of a heavy metal remediation process must be not only to remove the heavy metals from the soil (or instead to reduce their bioavailability and mobility) but also to restore soil quality. Soil quality is defined as the capacity of a given soil to perform its functions. Soil microbial properties are increasingly being used as biological indicators of soil quality due to their quick response, high sensitivity, and, above all, capacity to provide information that integrates many environmental factors. Indeed, microbial properties are among the most ecologically relevant indicators of soil quality. Consequently, microbial monitoring of the recovery of soil quality is often carried out during heavy metal phytoremediation processes. However, soil microbial properties are highly context dependent and difficult to interpret. For a better interpretation of microbial properties as indicators of soil quality, they may be grouped within categories of higher ecological relevance, such as soil functions, ecosystem health attributes, and ecosystem services.

AB 1. Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory was designed to understand the dynamics of biological systems from cells to populations and ecosystems via a mass balance approach of individuals. However, most work so far has focused on the level of the individual. To encourage further use of DEB theory in a population context, we developed DEB-IBM, a generic individual-based model (IBM) that is based on DEB theory. 2. The generic IBM is implemented as a computer program using NetLogo, a free software platformthat is accessible to biologists with little programming background. The IBMuses DEB to represent assimilation, maintenance, growth and reproduction of individuals. The model description follows the overview, design and details ( ODD) protocol, a generic format for describing IBMs, and thereby provides a novel and accessible introduction to DEB theory and how it works in a population context. 3. Dynamic Energy Budget- individual- based model can be used to explore properties of both individual life- history traits and population dynamics, which emerge from the set of DEB parameters of a species, and their interaction with environmental variables such as food density. Furthermore, DEB- IBM can be adapted to address specific research questions, for example by including spatial effects. A user manual explains how this can be done. 4. Dynamic Energy Budget- individual- based model is designed to both facilitate use and testing DEB theory in a population context and to advance individual- based modelling by basing the representation of individuals on well- tested physiological principles.

AB The oncoprotein BCR-ABL transforms myeloid progenitor cells and is responsible for the development of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In transformed cells, BCR-ABL suppresses apoptosis as well as autophagy, a catabolic process in which cellular components are degraded by the lysosomal machinery. The mechanism by which BCR-ABL suppresses autophagy is not known. Here we report that in both mouse and human BCR-ABL-transformed cells, activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5), a prosurvival factor, suppresses autophagy but does not affect apoptosis. We find that BCR-ABL, through PI3K/AKT/FOXO4 signaling, transcriptionally up-regulates ATF5 expression and that ATF5, in turn, stimulates transcription of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; also called mechanistic target of rapamycin), a well-established master negative-regulator of autophagy. Previous studies have shown that the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib mesylate induces both apoptosis and autophagy, and that the resultant autophagy modulates the efficiency by which imatinib kills BCR-ABL-transformed cells. We demonstrate that imatinib-induced autophagy is because of inhibition of the BCR-ABL/PI3K/AKT/FOXO4/ATF5/mTOR pathway that we have identified in this study. (Blood. 2011; 118(10): 2840-2848)

AB While studies have found that bat abundance is positively related to the amount of forest cover in a landscape, the effects of forest fragmentation (breaking apart of forest, independent of amount) are less certain, with some indirect evidence for positive effects of fragmentation. However, in most of these studies, the variables used to quantify fragmentation are confounded with forest amount, making it difficult to interpret the results. The purpose of this study was to examine how forest amount and forest fragmentation independently affect bat abundance. We conducted acoustic bat surveys at the centers of 22 landscapes throughout eastern Ontario, Canada, where landscapes were chosen to avoid a correlation between forest amount and forest fragmentation (number of patches) at multiple spatial scales, while simultaneously controlling for other variables that could affect bat activity. We found that the effects of forest amount on bat relative abundance were mixed across species (positive for Lasiurus borealis, negative for Perimyotis subflavus and Lasionycteris noctivagans). When there was evidence for an effect of forest fragmentation, independent of forest amount, on bat relative abundance, the effect was positive (Myotis septentrionalis, Myotis lucifugus and Lasiurus borealis). We suggest that the mechanism driving the positive responses to fragmentation is higher landscape complementation in more fragmented landscapes; that is, increased access to both foraging and roosting sites for these bat species. We conclude that fragmented landscapes that maximize complementation between roosting and foraging sites should support a higher diversity and abundance of bats.

AB This paper proposes the employment of multiple scale factor values within distributed differential evolution structures. Four different scale factor schemes are proposed, tested, compared and analyzed. Two schemes simply employ multiple scale factor values and two also include an update logic during the evolution. The four schemes have been integrated for comparison within three recently proposed distributed differential evolution structures and tested on several various test problems.
   Numerical results show that, on average, the employment of multiple scale factors is beneficial since in most cases it leads to significant improvements in performance with respect to standard distributed algorithms. Although proper choice of a scale factor scheme appears to be dependent on the distributed structure, any of the proposed simple schemes has proven to significantly improve upon the single scale factor distributed differential evolution algorithms.

AB The 'tragedy of the commons' dilemma occurs when individuals working independently of one another, will overuse a common-property resource for short-term benefits while decimating the resource for long-term use (Hardin 1968). This is often found in the field of wildlife crimes where species become overexploited to increase short-term profits while endangering and eliminating a natural resource for future users. Wildlife crimes suffering from the 'tragedy' need to be prevented in order for species to avoid extinction while also conserving a natural resource that monetarily benefits numerous people and their respective communities. Current approaches to the illegal wildlife trade include implementing trade bans or regulatory schemes at the national and international level, yet their effectiveness of reducing the trade is unknown. Perhaps, a better approach in reducing the illegal wildlife trade is a combination of making it more difficult to poach (i.e. situational crime prevention) and incentivizing locals to abstain from poaching. This paper will first review the literature on wildlife crimes and then use a case study approach that will examine the literature on the illegal parrot trade, the market for wildlife skins, and over-fishing. Through these case studies, a comprehensive review of the problem will be detailed as well as innovative conservation solutions that show promise in reducing the poaching and exploitation of species. Amongst these solutions will be the use of situational crime prevention that has shown immediate reductions in crime when tailored towards highly-targeted areas and crimes.

AB P>1. Water abstraction strongly affects streams in arid and semiarid ecosystems, particularly where there is a Mediterranean climate. Excessive abstraction reduces the availability of water for human uses downstream and impairs the capacity of streams to support native biota.
   2. We investigated the flow regime and related variables in six river basins of the Iberian Peninsula and show that they have been strongly altered, with declining flows (autoregressive models) and groundwater levels during the 20th century. These streams had lower flows and more frequent droughts than predicted by the official hydrological model used in this region. Three of these rivers were sometimes dry, whereas there were predicted by the model to be permanently flowing. Meanwhile, there has been no decrease in annual precipitation.
   3. We also investigated the fish assemblage of a stream in one of these river basins (Tordera) for 6 years and show that sites more affected by water abstraction display significant differences in four fish metrics (catch per unit effort, number of benthic species, number of intolerant species and proportional abundance of intolerant individuals) commonly used to assess the biotic condition of streams.
   4. We discuss the utility of these metrics in assessing impacts of water abstraction and point out the need for detailed characterisation of the natural flow regime (and hence drought events) prior to the application of biotic indices in streams severely affected by water abstraction. In particular, in cases of artificially dry streams, it is more appropriate for regulatory agencies to assign index scores that reflect biotic degradation than to assign 'missing' scores, as is presently customary in assessments of Iberian streams.

AB Background: Transgressive segregation describes the occurrence of novel phenotypes in hybrids with extreme trait values not observed in either parental species. A previously experimentally untested prediction is that the amount of transgression increases with the genetic distance between hybridizing species. This follows from QTL studies suggesting that transgression is most commonly due to complementary gene action or epistasis, which become more frequent at larger genetic distances. This is because the number of QTLs fixed for alleles with opposing signs in different species should increase with time since speciation provided that speciation is not driven by disruptive selection. We measured the amount of transgression occurring in hybrids of cichlid fish bred from species pairs with gradually increasing genetic distances and varying phenotypic similarity. Transgression in multi-trait shape phenotypes was quantified using landmark-based geometric morphometric methods.
   Results: We found that genetic distance explained 52% and 78% of the variation in transgression frequency in F1 and F2 hybrids, respectively. Confirming theoretical predictions, transgression when measured in F2 hybrids, increased linearly with genetic distance between hybridizing species. Phenotypic similarity of species on the other hand was not related to the amount of transgression.
   Conclusion: The commonness and ease with which novel phenotypes are produced in cichlid hybrids between unrelated species has important implications for the interaction of hybridization with adaptation and speciation. Hybridization may generate new genotypes with adaptive potential that did not reside as standing genetic variation in either parental population, potentially enhancing a population's responsiveness to selection. Our results make it conceivable that hybridization contributed to the rapid rates of phenotypic evolution in the large and rapid adaptive radiations of haplochromine cichlids.

AB In mammals, including man, epidemiological and experimental studies have shown that a range of environmental factors acting during critical periods of early development can alter adult phenotype. Hormones have an important role in these epigenetic modifications and can signal the type, severity and duration of the environmental cue to the developing feto-placental tissues. They affect development of these tissues both directly and indirectly by changes in placental phenotype. They act to alter gene expression, hence the protein abundance in a wide range of different tissues, which has functional consequences for many physiological systems both before and after birth. By producing an epigenome specific to the prevailing condition in utero, hormones act as epigenetic signals in developmental programming, with important implications for adult health and disease. This review examines the role of hormones as epigenetic signals by considering their responses to environmental cues, their effects on phenotypical development and the molecular mechanisms by which they programme feto-placental development, with particular emphasis on the glucocorticoids.

AB The soils underlying the 12 Fire and Fire Surrogates Network include six soil orders and >50 named soil series. Across the network, pretreatment soils varied from 3.7 to 7.1 in pH, and exhibited ranges of twofold in bulk density, fourfold in soil organic C (SOC) content, 10-fold in total inorganic N (TIN), and 200-1000-fold in extractable Ca and K. Nonmetric multidimensional (NMS) ordination of pretreatment soil conditions arrayed the FFS sites along gradients of pH/base cation status, net N transformation rates, bulk density, and SOC. At the network scale, mineral soil exposure was significantly greater in. re-only (mean of 9.2%) and mechanical + fire (5.0%) treatments than in the controls (1.5%) during the first posttreatment year, and this persisted through the later sampling year (second through fourth year, depending on site) in the. re-only treatment (fire 4.1%, control 1.1%). Bulk density was not affected significantly at the network scale. TIN concentrations during the. rst posttreatment year increased after all three manipulative treatments, but this effect did not persist to the later sampling year. Neither SOC content nor soil C: N ratio was affected by any of the treatments at the network scale. At the individual site scale, the combined mechanical +. re treatment produced more significant site 3 treatment 3 year effects than did the. re-only or mechanical-only treatments, though in most cases even the statistically significant differences produced by the manipulative treatments were modest in magnitude. Ordination of first-year standardized effect sizes produced no discernable separation of the three manipulative treatments but did separate the three sites with the greatest. re severity (based on proportional fuel consumption) from the majority of the network sites, with changes in pH, TIN, SOC content, and soil C: N ratio correlating most strongly with this separation. Ordination of the effect sizes from the later sampling year produced somewhat clearer separation of treatments than did the first-year ordination, though fewer sites were represented in this second ordination. Overall, the network-wide effects of the FFS treatments on soil properties appear to have been modest and transient.

AB This paper attempts to identify and explain patterns in the biogeography of Australia's indigenous terrestrial mammals at the time of European settlement (before modern extinctions), and also compares species' pre-European and current status by region. From subfossil, historical and contemporary sources, we compiled data on the past geographic range and present status of mammals for Australia's 85 biogeographic regions. Of the 305 indigenous species originally present, 91 have disappeared from at least half of the bioregions in which they occurred before European settlement. Thirty-nine extant species 'persist' in less than 25% of their original bioregions; 28 of these are marsupials and 11 are rodents. Twenty-two of the original 305 species are extinct, a further eight became restricted to continental islands, and 100 have become extinct in at least one bioregion. Over the same period, 26 species of exotic mammals established wild populations and now occupy from one to 85 bioregions. When we classified the bioregions in terms of their original species composition, the 3-group level in the dendrogram approximated the Torresian, Eyrean and Bassian subregions proposed by Spencer in 1898, while the 4-group level separated southern semiarid Eyrean bioregions, including those in south-west Australia, from the arid Eyrean bioregions. The classification dendrogram showed geographically (and statistically) discrete clustering down to the 19-group level, suggesting that all four subregions can be further divided on the basis of their mammal faunas. Variation partitioning showed 66% of the biogeographical pattern can be explained by environmental factors (related to temperature and precipitation), the spatial position of each bioregion (a third-order polynomial of latitude and longitude), the area of each bioregion, and the richness of species in each bioregion. In addition to the marked distributional changes that indigenous mammals have experienced over the last 200 years, the 49% of variation explainable by temperature and precipitation implies further shifts with global climate change.

AB The flora and fauna of oceanic islands have inspired research since the early scientific explorations. Islands can be considered 'nature's test tubes' -simple systems with multiple replicates.Our research has used the simplicity of island systems to understand ecological community dynamics and to compare the properties of island communities with those in more complex mainland systems. Here, we present three topics: (i) current patterns of biodiversity on isolated islands of the Pacific; (ii) current patterns of disturbance and invasion on islands; and (iii) future trajectories inferred from these patterns. We examine features of islands (in particular, topography and isolation) that have allowed for given levels and distribution of endemicity. The extent to which island communities are impacted by, resist or accommodate disturbance and/or invasions by nonindigenous species appears to be dictated to a large extent by properties of the native communities and how these communities were originally assembled. Accordingly, patterns of disturbance and invasion are very different for high (montane) islands that are extremely isolated compared to those that are nearer to a source of natural migrants. As with all biotas, those on islands are dynamic entities. However, the unique aspect of islands is their isolation, and extreme isolation has largely been lost over the course of the last few centuries due to the development of transportation routes. We argue that such a modified dynamic will affect the future of the biota and the processes that gave rise to the biota. Specifically for isolated habitats, ecological processes will become increasingly more likely to generate biodiversity than evolutionary processes which have been relatively more important in the past. In the short term, island biotas and other similar biotas that occur in montane habitats may fare well as species are often abundant locally in the habitat to which they are indigenous, and may demonstrate considerable resistance and resilience to invasion. However, island biotas - and other biotas that show high local endemism - will likely not fare well in the face of prolonged disturbance. The biotas in these areas generally display a relatively low dispersal capacity; therefore, under conditions of long-term habitat modification, isolated biotas are likely to be swamped by non-natives, which - simply because of random processes and higher propagule pressure - will move more readily into available habitats. Thus, despite the importance of incorporating the evolutionary process into conservation efforts, we must also be careful to evaluate the likely form that the processes will take when the context (specifically, extent of isolation) has been highly modified.

AB The time during which prey remains are detectable in the gut of a predator is an important consideration in the interpretation of molecular gut-content data, because predators with longer detectability times may appear on the basis of unweighted data to be disproportionately important agents of prey population suppression. The rate of decay in delectability, typically expressed as the half-life, depends on many variables; one that has not been explicitly examined is the manner in which the predator processes prey items. The influence of differences in feeding mode and digestive physiology on the half-life of DNA for a single prey species, the Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), is examined in two predators that differ dramatically in these attributes: the pink ladybeetle, Coleomegilla maculata (DeGeer), which feeds by chewing and then ingesting the macerated material into the gut for digestion; and the spined soldier bug, Podisus maculiventris (Say), which physically and enzymatically processes the prey extra-orally before ingestion and further digestion in the gut. In order to standardize the amount of DNA consumed per predator, a single L. decemlineata egg was used as the prey item; all predators were third instars. The PCR assay yields estimated prey DNA half-lives, for animals maintained under field temperatures, of 7.0 h in C. maculata and 50.9 h in P. maculiventris. The difference in the prey DNA half-lives from these two predators underscores the need to determine detectabilities from assemblages of predators differing in feeding mode and digestive physiology, in order to weight positives properly, and hence determine the predators' relative impacts on prey population suppression.

TI Climate change and the optimal arrival of migratory birds
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE climate change; match-mismatch; phenology; migration
ID DATES; PROTANDRY; NEED
AB Recent climate change has sparked an interest in the timing of biological events, which is a general problem in life-history evolution. Reproduction in many organisms breeding in seasonal environments, e. g. migratory birds, is dependent on the exploitation of a short but rich food supply. If the seasonal timing of the food peak advances owing to climate change, then one would expect the bird to track those changes, hence, initiate migration and breeding earlier. However, when there is competition for territories and a risk of pre-breeding mortality, the optimal response to a shifting food distribution is no longer obvious. We develop a theoretical model to study how the optimal arrival time depends on the mean and variance of the food distribution, the degree of competition for territories and the risk of mortality. In general, the optimal shift in arrival date should never be as extreme as the shift in food peak date. Our results also show that we should expect the high variation of trends in arrival date observed among migratory birds, even if migration and information about climate change were unconstrained.

AB The control and/or removal of a dominant invasive species is expected to lead to increases in native species richness and diversity. Small pilot studies were performed on Santa Cruz Island (SCI), California, in the early 1990s to test the efficacy of different methods on the control of Foeniculum vulgare (fennel) and management's effects on native species recovery. We chose a treatment that showed significant native species recovery, applied it at the landscape scale, and followed its effects on fennel infested plant communities. We tested the hypothesis that results from small-scale studies translate to the landscape level. We found that although the control of fennel translated from the small to landscape scale, decreasing from an average of 60% to less than 3% cover, native species recovery did not occur in the landscape study as it did in the pilot studies. Invasive fennel cover was replaced by non-native grass cover over time. Unexpectedly, fennel cover in untreated fennel plots decreased significantly (though not as drastically) from over 60% cover to just under 40% cover while native species richness in untreated areas increased significantly. The correlation between precipitation and changes in native and non-native species richness and abundance in this study imply that changes in species abundances were highly correlated with environmental fluctuations. The lack of a native seed bank and the accumulation of non-native grass litter likely prevented the recovery of native species in treated areas. Greater vertical complexity found in fennel communities, which increased visitation by frugivorous birds and likely increased native seed dispersal, may have been responsible for the increase in native species richness in the untreated areas. These results suggest that successful invasive species control and native species recovery experiments conducted at small scales may not translate to the landscape level, and active restoration should be an organic component of such large-scale projects.

AB The dynamics of the phytoplankton community were investigated in a marine coastal lagoon (Thau, NW Mediterranean) from February 1999 to January 2000. Dilution experiments, chlorophyll a (Chl a) size-fractionation and primary production measurements were conducted monthly. Maximum growth and microzooplankton grazing rates were estimated from Chl a biomass fractions to separate pico- from nano- and microphytoplankton and by flow cytometry to distinguish between picoeukaryotes and picocyanobacteria. In spring, the phytoplankton community was dominated by Chaetoceros sp. and Skeletonema costatum, which represented most of biomass (B) and primary production (P). Nano- and microphytoplankton growth was controlled by nutrient availability and exceeded losses due to microzooplankton grazing (g). Picoeukaryote and cyanobacteria growth was positively correlated with water temperature and/or irradiance, reaching maximum values in the summer (2.38 and 1.44 day(-1) for picoeukaryotes and cyanobacteria, respectively). Picophytoplankton accounted for 57% of the biomass-specific primary productivity (P/B). Picophytoplankton was strongly controlled by protist grazers (g = 0.09-1.66 day(-1) for picoeukaryotes, g = 0.25-1.17 day(-1) for cyanobacteria), and microzooplankton consumption removed 71% of the daily picoplanktonic growth. Picoeukaryotes, which numerically dominate the picoplankton community, are an important source of organic carbon for the protistan community and contribute to the carbon flow to higher trophic levels.

AB Using spatial predictions of future threats to biodiversity, we assessed for the first time the relative potential impacts of future land use and climate change on the threat status of plant species. We thus estimated how many taxa could be affected by future threats that are usually not included in current IUCN Red List assessments. Here, we computed the Red List status including future threats of 227 Proteaceae taxa endemic to the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa, and compared this with their Red List status excluding future threats. We developed eight different land use and climate change scenarios for the year 2020, providing a range of best- to worst-case scenarios. Four scenarios include only the effects of future land use change, while the other four also include the impacts of projected anthropogenic climate change (HadCM2 IS92a GGa), using niche-based models. Up to a third of the 227 Proteaceae taxa are uplisted (become more threatened) by up to three threat categories if future threats as predicted for 2020 are included, and the proportion of threatened Proteaceae taxa rises on average by 9% (range 2-16%), depending on the scenario. With increasing severity of the scenarios, the proportion of Critically Endangered taxa increases from about 1% to 7% and almost 2% of the 227 Proteaceae taxa become Extinct because of climate change. Overall, climate change has the most severe effects on the Proteaceae, but land use change also severely affects some taxa. Most of the threatened taxa occur in low-lying coastal areas, but the proportion of threatened taxa changes considerably in inland mountain areas if future threats are included. Our approach gives important insights into how, where and when future threats could affect species persistence and can in a sense be seen as a test of the value of planned interventions for conservation.

AB The geographical extent of exotic plant species is a major component of invasiveness, which has been explained by intrinsic attributes of the plants, such as growth rate, reproductive type, life form, and biogeographical origin. We assessed quantitatively life cycle and biogeographical origin as determinants of the geographical distribution of naturalized plants in continental Chile, using minimum residence time (MRT) as an estimator of introduction date. We assembled a database with information on 428 plants (principally herbs) in continental Chile, corresponding to 61% of the exotic naturalized flora. For each species we recorded: (1) minimum residence time (introduction date or first recorded date in the country); (2) biogeographical origin (American, Eurasian, others); (3) life cycle (annual, perennial, others); (4) number of Chilean regions occupied by the plant. We found that 82 species (19%) have been recorded in only one region of Chile, while only three species have been found in all 13 regions of the country. About 89% of the species (381) have been found only in central Chile (Regions IV to VIII), while the remaining 11% (47) are found only in the northern (Regions I to III) or southern parts of the country (Regions IX to XII). We detected significant differences in regional spread of naturalized plants according to minimum residence time: those species with shorter MRT had more limited spread ranges than those with longer MRT. Biogeographical origin and life cycle did not explain geographical extent in Chile. This study shows that historical factors are more important than biological ones in determining the geographical extent of naturalized plants in continental Chile. Thus, caution should be exercised when assigning value to biological attributes that may confer invasiveness to naturalized plants.

AB Identification of the main correlates of the invasion process is a fundamental step in alien species management at the regional scale. This paper explores the main climatic, territorial, and anthropic correlates of alien plant species richness and percentage in Catalonia (NE of Spain), by means of GIS techniques. We used floristic data collected in FLORACAT per UTM 10 km x 10 km to set up the number and the percentage of alien species. The association of these variables with climate, topography, landscape, human settlement, and geographic position was explored by means of stepwise regression models applied on the axes obtained from principal component analysis. The significance of the resulting correlates was tested using the modified t test of Dutilleul to remove the effects of spatial autocorrelation. PCA reduced the 22 variables to 12 principal components (PC) that explained 90% of the cumulative variance. Regression models were highly significant and captured a high proportion of total variance (adjusted r(2) = 0.70 for alien species richness and r(2) = 0.56 for alien species percentage). Both alien species richness and percentage were mainly correlated to PC summarising variables concerning climate, habitat and landscape heterogeneity, and potential anthropogenic disturbance. However, while these PC exhibited similar weights on alien species richness, species percentage was mainly determined by climate. Implications for conservation are discussed considering a future scenario of climate warming and increasing land use change in Mediterranean areas. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Mixed-genotype infections are common in many natural host-parasite interactions. Classical kin-selection models predict that single-genotype infections can exploit host resources prudently to maximize fitness, but that selection favours rapid exploitation when co-infecting genotypes share limited host resources. However, theory has outpaced evidence: we require empirical studies of pathogen genotypes that naturally co-infect hosts. Do genotypes actually compete within hosts? Can host ecology affect the outcome of co-infection? We posed both questions by comparing traits of infections in which two baculovirus genotypes were fed to hosts alongside inocula of the same or a different genotype. The host, Panolis flammea, is a herbivore of Pinus sylvestris and Pi. contorta. The pathogen, PfNPV (a nucleopolyhedrovirus), occurs naturally as mixtures of genotypes that differ, when isolated, in pathogenicity, speed of kill and yield. Single-genotype infection traits failed to predict the 'winning' genotypes in co-infections. Co-infections infected and caused lethal disease in more hosts, and produced high yields, relative to single-genotype infections. The need to share with nonkin did not cause fitness costs to either genotype. In fact, in hosts feeding on Pi. sylvestris, one genotype gained increased yields in mixed-genotype infections. These results are discussed in relation to theory surrounding adaptive responses to competition with nonkin for limited resources.

AB Selective logging is a dominant form of land use in the Amazon basin and throughout the humid tropics, yet little is known about the spatial variability of forest canopy gap formation and closure following timber harvests. We established chronosequences of large-area (14-158 ha) selective logging sites spanning a 3.5-year period of forest regeneration and two distinct harvest methods: conventional logging (CL) and reduced-impact logging (RIL). Our goals were to: (1) determine the spatial characteristics of canopy gap fraction immediately following selective logging in the eastern Amazon; (2) determine the degree and rate of canopy closure in early years following harvest among the major landscape features associated with logging - tree falls, roads, skid trails and log decks; and (3) quantify spatial and temporal differences in canopy opening and closure in high- and low-damage harvests (CL vs. RIL).
   Across a wide range of harvest intensities (2.6-6.4 felled trees ha(-1)), the majority of ground damage occurred as skid trails (4-12%), whereas log decks and roads were only a small contributor to the total ground damage (<2%). Despite similar timber harvest intensities, CL resulted in more ground damage than RIL. Neither the number of log decks nor their individual or total area was correlated with the number of trees removed or intensity of tree harvesting (trees ha(-1)). The area of skids was well correlated with the ground area damaged (m(2)) per tree felled.
   In recently logged forest (0.5 years postharvest), gap fractions were highest in log decks (mean RIL=0.83, CL=0.99) and lowest in tree-fall areas (RIL: 0.26, CL: 0.41). However, the small surface area of log decks made their contribution to the total area-integrated forest gap fraction minor. In contrast, tree falls accounted for more than two-thirds of the area disturbed, but the canopy gaps associated with felled trees were much smaller than for log decks, roads and skids. Canopy openings decreased in size with distance from each felled tree crown. At 0.5 years postharvest, the area initially affected by the felling of each tree was approximately 100 m in radius for CL and 50 m for RIL. Initial decreases in gap fraction during the first 1.5 years of regrowth diminished in subsequent years. Throughout the 3.5-year period of forest recovery, tree-fall gap fractions remained higher in CL than in RIL treatments, but canopy gap closure rates were higher in CL than in RIL areas. During the observed recovery period, the canopy gap area affected by harvesting decreased in radius around each felled tree from 100 to 40 m in CL, and from 50 to 10 m in RIL. The results suggest that the full spatial and temporal dynamics of canopy gap fraction must be understood and monitored to predict the effects of selective logging on regional energy balance and climate regimes, biogeochemical processes including carbon cycling, and plant and faunal population dynamics. This paper also shows that remote sensing of log decks alone will not provide an accurate assessment of total forest area impacted by selective logging, nor will it be closely correlated to damage levels and canopy gap closure rates.

AB Nine leaf traits (area, fresh weight, dry weight, volume, density, thickness, specific leaf area (SLA), dry matter content (LDMC), leaf nitrogen content (LNC)) from ten plant species at eight sites in southern mediterranean France were investigated in order to assess their variability along a climatic gradient and their ranking congruency power. After examination of trait correlation patterns, we reduced the nine initial leaf traits to four traits, representative of three correlation groups: allometric traits (dry weight), functional traits (SLA and dry matter percentage) and Leaf Thickness. We analysed the variability of these four leaf traits at species and site level. We observed that between species variation (between 64.5 for SLA and 91% for LDMC) is higher than within species variation. Allowing a good congruency of species ranking assessed by spearman rank correlation () and a good reallocation of individuals to species by discriminant analysis. A site level variability (between 0.7% for Dry weight and 6.9% for SLA) was identified and environmental parameters (altitude, temperature, precipitation, nitrogen, pH) were considered as probable control factors. We found significant correlation between SLA, LDMC and the average minimum temperature (respectively r=0.87 and r=-0,9) and no correlation for the other traits or environmental parameters. Furthermore, we conclude that two leaf traits appear to be central in describing species: specific leaf area (SLA), percentage of dry matter (LDMC. While, SLA and LDMC are strongly correlated, LDMC appears to be less variable than SLA. According to our results the Dry Matter Content (or its reversal Leaf Water Content) appears the best leaf trait to be quantified for plant functional screening. Leaf thickness appeared to be rather uncorrelated with other leaf traits and show no environmental contingency; its variability could not have been explained in this study. Further studies should focus on this trait.

AB Variation partitioning by (partial) constrained ordination is a popular method for exploratory data analysis, but applications are mostly restricted to simple ecological questions only involving two or three sets of explanatory variables, such as climate and soil, this because of the rapid increase in complexity of calculations and results with an increasing number of explanatory variable sets. The existence is demonstrated of a unique algorithm for partitioning the variation in a set of response variables on n sets of explanatory variables; it is shown how the 2n - 1 non-overlapping components of variation can be calculated. Methods for evaluation and presentation of variation partitioning results are reviewed, and a recursive algorithm is proposed for distributing the many small components of variation over simpler components. Several issues related to the use and usefulness of variation partitioning with n sets of explanatory variables are discussed with reference to a worked example.

AB We constructed a phylogenetic hypothesis for western Indian Ocean sunbirds (Nectarinia) and used this to investigate the geographic pattern of their diversification among the islands of the Indian Ocean. A total of 1309 bp of mitochondrial sequence data was collected from the island sunbird taxa of the western Indian Ocean region, combined with sequence data from a selection of continental (African and Asian) sunbirds. Topological and branch length information combined with estimated divergence times are used to present hypotheses for the direction and sequence of colonization events in relation to the geological history of the Indian Ocean region. Indian Ocean sunbirds fall into two well-supported clades, consistent with two independent colonizations from Africa within the last 3.9 million years. The first clade contains island populations representing the species Nectarinia notata, while the second includes Nectarinia souimanga, Nectarinia humbloti, Nectarinia dussumieri, and Nectarinia coquereli. With respect to the latter clade, application of Bremer's [Syst. Biol. 41 (1992) 436] ancestral areas method permits us to posit the Comoros archipelago as the point of initial colonization in the Indian Ocean. The subsequent expansion of the souimanga clade across its Indian Ocean range occurred rapidly, with descendants of this early expansion remaining on the Comoros and granitic Seychelles. The data suggest that a more recent expansion from Anjouan in the Comoros group led to the colonization of Madagascar by sunbirds representing the souimanga clade. In concordance with the very young geological age of the Aldabra group, the sunbirds of this archipelago have diverged little from the Madagascar population; this is attributed to colonization of the Aldabra archipelago in recent times, in one or possibly two or more waves originating from Madagascar. The overall pattern of sunbird radiation across Indian Ocean islands indicates that these birds disperse across ocean barriers with relative ease, but that their subsequent evolutionary success probably depends on a variety of factors including prior island occupation by competing species.

AB 1. Maternal diet can significantly influence the quality and size of eggs, and this may, in turn, influence the fitness of offspring. In this study, we show how antioxidants (vitamin E compounds and carotenoids) in the diet of female zebra finches influence the concentrations of antioxidants in their eggs. Antioxidants are biochemicals derived from the diet, which reduce damage to cell membranes caused by the free radicals produced during normal metabolism and growth.
   2. Females were given either a seed-only or a seed + rearing food diet prior to egg laying. The seed + rearing food diet was more enriched with carotenoids, but had lower amounts of less effective antioxidants, such as gamma-tocopherol. Eggs were collected as they were laid, then analysed to determine the concentrations of antioxidants using high-performance liquid chromatography.
   3. Females in the two food groups had similar rates of food consumption and laid similar sized clutches. Females on the seed-only diet produced eggs of similar mass to that of females on the seed + rearing food diet.
   4. The concentrations of the most effective antioxidant (alpha-tocopherol) were higher in the eggs of females from the seed-only group and, for both food groups, concentrations decreased with successively laid eggs within clutches. The concentration of carotenoids in egg yolks did not differ between food treatments, but also decreased with successive eggs. Less effective antioxidants were relatively under-represented in eggs in relation to their availability in food, and were deposited in similar overall amounts between the two food treatments, and independently of laying sequence.
   5. Our results indicate that egg size is not necessarily an accurate guide to egg quality, especially when comparing between clutches of different females or across species. Females may be able to adjust egg composition to influence offspring quality variation within broods, possibly traded-off against their personal use of antioxidants, their future reproductive success, control over sibling competition within their brood and/or brood reduction.

AB Examining patterns of inter-population genetic diversity can provide valuable information about both historical and current evolutionary processes affecting a species. Population genetic studies of flying and migratory species such as bats and birds have traditionally shown minimal population substructure, characterized by high levels of gene flow between populations(1,2). In general, strongly substructured mammalian populations either are separated by non-traversable barriers or belong to terrestrial species with low dispersal abilities(3). Species with female philopatry ( the tendency to remain in or consistently return to the natal territory) might show strong substructure when examined with maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA, but this substructure generally disappears when biparentally inherited markers are used, owing to male-mediated gene flow(4). Male-biased dispersal is considered typical for mammals(5), and philopatry in both sexes is rare. Here we show strong population substructure in a migratory bat species, and philopatry in both sexes, as indicated by concordance of nuclear and mtDNA findings. Furthermore, the genetic structure correlates with local biomes and differentiation in wing morphology. There is therefore a close correlation of genetic and morphological differentiation in sympatric subspecific populations of this mammalian species.

AB Estimation of individual fitness - i.e. description of the extent to which an individual's genes are represented in future generations - is a feature central to most evolutionary studies. Lifetime reproductive success (LRS) is a commonly used estimate of individual fitness, but because it is rate-insensitive (i.e. timing of reproductive events is not incorporated), it may give a biased estimate of fitness when reproductive timing is an important component of fitness. A review of all empirical studies which have used a recently derived, rate-sensitive estimate of individual fitness, kind revealed that kind ranks the fitness of phenotypes differently from LRS, and that this difference may lead to different conclusions about strength of selection acting on phenotypic traits. However, although kind may be a better estimate of individual fitness than LRS in certain situations (e. g. in growing populations), its application is not always unproblematic. For instance, in contrast to rate-insensitive estimates of individual fitness, the kind is sensitive to the age at which offspring are censused and there is little consensus among published studies on when offspring should be counted. Further, rate-sensitivity does not necessarily improve a fitness estimate in spatio-temporal variable environments. We suggest that the ultimate test on the applicability of kind vs. LRS as practical measures of individual fitness in quantifying selection should come from studies which correlate these estimates with actual number of descendants left more than one generation further in future.

AB The effect of nitrogen (N) recycling on tissue delta(15)N was studied using drought-deciduous shrubs (Encelia farinosa and E. frutescens) and deciduous trees (Quercus rubra and Q. alba) to determine if isotope discrimination occurs with N reabsorption or reallocation.
   There was substantial reabsorption of leaf nitrogen before abscission in all species, yet there was no difference in the delta(15)N of living vs abscised leaves, suggesting no isotope discrimination with reabsorption. However, the contribution of stored N for leaf production resulted in a difference in foliar and absorbed nitrogen delta(15)N, suggesting that isotope discrimination occurs with reallocation.
   The contribution of stored nitrogen to leaf production varied with timing of leaf development: leaves produced first had a delta(15)N that reflected utilization of both absorbed and stored N, yet the contribution of stored N decreased over time.
   The results from this study as well as previous research on intraplant variation in isotopic composition suggest that caution needs to be exercised when interpreting foliar delta(15)N because it is not always a reliable indicator of whole-plant delta(15)N.

AB Geographical gradients in species richness and the degree to which different taxa show congruent patterns remain unknown for many taxonomic groups. Here, I examined broad-scale species richness patterns in five groups of freshwater organisms; macrophytes, dragonflies, stoneflies, aquatic beetles and fishes. The analyses were based on provincial distribution records in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. In general, variation in species richness across provinces was concordant among the groups, but stoneflies showed weaker negative relationships with the other taxonomic groups. Species richness in most groups decreased with increasing latitude and altitude, and a considerable part of the variation was explained by mean July temperature. However, stoneflies showed a reversed pattern, with species richness correlating positively, albeit more weakly, with mean provincial altitude. Nevertheless, combined species richness of all five taxa showed a strong relationship with mean July temperature, accounting for 74% of variation in provincial species richness alone. Such temperature-controlled patterns suggest that regional freshwater biodiversity will strongly respond to climate change, with repercussions for local community organization in freshwater ecosystems in Fennoscandia.

AB The hydrologic regime of the Illinois River has been altered over the past 100 years. Locks and dams regulate water surface elevations and flow, enabling commercial navigation to continue year round. This study relates changes in water surface elevation to fish abundance in the river, and establishes target criteria for operating locks and dams. Using longterm records of daily river stage, we identified ecologically meaningful hydrological parameters for eight gage locations along the Illinois River. Inter-annual variability of a long-term fisheries dataset beginning in 1957 was related to variability in stage, flood and recession duration, frequency, timing, and rate of change of water levels. Reversals in water surface elevation, maximum stage levels, and length of the spring flood were the most important parameters Influencing abundance of age-zero fishes in annual collections. Smallmouth buffalo (Ictiobus bubalus), black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunneins), and white bass (Morone chrysops) were most abundant in samples during years that approximated the natural water level regime. Of the 33 hydrologic parameters evaluated for the entire water year from an Illinois River gage site on La Grange Reach, all except average stage in January and Julian date (JD) of maximum stage had moderate or high hydrologic alteration based on the historical range of variation (RVA). The highest degree of hydrologic alteration was for minimum stage levels (1-day, 3-day, and 7-day), rate-of-rise, and rate-of-fall. Other parameters that have been severely altered were 30-day minimum stage, 90-day maximum stage, and the annual number of water level reversals. Operations of the La Grange and Peoria locks and dams could be modified so water level variability would approximate that of the late 1800s, when fish and wildlife resources were abundant. The water regime could be regulated to maintain navigation and improve conditions for native plants and animals without increasing flood damages. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Non-native species diversity of plants and fishes in the contiguous 48 United States is analyzed to measure the influence of human population size, time of modern settlement, area and native species diversity. Besides exotic (from outside USA) plants, four types of non-native fishes are examined: established exotic fishes, reported exotic fishes, US fishes not native to a state, and native state fishes moved to new locations in a state. Human population size is most highly correlated with exotic plant diversity (r > 70%) but is still significantly correlated with most types of non-native fish diversity. Time of modern settlement significantly increases nonnative plant (but not most fish) diversity, even after the effects of current population size are removed. These patterns occur because most non-native plants are imported for landscaping, farming and other uses intimately linked to human settlements whereas, almost half of non-native fishes were released by state agencies for sport, often into large western states with relatively few humans. This also explains why state area is significantly correlated with all types of non-native fish diversity, but not non-native plant diversity where smaller eastern states have more people and more years of settlement which increase non-native plant diversity. Positive correlation of non-native plant diversity with native plant diversity is found, as humans tend to settle in states with high native species diversity. In contrast, negative correlation between non-native fish and native fish diversity is found. These findings may help predict non-native species diversity if past trends continue. They also imply that the most cost-effective way to slow nonnative species impact may be to focus where human population is still small, because rate of establishment of non-native species decreases with increasing human population.

AB Evolutionary history of Muscicapidae flycatchers is inferred from nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence comparisons and population genetic analysis of nuclear and mtDNA markers. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on sequences from the two genomes yielded similar trees with respect to the order at which the species split off. However, the genetic distances fitted a nonlinear, polynomial model reflecting diminishing divergence rate of the mtDNA sequences compared to the nuclear DNA sequences. This could be explained by Haldane's rule because genetic isolation might evolve more rapidly on the mitochondrial rather than the nuclear genome in birds. This is because hybrid sterility of the heterogametic sex (females) would predate that of the homogametic sex (males), leading to sex biased introgression of nuclear genes. Analyses of present hybrid zones of pied (Ficedula hypoleuca) and collared flycatchers (E albicollis) may indicate a slight sexual bias in rate of introgression, but the introgression rates were too low to allow proper statistical analyses. It is suggested, however, that the observed deviation from linearity can be explained by a more rapid mutational saturation of the mtDNA sequences than of the nuclear DNA sequences, as supported by analyses of third codon position transversions at two protein coding mtDNA genes. A phylogeographic scenario for the black and white flycatcher species is suggested based on interpretation of the genetic data obtained. Four species appear to have diverged from a common ancestor relatively simultaneously during the Pleistocene. After the last glaciation period, pied and collared flycatchers expanded their breeding ranges and eventually came into secondary contact in Central and Eastern Europe and on the Baltic Isles.

AB Artificial nests are commonly used to investigate relative rates of nest predation in birds, but several methodological considerations need to be addressed before results from natural and artificial nests can be compared. Using field and laboratory experiments, we examined responses of predators to visual and olfactory cues that were associated with wicker nests and their contents. Avian predators did not discriminate between wicker nests dipped in mud and those covered by a camouflage fabric, whereas mammalian predators showed a weak tendency to depredate camouflaged nests. Nests containing plasticine eggs were depredated more often than nests containing only quail eggs and finch eggs, although no response to number of plasticine eggs in nests was found. The higher predation of nests with plasticine eggs may have resulted because small mammals, relying on olfactory cues, comprised a large portion of the predator assemblage. Field results were supported in tests where captive deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) were attracted to assortments of egg types that included plasticine. Time required by captive deer mice to penetrate quail eggs and finch eggs versus plasticine eggs varied as a function of egg size and shell thickness and strength. Overall, domestic finch eggs provided a better alternative to quail eggs because they were small enough to allow detection of predation events by small mammals and did not have an unnatural odor Like plasticine. Potential problems with nest concealment, egg visibility, egg odors, and other factors must be resolved to enhance the design and reliability of artificial nest experiments.

AB Vegetation models based on multiple logistic regression are of growing interest in environmental studies and decision making. The relatively simple sigmoid Gaussian optimum curves are most common in current vegetation models, although several different other response shapes are known. However, improvements in the technical means for handling statistical data now facilitate fast and interactive calculation of alternative complex, more data-related, non-parametric models. The aim in this study was to determine whether, and if so how often, a complex response shape could be more adequate than a linear or quadratic one. Using the framework of Generalized Additive Models, both parametric (linear and quadratic) and non-parametric (smoothed) stepwise multiple logistic regression techniques were applied to a large data set on wetlands and water plants and to six environmental variables: pH, chloride, orthophosphate, inorganic nitrogen, thickness of the sapropelium layer and depth of the water-body. All models were tested for their goodness-of-fit and significance. Of all 156 generalized additive models calculated, 77% were found to contain at least one smoothed predictor variable, i.e. an environmental variable with a response better fitted by a complex, non-parametric, than by a linear or quadratic parametric curve. Chloride was the variable with the highest incidence of smoothed responses (48%). Generally, a smoothed curve was preferable in 23% of all species-variable correlations calculated, compared to 25% and 18% for sigmoid and Gaussian shaped curves, respectively. Regression models of two plant species are presented in detail to illustrate the potential of smoothers to produce good fitting and biologically sound response models in comparison to linear and polynomial regression models. We found Generalized Additive Modelling a useful and practical technique for improving current regression-based vegetation models by allowing for alternative, complex response shapes.

AB The harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) has the most extensive distribution of any phocid seal species. An analysis of population structure in this species across its European range was made using 7 phocid derived microsatellites in a sample of 1,029 individuals from 12 separate geographic areas. Despite the species potential for long-distance movement, significant genetic differentiation between areas was observed using an unbiased estimator of R-ST. Six distinct population units were identified: Ireland-Scotland, English east coast, Waddensea, western Scandinavia (Norway-Kattegat-Skagerrak-west Baltic), east Baltic, and Iceland. Little local substructuring is present along coastlines with a continuous distribution of breeding animals, but differentiation does increase with geographic distance. The degree of differentiation is greater over equivalent distances where the distribution is discontinuous, such as along coasts where breeding colonies are separated by large distances or by stretches of open sea. Patterns of population differentiation derived from microsatellites are very similar to those obtained from previous mitochondrial DNA analysis and suggest that philopatry in harbor seals operates over 300-500 km. In Europe, harbor seals have experienced a complex demographic history and patterns of population structure are likely to have been affected by natural environmental influences such as Pleistocene glaciations and epizootics. Comparison of Nm values from an unbiased estimator of R-ST, G(ST), and theta are consistent and, in some cases, may indicate populations where conditions deviate from the expectations of the R-ST model.

AB Effects of pollution on biotic integrity are difficult to identify when correlations occur between environmental gradients and contaminant effects, as they do in estuaries. In this broad-scale study, we used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to distinguish influences of natural and contaminant-related gradients on macrobenthic community structure among 319 sites from estuaries throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico. Natural gradients in salinity, depth, and sediment composition obscured the detection of macrobenthic responses to sediment contamination. After adjusting for natural environmental variability, however, partial CCA revealed important macrobenthic variation in relation to sediment contamination. A rotated principal component analysis (PCA) distinguished five composite environmental factors, each largely reflecting contaminant or natural variation. Two complex gradients in sediment contamination identified by the PCA diverged in partial CCA space and correlated with different macrobenthic indicator taxa. Contaminant gradients represented variation in two different classes of sediment contaminants: trace metals and organic chemicals. Dispersion patterns of CCA site coordinates enabled cross validation of implied contamination-related variation in community function and the utility of several interpretive or management metrics. Trophic diversity decreased with sediment contamination, linking shifts in macrobenthic community function and community structure along contaminant gradients. The CCA model complemented an earlier benthic index developed from these data to examine biotic integrity, but the benthic index could not discern macrobenthic responses to the different contaminant gradients. Neither was the benthic index useful for showing transitions in macrobenthic community structure commensurate with different levels of contamination. Ampelisca amphipod sediment bioassays were inadequate for identifying contaminant effects on biotic integrity, whereas Mysidopsis mysid sediment bioassays conservatively reflected sediment contamination and associated macrobenthic indicators.

AB Ecomorphological correlates were sought among ten species of distantly related subtropical seagrass fishes. Morphometric data associated with feeding and microhabitat utilization were compared by principal components analysis, cluster analysis, and canonical correspondence analysis to dietary data. Morphology was generally a poor predictor of diet except for a group of mid-water planktotrophic filter feeders. Separation of the species along morphological axes appears to be related more to microhabitat utilization resulting in three major groups: (1) a group of planktotrophic, mid-water fishes specialized for cruising and seeking out evasive prey characterized by a compressed fusiform body, forked caudal fin, long, closely spaced gill rakers, short to intermediate length pectoral fin, pointed pectoral fin, large lateral eye, short head, and a terminal or subterminal mouth; (2) slow swimming, less maneuverable epibenthic fishes that pick or suck their prey off the substrate. They are united by more rounded caudal and pectoral fins, and short or no gill rakers; and (3) a group of more mobile and maneuverable epibenthic foragers characterized by a more compressed, sub-gibbose body, long, pointed pectoral fins, forked caudal fins, large lateral eyes, subterminal mouth, and greater jaw protrusibility. Cases of convergence in trophic and microhabitat utilization characters were apparent in some of the groups.

TI MEIOFAUNA RESPONSE TO THE AGIP-ABRUZZO OIL-SPILL IN SUBTIDAL SEDIMENTS
   OF THE LIGURIAN SEA
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
ID NEMATODE-COPEPOD RATIO; ORGANIC POLLUTION; COMMUNITIES; ECOLOGY
AB The effects of the Agip Abruzzo oil spill (10 April 1991) on meiobenthic assemblages of the Ligurian Sea were investigated using samples collected from January 1991 to January 1992. Meiofauna appeared to be highly sensitive to hydrocarbon stress since the oil spill determined an observable decline in density, relative to the pre-pollution conditions. Such patterns were unusual since reported in a period in which, because of the usual seasonality of Mediterranean meiofauna, we would expect an increase in density. In particular, clear decreases in nematode, turbellarian and foraminiferan densities were observed. Oil-induced disturbance had no influence on copepods, which slightly increased after the oil spill, probably because they were dominated by epibenthic forms which were able to escape from the toxic effects of hydrocarbon pollution. The results of classification anti ordination analyses as well as the univariate indices indicated that the level of the major meiofaunal groups was not sufficient for detecting oil-induced disturbance, but nematodes at the genus level proved to be highly efficient. The oil spill determined evident changes in terms of a decrease in N-1 diversity, Changes were also observed in richness and in the k-dominance curves of nematode genera, showing a decrease in overall community diversity. One month after the oil spill, diversity patterns were similar to pre-pollution conditions. In contrast, the nematode:copepod ratio and its modifications were not sensitive to the induced stress and proved to be inadequate for detecting hydrocarbon pollution. Similarly, no significant variations were observed when analysing the index of trophic diversity. However, the nonselective deposit feeding nematodes (1B) declined after the oil spill thus indicating possible changes in the functional characteristics of the meiobenthic assemblages. Meiofaunal response to oil pollution was extremely rapid. Meiofaunal structure was significantly affected only immediately after the oil spill (22 April 1991). Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that the structural characteristics of meiobenthos recovered after only 2 weeks and were almost indistinguishable from pre-pollution conditions a few weeks later, indicating the high resilience of these meiobenthic assemblages.

AB The honeybee is the primary managed species worldwide for both crop pollination and honey production. Owing to beekeeping activity, its high relative abundance potentially affects the structure and functioning of pollination networks in natural ecosystems. Given that evidences about beekeeping impacts are restricted to observational studies of specific species and theoretical simulations, we still lack experimental data to test for their larger-scale impacts on biodiversity. Here we used a three-year field experiment in a natural ecosystem to compare the effects of pre- and post-establishment stages of beehives on the pollination network structure and plant reproductive success. Our results show that beekeeping reduces the diversity of wild pollinators and interaction links in the pollination networks. It disrupts their hierarchical structural organization causing the loss of interactions by generalist species, and also impairs pollination services by wild pollinators through reducing the reproductive success of those plant species highly visited by honeybees. High-density beekeeping in natural areas appears to have lasting, more serious negative impacts on biodiversity than was previously assumed.

AB With the development of mobile internet technology, on-demand ridesourcing services have rapidly spread across the world and have caused debates in the transportation industry. While many researchers have begun to study the characteristics and impacts of ridesourcing, there are few published studies specifically on ridesplitting, a ridesourcing service that matches riders with similar origins or destinations to the same ridesourcing driver and vehicle in real time. This paper aims to explore the characteristics and effects of ridesplitting using observed ridesourcing data provided by DiDi Chuxing that contain complete datasets of the ridesourcing trajectories and orders in the city of Chengdu, China. First, a ridesplitting trip identification (RTI) algorithm is developed to separate the shared rides from the single rides (non-ridesplitting orders) and derive ridesplitting scales. Second, a ridesplitting trajectory reconstruction (RTR) algorithm is proposed to estimate the ridesplitting effects on delays and detours. Then, we analyze and compare the scales, spatiotemporal patterns and travel characteristics between shared rides and single rides, which are very different. The results show that the current percentage of ridesplitting in ridesourcing is still low (6-7%), which may be explained by the extra delay (about 10 min on average), detour (about 1.55 km on average), and degraded travel time reliability caused by ridesplitting. In addition, built environment factors, such as density, diversity, and development, are also correlated with ridesplitting demand and delay. The findings of this study can help better understand the features of ridesplitting and develop strategies for improving its use in emerging ridesourcing services.

AB Invasive alien species are a major driver of global environmental change and a range of management interventions are needed to manage their effects on biodiversity, ecosystem services, human well-being and local livelihoods. Stakeholder engagement is widely advocated to integrate diverse knowledge and perspectives in the management of invasive species and to deal with potential conflicts of interest. We reviewed the literature in the ISI Web of Science on stakeholder engagement (the process of involving stakeholders (actors) in decision making, management actions and knowledge creation) in invasion science to assess and understand what has been done (looking at approaches and methodologies used, stakeholders involved, and outcomes from engagement) and to make recommendations for future work.
   Research on stakeholder engagement in invasion science has increased over the last decade, helping to improve scientific knowledge and contributing towards policy formulation and co-implementation of management. However, many challenges remain and engagement could be made more effective. For example, most studies engage only one stakeholder group passively using questionnaires, primarily for assessing local knowledge and perceptions. Although useful for management and policy planning, these stakeholders are not active participants and there is no two-way flow of knowledge. To make stakeholder involvement more useful, we encourage more integrative and collaborative engagement to (1) improve co-design, co-creation and co-implementation of research and management actions; (2) promote social learning and provide feedback to stakeholders; (3) enhance collaboration and partnerships beyond the natural sciences and academia (interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaboration); and (4) discuss some practical and policy suggestions for improving stakeholder engagement in invasion science research and management. This will help facilitate different stakeholders to work better together, allowing problems associated with biological invasions to be tackled more holistically and successfully.

AB Current mitigation efforts and existing future commitments are inadequate to accomplish the Paris Agreement temperature goals. In light of this, research and debate are intensifying on the possibilities of additionally employing proposed climate geoengineering technologies, either through atmospheric carbon dioxide removal or farther-reaching interventions altering the Earth's radiative energy budget. Although research indicates that several techniques may eventually have the physical potential to contribute to limiting climate change, all are in early stages of development, involve substantial uncertainties and risks, and raise ethical and governance dilemmas. Based on present knowledge, climate geoengineering techniques cannot be relied on to significantly contribute to meeting the Paris Agreement temperature goals.

AB Human-induced biodiversity change impairs ecosystem functions crucial to human wellbeing. However, the consequences of this change for ecosystem multifunctionality are poorly understood beyond effects of plant species loss, particularly in regions with high biodiversity across trophic levels. Here we adopt a multitrophic perspective to analyze how biodiversity affects multifunctionality in biodiverse subtropical forests. We consider 22 independent measurements of nine ecosystem functions central to energy and nutrient flow across trophic levels. We find that individual functions and multifunctionality are more strongly affected by the diversity of heterotrophs promoting decomposition and nutrient cycling, and by plant functional-trait diversity and composition, than by tree species richness. Moreover, cascading effects of higher trophic-level diversity on functions originating from lower trophic-level processes highlight that multitrophic biodiversity is key to understanding drivers of multifunctionality. A broader perspective on biodiversity-multifunctionality relationships is crucial for sustainable ecosystem management in light of non-random species loss and intensified biotic disturbances under future environmental change.

AB 1. Tropical forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle, but the drivers of net forest biomass change (i.e. net carbon sequestration) are poorly understood. Here, we evaluate how abiotic factors (soil conditions and disturbance) and biotic factors (forest structure, diversity and community trait composition) shape three important demographic processes (biomass recruitment, growth and mortality) and how these underlie net biomass change.
   2. To test this, we evaluated 9 years of biomass dynamics using 48 1-ha plots in a Bolivian tropical moist forest, and measured for the most abundant species eight functional traits that are important for plant carbon gain and loss. Demographic processes were related to the abiotic and biotic factors using structural equation models.
   3. Variation in net biomass change across plots was mostly due to stand-level mortality, but mortality itself could not be predicted at this scale. Contrary to expectations, we found that species richness and trait composition - which is an indicator for the mass-ratio theory - had little effect on the demographic processes. Biomass recruitment (i.e. the biomass growth by recruiting trees) increased with higher resource availability (i.e. water and light) and with high species richness, probably because of increased resource use efficiency. Biomass growth of larger, established trees increased with higher sand content, which may facilitate root growth of larger trees to deeper soil layers.
   4. In sum, diversity and mass-ratio are of limited importance for the productivity of this forest. Instead, in this moist tropical forest with a marked dry season, demographic processes are most strongly determined by soil texture, soil water availability and forest structure. Only by simultaneously evaluating multiple abiotic and biotic drivers of demographic processes, better insights can be gained into mechanisms playing a role in the carbon sequestration potential of tropical forests and natural systems in general.

AB Climate effects and human impacts, that is, nutrient enrichment, simultaneously drive spatial biodiversity patterns. However, there is little consensus about their independent effects on biodiversity. Here we manipulate nutrient enrichment in aquatic microcosms in subtropical and subarctic regions (China and Norway, respectively) to show clear segregation of bacterial species along temperature gradients, and decreasing alpha and gamma diversity toward higher nutrients. The temperature dependence of species richness is greatest at extreme nutrient levels, whereas the nutrient dependence of species richness is strongest at intermediate temperatures. For species turnover rates, temperature effects are strongest at intermediate and two extreme ends of nutrient gradients in subtropical and subarctic regions, respectively. Species turnover rates caused by nutrients do not increase toward higher temperatures. These findings illustrate direct effects of temperature and nutrients on biodiversity, and indirect effects via primary productivity, thus providing insights into how nutrient enrichment could alter biodiversity under future climate scenarios.

AB Stakeholder analysis and engagement processes are recognised as essential in environmental and natural resources management (ENRM). Underpinning these processes is the identification of stakeholders, an often tacit process which finds the practitioner responsible for stakeholder analysis or engagement sifting through all of society to determine who is awarded stakeholder status for the given project or issue. While the ENRM literature provides guidance for stakeholder analysis and engagement, there has not been the same level of examination of the practical approaches to and assumptions underlying stakeholder identification by practitioners working in the field. This research extends on the ENRM stakeholder analysis and engagement literature by exploring the approaches to identification as used by ENRM practitioners. Semi-structured interviews (n=20) were conducted with ENRM practitioners, leading to the classification of eight approaches to stakeholder identification. These approaches are discussed as the 'art' and 'science' of stakeholder identification. Practitioners' conceptualisations of the terms stakeholder, community, and the citizenry are discussed, and differences in understandings of these critical terms are outlined based on the broad domain of ENRM in which the practitioner is operating (land use change versus agricultural extension or community engagement). The social structures of relevance to stakeholder identification (individual, social constituency, group, organisation) are presented, and practitioners' perspectives on the role of groups are discussed. Through explicating the approaches to identification of stakeholders, this research offers new perspectives on a significant element of ENRM. These insights provide greater clarity on the practices which shape stakeholder analysis and engagement in ENRM, and highlight the importance of acknowledging the privileged position of the practitioner in deciding who is awarded stakeholder status in a project or issue.

AB Background: Several phylogenomic analyses have recently demonstrated the need to account simultaneously for incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and hybridization when inferring a species phylogeny. A maximum likelihood approach was introduced recently for inferring species phylogenies in the presence of both processes, and showed very good results. However, computing the likelihood of a model in this case is computationally infeasible except for very small data sets.
   Results: Inspired by recent work on the pseudo-likelihood of species trees based on rooted triples, we introduce the pseudo-likelihood of a phylogenetic network, which, when combined with a search heuristic, provides a statistical method for phylogenetic network inference in the presence of ILS. Unlike trees, networks are not always uniquely encoded by a set of rooted triples. Therefore, even when given sufficient data, the method might converge to a network that is equivalent under rooted triples to the true one, but not the true one itself. The method is computationally efficient and has produced very good results on the data sets we analyzed. The method is implemented in PhyloNet, which is publicly available in open source.
   Conclusions: Maximum pseudo-likelihood allows for inferring species phylogenies in the presence of hybridization and ILS, while scaling to much larger data sets than is currently feasible under full maximum likelihood. The nonuniqueness of phylogenetic networks encoded by a system of rooted triples notwithstanding, the proposed method infers the correct network under certain scenarios, and provides candidates for further exploration under other criteria and/or data in other scenarios.

AB The soil provides a great variety of microhabitats for myriad organisms of different size, physiological activity, behavior and ecosystem function. Besides abundance of participating soil organisms, their species diversity facilitates maximum exploitation of the resources available in the different habitats. At various levels of resolution, species can be categorized into classes performing ecosystem functions and, within each functional class, into guilds of species with similar life course characteristics. Measurement of the diversity and abundance of species within a functional class provides insights into the nature of ecosystem functions and services and to the health of the soil. At higher resolution, species diversity within guilds of a functional class may infer the degree of exploitation of available resources and the complementarity of an ecosystem service; diversity among the guilds of a functional class may indicate successional complementarity of the services. A diversity of guilds within a functional class expands the range of conditions over which ecosystem services are performed while species diversity within a functional class and its guilds contributes to the magnitude of the services. Consequently, diversity of species within functional classes is a key element of the biological component of soil health. In the context of ecosystem services and soil health, the biomass or metabolic activity of species are more useful measures of their abundance than numbers ofindividuals. Thus, understanding of soil health and ecosystem function requires, besides knowledge of species diversity within functional classes, assessment of the range of functions currently performed in the system and the abundances of organisms by which they are performed. We propose a diversity-weighted abundance product for comparison of the functional magnitude of different assemblages of like organisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Variation in prey resources influences the diet and behaviour of predators. When prey become limiting, predators may travel farther to find preferred food or adjust to existing local resources. When predators are habitat limited, local resource abundance impacts foraging success. We analysed the diet of Myotis lucifugus (little brown bats) from Nova Scotia (eastern Canada) to the Northwest Territories (north-western Canada). This distribution includes extremes of season length and temperature and encompasses colonies on rural monoculture farms, and in urban and unmodified areas. We recognized nearly 600 distinct species of prey, of which approximate to 30% could be identified using reference sequence libraries. We found a higher than expected use of lepidopterans, which comprised a range of dietary richness from approximate to 35% early in the summer to approximate to 55% by late summer. Diptera were the second largest prey group consumed, representing approximate to 45% of dietary diversity early in the summer. We observed extreme local dietary variability and variation among seasons and years. Based on the species of insects that were consumed, we observed that two locations support prey species with extremely low pollution and acidification tolerances, suggesting that these are areas without environmental contamination. We conclude that there is significant local population variability in little brown bat diet that is likely driven by seasonal and geographical changes in insect diversity, and that this prey may be a good indicator of environment quality.

AB Theory predicts a trade-off between investments in precopulatory (ornaments and armaments) and postcopulatory (testes and ejaculates) sexual traits due to the costs associated with their growth and maintenance within the finite energy resources available. Empirical studies, however, have revealed considerable inconsistency in the strength and direction of relationships among these sexual traits. Ambiguity may result from variance in the marginal benefits gained by increasing investments in either pre-or postcopulatory sexual traits. Here, in a broad comparative study, we test the prediction that the relationship between pre-and postcopulatory sexual traits differs among taxa relative to the importance of male-male contest competition within them. We find that covariance between pre-and postcopulatory sexual traits gradually shifts from strongly positive to strongly negative with increasing male-male contest competition. Thus, our findings reveal a potentially unifying explanation for the oftentimes inconsistent relationships in the strength and direction of covariance among sexual traits.

AB Ongoing global warming has been implicated in shifting phenological patterns such as the timing and duration of the growing season across a wide variety of ecosystems. Linear models are routinely used to extrapolate these observed shifts in phenology into the future and to estimate changes in associated ecosystem properties such as net primary productivity. Yet, in nature, linear relationships may be special cases. Biological processes frequently follow more complex, non-linear patterns according to limiting factors that generate shifts and discontinuities, or contain thresholds beyond which responses change abruptly. This study investigates to what extent cambium phenology is associated with xylem growth and differentiation across conifer species of the northern hemisphere.
   Xylem cell production is compared with the periods of cambial activity and cell differentiation assessed on a weekly time scale on histological sections of cambium and wood tissue collected from the stems of nine species in Canada and Europe over 19 years per site from 1998 to 2011.
   The dynamics of xylogenesis were surprisingly homogeneous among conifer species, although dispersions from the average were obviously observed. Within the range analysed, the relationships between the phenological timings were linear, with several slopes showing values close to or not statistically different from 1. The relationships between the phenological timings and cell production were distinctly non-linear, and involved an exponential pattern
   The trees adjust their phenological timings according to linear patterns. Thus, shifts of one phenological phase are associated with synchronous and comparable shifts of the successive phases. However, small increases in the duration of xylogenesis could correspond to a substantial increase in cell production. The findings suggest that the length of the growing season and the resulting amount of growth could respond differently to changes in environmental conditions.

AB We estimated the latitudinal velocity (km/decade) of northern and southern boundaries of core distributions for 30 woody taxa over the last 16000years (biotic velocities) using networks of fossil pollen records, and compared these with climate velocities estimated from CCSM3 simulations. Biotic velocities were faster during periods of rapid temperature change (i.e. 16 to 7ka) than times of relative stability (i.e. 7 to 1ka), with a consistent northward movement of northern and southern boundaries. For most taxa, biotic velocities were faster for northern than for southern boundaries between 12 and 7ka, resulting in expanding distributions. For individual time periods, biotic velocities were as fast or faster than climate velocities calculated using multivariate approaches. These results indicate that climate change paced the rate of distribution shifts in both northern and southern populations while suggesting that northern populations were more sensitive. A similar sensitivity and pacing is expected under 21st century climate change.

AB Aim Determining the relative influence of niche-based and neutral processes in driving the spatial turnover of community composition is a central challenge in community ecology. Spatial patterns of functional turnover, or functional beta diversity, may capture important signals of niche-based assembly processes, but these patterns have not been quantified for communities across broad geographic and environmental gradients. Here, we analyse continental-scale patterns of species and functional beta diversity in relation to space and the environment to assess the relative importance of niche-based and neutral community assembly mechanisms. Location Eastern North America. Methods We use a continental-scale forest plot dataset and functional trait data to quantify spatial patterns of species and functional beta diversity. We use redundancy analysis-based variance partitioning to evaluate the influence of space, soil and climate on beta-diversity metrics. We use a null model approach to test for non-random functional beta diversity given the observed patterns of species turnover across spatial scales. Results Species and functional beta diversity increased with increasing geographic distance (i.e. distance decay of community similarity). Results of variance partitioning analysis show that species and functional beta diversity were spatially structured and significantly related to environmental, particularly climatic, variation. Results of null model analysis show that functional beta diversity was lower than expected based on species turnover at fine scales (<600km) and higher than expected at broad scales (>1800km). Main conclusions The observed patterns of functional beta diversity support a niche-based model of community assembly, driven by the deterministic filtering of species across environmental gradients based on their functional traits.

AB Plant pathogens and herbivores frequently co-occur on the same host plants. Despite this, little is known about the impact of their interactions on the structure of plant-based ecological communities. Here, we synthesize evidence that indicates that plant pathogens may profoundly impact arthropod performance, preference, population dynamics and community structure across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Intriguingly, the effects of plantpathogenherbivore interactions frequently cascade up and down multiple trophic levels and explain variation in the arthropod community at spatial scales ranging from patterns within single host plants to entire landscapes. This review indicates that knowledge on pathogenherbivore interactions may be crucial for understanding the dynamics of terrestrial communities.

   MECHANISMS
AB Stressful parental (usually maternal) environments can dramatically influence expression of traits in offspring, in some cases resulting in phenotypes that are adaptive to the inducing stress. The ecological and evolutionary impact of such transgenerational plasticity depends on both its persistence across generations and its adaptive value. Few studies have examined both aspects of transgenerational plasticity within a given system. Here we report the results of a growth-chamber study of adaptive transgenerational plasticity across two generations, using the widespread annual plant Polygonum persicaria as a naturally evolved model system. We grew five inbred Polygonum genetic lines in controlled dry vs. moist soil environments for two generations in a fully factorial design, producing replicate individuals of each genetic line with all permutations of grandparental and parental environment. We then measured the effects of these two-generational stress histories on traits critical for functioning in dry soil, in a third (grandchild) generation of seedling offspring raised in the dry treatment. Both grandparental and parental moisture environment significantly influenced seedling development: seedlings of drought-stressed grandparents or parents produced longer root systems that extended deeper and faster into dry soil compared with seedlings of the same genetic lines whose grandparents and/or parents had been amply watered. Offspring of stressed individuals also grew to a greater biomass than offspring of nonstressed parents and grandparents. Importantly, the effects of drought were cumulative over the course of two generations: when both grandparents and parents were drought-stressed, offspring had the greatest provisioning, germinated earliest, and developed into the largest seedlings with the most extensive root systems. Along with these functionally appropriate developmental effects, seedlings produced after two previous drought-stressed generations had significantly greater survivorship in very dry soil than did seedlings with no history of drought. These findings show that plastic responses to naturalistic resource stresses experienced by grandparents and parents can "preadapt" offspring for functioning under the same stresses in ways that measurably influence realized fitness. Possible implications of these environmentally-induced, inherited adaptations are discussed with respect to ecological distribution, persistence under novel stresses, and evolution in natural populations.

AB We examined the phylogenetic history of Linaria with special emphasis on the Mediterranean sect. Supinae (44 species). We revealed extensive highly supported incongruence among two nuclear (ITS, AGT1) and two plastid regions (rpl32-trnL(UAG), trnS-trnG). Coalescent simulations, a hybrid detection test and species tree inference in *BEAST revealed that incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization may both be responsible for the incongruent pattern observed. Additionally, we present a multilabelled *BEAST species tree as an alternative approach that allows the possibility of observing multiple placements in the species tree for the same taxa. That permitted the incorporation of processes such as hybridization within the tree while not violating the assumptions of the *BEAST model. This methodology is presented as a functional tool to disclose the evolutionary history of species complexes that have experienced both hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting. The drastic climatic events that have occurred in the Mediterranean since the late Miocene, including the Quaternary-type climatic oscillations, may have made both processes highly recurrent in the Mediterranean flora.

AB Non-native fishes are often blamed for exerting adverse ecological impacts on native fishes, but the evidence is circumstantial and the true impacts remain largely unknown. This dilemma is particularly acute for freshwater ecosystems of the Mediterranean Region, where a high level of endemism (a biodiversity hotspot) makes native fish extinctions much more likely because of their small natural ranges. The aim of this paper is to review non-native fish impacts, from genes to ecosystem level, in the fresh waters of the Mediterranean Region and identify gaps in knowledge that currently hamper effective conservation and management of native species and ecosystems. Most studies reviewed reported potential impacts rather than realised impact mechanisms, and these were conducted predominantly in the European part of the Mediterranean Region. No studies of realised impacts were found for three of the 15 most introduced fishes, which emphasises the need for evidence-based studies of non-native species impacts.

AB This study investigates the role of climate in determining phytogeographic regions, focusing particularly on the lrano-Turanian floristic region in SW and Central Asia. A set of simple climatic variables and bioclimatic indices were used to prepare climate-space scatter plots and climate diagrams. The climate data were also subjected to multivariate analyses (PCA and Regression tree) in order to develop a bioclimatic characterization of the Irano-Turanian region in comparison with the adjacent Mediterranean, Saharo-Sindian, Euro-Siberian, and Central-Asiatic regions. Phytogeographic regions of SW and Central Asia display distinct bioclimatic spaces with small overlaps. The Irano-Turanian region is differentiated from surrounding regions by continentality, winter temperature, and precipitation seasonality. Continentality is the most important bioclimatic factor in differentiating it from the Mediterranean and Saharo-Sindian regions and is responsible for floristic differences among sub-regions of the Irano-Turanian region. In our case study, the Irano-Turanian region is a nearly independent bioclimatic unit, distinct from its surrounding regions. Hence, it is suggested that the term "Irano-Turanian bioclimate" be used to describe the climate of most of the continental Middle East and Central Asia. Among different sub-regions, the west-central part of this floristic region ("IT2 sub-region") is a major center of speciation and endemism. Our case study demonstrates that climate is a primary determinant of phytogeographic regionalization. Although modern climate and topography are strong control parameters on the floristic composition and geographical delimitation of the Irano-Turanian region, the complex paleogeographic and paleoclimatic history of SW Asia has also influenced the Tertiary and Quaternary evolution of the Irano-Turanian flora, with additional impacts by the long-lasting historic and present land-use in this region. Many lrano-Turanian montane species are threatened by global warming, and particular conservation measures are needed to protect the Irano-Turanian flora in all sub-regions. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

AB Forests in Europe face significant changes in climate, which in interaction with air quality changes, may significantly affect forest productivity, stand composition and carbon sequestration in both vegetation and soils. Identified knowledge gaps and research needs include: (i) interaction between changes in air quality (trace gas concentrations), climate and other site factors on forest ecosystem response, (ii) significance of biotic processes in system response, (iii) tools for mechanistic and diagnostic understanding and upscaling, and (iv) the need for unifying modelling and empirical research for synthesis. This position paper highlights the above focuses, including the global dimension of air pollution as part of climate change and the need for knowledge transfer to enable reliable risk assessment. A new type of research site in forest ecosystems ("supersites") will be conducive to addressing these gaps by enabling integration of experimentation and modelling within the soil-plant-atmosphere interface, as well as further model development.

AB Accumulation of anthropogenic gases, particularly CO2, is likely to have 2 fundamental effects on plant biology. The first is an indirect effect through Earth's increasing average surface temperatures, with subsequent effects on other aspects of climate, such as rainfall and extreme weather events. The second is a direct effect caused by CO2-induced stimulation of photosynthesis and plant growth. Both effects are likely to alter a number of fundamental aspects of plant biology and human health, including aerobiology and allergic diseases, respectively. This review highlights the current and projected effect of increasing CO2 and climate change in the context of plants and allergen exposure, emphasizing direct effects on plant physiologic parameters (eg, pollen production) and indirect effects (eg, fungal sporulation) related to diverse biotic and abiotic interactions. Overall, the review assumes that future global mitigation efforts will be limited and suggests a number of key research areas that will assist in adapting to the ongoing challenges to public health associated with increased allergen exposure.

AB Morphological traits typically scale with the overall body size of an organism. A meaningful comparison of trait values among individuals or populations that differ in size therefore requires size correction. A frequently applied size correction method involves subjecting the set of n morphological traits of interest to (common) principal component analysis [(C)PCA], and treating the first principal component [(C)PC1] as a latent size variable. The remaining variation (PC2-PCn) is considered size-independent and interpreted biologically. I here analyze simulated data and natural datasets to demonstrate that this (C)PCA-based size correction generates systematic statistical artifacts. Artifacts arise even when all traits are tightly correlated with overall size, and they are particularly strong when the magnitude of variance is heterogeneous among the traits, and when the traits under study are few. (C)PCA-based approaches are therefore inappropriate for size correction and should be abandoned in favor of methods using univariate general linear models with an adequate independent body size metric as covariate. As I demonstrate, (C)PC1 extracted from a subset of traits, not themselves subjected to size correction, can provide such a size metric.

AB P>The potential for parallel impacts of habitat change on multiple biodiversity levels has important conservation implications. We report on the first empirical test of the 'species-genetic diversity correlation' across co-distributed taxa with contrasting ecological traits in the context of habitat fragmentation. In a rainforest landscape undergoing conversion to oil palm, we show that depauperate species richness in fragments is mirrored by concomitant declines in population genetic diversity in the taxon predicted to be most susceptible to fragmentation. This association, not seen in the other species, relates to fragment area rather than isolation. While highlighting the over-simplification of extrapolating across taxa, we show that fragmentation presents a double jeopardy for some species. For these, conserving genetic diversity at levels of pristine forest could require sites 15-fold larger than those needed to safeguard species numbers. Importantly, however, each fragment contributes to regional species richness, with larger ones tending to contain more species.

AB Niche differentiation and ecological filtering are primary ecological processes that shape community assembly, but their relative importance remains poorly understood. Analyses of the distributions of functional traits can provide insight into the community structure generated by these processes. We predicted the trait distributions expected under the ecological processes of niche differentiation and environmental filtering, then tested these predictions with a dataset of 4672 trees located in nine 1-ha plots of tropical rain forest in French Guiana. Five traits related to leaf function (foliar N concentration, chlorophyll content, toughness, tissue density and specific leaf area), and three traits related to stem function (trunk sapwood density, branch sapwood density, and trunk bark thickness), as well as laminar surface area, were measured on every individual tree. There was far more evidence for environmental filtering than for niche differentiation in these forests. Furthermore, we contrasted results from species-mean and individual-level trait values. Analyses that took within-species trait variation into account were far more sensitive indicators of niche differentiation and ecological filtering. Species-mean analyses, by contrast, may underestimate the effects of ecological processes on community assembly. Environmental filtering appeared somewhat more intense on leaf traits than on stem traits, whereas niche differentiation affected neither strongly. By accounting for within-species trait variation, we were able to more properly consider the ecological interactions among individual trees and between individual trees and their environment. In so doing, our results suggest that the ecological processes of niche differentiation and environmental filtering may be more pervasive than previously believed.

TI Conspecific Crop-Weed Introgression Influences Evolution of Weedy Rice

   TRAITS; EXTENSIONS
AB Background: Introgression plays an important role in evolution of plant species via its influences on genetic diversity and differentiation. Outcrossing determines the level of introgression but little is known about the relationships of outcrossing rates, genetic diversity, and differentiation particularly in a weedy taxon that coexists with its conspecific crop.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Eleven weedy rice (Oryza sativa f. spontanea) populations from China were analyzed using microsatellite (SSR) fingerprints to study outcrossing rate and its relationship with genetic variability and differentiation. To estimate outcrossing, six highly polymorphic SSR loci were used to analyze >5500 progeny from 216 weedy rice families, applying a mixed mating model; to estimate genetic diversity and differentiation, 22 SSR loci were analyzed based on 301 weedy individuals. Additionally, four weed-crop shared SSR loci were used to estimate the influence of introgression from rice cultivars on weedy rice differentiation. Outcrossing rates varied significantly (0.4 similar to 11.7%) among weedy rice populations showing relatively high overall Nei's genetic diversity (0.635). The observed heterozygosity was significantly correlated with outcrossing rates among populations (r(2) = 0.783; P<0.001) although no obvious correlation between outcrossing rates and genetic diversity parameters was observed. Allelic introgression from rice cultivars to their coexisting weedy rice was detected. Weedy rice populations demonstrated considerable genetic differentiation that was correlated with their spatial distribution (r(2) = 0.734; P<0.001), and possibly also influenced by the introgression from rice cultivars.
   Conclusions/Significance: Outcrossing rates can significantly affect heterozygosity of populations, which may shape the evolutionary potential of weedy rice. Introgression from the conspecific crop rice can influence the genetic differentiation and possibly evolution of its coexisting weedy rice populations.

TI Asymmetric boundary shifts of tropical montane Lepidoptera over four

AB Aim
   To estimate whether species have shifted at equal rates at their leading edges (cool boundaries) and trailing edges (warm boundaries) in response to climate change. We provide the first such evidence for tropical insects, here examining elevation shifts for the upper and lower boundaries shifts of montane moths. Threats to species on tropical mountains are considered.
   Location
   Mount Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia.
   Methods
   We surveyed Lepidoptera (Geometridae) on Mount Kinabalu in 2007, 42 years after the previous surveys in 1965. Changes in species upper and lower boundaries, elevational extents and range areas were assessed. We randomly subsampled the data to ensure comparable datasets between years. Estimated shifts were compared for endemic versus more widespread species, and for species that reached their range limits at different elevations.
   Results
   Species that reached their upper limits at 2500-2700 m (n = 28 species, 20% of those considered) retreated at both their lower and upper boundaries, and hence showed substantial average range contractions (-300 m in elevational extent and -45 km2 in estimated range area). These declines may be associated with changes in cloud cover and the presence of ecological barriers (geological and vegetation transitions) which impede uphill movement. Other than this group, most species (n = 109, 80% of the species considered) expanded their upper boundaries upwards (by an average of 152 m) more than they retreated at their lower boundaries (77 m).
   Main conclusions
   Without constraints, leading margins shifted uphill faster than trailing margins retreated, such that many species increased their elevational extents. However, this did not result in increases in range area because the area of land available declines with increasing elevation. Species close to a major ecological/geological transition zone on the mountain flank declined in their range areas. Extinction risk may increase long before species reach the summit, even when undisturbed habitats are available.

TI Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST): effects on different areas of

   Therapy; CST
ID ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; REALITY ORIENTATION; PROGRAM
AB Background: There is good evidence indicating that group Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) leads to generalised cognitive benefits for people with dementia. However, little is known about whether some aspects of cognition might change more than others and why.
   Methods: Cognitive Stimulation Therapy, a 14-session group treatment, has been evaluated in a multi-centre, single-blind, randomised controlled trial. This study looks at the subscales of the ADAS-Cog (memory and new learning, praxis and language) and compares the outcome of CST with a treatment as usual control group.
   Results: There was a significant difference between treatment and control groups in total ADAS-Cog score (p = 0.01) and in the language subscale (p = 0.01). There were no significant changes in memory and orientation or praxis.
   Conclusions: CST appears to have particular effects in promoting language function, which is likely to lead to generalised benefits. This may be through generating opinions and creating new semantic links through categorisation. Future research might use more sensitive psychometric tests to assess these effects in more depth.

AB P>All species are restricted in their distribution. Currently, ecological models can only explain such limits if patches vary in quality, leading to asymmetrical dispersal, or if genetic variation is too low at the margins for adaptation. However, population genetic models suggest that the increase in genetic variance resulting from dispersal should allow adaptation to almost any ecological gradient. Clearly therefore, these models miss something that prevents evolution in natural populations. We developed an individual-based simulation to explore stochastic effects in these models. At high carrying capacities, our simulations largely agree with deterministic predictions. However, when carrying capacity is low, the population fails to establish for a wide range of parameter values where adaptation was expected from previous models. Stochastic or transient effects appear critical around the boundaries in parameter space between simulation behaviours. Dispersal, gradient steepness, and population density emerge as key factors determining adaptation on an ecological gradient.

AB Predicting the variation of biodiversity across the surface of the Earth is a fundamental issue in ecology, and in this article we focus on one of the most widely studied spatial biodiversity patterns: the species-area relationship (SAR). The SAR is a central tool in conservation, being used to predict species loss following global climate change, and is striking in its universality throughout different geographical regions and across the tree of life. In this article we draw upon the methods of quantum field theory and the foundation of neutral community ecology to derive the first spatially explicit neutral prediction for the SAR. We find that the SAR has three phases, with a power law increase at intermediate scales, consistent with decades of documented empirical patterns. Our model also provides a building block for incorporating non-neutral biological variation, with the potential to bridge the gap between neutral and niche-based approaches to community assembly.

AB A computational framework to map species' distributions (realized density) using occurrence-only data and environmental predictors is presented and illustrated using a textbook example and two case studies: distribution of root vole (Microtes oeconomus) in the Netherlands, and distribution of white-tailed eagle nests (Haliaeetus albicilla) in Croatia. The framework combines strengths of point pattern analysis (kernel smoothing), Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) and geostatistics (logistic regression-kriging), as implemented in the spatstat, adehabitat and gstat packages of the R environment for statistical computing. A procedure to generate pseudo-absences is proposed. It uses Habitat Suitability Index (HSI, derived through ENFA) and distance from observations as weight maps to allocate pseudo-absence points. This design ensures that the simulated pseudo-absences fall further away from the occurrence points in both feature and geographical spaces. The simulated pseudo-absences can then be combined with occurrence locations and used to build regression-kriging prediction models. The output of prediction are either probabilitiesy of species' occurrence or density measures. Addition of the pseudo-absence locations has proven effective - the adjusted R-square increased from 0.71 to 0.80 for root vole (562 records), and from 0.69 to 0.83 for white-tailed eagle (135 records) respectively; pseudo-absences improve spreading of the points in feature space and ensure consistent mapping over the whole area of interest. Results of cross validation (leave-one-out method) for these two species showed that the model explains 98% of the total variability in the density values for the root vole, and 94% of the total variability for the white-tailed eagle. The framework could be further extended to Generalized multivariate Linear Geostatistical Models and spatial prediction of multiple species.

AB Leaves are organs sensitive to environmental changes in the process of evolution and may exhibit phenotypic plasticity as a response to abiotic stress. However, affirmation of leaf morphological plasticity and its regulations in different environments are still unclear. We performed a simulated experiment to study the variations of leaf morphology in different gradients of water and light availability. Considering different types of leaves and venation, we chose pinnate-veined simple leaves of Quercus acutissima and compound leaves of Robinia pseudoacacia as the study objects. The morphological parameters we investigated include leaf size, shape and venation pattern which can be easily measured in the field. Significant variations occurred in many parameters due to the effects of the environment and/or allometry. There were broadly consistent trends for leaf morphological variations along the gradients. The leaf size became smaller with a short supply of resources. Leaf elongation and fractions of the lamina area altered to enhance resources acquisition and conservation. Trade-offs between investments in support and functional structures optimized the venation pattern of major and minor veins. Leaflets partially played a role such as leaf teeth, for they are not only individual units, but also a part of the compound leaf. We suggest that more or less the same trends in morphological variations may be an important explanation for coexisting species to adapt to similar habitats and form the niche differentiation.

AB How often do the early stages of speciation occur in the presence of gene flow? To address this enduring question, a number of recent papers have used computational approaches, estimating parameters of simple divergence models from multilocus polymorphism data collected in closely related species. Applications to a variety of species have yielded extensive evidence for migration, with the results interpreted as supporting the widespread occurrence of parapatric speciation. Here, we conduct a simulation study to assess the reliability of such inferences, using a program that we recently developed MCMC estimation of the isolation-migration model allowing for recombination (MIMAR) as well as the program isolation-migration (IM) of Hey and Nielsen (2004). We find that when one of many assumptions of the isolation-migration model is violated, the methods tend to yield biased estimates of the parameters, potentially lending spurious support for allopatric or parapatric divergence. More generally, our results highlight the difficulty in drawing inferences about modes of speciation from the existing computational approaches alone.

AB In this study, we assessed the accuracy of the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) GPP (gross primary productivity) Collections 4.5, 4.8 and 5 along with Leaf Area Index (LAI), fraction of absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fPAR), light use efficiency (LUE) and meteorological variables that are used to estimate GPP for a northern Australian savanna site. Results of this study indicated that the MODIS products captured the seasonal variation in GPP, LAI and fPAR well. Using the index of agreement (IOA), it was found that Collections 4.5 and 4.8 (IOA 0.89 respectively) agreed reasonably well with flux tower measurements between 2001 and 2006. It was also found that MODIS Collection 4.5 predicted the dry season GPP well (Relative Predictive Error (RPE) 4.17%, IOA 0.72 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.05 g C m(-2) day(-1)), whilst Collection 4.8 performed better in capturing wet season dynamics (RPE 1.11%, IOA 0.80 and RMSE of 0.91 g C m(-2) day(-1)). Although the wet season magnitude of GPP was predicted well by Collection 4.8, an examination of the inputs to the GPP algorithm revealed that MODIS fPAR was too high, but this was compensated by PAR and WE that was too low. Although LAI and fPAR estimated by Collection 5 were more accurate. GPP for this Collection resulted in a much lower value (RPE 25%) due to errors in other factors. Recalculation of MODIS GPP using site specific input parameters indicated that MODIS fPAR was the main reason for the differences between MODIS and tower derived GPP followed by WE and meteorological inputs. GPP calculated using all site specific values agreed very well with tower data on an annual basis (IOA 0.94, RPE 6.06% and RMSE 0.83 g C m(-2) day(-1)) but the early initiation of the growing season calculated by the MODIS algorithm was improved when the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) function was replaced with a soil water deficit function. The results of this study however, reinforce previous findings in water limited regions, like Australia, and incorporation of soil moisture in a LUE model is needed to accurately estimate the productivity.

AB Invasion by Acacia longifolia alters soil characteristics and processes. The present study was conducted to determine if the changes in soil C and N pools and processes induced by A. longifolia persist after its removal, at the SA o pound Jacinto Dunes Nature Reserve (Portugal). Some areas had been invaded for a long time (> 20 years) and others more recently (< 10 years). For each type of invasion, (i.e., long-invaded and recently invaded), three treatments were used: (1) A. longifolia left intact; (2) A. longifolia was removed; and (3) both A. longifolia and litter layer were removed. Soil samples were collected once a year for four and half years and analysed for chemical and microbial properties. In general, microbial parameters responded faster than C and N pools. In long-invaded areas, two and half years after removal of plants and litter, basal respiration and microbial biomass had already decreased > 30%, beta-glucosaminidase activity (N mineralization index) > 60% and potential nitrification > 95%. Removal of plants and litter resulted in a > 35% decrease in C and N content after four and half years. In recently invaded areas, beta-glucosaminidase activity and potential nitrification showed a marked decrease (> 54% and > 95%, respectively) after removal of both A. longifolia and litter. Our results suggest that after removal of an N-2-fixing invasive tree that changes ecosystem-level processes, it takes several years before soil nutrients and processes return to pre-invasion levels, but this legacy slowly diminish, suggesting that the susceptibility of native areas to (re)invasion is a function of the time elapsed since removal. Removal of the N-rich litter layer facilitates ecosystem recovery.

AB Understanding the impact of past climatic events on species may facilitate predictions of how species will respond to future climate change. To this end, we sampled populations of the common pond snail Radix balthica over the entire species range (northwestern Europe). Using a recently developed analytical framework that employs ecological niche modelling to obtain hypotheses that are subsequently tested with statistical phylogeography, we inferred the range dynamics of R. balthica over time. A Maxent modelling for present-day conditions was performed to infer the climate envelope for the species, and the modelled niche was used to hindcast climatically suitable range at the last glacial maximum (LGM) c. 21 000 years ago. Ecological niche modelling predicted two suitable areas at the LGM within the present species range. Phylogeographic model selection on a COI mitochondrial DNA data set confirmed that R. balthica most likely spread from these two disjunct refuges after the LGM. The match observed between the potential range of the species at the LGM given its present climatic requirements and the phylogeographically inferred refugial areas was a clear argument in favour of niche conservatism in R. balthica, thus allowing to predict the future range. The subsequent projection of the potential range under a global change scenario predicts a moderate pole-ward shift of the northern range limits, but a dramatic loss of areas currently occupied in France, western Great Britain and southern Germany.

AB 1. Body condition (defined as the relative amount of energy reserves in the body) is an animal trait with strong ecological implications. In some animal taxa (e.g. arthropods), the external volume of the body part in which most nutrients are stored (e.g. abdomen) is used interchangeably with body mass to estimate body condition, making the implicit assumption that abdomen residual volume is a good surrogate of residual mass. However, the degree of correlation between these two measures should largely depend on the density of the nutrients stored.
   2. We simulated two food-supplemented experimental groups of animals, each storing a slightly different amount of lipids either in their abdomens or in their entire bodies, and explored (i) how different estimates of condition were able to detect fixed differences between the groups; and (ii) how the amount of lipids stored could affect the outcome of non-intrusive measures of condition on a dichotomous variable (e.g. survival, mating success). We found that density body condition (body mass statistically controlled for structural body size and body volume) has much greater power to detect differences between experimental groups or effects on binary response variables than do classic mass/size or volume/size condition indices.
   3. Using data on Lycosa tarantula (L.), a burrowing wolf spider, we report dramatic differences among these three indices in their ability to detect sex differences in the effect of feeding treatment on body condition at maturity. In particular, a plot of residual mass against residual volume reflecting nutrient density suggests that poorly fed spiders are nutritionally unbalanced, since well-fed spiders invest in nutrients of very different density.
   4. Furthermore, using data on Scathophaga stercoraria (L.), the yellow dung fly, we found that an index of density condition was better at distinguishing condition differences among three populations than were mass or volume condition estimates alone.
   5. We propose that including these three surrogates of condition (mass, volume and density) will substantially improve the accuracy of non-intrusive estimates of body condition, thus providing more powerful tools with direct application in a wide range of disciplines.

Spatial scaling, in particular the species-area relationship (SAR), has a long history in ecology and has recently been addressed in microbial ecology. However, the temporal analogue of the SAR, the species-time relationship, has received far less attention even in the science of general ecology. Here we focus upon the role of temporal scaling in microbial ecological patterns by coupling molecular characterization of bacterial communities in discrete island (bioreactor) systems with a macroecological approach. Our findings showed that the temporal scaling exponent (slope), and therefore taxa turnover of the bacterial taxa-time relationship decreased as selective pressure (industrial wastewater concentration) increased. Also, as the concentration of industrial wastewater increased across the bioreactors, we observed a gradual switch from stochastic community assembly to more deterministic (niche)-based considerations. The identification of broad-scale statistical patterns is particularly relevant to microbial ecology, as it is frequently difficult to identify individual species or their functions. In this study, we identify wide-reaching statistical patterns of diversity and show that they are shaped by the prevalent underlying ecological factors.

AB Habitat conditions mediate the effects of climate, so neighboring populations with differing habitat conditions may differ in their responses to climate change. We have previously observed that juvenile survival in Snake River spring/summer Chinook salmon is strongly correlated with summer temperature in some populations and with fall streamflow in others. Here, we explore potential differential responses of the viability of four of these populations to changes in streamflow and temperature that might result from climate change. First, we linked predicted changes in air temperature and precipitation from several General Circulation Models to a local hydrological model to project streamflow and air temperature under two climate-change scenarios. Then, we developed a stochastic, density-dependent life-cycle model with independent environmental effects in juvenile and ocean stages, and parameterized the model for each population. We found that mean abundance decreased 20-50% and the probability of quasi-extinction increased dramatically (from 0.1-0.4 to 0.3-0.9) for all populations in both scenarios. Differences between populations were greater in the more moderate climate scenario than in the more extreme, hot/dry scenario. Model results were relatively robust to realistic uncertainty in freshwater survival parameters in all scenarios. Our results demonstrate that detailed population models can usefully incorporate climate-change predictions, and that global warming poses a direct threat to freshwater stages in these fish, increasing their risk of extinction. Because differences in habitat may contribute to the individualistic population responses we observed, we infer that maintaining habitat diversity will help buffer some species from the impacts of climate change.

AB Despite recent advances in conservation genetics and related disciplines and the growing impact that conservation genetics is having in conservation biology, our knowledge on several key issues in the field is still insufficient. Here we identify some of these issues together with addressing several paradoxes which have to be solved before conservation genetics can face new challenges that are appearing in the transitory phase from the population genetics into the population genomics era. Most of these issues, paradoxes and challenges, like the central dogma of conservation genetics, the computational, theoretical and laboratory experiment achievements and limitations in the conservation genetics field have been discussed. Further knowledge on the consequences of inbreeding and outbreeding depression in wild populations as well as the capacity of small populations to adapt to local environmental conditions is also urgently needed. The integration of experimental, theoretical and applied conservation genetics will contribute to improve our understanding of methodological and applied aspects of conservation genetics.

AB We have determined the scaling relationship between photosynthesis rate and cell size in natural phytoplankton assemblages of contrasting marine environments. We found that phytoplankton photosynthesis in the ocean does not scale as the 3/4- power of cell size, but scales approximately isometrically with cell size, indicating that a single model cannot predict the metabolism-size relationship in all photosynthetic organisms. The scaling relationship between cellular chlorophyll a content and cell size is also isometric. Taxonomical changes along the size spectrum may explain the deviation of phytoplankton photosynthesis from the general allometric rule. The size scaling exponent for photosynthesis is significantly higher ( 1.14) in coastal productive waters than in the oligotrophic open ocean ( 0.96), which provides a physiological basis to explain the dominance of larger cells in nutrient-rich environments. The size scaling exponent for phytoplankton abundance is significantly less negative in coastal productive waters ( -0.90) than in the oligotrophic open ocean ( -1.25). The observed size scaling relationships imply that carbon fixation per unit volume decreases with cell size in oligotrophic waters, whereas the opposite occurs in productive ones. By controlling the metabolism-size scaling relationship, nutrient supply plays a major role in determining community size structure and the energy flow through the pelagic ecosystem.

AB Leaf mass per area (M-A) is a central ecological trait that is intercorrelated with leaf life span, photosynthetic rate, nutrient concentration, and palatability to herbivores. These coordinated variables form a globally convergent leaf economics spectrum, which represents a general continuum running from rapid resource acquisition to maximized resource retention. Leaf economics are little studied in ancient ecosystems because they cannot be directly measured from leaf fossils. Here we use a large extant data set (65 sites; 667 species-site pairs) to develop a new, easily measured scaling relationship between petiole width and leaf mass, normalized for leaf area; this enables M-A estimation for fossil leaves from petiole width and leaf area, two variables that are commonly measurable in leaf compression floras. The calibration data are restricted to woody angiosperms exclusive of monocots, but a preliminary data set (25 species) suggests that broad-leaved gymnosperms exhibit a similar scaling. Application to two well-studied, classic Eocene floras demonstrates that M-A can be quantified in fossil assemblages. First, our results are consistent with predictions from paleobotanical and paleoclimatic studies of these floras. We found exclusively low-M-A species from Republic (Washington, U.S.A., 49 Ma), a humid, warm-temperate flora with a strong deciduous component among the angiosperms, and a wide M-A range in a seasonally dry, warm-temperate flora from the Green River Formation at Bonanza (Utah, U.S.A, 47 Ma), presumed to comprise a mix of short and long leaf life spans. Second, reconstructed M-A in the fossil species is negatively correlated with levels of insect herbivory, whether measured as the proportion of leaves with insect damage, the proportion of leaf area removed by herbivores, or the diversity of insect-damage morphotypes. These correlations are consistent with herbivory observations in extant floras and they reflect fundamental trade-offs in plant-herbivore associations. Our results indicate that several key aspects of plant and plant-animal ecology can now be quantified in the fossil record and demonstrate that herbivory has helped shape the evolution of leaf structure for millions of years.

AB Habitat selection models, such as the ideal free, ideal despotic, site-dependent, and conspecific citing models, are of great importance to behavioral ecologists given their capability to predict habitat distributions and to link individual behavior to population processes. However, there have been relatively few field tests of their predictions. We tested the 4 models by studying the process of sequential settlement on territory in 2 distant populations of a migratory raptor, the black kite Milvus migrans. Results were mainly consistent with the site-dependent model: on arrival, kites settled on progressively lower quality territories, and earlier arriving individuals were older, larger, and in better body condition than later arriving ones, leading to a state-dependent arrival sequence also predicted by a previous theoretical model of settlement pattern. Occupation of superior territories by superior phenotypes resulted in cascading advantages for earlier arriving individuals in terms of subsequent reproductive performance. At the population level, the populations expanded/ retracted from lower quality sites during population increases/declines. The above scenario was consistent across the 2 Populations, and a review of the literature uncovered a remarkably consistent picture of state-dependent arrival, progressive monopolization of best quality sites, and cascading effects on subsequent breeding performance. We propose as a general paradigm of sequential settlement the following process: 1) arrival (late is a reliable surrogate of phenotype quality, 2) early-arriving individuals have preferential access to the best quality sites and partners, 3) the above conditions cascade into a number of benefits ultimately related to higher fitness for earlier arriving individuals.

AB 1. Sexual selection has been studied intensively, and is often strong in natural populations. Theoretical models, comparative studies and laboratory selection experiments all suggest that evolution driven by sexual selection should be rapid and common.
   2. However, there are relatively few documented cases of the contemporary evolution of secondary sexual traits in natural populations. Moreover, the causes are not always due to sexual selection, but often due to altered natural selection regimes, or an altered balance between natural and sexual selection.
   3. Here we discuss recent empirical studies that have demonstrated the contemporary evolution of secondary sexual traits in natural populations. Our examples include both continuous traits and discrete polymorphisms. Taxa in which the contemporary (rapid) evolution of secondary sexual traits have been demonstrated include fish, insects, mammals, reptiles and birds. The evolutionary rates of these changes range from 0.005 to 0.570 haldanes (arithmetic mean = 0.14; geometric mean = 0.095; median = 0.12).
   4. The relative rarity of examples could be explained by different genetic architectures of sexually selected traits compared with naturally selected traits, or by sexual selection regimes not being sustained in the long term. These factors could potentially slow down evolutionary rates of secondary sexual traits and make the detection of the contemporary evolution empirically more difficult.
   5. Promising and underutilized approaches to sexual selection research include reciprocal transplant experiments and estimation of sexual isolation between conspecific populations.

AB Compilation of alien flora from phytogeographically distinct regions is of immediate relevance not only for better understanding the patterns of plant invasion but also for explicating the processes promoting invasion at local, regional or global scales. Despite being at higher risk of invasion by plants because of its European colonial past, south Asia has received very little attention in respect of characterization of its alien flora. This paucity of baseline data necessitated compilation of the first catalogue of alien flora from the Kashmir Himalaya-a phytogeographically distinct south Asian region nestled in the northwestern folds of Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. Total alien flora of the region is represented by 571 plant species, belonging to 352 genera and 104 families. It constitutes a relatively higher (29%) proportion of the total flora of the region. Families with largest number of alien representatives are Poaceae (60 species), Asteraceae (54 species), and Brassicaceae (30 species). However, families such as Amaranthaceae (83%) and Chenopodiacae (71%) show higher percentage of aliens relative to their total number of plant species in the region. Most of the alien plant species (38%) trace their origin to Europe, followed by Asia (27%) and Africa (15%).

AB When females copulate with multiple males, paternity is determined by the competitive ability of a male to access females and by the ability of its ejaculates to out-compete those of other males over fertilization. The relationship between the social competitiveness of a male and the fertilizing quality of its sperm has therefore crucial implications for the evolution of male reproductive strategies in response to sexual selection. Here, we present a longitudinal experimental study of the relationship between social status and sperm quality. We monitored sperm quality in socially naive male domestic fowl, Gallus gallus domesticus, before and after exposure to a social challenge which comprised two stages. In the first stage, social dominance was established in male pairs divergent in sperm quality, and in the second, social status was experimentally manipulated by re-shuffling males across pairs. We show that sperm quality fluctuates within males both before and after a social challenge. Importantly, such fluctuations followed consistently different patterns in males that displayed different levels of social competitiveness in the social challenge. In particular, following the social challenge, sperm quality dropped in males that won both contests while the sperm quality of males that lost both contests remained constant. Together, these results indicate that males of different social competitiveness are predisposed to specific patterns of fluctuations in sperm quality. These rapid within-male fluctuations may help explain the recent findings of trade-offs between male social and gametic competitive abilities and may help maintain phenotypic variability in these traits.

AB Knowledge of past. re regimes is crucial for understanding the changes in. re frequency that are likely to occur during the coming decades as a result of global warming and land-use change. This is a key issue for the sustainable management of forest biodiversity because. re regimes may be controlled by vegetation, human activities, and/or climate. The present paper aims to reconstruct the pattern of. re frequency over the Holocene at three sites located in the same region in the northern Swedish boreal forest. The. re regime is reconstructed from sedimentary charcoal analysis of small lakes or ponds. This method allows. re events to be characterized, after detrending the charcoal influx series, and allows estimation of the time elapsed between. res. The long-term. re regime, in terms of fire-free intervals, can thus be elucidated. At the three sites, the mean fire-free intervals through the Holocene were long and of similar magnitude (similar to 320 years). This similarity suggests that the ecological processes controlling. re ignition and spread were the same. At the three sites, the intervals were shorter before 8600 cal yr BP ( calibrated years before present), between 7500 and 4500 cal yr BP, and after 2500 cal yr BP. Geomorphological and vegetation factors cannot explain the observed change, because the three sites are located in the same large ecological region characterized by Pinus sylvestris-Ericaceae mesic forests, established on morainic deposits at the same elevation. Archaeological chronologies also do not match the. re chronologies. A climatic interpretation is therefore the most likely explanation of the long-term regional pattern of. re. Although recent human activities between the 18th and the 20th centuries have clearly affected the. re regime, the dominant factor controlling it for 10 000 years in northern Sweden has probably been climatic.

AB The original immunocompetence handicap hypothesis (ICHH) suggested that testosterone has a handicapping effect in males by both promoting the development of sexual signals and suppressing immune function. A modified version, the stress-linked ICHH, has recently proposed that testosterone is immunosuppressive indirectly by increasing production of corticosterone. To test both the original and stress-mediated versions of the ICHH, we implanted male zebra finches taken from lines selected for divergent maximum stress-induced levels of corticosterone (high, low and control) with either empty or testosterone-filled implants. Their Immoral and cell-mediated immune responses were then assessed by challenge with diphtheria:tetanus vaccine and phytohemagglutinin respectively. We found no effect of the hormone manipulations on either PHA or tetanus antibody responses, but found a significant interaction between titers of both testosterone and corticosterone on diphtheria secondary antibody response; antibody response was greatest in individuals with high levels of both hormones. There was also a significant interactive effect between testosterone treatment group and corticosterone titer on body mass; the body mass of males in the elevated testosterone treatment group decreased with increasing corticosterone titer. These results suggest that, contrary to the assumption of the stress-mediated version of the ICHH, high plasma levels of corticosterone are not immunosuppressive, but are in fact immuno-enhancing in the presence of high levels of plasma testosterone. Equally, the central assumption of the ICHH that testosterone is obligately immunosuppressive is also not supported. The same individuals with the highest levels of both hormones and consequently the most robust antibody response also possessed the lowest body mass. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The net effect of sexual selection on nonsexual fitness is controversial. On one side, elaborate display traits and preferences for them can be costly, reducing the nonsexual fitness of individuals possessing them, as well as their offspring, In contrast, sexual selection may reinforce nonsexual fitness if an individual's attractiveness and quality are genetically correlated. According to recent models, such good-genes mate choice should increase both the extent and rate of adaptation. We evolved 12 replicate populations of Drosophila serrata in a powerful two-way factorial experimental design to test the separate and combined contributions of natural and sexual selection to adaptation to a novel larval food resource. Populations evolving in the presence of natural selection had significantly higher mean nonsexual fitness when measured over three generations (13-15) during the course of experimental evolution (16-23% increase). The effect of natural selection was even more substantial when measured in a standardized, monogamous mating environment at the end of the experiment (generation 16; 52% increase). In contrast, and despite strong sexual selection on display traits, there was no evidence from any of the four replicate fitness measures that sexual selection promoted adaptation. In addition, a comparison of fitness measures conducted under different mating environments demonstrated a significant direct cost of sexual selection to females, likely arising from some form of male-induced harm. Indirect benefits of sexual selection in promoting adaptation to this novel resource environment therefore appear to be absent in this species, despite prior evidence suggesting the operation of good-genes mate choice in their ancestral environment. How novel environments affect the operation of good-genes mate choice is a fundamental question for future sexual selection research.

AB Are mature forest trees carbon limited at current CO2 concentrations? Will 'mid-life', 35 m tall deciduous trees grow faster in a CO2-enriched atmosphere? To answer these questions we exposed ca. 100-year-old temperate forest trees at the Swiss Canopy Crane site near Basel, Switzerland to a ca. 540 ppm CO2 atmosphere using web-FACE technology. Here, we report growth responses to elevated CO2 for 11 tall trees (compared with 32 controls) of five species during the initial four treatment years. Tested across all trees, there was no CO2 effect on stem basal area (BA) increment (neither when tested per year nor cumulatively for 4 years). In fact, the 4th year means were almost identical for the two groups. Stem growth data were standardized by pretreatment growth (5 years) in order to account for a priori individual differences in vigor. Although this experiment was not designed to test species specific effects, one species, the common European beech, Fagus sylvatica, showed a significant growth enhancement in the first year, which reoccurred during a centennial drought in the third year. None of the other dominant species (Quercus petraea, Carpinus betulus) showed a growth response to CO2 in any of the 4 years or for all years together. The inclusion or exclusion of single individuals of Prunus avium and Tilia platyphyllos did not change the picture. In elevated CO2, lateral branching in terminal shoots was higher in Fagus in 2002, when shoots developed from buds that were formed during the first season of CO2 enrichment (2001), but there was no effect in later years and no change in lateral branching in any of the other species. In Quercus, there was a steady stimulation of leading shoot length in high-CO2 trees. Phenological variables (bud break, leaf fall, leaf duration) were highly species specific and were not affected by elevated CO2 in any consistent way. Our 4-year data set reflects a very dynamic and species-specific response of tree growth to a step change in CO2 supply. Stem growth after 4 years of exposure does not support the notion that mature forest trees will accrete wood biomass at faster rates in a future CO2-enriched atmosphere.

AB Mauremys leprosa, distributed in Iberia and North-west Africa, contains two major clades of mtDNA haplotypes. Clade A occurs in Portugal, Spain and Morocco north of the Atlas Mountains. Clade B occurs south of the Atlas Mountains in Morocco and north of the Atlas Mountains in eastern Algeria and Tunisia. However, we recorded a single individual containing a clade B haplotype in Morocco from north of the Atlas Mountains. This could indicate gene flow between both clades. The phylogenetically most distinct clade A haplotypes are confined to Morocco, suggesting both clades originated in North Africa. Extensive diversity within clade A in south-western Iberia argues for a glacial refuge located there. Other regions of the Iberian Peninsula, displaying distinctly lower haplotype diversities, were recolonized from within south-western Iberia. Most populations in Portugal, Spain and northern Morocco contain the most common clade A haplotype, indicating dispersal from the south-western Iberian refuge, gene flow across the Strait of Gibraltar, and reinvasion of Morocco by terrapins originating in south-western Iberia. This hypothesis is consistent with demographic analyses, suggesting rapid clade A population increase while clade B is represented by stationary, fragmented populations. We recommend the eight, morphologically weakly diagnosable, subspecies of M. leprosa be reduced to two, reflecting major mtDNA clades: Mauremys l. leprosa (Iberian Peninsula and northern Morocco) and M. l. saharica (southern Morocco, eastern Algeria and Tunisia). Peripheral populations could play an important role in evolution of M. leprosa because we found endemic haplotypes in populations along the northern and southern range borders. Previous investigations in another western Palearctic freshwater turtle (Emys orbicularis) discovered similar differentiation of peripheral populations, and phylogeographies of Emys orbicularis and Mauremys rivulata underline the barrier status of mountain chains, in contrast to sea straits, suggesting common patterns for western Palearctic freshwater turtles.

AB Gut-content analyses using molecular techniques are an effective approach to quantifying predator-prey interactions. Predation is often assumed but scavenging is an equally likely route by which animal DNA enters the gut of a predator/scavenger. We used PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to detect scavenged material in predator gut homogenates. The rates at which DNA in decaying slugs ( Mollusca: Pulmonata) and aphids (Homoptera: Aphididae) became undetectable were estimated. The detectability of DNA from both carrion types in the guts of the generalist predator Pterostichus melanarius ( Coleoptera: Carabidae) was then determined. The effects of carrion age and weight, as well as beetle sex, on detection periods, were quantified. Laboratory trials measured prey preference of beetles between live and decaying prey. Further experiments measured, for the first time, feeding by P. melanarius on dead slugs and aphids directly in the field. In both field and laboratory, P. melanarius preferentially fed on dead prey if available, but preference changed as the prey became increasingly decayed. Disappearance rates for slug carrion in wheat fields and grasslands were estimated and P. melanarius was identified as the main scavenger. Comparison of the retention time for dead slugs in the field, with the detection period for decaying slug material in the guts of the predators, showed that PCR-based techniques are not able to distinguish between predated and scavenged food items. This could potentially lead to overestimation of the impact of predation on slugs ( and other prey) by carabids. Possible implications of facultative scavenging by invertebrate predators for biocontrol and food-web research are discussed.

AB Changes in diatom assemblage composition were examined from the sediments of Slipper Lake, an isolated tundra lake located similar to 50 km north of current treeline in Canada's Northwest Territories. Diatom shifts over the last ca. 5600 years were related to the response of this ecosystem to climatic and environmental change during the late Holocene, with particular emphasis on the last few hundred years. To date, a detailed diatom analysis for this recent time frame has not been undertaken for the central Canadian Subarctic. The first ca. 5400 years of the sediment record was marked by modest shifts between benthic, alkaliphilous diatom taxa (e.g., Fragilaria, Achnanthes, and Navicula species) and heavily silicified, tychoplanktonic Aulacoseira species. In the 19th century, abrupt changes were delineated by a marked shift to a diatom assemblage characteristic of more planktonic habitats consisting of the Cyclotella stelligera complex (C. stelligera, C. pseudostelligera), which was absent in earlier sediments. Several possible mechanisms for these recent changes are examined, including atmospheric deposition of acidifying compounds and anthropogenically derived nutrient enrichment, however we conclude that climatically induced limnological changes associated with shorter duration of ice cover and a longer growing season can best explain the direction and magnitude of changes in our diatom record.

AB A number of experiments have addressed how increases in nitrogen availability increase the productivity and decrease the diversity of plant communities. We lack, however, a rigorous mechanistic understanding of how changes in abundance of particular species combine to produce changes in community productivity and diversity. Single experiments cannot provide insight into this issue because each species occurs only once per experiment, and each experiment is conducted in only one location; thus, it is impossible from single experiments to determine whether responses of particular species are consistent across environments or dependent on the particular environmental context in which the experiment was conducted. To address this issue, we assembled a dataset of 20 herbaceous species that were each represented in at least 6 different fertilization experiments and tested whether responses were general across experiments. Of the 20 species, one consistently increased in relative abundance and five consistently decreased across replicate experiments. A partially-overlapping group of 8 species displayed responses to nitrogen that varied predictably among experiments as a function of geographic location, neighboring species, or a handful of other community characteristics (ANPP, precipitation, species richness, relative abundance of focal species in control plots, and community composition). Thus, despite modest replication and a limited number of predictor variables, we were able to identify consistent patterns in response of 10 out of 20 species across multiple experiments. We conclude that the responses of individual species to nitrogen addition are often predictable, but that in most cases these responses are functions of the abiotic or biotic environment. Thus, a rigorous understanding of how plant species respond to nitrogen addition will have to consider not only the traits of individual plant species, but also aspects of the communities in which those plants live.

AB Age structure, tree characteristics, and environmental data were used to analyze the status of the birch treeline in three regions along the Scandes Mountains from 62 degrees 10'N to 69 degrees 50'N. Aspect and estimated relative radiation explained most of the treeline altitude across studied regions, but not all variation. Main tree establishment occurred during the 1940s in the southern and northernmost regions, and during the 1960s in the middle region. Age distribution patterns at 2 m (tree size), however, showed stable or possibly progressive treelines in the southern and middle regions but recent recession in the north. Growth rates varied through time and between regions, with an apparent decrease in the north since the 1940s. Weak negative correlations between attitude and age in the south indicate recent changes favoring tree growth or increased turnover at higher, more exposed altitudes. Although Scandinavian treelines are expected to advance in response to climate warming, this was not evident as a general pattern for all regions. Seasonally different climate patterns, browsing, and abrasion are mechanisms involved in this, These regionally different patterns have to be taken into account in predictions of future responses to avoid overestimation of, e.g., ecosystem change, carbon uptake capacity, and feedbacks to climate systems.

AB 1. Lipids are a major source of energy storage in vertebrates. A cross-fostering brood manipulation was conducted to assess the role of rearing environment vs common origin on lipid stores.
   2. Rearing conditions, especially nest temperatures, explained more variation in lipid levels than did nest of origin. As nest temperatures increased, lipid levels in nestlings also increased. Larger individuals, reflected in both wet and lean dry mass, tended to store more lipids.
   3. There was no trade-off between structural growth and lipid stores. However, body mass growth was linked with lipids. In addition, nestlings raised early in the season tended to maintain greater lipid levels, suggesting a role of individual quality.
   4. Because the assessment of lipid stores is difficult, it is common to use residual body mass (RBM) as a surrogate. Multiple methods of calculating RBM were compared with actual lipid mass in nestling European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). RBM was correlated with lipid levels (R-2 up to 0.66); models calculated using ordinary least squares regression predicted lipid stores better than reduced major axis regression.
   5. These results indicate that RBM can be a non-invasive predictor of lipid levels in nestling birds and that studies examining variation in physiological stores should consider development conditions and individual quality.

AB Geographic variation in maternal investment in offspring size can be adaptive if differences in investment translate into improved offspring performance in the given environments. We compared two moor frog, Rana arvalis, populations in the laboratory to test the hypothesis that investment in large eggs in populations originating from stressful (acid) environments improves offspring performance when reared in stressful (acid) conditions. We found that large initial size (hatchling mass) had moderate to strong, environment-dependent positive effects on larval and metamorphic traits in the acidic origin population, but only weak effects in the neutral origin population. Our results suggest that interactions between environmental conditions and initial size can be important determinants of individual performance, and that investment in large eggs is adaptive in acid environments. These findings emphasize the role of maternal effects as adaptations to environmental stress.

AB Recent research in aquatic systems suggests that productivity-richness relationships change with spatial scale and that species turnover (i.e., spatial and temporal variation in species composition) plays an important role in generating this scale dependence. The generality of such scale dependence and the effects of variation in temporal scale remain unknown. We examined the extent to which the richness-productivity relationship in terrestrial plant communities depends on spatial or temporal scale and evaluated how spatial and temporal turnover (i.e., species turnover in space and time) generates scale dependence in these relationships using data from two Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites (Jornada and Konza). We found a weak hump-shaped relationship (Jornada) and no relationship (Konza) between richness and productivity at the smallest focal scale (I m(2) at Jornada and 50 m(2) at Konza) at each site, but strong hump-shaped relationships at the largest focal scale (49 m(2) at Jornada and 200 m(2) at Konza) for each site. Relationships between spatial turnover and productivity at each site mirrored the productivity-richness relationships that emerged at the larger spatial scale (i.e., a significant hump-shaped pattern). In contrast, temporal turnover was unrelated to productivity, and hence increasing temporal scale did not appreciably change the form of the productivity-richness relationship. Our study suggests that the way in which productivity-richness relationships change with spatial or temporal scale depends on the form and strength of the underlying relationship between species turnover and productivity. Moreover, we contend that a dominant effect of increasing productivity is the generation of dissimilarity in species composition among localities that comprise a region, rather than increasing the number of species that occur within local communities. Thus, understanding the mechanisms that cause species turnover to vary with productivity is critical to understanding scale dependence in richness-productivity relationships.

AB We measured the N-15 natural abundance values of 320 individuals belonging to 45 different plant species of the Brazilian cerrado. We also determined delta(15)N of soil nitrogen as a function of soil depth. Our purpose was to test the hypothesis that N-limited cerrado would have a large range of plant delta(15)N values, similar to patterns seen in northern high-latitude ecosystems. Foliar delta(15)N values did demonstrate the large range found in some other N-limited ecosystems, varying from -5parts per thousand to +7.9parts per thousand, Significant variability within individual species was also seen across cerrado community types. Several factors contributed to this variability, including the presence of N-fixing legumes, associations with mycorrhizal fungi, delta(15)N variability of soil organic matter with depth, fire events, and the seasonality of N-immobilization and mineralization processes in cerrado soils.

AB The fixation and storage of C by tropical forests, which contain close to half of the globe's biomass C, may be affected by elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration. Classical theoretical approaches assume a uniform stimulation of photosynthesis and growth across taxa. Direct assessments of the C balance either by flux studies or by repeated forest inventories also suggest a current net uptake, although magnitudes sometimes exceed those missing required to balance the global C cycle. Reasons for such discrepancies may lie in the nature of forest dynamics and in differential responses of taxa or plant functional types. In this contribution I argue that CO2 enrichment may cause forests to become more dynamic and that faster tree turnover may in fact convert a stimulatory effect of elevated CO2 on photosynthesis and growth into a long-term net biomass C loss by favouring shorter-lived trees of lower wood density. At the least, this is a scenario that deserves inclusion into long-term projections of the C relations of tropical forests. Species and plant functional type specific responses ('biodiversity effects') and forest dynamics need to be accounted for in projections of future C storage and cycling in tropical forests.

Nestlings' H/L ratios were negatively related to forest patch area in control and enlarged broods, whereas no effects were found in reduced broods. The effects of forest patch area were strongest in enlarged broods, which had, in general, twofold higher H/L ratios than control and reduced broods. The elevated H/L ratios were positively related to nestling mortality and negatively correlated with body-condition indices suggesting that the origin of stress in nestlings was mainly nutritional. Cell-mediated immunity of nestlings was not related to brood manipulation or to forest patch size. Also, the H/L ratios of adults were not related to brood manipulation or forest patch size. In addition, parental H/L ratios and body condition were not related to nestling H/L ratios. Our results suggest that during the breeding period the deleterious effects of habitat loss are seen explicitly in growing young.

AB 1. Vegetative growth in vascular epiphytes is assumed to be severely limited by intermittent supply of water and nutrients, but experimental evidence for this notion is meagre. The effects of water, nutrient supply and light on growth were studied in an epiphytic bromeliad, Vriesea sanguinolenta Cogn. & Marchal (syn. Werauhia sanguinolenta) in a large forest gap in a lowland forest of Panama, in a full-factorial design. To investigate ontogenetic drift, three plant-size classes (approximate to5, 15 and 35 cm leaf length) were included in the experiment.
   2. Water supply had the strongest influence on growth, but the magnitude of this effect differed considerably among size classes. Nutrient supply affected growth only in small and intermediate-sized plants. More light (60% of direct irradiation) tended to decrease growth rates compared to 30% irradiation.
   3. Small plants showed by far the highest potential to adjust their relative growth rate (RGR) in response to favourable growing conditions.
   4. Despite these size-related differences, absolute RGRs were extremely low compared to studies with other plant groups, confirming the notion that vascular epiphytes are inherently slow-growing plants.

AB 1. River restoration is now widely undertaken and may be considered an increasingly important aspect of river management. Recent developments in European legislation (Habitats Directive and the Water Framework Directive) should give further impetus to river restoration across EU member states, as this legislation places greater emphasis on the processes that support river ecology.
   2. Traditional river restoration approaches have been reach-focused and opportunistic, capitalizing on flood defence works and the cooperation of sympathetic landowners.
   3. Furthermore, many schemes have been species- or habitat-driven and, thus, have sought to recreate channel forms believed to be favoured by particular species or associated with particular habitats. Such approaches have not always given due attention to the underlying geomorphological processes that create channel form and, consequently, the schemes have not been self-sustaining, requiring continued management input.
   4. Consistent with the ethos of the Water Framework Directive, an eco-hydromorphic approach to river restoration is proposed here. This approach views spatial and temporal heterogeneity as fundamental characteristics of fluvial systems and advocates recreating a framework within which natural processes, such as sediment transport and nutrient dynamics, can occur.
   5. Mesoscale habitat approaches are considered as one possible way to plan and achieve this framework, providing the potential to link the wide range of spatial and temporal scales that characterize river systems.
   6. It is argued that river restoration will only be sustainable if it is undertaken within a process-driven and strategic framework with inputs from a wide range of specialists. Such an approach needs to be reviewed constantly in light of appraisal and monitoring of previous river restoration schemes. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Recently, doubt has been cast on studies supporting good genes sexual selection by the suggestion that observed genetic benefits for offspring may be confounded by differential maternal allocation. In traditional analyses, observed genetic sire effects on offspring phenotype may result from females allocating more resources to the offspring of attractive males. However, maternal effects such as differential allocation may represent a mechanism promoting genetic sire effects, rather than an alternative to them. Here we report results from an experiment on the horned dung beetle Onthophagus taurus, in which we directly compare genetic sire effects with maternal effects that are dependent on sire phenotype. We found strong evidence that mothers provide more resources to offspring when mated with large-horned males. There were significant heritabilities for both horn length and body size, but when differential maternal effects were controlled, the observed estimates of genetic variance were greatly reduced. Our experiment provides evidence that differential maternal effects may amplify genetic effects on offspring traits that are closely related to fitness. Thus, our results may partly explain the relatively high coefficients of additive genetic variation observed in fitness-related traits and provide empirical support for the theoretical argument that maternal effects can play an important role in evolution.

AB 1 Past work on tropical rain forest tree seedlings has been dominated by contrasts between strongly light-demanding and strongly shade-tolerant species. We examined patterns of growth and mortality among shade-tolerant tree seedlings in response to light, and investigated the morphological and physiological correlates of high seedling growth and survival rates across species.
   2 Seedlings of 15 tree species from Australian tropical lowland forest were grown for up to 1 year in neutral-density shadehouses at three light levels (10%, 0.8% and 0.2% full daylight). All species showed negligible mortality in the 10% and 0.8% shadehouses, but survival was significantly reduced in 0.2% daylight.
   3 Seedling survival rate in 0.2% daylight showed no significant relationship with either the dry mass of seed reserves (embryo plus endosperm), or relative growth rates in dry mass (RGR(M) ) in 0.8% and 10% light.
   4 The RGR(M) values in 0.8% and 10% daylight were strongly positively correlated, and showed a strong negative correlation with the dry mass of seed reserves. Interspecific variation in low-light RGR(M) was driven by unit leaf rate (rate of accumulation of dry mass per unit area of leaf), whereas interspecific variation in high-light RGR(M) was most closely correlated with leaf area ratio (leaf area per total plant dry mass).
   5 Variation in seedling characters in response to light may have important implications for the coexistence of shade-tolerant tropical tree species.

AB We present empirical evidence that the direct and indirect effects of species richness on ecological processes depend on a system's disturbance regime. We manipulated the number of species of freshwater suspension feeders (net-spinning caddisflies) in laboratory stream mesocosms where communities were either subject to a periodic mortality or were left undisturbed. We hypothesized that disturbance would alter the direct effect of suspension-feeder species richness on the flux of their resource, particulate organic matter (POM), and alter the indirect effects of suspension-feeder species richness on algal productivity and biofilm respiration (via nutrient recycling). The direct effect of suspension-feeder species richness on POM flux did indeed change with disturbance regime. The flux of POM from the water column to stream bed was not influenced by species richness in the absence of disturbance, but increased as species richness was increased in disturbed streams. This apparently occurred because a high taxonomic evenness in disturbed streams minimized cut-rent "shading" (i.e., the blocking of flow from upstream to downstream neighbors) that, in turn, allowed diverse assemblages to capture a greater fraction of suspended resources. Disturbance also altered the indirect effect of suspension feeder species richness on algal productivity. In the absence of disturbance, increasing species richness led to dominance by a competitively superior suspension feeding taxon that had particularly low rates of nutrient excretion. Reduced nutrient availability, in turn, caused algal productivity to decline as a function of species richness. Periodic disturbances, however, prevented taxonomic dominance and eliminated this indirect effect of suspension feeder species richness on stream productivity. Our results suggest that disturbance can moderate relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning by (1) increasing the chance that diversity generates unique system properties (i.e., "emergent" properties), or (2) suppressing the probability of ecological processes being controlled by a single taxon (i.e., the "selection-probability" effect).

AB The cover, number, size, shape, spatial arrangement and orientation of vegetation patches are attributes that have been used to indicate how well landscapes function to retain, not 'leak', vital system resources such as rainwater and soil. We derived and tested a directional leakiness index (DLI) for this resource retention function. We used simulated landscape maps where resource flows over map surfaces were directional and where landscape patch attributes were known. Although DLI was most strongly related to patch cover, it also logically related to patch number, size, shape, arrangement and orientation. If the direction of resource flow is multi-directional, a variant of DLI, the multi-directional leakiness index (MDLI) can be used. The utility of DLI and MDLI was demonstrated by applying these indices to three Australian savanna landscapes differing in their remotely sensed vegetation patch attributes. These leakiness indices clearly positioned these three landscapes along a function-dysfunction continuum, where dysfunctional landscapes are leaky (poorly retain resources).

AB Many recent studies have addressed the effects of patch size and isolation on bird communities in highly fragmented landscapes, but the importance of landscape composition in more forested landscapes remains poorly understood. The objectives of our study were (1) to determine the effects of two structurally and temporally distinct disturbance types (agriculture and silviculture) and extent of disturbance (percentage of disturbance within 1.0 km) on avian community structure within forested landscapes, and (2) to investigate underlying mechanisms responsible for associations between landscape composition and avian communities. Differences in microhabitat, microclimate, and nesting success among landscapes were examined as possible mechanisms. Breeding bird communities in central Pennsylvania (USA) were surveyed twice per year during 1997-1999 at 34 sites within contiguous mature forest, which represented a range of disturbance extent (4-59% nonforest cover within 1.0 km). Each site was in a forested landscape containing predominantly agricultural or silvicultural disturbances (n = 17 each). Our results indicate that type of disturbance within landscapes influenced bird community composition and relative abundance more than extent of disturbance. Compared to forests within landscapes disturbed by silviculture, forests within landscapes disturbed by agriculture, irrespective of the extent of disturbance, had fewer forest-associated species, long-distance migrants, forest-canopy and forest-understory-nesting species, and greater numbers of edge-associated species, including avian nest predators and Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater). Fewer species and guilds were associated with the extent of disturbance within a landscape or interactions between disturbance type and extent. Abundances of edge-associated species, residents, and forest-canopy nesters increased with increasing amounts of disturbance within forested landscapes. Local variation in microhabitat and microclimate among landscapes did not explain observed differences in avian community structure. However, nesting success was greater and numbers of some avian and small mammalian nest predators were lower in stands within forested landscapes disturbed by silviculture than in forested landscapes disturbed by agriculture. Nesting success was not associated with the extent of a given disturbance type within landscapes. These results demonstrate that, even within forested landscapes. the types of disturbance can influence avian community structure and, thus, should be considered in conservation and forest management plans. In particular, agricultural disturbances within forested landscapes seemed to negatively affect bird communities in adjacent forests more than silvicultural disturbances. Both species richness and abundance of forest-associated species were greater on sites with higher levels of nesting success. Thus, differences in nesting success resulting from altered interactions between nest predators and nesting birds may be an important underlying mechanism of avian community structure and organization at the landscape scale.

AB Species differ in the size of their geographical ranges, but it is unclear how this is affected by the intrinsic properties of various habitat types. Using data on range sizes for 490 species of aquatic Coleoptera from the Iberian Peninsula we show that running-water (lotic) species have much smaller distributional ranges than those occurring in standing water (lentic). This robust association of habitat type and range size has independently arisen in at least four monophyletic coleopteran lineages, in Hydradephaga, Hydrophiloidea, Hydraenidae and Byrrhoidea, and several more times within these main groups. We propose that this pattern is due to different evolutionary dynamics of both habitat types: stagnant water bodies are more likely to completely disappear, requiring frequent migration of resident populations. Rivers and streams, on the contrary, have more temporal and spatial continuity, and therefore permit the long-term persistence of local populations. In less permanent habitats species will require a greater geographical mobility, which indirectly results in a larger size range. The less dispersive populations of running water should also have reduced gene flow, increasing the probability of allopatric speciation, and thus reducing the average range of more widespread ancestral species. These differences in population parameters, and the frequency of transitions between the two habitat types, may have strong macroevolutionary consequences, in particular regarding speciation rates and possible morphological specializations.

AB Although most plant products eventually enter the below-ground subsystem as plant litter, relatively little is known about the effects of plant litter diversity or composition on ecosystem processes and no study has considered the responses of plant growth to these factors. We conducted an experiment in which humus substrate was collected from three field sites in the boreal forest of northern Sweden. Litter was then placed on the humus surface and the litter used consisted of monocultures of Empetrum hermaphroditum (dwarf shrub), Betula pendula (tree), and Pleurozium schreberi (feather moss), as well as mixtures containing all the possible (two-way and three-way) combinations of these species; the experiment was maintained in out-door conditions. Although decomposition rates of this surface-placed litter differed between species few effects of litter mixing on litter mass loss were apparent. Added litter of Pinus sylvestris litter broke down most slowly when placed in E. hermaphroditum litter but sometimes showed elevated decomposition rates when placed in some of the multiple species litter mixes. Soil microbial biomass and activity was lowest when plant litter was absent, but as long as plant litter was present on the humus surface the species composition and diversify of the litter was irrelevant. There were Few effects of litter treatments on growth of seedlings of either B. pendula or P. sylvestris,is planted into the humus. However, for one site there were significant effects of mixing litter of P. schreberi and E. hermaphroditum in reducing growth of both seedling species. Litter treatments generally did not alter the competitive balance between B. pendula and P. sylvestris is seedlings when grown together but for all sites litter treatments had significant effects on the overall intensity of competition, and mixing of litter of B. pendula and P. schreberi had significant non-additive effects on competition intensity for two of the three sites. The abundance of mycorrhizae on seedlings was only weakly related to litter treatment but there were some positive effects of litter mixing on one of the most abundant mycorrhizal morphotypes on both species of seedlings for one of the sites. Our results suggest that litter presence was important in influencing a range of above ground and below ground properties and processes. In some instances individual species effects and litter mixing effects were also important but few general patterns emerged, and the nature of significant effects tended to be idiosyncratic. Ultimately our results show that plant litter has important "afterlife effects" which need to be considered in order to develop a more complete understanding of how biodiversity affects ecosystems.

ID CONTINENTAL-SHELF; ATLANTIC; COMMUNITY
AB This study describes and maps demersal fish assemblages for the east coast of North America from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, to Cape Chidley: Labrador, evaluates evidence for interannual shifts in assemblage distribution, and examines the relationship of the assemblages to accepted biogeographical boundaries. Demersal trawl survey data collected from 1975 to 1994 were analyzed. Visual classification of distribution maps for the 108 most abundant demersal species revealed nine species groups, based on both geography and depth distribution. Eighteen assemblage groups were identified using principal components analysis (PCA) and mapped. Assemblage groups were also identified by cluster analysis. Fish assemblages identified by both methods were spatially coherent. Assemblage distribution patterns were not consistent with accepted biogeographical boundaries. The PCA explained only 56.3% of the variance in distribution of the species, indicating that the assemblages should be interpreted as indeterminate, potentially adaptable entities rather than as rigid ecological constructs. Assemblages were persistent in composition through time but appeared to shift, in location. The apparent looseness of the assemblages and their persistence through time in spite of severe impacts from fishing suggest that single-species management approaches may not be entirely inappropriate for the major groundfish species in the study area.

AB We compared the nesting success of a disturbance-dependent species, the Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), on different kinds of habitat edges in five sites (225 total nests) in southern Illinois from 1989 to 1993. Nest predation rates along agricultural and abrupt, permanent edges (e.g., wildlife openings, campgrounds) were nearly twice as high as rates along more gradual edges where plant succession was allowed to occur (e.g., treefalls, streamsides, gaps created by selective logging). Levels of brood parasitism by Brown-beaded Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) varied significantly among sites and years, but not among edge types. Clutch sizes, however, were significantly smaller at agricultural edges where nest predation rates were also high, which suggests either decreased food availability or a population dominated by younger and/or lower-quality (poor condition) birds. The results of this study illustrate the need to reevaluate management practices (e.g., wildlife openings) that are designed to promote populations of disturbance-dependent wildlife.

TI TREE-DEPENDENT LICHENS AND BEETLES AS INDICATORS IN CONSERVATION FORESTS
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SOUTH SWEDEN
AB We tested whether the conspicuous lichen Lobaria pulmonaria indicates the number of tree-dependent, red-listed species in a hemiboreal forest in southern Sweden. In 18 naturally regenerated, mainly old deciduous forest plots considered to be of high or very high conservation value, the number of red-listed tree lichens or wood beetles was not positively correlated with the area of the forest stands studied (8-56 ha). The 8 stands with L. pulmonaria had about nine (median) red-listed lichens, but 10 stands without L. pulmonaria had only about one such species, a highly significant difference. Similarly, the variation between stands in the number of red-listed wood beetles was considerable, but it was very weakly correlated with the number of red-listed lichens. The number of red-listed wood beetles dependent on dead trees was not different in areas with or without Lobaria pulmonaria, but the number of red-listed wood beetles dependent on hollow trees was higher in stands with Lobaria pulmonaria (median of seven species) than in those without (three species) the lichen. Stands with this lichen species also contained significantly more of other types of lichens that have been proposed as indicators of forest continuity according to three lists. We stress the need for identification of species that could serve as indicators of different types of forest continuity and identify some organism groups that may indicate the different types.

ID COMMUNITY; SIZE
AB The submodel describing benthic biology including a bioturbation module as incorporated in the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model (ERSEM) is discussed. It is linked to a nutrient dynamic model. The structure of the benthic model food web is presented. There are four macrobenthic functional groups, meiobenthos and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The modelling uses 'standard organisms' as basic building blocks, The choice of parameter values is discussed. The results demonstrate the dependence of the benthic system on the pelagic system. The importance of features such as predation within functional groups for stability of the system is investigated. Detritus input from the pelagic system and detritus recycling is most important in the benthic food web. The web of carbon and nutrient fluxes through the system is analysed. On the basis of the food web analysis, the trophic positions of the functional groups are calculated. Besides the benthic biology, the mathematical formulation of the bioturbation and diffusion enhancement is discussed. Macrobenthic presence and activity enhance diffusion in the sediment and contribute essentially to vertical transport of particulate matter. This is of great importance for the vertical distribution of detritus, and as a consequence, for microbial activity in the sediment layers.

   ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING
ID MONITORING PROGRAMS; LESSONS; DESIGN
AB Implementing ecosystem approaches to land use decision making and land management requires new methods for linking science and planning. Greater integration is crucial because under ecosystem management sustainable levels of resource use are determined by coupling management objectives to landscape capabilities and capacities. Recent proposals for implementing ecosystem management employ analyses organized at a hierarchy of scales for analysis and planning. Within this hierarchy, watershed analysis provides a framework for delineating the spatial distribution and linkages between physical processes and biological communities in an appropriate physical context: the watershed. Several such methods are currently in use in the western United States, and although there is no universal procedure for either implementing watershed analysis or linking the results to planning, there are a number of essential elements. A series of questions on landscape-level ecological processes, history, condition, and response potential guide watershed analysis. Individual analysis modules are structured around answering these questions through a spatially-distributed, process-based approach. The planning framework linked to watershed analysis uses this information to either manage environmental impacts or to identify desired conditions and develop land management; prescriptions to achieve these conditions. Watershed analysis offers a number of distinct advantages over contemporary environmental analyses for designing land management scenarios compatible with balancing environmental and economic objectives.

AB The landscape structure and dynamics of NE-European forests were analysed using data from Landsat TM in combination with systematic surveys in the field. The frontier of intensive forestry meets forests undergoing natural dynamics in the image's area. In exploited areas the structural heterogeneity of the vegetation is pronounced, but the most prominent differences between the landscapes in exploited and natural areas were detected in the sizes and surroundings of stands of climax coniferous forests. The distance to the nearest vegetation edge, as measured around random points, decreases by 95% and the former landscape matrix turns to islands surrounded by deciduous vegetation. In natural areas the dynamic processes controlling the landscape structure include fires, windstorms and fluvial dynamics. Vegetation and the processes affecting it vary according to site qualities. In dry sites frequent low-intensity wildfires create small scale vegetation mosaics. In mesic sites post-fire successional stands of deciduous trees are present close to river valleys. In mature Picea abies dominated forests birches also remain essential components of the canopy layer, and forest regeneration occurs in windstorm gaps along with tree mortality through pathogen stress. These steady state boreal forests represent the climatic climax in the study area. The study suggests that some frequently cited generalizations about fire dominated boreal forest dynamics may be over-simplified.

AB Trees greater than or equal to 10 cm gbh were enumerated, mapped and identified in two 4 hectare (ha) (40000 m2) plots in 1985-1987. The number of species recorded was 511 (in 164 genera and 59 families) in a total sample of 17985 individuals. Plots 1 and 2 contain 388 and 387 species respectively, and for trees greater than or equal to 30 cm gbh there are 247 and 242 species. Relative abundance patterns were fitted to a logseries distribution. In each plot, 51% of species are rare (f < 5) and 31% have only one tree (f = 1). Common species (f greater-than-or-equal-to 5) achieve a minimum area at 2 ha. The plots are close 'replicates' in many respects, and 8 ha gives an adequate sample.
   The mean density of trees greater than or equal to 10 cm gbh and 30 cm gbh is 2248 ha-1 and 470 ha-1, with corresponding basal areas of 30.7 m2 ha-1 and 26.6 m2 ha-1. The linear relation between ln frequency and ln gbh, the small (0.5%) ground area of gaps, and the low contribution by pioneer species show little recent disturbance. Dominance by 2-4 understorey species is pronounced.
   For trees greater than or equal to 30 cm gbh, the Euphorbiaceae contribute the most to density at 21%, with Dipterocarpaeceae second at 16%: corresponding basal areas are 7% and 49%. For trees greater than or equal to 10 cm gbh, density of the Euphorbiaceae reaches 28%, Dipterocarpaceae 9%, followed by Annonaceae 8%, Lauraceae 7% and Meliaceae 6%. Lauraceae was the most species-rich family (83 species), then Euphorbiaceae (51 species) and Meliaceae (36 species).
   Compared with the means of nine other sites in this forest type, Danum has 84% of the density and 74% of the basal area for trees greater than or equal to 30 cm gbh; and 60% of the species richness for this size class on a 1-1.6 ha basis. The forest is differentiated by its dominance by Euphorbiaceae, in terms of tree density, and the high contributions made by Lauraceae and Meliaceae. These attributes may reflect special site conditions and/or a late stage in recovery from past disturbance.

AB Transformations towards sustainability are needed to address many of the earth's profound environmental and social challenges. Yet, actions taken to deliberately shift social-ecological systems towards more sustainable trajectories can have substantial social impacts and exclude people from decision-making processes. The concept of just transformations makes explicit a need to consider social justice in the process of shifting towards sustainability. In this paper, we draw on the transformations, just transitions, and social justice literature to advance a pragmatic framing of just transformations that includes recognitional, procedural and distributional considerations. Decision-making processes to guide just transformations need to consider these three factors before, during and after the transformation period. We offer practical and methodological guidance to help navigate just transformations in environmental management and sustainability policies and practice. The framing of just transformations put forward here might be used to inform decision making in numerous marine and terrestrial ecosystems, in rural and urban environments, and at various scales from local to global. We argue that sustainability transformations cannot be considered a success unless social justice is a central concern.

AB Climate change is leading to shifts in species geographical distributions, but populations are also probably adapting to environmental change at different rates across their range. Owing to a lack of natural and empirical data on the influence of phenotypic adaptation on range shifts of marine species, we provide a general conceptual model for understanding population responses to climate change that incorporates plasticity and adaptation to environmental change in marine ecosystems. We use this conceptual model to help inform where within the geographical range each mechanism will probably operate most strongly and explore the supporting evidence in species. We then expand the discussion from a single-species perspective to community-level responses and use the conceptual model to visualize and guide research into the important yet poorly understood processes of plasticity and adaptation.
   This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of plasticity in phenotypic adaptation to rapid environmental change'.

AB Populations of many species are genetically adapted to local historical climate conditions. Yet most forecasts of species' distributions under climate change have ignored local adaptation (LA), which may paint a false picture of how species will respond across their geographic ranges. We review recent studies that have incorporated intraspecific variation, a potential proxy for LA, into distribution forecasts, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and make recommendations for how to improve forecasts in the face of LA. The three methods used so far (species distribution models, response functions, and mechanistic models) reflect a trade-off between data availability and the ability to rigorously demonstrate LA to climate. We identify key considerations for incorporating LA into distribution forecasts that are currently missing from many published studies, including testing the spatial scale and pattern of LA, the confounding effects of LA to nonclimatic or biotic drivers, and the need to incorporate empirically based dispersal or gene flow processes. We suggest approaches to better evaluate these aspects of LA and their effects on species-level forecasts. In particular, we highlight demographic and dynamic evolutionary models as promising approaches to better integrate LA into forecasts, and emphasize the importance of independent model validation. Finally, we urge closer examination of how LA will alter the responses of central vs. marginal populations to allow stronger generalizations about changes in distribution and abundance in the face of LA.

AB Imidacloprid (IMI), a systemic neonicotinoid insecticide widely used in worldwide scale, is reported in freshwater bodies. Nevertheless, there is a lack of information about IMI sublethal effects on freshwater fish. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the potential hazard of this insecticide to the South American fish Prochilodus lineatus exposed for 120 h to four IMI concentrations (1.25, 12.5, 125, and 1250 mu g L-1). A set of biochemical, genotoxic and physiological biomarkers were evaluated in different organs of the fish. IMI exposure induced significant changes in the enzymatic profiles of P. lineatus, with alterations in the activity of biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes in different tissues. Redox balance of the tissues was affected, since oxidative damage such as lipoperoxidation (LPO) and protein carbonylation (PCC) were evidenced in the liver, gills, kidney and brain of fish exposed to different IMI concentrations. Fish exposed to all IMI concentrations showed decreased blood glucose indicating an increase of energetic demand. DNA damage was evidenced by the comet test, in the erythrocytes of fish all the concentrations evaluated. We integrated these results in the Integrated Biomarker Response (IBR) index, which evidenced that the organs most affected by IMI exposure were the liver and kidney, followed by the gills. Our results highlight the importance of investigating different target tissues after IMI exposure and show the sublethal effects of IMI in some of them; they also warn to the possible consequences that fish living in freshwater ecosystems can suffer due to IMI exposure.

AB Bacterial adaptation is accelerated by the acquisition of novel traits through horizontal gene transfer, but the integration of these genes affects genome organization. We found that transferred genes are concentrated in only similar to 1% of the chromosomal regions (hotspots) in 80 bacterial species. This concentration increases with genome size and with the rate of transfer. Hotspots diversify by rapid gene turnover; their chromosomal distribution depends on local contexts (neighboring core genes), and content in mobile genetic elements. Hotspots concentrate most changes in gene repertoires, reduce the trade-off between genome diversification and organization, and should be treasure troves of strain-specific adaptive genes. Most mobile genetic elements and antibiotic resistance genes are in hotspots, but many hotspots lack recognizable mobile genetic elements and exhibit frequent homologous recombination at flanking core genes. Overrepresentation of hotspots with fewer mobile genetic elements in naturally transformable bacteria suggests that homologous recombination and horizontal gene transfer are tightly linked in genome evolution.

AB Rapid urbanization has induced numerous ecological and environmental issues seriously threatening the ecological security. The ecological security pattern (ESP), an effective way for protecting the ecological security, is becoming increasingly important in reconciling the rapid urbanization and ecology protection in urban planning practices. Based on the cost-distance analysis method, we constructed a three-rank (basic, moderate and strict-rank) composite ESP of Gaoming (Guangdong, China) aiming at protecting the survivals and habitat securities of rare vegetations, wild animals and human beings. The proposed composite ESP is established on five equal-weighted individual ESPs (namely Geology-ESP, Hydrology-ESP, Atmosphere-ESP, Biodiversity-ESP and Farmland-ESP) for geologic disasters prevention, flood prevention and drinking water protection, air pollution prevention, biodiversity conservation and farmland protection, respectively. Our results show that under the basic, moderate, and strict-rank ESPs, the integration and connectivity of the ecological components are constantly improved, but the connectivity between neighboring urban patches decline gradually. The moderate-rank ESP proves to be the optimal spatial pattern for balancing the conflicts between urban development and ecological protection. Notably, the ESP that considers the security of atmosphere and farmland securities, which protects the regional farmlands better and well balance the expansions of industrial and residual lands, proves to be much more reasonable.

AB Trees alter their use and allocation of nutrients in response to drought, and changes in soil nutrient cycling and trace gas flux (N2O and CH4) are observed when experimental drought is imposed on forests. In extreme droughts, trees are increasingly susceptible to attack by pests and pathogens, which can lead to major changes in nutrient flux to the soil. Extreme droughts often lead to more common and more intense forest fires, causing dramatic changes in the nutrient storage and loss from forest ecosystems. Changes in the future manifestation of drought will affect carbon uptake and storage in forests, leading to feedbacks to the Earth's climate system. We must improve the recognition of drought in nature, our ability to manage our forests in the face of drought, and the parameterization of drought in earth system models for improved predictions of carbon uptake and storage in the world's forests.

AB Species distribution models (SDMs) have been criticized for involving assumptions that ignore or categorize many ecologically relevant factors such as dispersal ability and biotic interactions. Another potential source of model error is the assumption that species are ecologically uniform in their climatic tolerances across their range. Typically, SDMs treat a species as a single entity, although populations of many species differ due to local adaptation or other genetic differentiation. Not taking local adaptation into account may lead to incorrect range prediction and therefore misplaced conservation efforts. A constraint is that we often do not know the degree to which populations are locally adapted. Lacking experimental evidence, we still can evaluate niche differentiation within a species' range to promote better conservation decisions. We explore possible conservation implications of making type I or type II errors in this context. For each of two species, we construct three separate MaxEnt models, one considering the species as a single population and two of disjunct populations. Principal component analyses and response curves indicate different climate characteristics in the current environments of the populations. Model projections into future climates indicate minimal overlap between areas predicted to be climatically suitable by the whole species vs. population-based models. We present a workflow for addressing uncertainty surrounding local adaptation in SDM application and illustrate the value of conducting population-based models to compare with whole-species models. These comparisons might result in more cautious management actions when alternative range outcomes are considered.

AB Hydraulic impairment due to xylem embolism and carbon starvation are the two proposed mechanisms explaining drought-induced forest dieback and tree death. Here, we evaluate the relative role played by these two mechanisms in the long-term by quantifying wood-anatomical traits (tracheid size and area of parenchyma rays) and estimating the intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) from carbon isotopic discrimination. We selected silver fir and Scots pine stands in NE Spain with ongoing dieback processes and compared trees showing contrasting vigour (declining vs nondeclining trees). In both species earlywood tracheids in declining trees showed smaller lumen area with thicker cell wall, inducing a lower theoretical hydraulic conductivity. Parenchyma ray area was similar between the two vigour classes. Wet spring and summer conditions promoted the formation of larger lumen areas, particularly in the case of nondeclining trees. Declining silver firs presented a lower iWUE than conspecific nondeclining trees, but the reverse pattern was observed in Scots pine. The described patterns in wood anatomical traits and iWUE are coherent with a long-lasting deterioration of the hydraulic system in declining trees prior to their dieback. Retrospective quantifications of lumen area permit to forecast dieback in declining trees 2-5 decades before growth decline started. Wood anatomical traits provide a robust tool to reconstruct the long-term capacity of trees to withstand drought-induced dieback.

ID ENERGY-BALANCE; HEAT FLUXES; MODEL; IMPACT; RADIATION
AB Pavement surface temperature is critical to the pavement performance and the development of cool pavements. The variations of the pavement surface temperature have been documented in numerous empirical models. These models, however, exclude critical parameters like albedo and thermal inertia but include many empirical parameters that have no thermo-physical meanings. This study presents a theoretical model to predict the surface temperature of pavements and validates it against field data and numerical results from the existing studies. It is found that the amplitude, maximum, and minimum of the pavement surface temperature increase linearly with the pavement surface absorptivity, the daily zenith incident solar irradiation, and the reciprocal thermal inertia. Among these, raising the pavement albedo is more effective to reduce the pavement surface temperature than increasing the pavement thermal inertia. The model has practical meanings to predicting the maximum, minimum, and amplitude of the pavement surface temperature and to developing cool pavements. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB AimThree broad mechanisms have been proposed to explain geographic variation in species range size: habitat area/heterogeneity, climate seasonality and long-term climate variability. However, it has proved difficult to disentangle their relative role, particularly as temperature seasonality often covaries with the amplitude of long-term temperature oscillations. Here, we shed new light onto this debate by providing the first continental-scale analysis of range size and beta diversity in groundwater habitats, where taxa are not exposed to latitudinal variation in temperature seasonality.
   LocationEurope.
   MethodsWe compiled and mapped occurrence data for 1570 groundwater crustacean species. Generalized regression models were used to test for latitudinal variation in geographic range size and to assess the relative role of the three broad mechanisms in shaping present-day patterns of range size. We partitioned beta diversity into its spatial turnover and nestedness components and analysed their latitudinal variation across Europe.
   ResultsMedian range size increases with latitude above 43 degrees N and the range size of individual species is positively correlated to latitude, even after accounting for phylogenetic effects. Long-term temperature variability accounted for a substantially higher variation in median range size of groundwater crustaceans across Europe than precipitation seasonality and habitat heterogeneity, including aquifer area, elevation range, climatic rarity and productive energy. Spatial turnover contributes significantly more to beta diversity in southern regions characterized by stable historic climates than it does in northern Europe.
   Main conclusionsOur findings add support to the historic climate hypothesis which suggests that patterns of increasing range size and decreasing species turnover at higher latitudes in the Palaearctic region are primarily driven by long-term temperature oscillations rather than by climatic seasonality and the availability and heterogeneity of habitats.

AB Generalist species with numerous food web interactions are thought to provide stability to ecosystem dynamics; however, it is not always clear whether habitat generality translates into dietary diversity. Big brown bats are common across North America and employ a flexible foraging strategy over water, dense forests, forest edges and rural and urban settings. Despite this generalist use of habitat, they are paradoxically characterized as beetle specialists. However, hard carapaces may preferentially survive digestion leading to over-representation during morphological analysis of diet. This specialization has not been evaluated independently using molecular analysis and species-level identification of prey. We used next-generation sequencing to assess the diet of big brown bats. Beetles were consumed in the highest frequency but Lepidoptera species richness was highest among identified prey. The consumption of species showed strong seasonal and annual variation. While Coleoptera consumption varied, Lepidoptera and Ephemeroptera were relatively constant dietary components. Dietary diversity increased in late summer when insect diversity decreases. Our results indicate that big brown bats are dietary generalists and, while beetles are an important component of the diet, Lepidoptera are equally important, and Lepidoptera and Ephemeroptera are the only stable prey resource exploited. As resources become limited, big brown bats may respond by increasing the species richness of prey and thus their connectedness in the ecosystem. This characterization of diet corresponds well with a generalist approach to foraging, making them an important species in encouraging and maintaining ecosystem stability.

AB Although vast areas in tropical regions have weathered soils with low potassium (K) levels, little is known about the effects of K supply on the photosynthetic physiology of trees. This study assessed the effects of K and sodium (Na) supply on the diffusional and biochemical limitations to photosynthesis in Eucalyptus grandis leaves. A field experiment comparing treatments receiving K (+K) or Na (+Na) with a control treatment (C) was set up in a K-deficient soil. The net CO2 assimilation rates were twice as high in +K and 1.6 times higher in +Na than in the C as a result of lower stomatal and mesophyll resistance to CO2 diffusion and higher photosynthetic capacity. The starch content was higher and soluble sugar was lower in +K than in C and +Na, suggesting that K starvation disturbed carbon storage and transport. The specific leaf area, leaf thickness, parenchyma thickness, stomatal size and intercellular air spaces increased in +K and +Na compared to C. Nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations were also higher in +K and +Na than in C. These results suggest a strong relationship between the K and Na supply to E.grandis trees and the functional and structural limitations to CO2 assimilation rates.

AB How best to manage forest patches, mitigate the consequences of forest fragmentation, and enable landscape permeability are key questions facing conservation scientists and managers. Many temperate forests have become increasingly fragmented, resulting in reduced interior forest habitat, increased edge habitats, and reduced connectivity. Using a citizen science landscape-scale mark-release-recapture study on 87 macro-moth species, we investigated how both life-history traits and landscape characteristics predicted macro-moth responses to forest fragmentation. Wingspan, wing shape, adult feeding, and larval feeding guild predicted macro-moth mobility, although the predictive power of wingspan and wing shape depended on the species' affinity to the forest. Solitary trees and small fragments functioned as stepping stones, especially when their landscape connectivity was increased, by being positioned within hedgerows or within a favorable matrix. Mobile forest specialists were most affected by forest fragmentation: despite their high intrinsic dispersal capability, these species were confined mostly to the largest of the forest patches due to their strong affinity for the forest habitat, and were also heavily dependent on forest connectivity in order to cross the agricultural matrix. Forest fragments need to be larger than five hectares and to have interior forest more than 100 m from the edge in order to sustain populations of forest specialists. Our study provides new insights into the movement patterns of a functionally important insect group, with implications for the landscape-scale management of forest patches within agricultural landscapes.

AB Citizen science the partnering of scientists with members of the public to do research is increasingly utilized in environmental research, having been credited with enabling studies that would otherwise be cost-prohibitive while promoting scientific literacy and empowering and engaging participants in conservation. Although the value of citizen-generated data for scientific purposes is increasingly accepted, and there is a growing recognition of the role of citizen science in developing science literacy, there has been little investigation of its link to conservation outcomes particularly in terms of volunteers' further engagement in conservation. This paper reviews the literature on the relationship between participation in citizen science and conservation attitude and behavior changes, and looks at the relevance of theoretical models to shed light on possible drivers of such changes. We discuss two citizen science projects in the New York metropolitan area the Great Pollinator Project and the Earthwatch Coyote Project as illustrations of the impact of citizen science on attitudes and behaviors as perceived by participants. We offer recommendations for further research on facilitating conservation outcomes through citizen science.

AB Prescribed fire has been used in a coordinated manner to manage fuels in eucalypt forests of southern Australia since the 1950s. The impetus for planned use of fire arose from the need to reduce the impact of extensive, high intensity fires on life, property and commercial forest values. Prescribed fire is increasingly recognised as also playing an important role in mitigating undesirable effects of high intensity fires on environmental values including soil, water and biodiversity. Critical elements for an effective prescribed fire program include a sound understanding of fire behaviour, an experienced and flexible workforce, and organisational commitment to adaptive management involving planning, monitoring and applied research. Implementation of prescribed fire programs has been closely linked with, and dependent upon, the development of burning guides for particular forest types through empirical field research. The contribution of prescribed fire to mitigating the effects of extensive, high intensity fires can be quantified in a variety of ways using basic combustion science, well-documented case studies, analysis of fire statistics, and simulation. Fuel reduction can improve the safety, efficiency and effectiveness of fire suppression, although these effects may be subtle and difficult to measure. Social and political factors can significantly influence the conduct and effectiveness of prescribed fire programs, and effective engagement with the community during planning, implementation and post-fire monitoring phases is essential to ensure that the role of prescribed fire in land management is properly recognised and understood.

AB Obligate eusociality with distinct caste phenotypes has evolved from strictly monogamous sub-social ancestors in ants, some bees, some wasps and some termites. This implies that no lineage reached the most advanced form of social breeding, unless helpers at the nest gained indirect fitness values via siblings that were identical to direct fitness via offspring. The complete lack of re-mating promiscuity equalizes sex-specific variances in reproductive success. Later, evolutionary developments towards multiple queen-mating retained lifetime commitment between sexual partners, but reduced male variance in reproductive success relative to female's, similar to the most advanced vertebrate cooperative breeders. Here, I (i) discuss some of the unique and highly peculiar mating system adaptations of eusocial insects; (ii) address ambiguities that remained after earlier reviews and extend the monogamy logic to the evolution of soldier castes; (iii) evaluate the evidence for indirect fitness benefits driving the dynamics of (in) vertebrate cooperative breeding, while emphasizing the fundamental differences between obligate eusociality and cooperative breeding; (iv) infer that lifetime commitment is a major driver towards higher levels of organization in bodies, colonies and mutualisms. I argue that evolutionary informative definitions of social systems that separate direct and indirect fitness benefits facilitate transparency when testing inclusive fitness theory.

AB Nutrition is critical to immune defence and parasite resistance, which not only affects individual organisms, but also has profound ecological and evolutionary consequences. Nutrition and immunity are complex traits that interact via multiple direct and indirect pathways, including the direct effects of nutrition on host immunity but also indirect effects mediated by the host's microbiota and pathogen populations. The challenge remains, however, to capture the complexity of the network of interactions that defines nutritional immunology. The aim of this paper is to discuss the recent findings in nutritional research in the context of immunological studies. By taking examples from the entomological literature, we argue that insects provide a powerful tool for examining the network of interactions between nutrition and immunity due to their tractability, short lifespan and ethical considerations. We describe the relationships between dietary composition, immunity, disease and microbiota in insects, and highlight the importance of adopting an integrative and multi-dimensional approach to nutritional immunology.

AB Changes in climate are affecting the distribution and status of species on a global scale, through alteration of factors including their phenology, growth and ecological interactions. These alterations are often most apparent at species range edges, where changes to conditions previously limiting the species distribution can result in range shifts. In this paper, we review the rapid recent increase in our understanding of the factors limiting the distribution of a species to explore how the interaction of biotic and abiotic factors is likely to significantly alter its range edge behaviour beyond our current predictive capacity. We focus on Scots pine (Pious sylvestris L), one of the most abundant tree species on the globe. Glacial refugia and colonisation routes after last glacial maximum have strongly influenced the genetic diversity and local adaptation of this species. Over recent decades, increased reproduction and growth has been detected at the northern limit of P. sylvestris as a response to increased temperature, whereas at its southern limit, increased drought stress has resulted in decreased growth, low recruitment, and in some cases a massive mortality of this species. In addition, direct climatic effects on the species are acting together with indirect effects due to altered biotic interactions including outbreaks of insects, pathogens, and parasites, and increased herbivory linked to declining ecosystem productivity. However, whilst predictive studies forecast a gradual decline of the species at the southern range limit and expansion at higher latitudes, models do not commonly include biotic factors, which can significantly modify the response of the species to climatic changes. We conclude by discussing the early detection of imperilled areas and how their natural resistance and resilience to ongoing climatic changes might be increased. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB A rapidly increasing effort to merge functional community ecology and phylogenetic biology has increased our understanding of community assembly. However, studies using both phylogenetic- and trait-based methods have been mainly conducted in old-growth forests, with fewer studies in human-disturbed communities, which play an increasingly important role in providing ecosystem services as primary forests are degraded. We used data from 18 1-ha plots in tropical old-growth forests and secondary forests with different disturbance histories (logging and shifting cultivation) and vegetation types (tropical lowland and montane forests) on Hainan Island, southern China. The distributions of 11 functional traits were compared among these six forest types. We used a null model approach to assess the effects of disturbance regimes on variation in response and effect traits and community phylogenetic structure across different stem sizes (saplings, treelets, and adult trees) and spatial scales (1050 m). We found significant differences in the distribution of functional traits in highly disturbed lowland sites versus other forest types. Many individuals in highly disturbed lowland sites were deciduous, spiny, with non-fleshy fruits and seeds dispersed passively or by wind, and low SLA. The response traits of coexisting species were clustered in all sites except for highly disturbed lowland sites where evenness was evident. There were different distributions of effect traits for saplings and treelets among different forest types but adult trees showed stronger clustering of trait values with increasing spatial scale among all forest types. Phylogenetic clustering predominated across all size classes and spatial scales in the highly disturbed lowland sites, and evenness in other forest types. High disturbance can lead to abiotic filtering, generating a community dominated by closely related species with disturbance-adapted traits, where biotic interactions play a relatively minor role. In lightly disturbed and old growth forests, multiple processes simultaneously drive the community assembly, but biotic processes dominate at the fine scale.

AB Plant studies that have investigated the fitness consequences of growing with siblings have found conflicting evidence that can support different theoretical frameworks. Depending on whether siblings or strangers have higher fitness in competition, kin selection, niche partitioning and competitive ability have been invoked. Here, we bring together these processes in a conceptual synthesis and argue that they can be co-occurring. We propose that these processes can be reconciled and argue for a trait-based approach of measuring natural selection instead of the fitness-based approach to the study of sibling competition. This review will improve the understanding of how plants interact socially under competitive situations, and provide a framework for future studies.

AB Pine forests bordering the Mediterranean Sea are often affected by severe wildfires, which cause major changes to soil organic matter (SUM). In this paper, recently burned and adjacent unburned areas of two coastal pine forests of Tuscany, Central Italy, were compared in terms of SUM quantity and quality to assess the nature and intensity of such fire-induced changes. Quantitative modification of the SUM stock was investigated by sampling in a grid pattern. Pre-fire and post-fire bulk SUM were analysed for stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes concentrations (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and spectroscopic properties (solid-state CP-MAS C-13 NMR). In addition, we determined the fraction of SUM resistant to acid dichromate oxidation, here assumed to be "pyrogenic" carbon, and the lignin composition after CuO oxidation.
   The results showed that at the two sites there were similar, significant losses in soil C, in spite of different times passed since the fire. Such C losses are attributable to the almost complete elimination of the litter layer, whereas the underlying mineral soil did not show any significant change in its carbon content. In terms of composition, the bulk SUM did experience a minor decrease in O-alkyl C and a parallel increase in aromatic C, but no significant change in the relative concentrations of C-13 and N-15 and the amount of pyrogenic C. On the contrary, fire markedly modified soil lignin composition. We recorded changes in the coumaryl to vanillyl and syringyl to vanillyl ratios of lignin-derived phenols, both of which are indicators of the lignin source. Furthermore, at one site, fire significantly increased the acid to aldehyde ratio of vanillyl and syringyl phenols, indicating that fire can affect soil lignin degradation and the overall C cycle. In conclusion, this study suggests that in fire-prone Mediterranean pine forests each fire may influence total SUM stocks and its chemical composition. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Saprotrophic fungal community composition, determined by the outcome of competitive mycelia] interactions, is one of the many key factors affecting soil nutrient mineralisation and decomposition rates. Fungal communities are not generally predicted to be regulated by top-down factors, such as predation, but rather by bottom-up factors, including resource availability. We show that invertebrate grazers can exert selective pressures on fungal decomposer communities in soil, reversing the outcomes of competitive interactions. By feeding selectively on the cord-forming fungus Resinicium bicolor, isopods prevented the competitive exclusion of Hypholoma fasciculare and Pbanerochaete velutina in soil and wood. Nematode populations also reversed the outcomes of competitive interactions by stimulating growth of less competitive fungi. These represent two opposing mechanisms by which soil fauna may influence fungal community composition and diversity. Factors affecting soil invertebrate communities will have direct consequences for fungal-mediated nutrient cycling in woodland soils.

AB Species' potential distribution modelling consists of building a representation of the fundamental ecological requirements of a species from biotic and abiotic conditions where the species is known to occur. Such models can be valuable tools to understand the biogeography of species and to support the prediction of its presence/absence considering a particular environment scenario. This paper investigates the use of different supervised machine learning techniques to model the potential distribution of 35 plant species from Latin America. Each technique was able to extract a different representation of the relations between the environmental conditions and the distribution profile of the species. The experimental results highlight the good performance of random trees classifiers, indicating this particular technique as a promising candidate for modelling species' potential distribution.

AB Competition for mates, cub rearing, and other behaviors differ between males and females in large carnivores. Although these differences can be reflected in patterns of habitat use, gender has rarely been incorporated into habitat models. We evaluated differences in habitat use between male and female jaguars in the Mayan Forest of the Yucatan Peninsula by modeling occupancy as a function of land cover type, distance to roads, and sex. Nested models were fitted to high-spatiotemporal resolution satellite (GPS) telemetry, controlled for temporal autocorrelation, and eliminated selection bias of pseudo-absences using a semi-non-parametric bootstrap. Although both male and female jaguars prefer tall forest, short forest was also preferred by females but avoided by males. Whereas females significantly avoided roads, males didn't and ventured into low-intensity cattle ranching and agriculture. Females' preference for intact forests and against roads led to their habitat being fragmented to a greater degree than that of males. Models that ignored sexual differences failed to capture the effect of roads and agriculture on jaguar habitat use, blurred the distinction of use between short and tall forest, and underestimated fragmentation of female jaguar habitat; but incorporating these differences increased precision of habitat maps and allowed the identification of potential jaguar-human conflict areas associated with male's use of cattle and agricultural lands. Specifying sex differences increases the power of habitat models to understand landscape occupancy by large carnivores, and so greater attention should be paid to these differences in their modeling and conservation.

AB With the recognition that eddy flux measurements are relatively accurate for a variety of common situations, a number of issues leading to inaccurate flux estimates and/or ambiguous interpretation of flux values are surveyed. These issues include inadvertent conversion of random errors to systematic errors, ambiguous differentiation between turbulence and other motions, and omission of transport by stationary eddies. Correcting for sonic misalignment and flow distortion in the presence of real systematic vertical motions is also problematic. Special emphasis is placed on the need for spatial information, partly to include vertical transport by stationary circulations induced by small-scale surface features. While no categorical solutions to the above problems are offered, promising approaches worthy of more investigation are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Loess Plateau of China is a special region that has suffered from soil erosion and water loss for a long time. Ecological restoration is an urgent task for this region. This study aims to characterize the variation in the vegetation restoration process on the abandoned croplands in the loess area. A series of quadrats were set up in different restoration stages in the Yancun watershed, Shanxi Province, an area of typical loess hills and gullies. Species and environmental data were recorded in each quadrat. Multivariate analysis and indices for species richness, diversity and evenness were used in the analysis. A series of plant community stages with different composition, structure and environments were identified by clustering analysis (UPGMA). These communities included three main restoration stages, grassland stage, scrubland stage and forest stage, and nine sub-stages, i.e. nine associations. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that time since abandonment was the key factor for the restoration process, and the first CCA axis was effectively a time gradient. Elevation, soil type, slope and aspect were also important in the restoration process in the loess area. Species richness and diversity increased, and evenness decreased in the restoration process. The variation of species richness and diversity significantly correlated with time since abandonment, elevation and soil type. Time since abandonment is most important to the restoration process and species diversity is the main indicator of community changes in restoration in the Loess Plateau. For effective management, abandoned lands should be kept from disturbance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mathematical models in fish nutrition have proven indispensable in estimating growth and feed requirements. Nowadays, reducing the environmental footprint and improving product quality of fish culture operations are of increasing interest. This review starts by examining simple models applied to describe/predict fish growth profiles and progresses towards more comprehensive concepts based on bioenergetics and nutrient metabolism. Simple growth models often lack biological interpretation and overlook fundamental properties of fish (e.g. ectothermy, indeterminate growth). In addition, these models disregard possible variations in growth trajectory across life stages. Bioenergetic models have served to predict not only fish growth but also feed requirements and waste outputs from fish culture operations. However, bioenergetics is a concept based on energy-yielding equivalence of chemicals and has significant limitations. Nutrient-based models have been introduced into the fish nutrition literature over the last two decades and stand as a more biologically sound alternative to bioenergetic models. More mechanistic models are required to expand current understanding about growth targets and nutrient utilization for biomass gain. Finally, existing models need to be adapted further to address effectively concerns regarding sustainability, product quality and body traits.

AB Under simple assumptions, the evolution of epistatic "Dobzhansky-Muller" incompatibilities between a pair of species should yield an accelerating decline of log overall reproductive compatibility-a "snowball" effect that might rapidly provide new species with "reality." Possible alternatives include: (1) simple exponential failure, giving a linear rate of log compatibility loss, and (2) "slow-down," likely during reinforcement in which mate choice evolves to prevent deleterious hybridization, yielding a decelerating log compatibility loss. In analyses of multiple datasets, we find little support for the snowball effect, except possibly in Lepidoptera hybrid viability. The snowball predicts a slow initial rate of incompatibility acquisition, with low initial variance; instead, highly variable compatibility is almost universally observed at low genetic distances. Another deviation from predictions is that reproductive isolation usually remains incomplete until long after speciation. These results do not disprove snowball compatibility decay, but can result if large deleterious effects are due to relatively few genetic changes, or if different types of incompatibility evolve at very different rates. On the other hand, data on Bacillus and Saccharomyces, as well as theories of chromosomal evolution, suggest that some kinds of incompatibility accumulate approximately linearly, without Dobzhansky-Muller effects. In microorganisms, linearity can result from direct negative effects of DNA sequence divergence on compatibility. Finally, a decelerating slowdown model is supported for sympatric Leptasterias starfish, and in Drosophila prezygotic isolation in sympatry but not allopatry, providing novel comparative evidence for reinforcement.

We show that our technique is statistically consistent under standard stochastic assumptions, that is, it returns the correct tree given sufficiently many unlinked loci. We also show that it can tolerate moderate estimation errors.

AB The intensity of a fire is an important factor determining the recovery of soil microorganisms after a forest fire, since it can alter the quality and quantity of carbon sources. Recovery of the microbial community was studied in a Mediterranean pine forest soil subjected to different temperatures to simulate the short-term effects of fire intensity on bacterial and fungal growth, estimated using leucine incorporation for bacteria and acetate incorporation into ergosterol for fungi. Soil samples were heated for 15 min at 50, 80,120, 200, 300, 400 and 500 degrees C. After inoculation with fresh soil, and adding water to achieve 60% WHC, the soils were incubated at 20 degrees C for 21 days. Bacterial growth was initially inhibited in the samples heated above 50 degrees C (totally inhibited >= 200 degrees C), but recovered within days to levels much higher than the control, except for the samples heated at 500 degrees C, where growth remained low throughout the incubation period due to the destruction of most of the organic matter. After the first week of incubation, the bacterial response decreased to values close to, but still above, that of the control. Samples heated at 200 degrees C showed the highest cumulative bacterial growth. Fungal growth was initially lower than in the control in all the heated samples (totally inhibited >= 200 degrees C). Fungal growth recovered slowly during incubation in soils heated at <= 300 degrees C, but the cumulative growth in heated soils did not exceed that in the control. No fungal growth was observed in samples heated at the two highest temperatures. Soil respiration was initially totally inhibited in soil heated at >= 200 degrees C, but recovered rapidly in all soils; the highest respiration being observed already 1 day after inoculation. This is the first time both fungal and bacterial growth has been directly estimated in heated soils. High soil pH favouring bacteria can explain these results, but the differences in fungal and bacterial responses suggest a competitive interaction between these groups. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Phylogeographic studies are lacking in the Southern Hemisphere, and in particular in the south-eastern Pacific. To infer the possible scenario for the debated biogeographic transition zone located at 30-33 degrees S along the Chilean coast, we investigated whether there is a concordance between the phylogeographic pattern and the biogeographic transition in the intertidal kelp Lessonia nigrescens; whose distribution is continuous across this transition zone. Using a combination of four makers located in the three genomic compartments (chloroplast, mitochondria and nucleus), we showed the presence of two main divergent lineages, possibly cryptic species. There was an exact match of the phylogeographic break with the 30 degrees S biogeographic transition zone, suggesting a common origin. The combined information given by the multilocus approach and by the population analysis suggested the occurrence of a budding speciation, with a northward range expansion. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Cork oak, (Quercus suber) is widely distributed in the Mediterranean region, all area subject to frequent fires. The ash produced by burning can have impacts on the soil status and water resources that can differ according to the temperature reached during fire and the characteristics of the litter, defined as the dead organic matter accumulated oil the soil surface prior to the fire. The aim of this work is to determine the physical and chemical characteristics of ash produced in laboratory experiments to approximate conditions typical of fires in this region. The litter of Quercus suber collected from two different plots oil the Iberian Peninsula, Mas Bassets (Catalonia) and Albufeira (Portugal), was combusted at different temperatures for 2 h. We measured Mass Loss (ML per cent), ash colour and CaCO3 content, pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC) and the major cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and Na+) released from ash slurries created by mixing ash with deionized water. The results showed that ML per cent is higher at all temperatures in Albufeira samples compared to Mas Bassets samples, except at 550 degrees C, and the rate of loss increases faster with temperature than the Mas Bassets samples. At 150 degrees C the ash colour is yellowish, becoming reddish at 200-250 degrees C and black at 300 degrees C. Above 400 degrees C the ash is grey/white. This thermal degradation is mostly observed in Albufeira litter. The formation of CaCO3 was identified at a lower temperature in Albufeira litter. At temperatures <300 degrees C, pH and EC values are lower, rising at higher temperatures, especially in Albufeira slurries. The concentration of cations at lower temperatures does not differ substantially from the unburned sample except for Mg2+. The cation concentration increases at medium temperatures and decrease at higher temperatures, especially the concentration of divalent cations. The monovalent cations showed a larger concentration at moderate temperatures, mainly in Albufeira ash slurries. The analysis of the Ca:Mg ratio also showed that for the same temperature, a higher severity results for Albufeira litter. Potential negative effects on soil properties are observed at medium and higher temperatures. These negative effects include a higher percentage of mass loss, meaning more soil may be exposed to erosion, higher pH values and greater cation release from ash, especially monovalalent cations (K+, Na+) in higher proportions than the divalent ions (Ca2+, Mg2+), that can lead to impacts oil soil physical properties like aggregate stability. Furthermore, the ions in ash may alter soil chemistry which may be detrimental to some plants thus altering the recovery of these ecosystems after fire. Low intensity prescribed fire can be a useful tool to land management in these sites, due to the reduced effects of fire temperatures oil the physical and chemical properties of surface litter, and call reduce the risk of high temperature wildland fires by reducing fuel loadings. From the perspective of water resources, lower fire temperatures produce fewer impacts on the chemistry of overland flow and there is less probability that the soil Surface will be eroded.

AB Global changes have the potential to cause a mass extinction. Predicting how species will respond to anticipated changes is a necessary prerequisite to effectively conserving them and reducing extinction rates. Species niche models are widely used for such predictions, but their reliability over long time periods is known to vary. However, climate and land use changes in northern countries provide a pseudo-experiment to test model reliability for predicting future conditions, provided historical data on both species distributions and environmental conditions are available. Using maximum entropy, a prominent modeling technique, we constructed historical models of butterfly species' ranges across Canada and then ran the models forward to present-day to test how well they predicted the current ranges of species. For the majority of species, projections of how we predicted species would respond to known climate changes corresponded with species' observed responses (mean autoregressive R-2 = 0.70). This correspondence declined for northerly and very widely distributed species. Our results demonstrate that at least some species are tracking shifting climatic conditions across very large geographic areas and that these shifts can be predicted accurately using niche models. We also found, however, that models for some species fail when projected through time despite high spatial model accuracies during model training, highlighting the need to base management decisions on species assemblages, not individual species.

ID WILD; DIVERSITY
AB Aim Gap analysis is a well-established conservation technique that identifies areas in which selected elements of biodiversity are represented and through comparison with existing in situ protected area networks identifies habitats or ecosystems that need additional protection. We aim to demonstrate that gap analysis may be extended to encompass both in situ and ex situ genetic diversity conservation strategies.
   Location Global, with exemplar case study from sub-Saharan Africa.
   Methods An extended methodology of gap analysis is proposed that involves the following steps: (1) circumscription of target taxon and target area; (2) assessment of natural diversity through a review of intrinsic taxonomic, genetic and ecogeographical diversity combined with threat assessment; (3) assessment of current complementary in situ and ex situ conservation strategies; and (4) reformulation of the conservation strategy through analysis of the differences between the pattern of natural, intrinsic diversity and the elements of that diversity already effectively represented by existing in situ and ex situ conservation actions.
   Results To illustrate the gap analysis approach proposed, the methodology was applied to the conservation of African Vigna species (cowpea Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. and its wild relatives) and indicated: (1) genetic reserves should be established at the southern tip of Lake Tanganyika, the coastal area of Sierra Leone and between Lake Victoria and the other Great Lakes, and (2) 14 taxa and several countries should be targeted for further seed collection.
   Main conclusions The robust nature of the extended methodology for gap analysis has been demonstrated and indicates that its scope as an effective conservation tool may be expanded to fully address the need for a more comprehensive and complementary conservation strategy that encompasses both in situ and ex situ applications. However, it should be stressed that the methodology is applicable for any form of biodiversity (wild or cultivated), where the conservation of genetic diversity is the prime goal.

AB Homoploid hybrid speciation (HHS) is the establishment of a novel species through introgressive hybridization without a change in chromosome number. We discuss different routes by which this might occur and propose a novel term, 'hybrid trait speciation', which combines the idea that hybridization can generate adaptive novelty with the 'magic trait' model of ecological speciation. Heliconius butterflies contain many putative examples of hybrid colour patterns, but only recently has the HHS hypothesis been tested explicitly in this group. Molecular data has shown evidence for gene flow between many distinct species. Furthermore, the colour pattern of Heliconius heurippa can be recreated in laboratory crosses between Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius cydno and, crucially, plays a role in assortative mating between the three species. Nonetheless, although the genome of H. heurippa shows evidence for hybridization, it is not a mosaic of the two parental species. Instead, ongoing hybridization has likely blurred any signal of the original speciation event. We argue that where hybridization leads to novel adaptive traits that also cause reproductive isolation, it is likely to trigger speciation.

AB Year-round mixed-species grazing at low densities in large-scale pasture systems has become a popular conservation concept as it is assumed to maintain the valuable biodiversity of semi-open cultural landscapes. This study aims to elucidate which vegetation types are preferentially grazed by cattle and sheep and whether the grazing animals change their preferences through the seasons so that year-round grazing leads to a utilization of all habitats. Additionally, we wanted to determine the main factors underlying the site use patterns of the animals.
   The study was conducted on 180 ha of a nature reserve and former military training area in northern Germany from January to October. Within this area, the positions of one cattle herd and one sheep flock were simultaneously recorded every 5 min using the global positioning system (GPS). For this purpose, we fitted one GPS collar alternately to three different cows and another to three different sheep. If the position of a collared animal had changed more than 6 m but less than 100 m within 5 min grazing was assumed based on a validation of these thresholds by direct observation. Using a geographic information system, we analysed the location data with regard to vegetation characteristics, altitude, and distance from fences, water sources, and a sheep shed. For each month, we determined Ivlev's electivity index of both herbivore species in relation to eight broad vegetation types. We used multiple linear regression to create models that describe the grazing frequencies in the grid cells of the area depending on parameters of those grid cells and their spatial position.
   Cattle preferred moist and productive habitats, whereas sheep preferred dry and nutrient-poor habitats. Only when feed was in extremely short supply, the animals switched to sites they had previously avoided. Differences in the spatial preferences of the two species were more marked than seasonal changes. Spatial demands of cattle and sheep were largely complementary. Grazing sites with better water availability (i.e. lower distance from the drinking trough and ponds) were significantly preferred by cattle. The sheep preferred grazing sites close to their shed.
   Our results show that only a combination of different herbivores guarantees that all habitats of such a large low-intensity pasture are grazed and thus are kept in a management status favourable to conservation. However, the positioning of drinking troughs, fences, and sheds should be carefully considered as these facilities seriously influence the site use of the animals. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB 1. Given the speed and extent of changes in vegetation as a result of human activity, there is a need to investigate ways in which individual species' impacts on ecosystem processes can be generalized and scaled-up to the community level.
   2. We focus on linking community functional parameters (mean of the traits of the plants in the community, weighted using four different methods) with litter chemistry and decomposition, in a chronosequence of currently managed and abandoned semi-natural grasslands in southern Sweden.
   3. Changes in plant community composition with age since abandonment were reflected in community functional parameters: as expected, aggregated specific leaf area (SLA) declined, and aggregated leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and leaf carbon : nitrogen ratio (C : N) increased with plot age.
   4. Several litter chemistry indices were closely linked with plant traits at the community level; in particular, community aggregated LDMC was correlated with the lignin and fibre content of the community litter.
   5. Aggregated LDMC stood out as the trait most closely linked to community litter decomposition. This relationship was consistent across all three incubation periods (by which time up to c. 70% mass loss had occurred) and as strong as that between the best single chemical index of litter quality (lignin : N ratio) and litter mass loss.
   6. Mass loss of whole community litter, incubated in its plot of origin, was related to mass loss of the same litter incubated under standard conditions, but not to decomposition of a standard substrate, indicating dominant substrate quality control over decomposition.
   7. This study demonstrates the potential of the traits of living plants as a tool to link changes in species composition with ecosystem processes at the community level.

AB The growth of the Finnish wolf (Canis lupus) population during the last years has highlighted people's contradictory attitudes toward wolves. The supranational conservation objectives brought on by Finland's membership in the European Union (EU) and the regional application of the official policy on wolves have led to conflicts. This article is based on the preparation process of the wolf management plan in Finland. As a part of the process, a nationwide hearing was arranged in 2004. Fear of wolves is widespread and even more common in areas with low wolf population. People living in areas where wolves occur feel that they can no longer influence decision making which affects them and that the authorities, conservationists, and the EU do not listen to their opinions. Numerous requests have been made for the legislation and its interpretation, and concessions to these requests would promote consensus and increase tolerance for wolves. Proposed changes include reforming the damage compensation system and formulating a clearer interpretation of the conservation status of wolves. However, it seems impossible to create a policy that would be universally supported. As the wolf question has become more central in environmental policy, the conservation and management of the species have become more complicated, and the cooperation between various interest groups has declined. The wolf conflict could be mitigated by compromises, but because the conflict is value-based, solutions are illusive.

AB North America harbors an astounding proportion of the world's freshwater species, but it is facing a freshwater biodiversity crisis. A first step to slowing the loss of biodiversity involves identifying gaps in existing efforts to conserve biodiversity and prioritizing opportunities to fill these gaps. In this monograph we detail two separate, but complementary, conservation planning efforts-a Gap Analysis (GAP) and a State Wildlife Action Plan (WAP)-for Missouri that address this first step. The goal of the Missouri Aquatic GAP Project was to identify riverine ecosystems, habitats, and species not adequately represented (i.e., gaps) within existing conservation lands. The goal of the freshwater component of the Missouri Wildlife Action Plan was to identify and map a set of conservation-opportunity areas (COAs) that holistically represent all riverine ecosystems, habitats, and species in Missouri. Since conservation planning is a geographical exercise, both efforts utilized geographic information systems (GIS). Four principal GIS data sets were used in each planning effort: (1) a hierarchical riverine ecosystem classification, (2) predicted species distributions, (3) public ownership/stewardship, and (4) a human-threat index. Results of the gap analyses are not encouraging. Forty five, mostly rare, threatened, or endangered, species are not represented in lands set aside for conserving biodiversity. Results also illustrate the fragmented nature of conservation lands, which are mainly situated in the uplands and fail to provide connectivity among riverine habitats. Furthermore, many conservation lands are severely threatened by an array of human disturbances. In contrast, results of the WAP provide hope that relatively intact riverine ecosystems still exist. A total of 158 COAs, representing similar to 6% of the total kilometers of stream in Missouri, were selected for the WAR This illustrates that a wide spectrum of biodiversity can be represented within a small portion of the total resource base, but the area of conservation concern is often much larger. Identifying priority riverscapes for conservation is an important first step toward effective biodiversity conservation. Yet, achieving the ultimate goal of conserving biodiversity will require vigilance on the part of all responsible parties, with particular attention to addressing and coordinating the many remaining logistical tasks.

AB The complexity of habitat structure created by aquatic vegetation is an important factor determining the diversity and composition of soft-sediment coastal communities. The introduction of estuarine organisms, such as oysters or other forms of aquaculture, that compete with existing forms of habitat structure, such as seagrass, may affect the availability of important habitat refugia and foraging resources for mobile estuarine fish and decapods. Fish and invertebrate communities were compared between adjacent patches of native seagrass (Zostera marina), normative cultured oyster (Crassostrea gigas), and unvegetated mudflat within a northeastern Pacific estuary. The composition of epibenthic meiofauna and small macrofaunal organisms, including known prey of fish and decapods, was significantly related to habitat type. Densities of these epifauna were significantly higher in structured habitat compared to unstructured mudflat. Benthic invertebrate densities were highest in seagrass. Since oyster aquaculture may provide a structural substitute for seagrass being associated with increased density and altered composition of fish and decapod prey resources relative to mudflat, it was hypothesized that this habitat might also alter habitat preferences of foraging fish and decapods. The species composition of fish and decapods was more strongly related to location within the estuary than to habitat, and fish and decapod species composition responded on a larger landscape scale than invertebrate assemblages. Fish and decapod species richness and the size of ecologically and commercially important species, such as Dungeness crab (Cancer magister), English sole (Parophrys vetulus), or lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus), were not significantly related to habitat type.

AB Human development impacts the landscape by altering the size and shape of natural habitat patches, replacing natural vegetation with other types such as lawns and row crops, or introducing environmental stressors such as increased human activity and pollutants. We investigated the effects of human alterations to the landscape on the distribution of 3 mammalian carnivores (coyote [Cams latrans], raccoon [Procyon lotor], and red fox [Vulpes vulpes]) along an urban-rural gradient in northern Illinois. Distribution of each species was assessed from occurrence at scent stations placed within or along the edges of 47 sites >= 4 ha, representing 7 different natural or anthropogenically altered habitats. We averaged presence or absence scores across several seasonal samples over a year, and used an outlying mean index analysis to compare them to environmental variables gathered for each site, including habitat and landscape metrics presumed to reflect varying degrees of anthropogenic influence across the urban-rural gradient. Coyotes used a variety of habitats within the rural part of the gradient. Red foxes were found in forest interiors or shrubland and old fields near forests where coyotes were least detected. Both canids were detected more often in areas of lower human densities but prey abundance was not a strong determinant of their occurrence. Overall occurrence along the gradient was highest for raccoons, which were positively associated with urban areas with relatively high residential land use.

AB Carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of human fingernails were measured in 490 individuals in the western US and 273 individuals in southeastern Brazil living in urban areas, and 53 individuals living in a moderately isolated area in the central Amazon region of Brazil and consuming mostly locally grown foods. In addition, we measured the carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of common food items to assess the extent to which these isotopic signatures remain distinct for people eating both omnivorous and vegetarian diets and living in different parts of the world, and the extent to which dietary information can be interpreted from these analyses. Fingernail delta C-13 values (mean +/- standard deviation) were -15.4 +/- 1.0 and -18.8 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand and delta N-15 values were 10.4 +/- 0.7 and 9.4 +/- 0.6%. for southeastern Brazil and western US populations, respectively. Despite opportunities for a "global supermarket" effect to swamp out carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in these two urbanized regions of the world, differences in the fingernail isotope ratios between southeastern Brazil and western US populations persisted, and appeared to be more associated with regional agricultural and animal production practices. Omnivores and vegetarians from Brazil and the US were isotopically distinct, both within and between regions. In a comparison of fingernails of individuals from an urban city and isolated communities in the Amazonian region, the urban region was similar to southeastern Brazil, whereas individuals from isolated nonurban communities showed distinctive isotopic values consistent with their diets and with the isotopic values of local foods. Although there is a tendency for a "global supermarket" diet, carbon and nitrogen isotopes of human fingernails hold dietary information directly related to both food sources and dietary practices in a region.

AB Aim To provide a spatially explicit model of how geographic distributions at the last glacial maximum (LGM) and post-glacial colonization routes shaped current migratory pathways in the Swainson's thrush, Catharus ustulatus, a long-distance migratory bird.
   Location The Swainson's thrush breeds in boreal forest regions of the United States and Canada as well as in riparian woodlands along the Pacific coast of North America.
   Methods Palaeodistribution modelling is combined with mtDNA phylogeography to predict the breeding range of the Swainson's thrush at the LGM. Quantitative environmental analysis and bioclimatic modelling are used to reconstruct the most likely post-glacial colonization pathways. A maximum likelihood method for estimating growth rates is used to approximate the relative change in population size since the LGM.
   Main conclusions The palaeodistribution models are concordant with the Swainson's thrush mtDNA phylogeography, suggesting that the inland and coastal groups were geographically isolated in eastern (inland) and western (coastal) regions at the LGM. Estimates of change in population size based on genetic data are remarkably consistent with estimates of change in range size, suggesting that the coastal group has undergone a 2- to 3-fold demographic and range expansion, while the inland group has undergone a 6- to 12-fold demographic and range expansion since the LGM. Bioclimatic analyses strongly support the hypothesis that populations expanding out of the east into previously glaciated areas in the west were undergoing a natural extension of their range by tracking the changes in climatic conditions. The combination of bioclimatic and molecular analyses is consistent with the idea that coastal and inland groups expanded from separate eastern and western regions after the LGM and that the current migratory pathway of the inland group retraces its post-glacial colonization route.

AB Relatively little experimental evidence is available regarding how ecological resistance and propagule density interact in their effects on the establishment of invasive exotic species. We examined the independent and interactive effects of neighbour cover (biotic resistance), winter vs. spring water addition (abiotic resistance) and seed density on the invasion of the European perennial grass Holcus lanatus into a California coastal grassland dominated by exotic annual grasses. We found that decreased competition from resident exotic grasses had no effect. In contrast, increased late-season water availability eroded the abiotic resistance offered by naturally dry conditions, facilitating invasion. Finally, watering treatment and seed density interacted strongly in determining seedling survival: while seedling mortality was close to 100% in ambient and winter water addition plots, survivor numbers increased with seed density in spring-watered plots. Thus, decreased abiotic resistance can amplify the effect of increased propagule density on seedling establishment, thereby increasing the likelihood of invasion.

ID GEOGRAPHICAL-DISTRIBUTION; AUSTRALIA; ECOLOGY
AB A climate model of the estimated potential distribution of Chromolaena odorata has been revised. The new model fits the known distribution better, eliminates several internal inconsistencies, and employs more biologically appropriate cold-stress mechanisms. The revised model reduces the estimated potential distribution of C. odorata, particularly in terms of the poleward and inland extents of suitable climates. Mediterranean, semi-arid and temperate climates are now predicted to be unsuitable. However, the revised model supports the previous conclusions that much of tropical Africa, the north-eastern coast of Australia and most Pacific islands are at risk of invasion. The distribution of C. odorata in South Africa extends further south than predicted by the model based on Asian and American distribution records. This anomaly supports the contention that the South African variety of C. odorata has different climatic requirements to the varieties commonly found elsewhere.

AB Interspecific hybridization is an important process through which abrupt speciation can occur. In recent years, genetic changes associated with hybrid speciation have been identified through a variety of techniques, including AFLP/SSR mapping, GISH/FISH and cDNA-AFLP differential display. However, progress in using microarray technology to analyse whole genome/transcriptome changes associated with hybrid speciation has been limited due to the lack of extensive sequence data for many hybrid species and the difficulties in extrapolating results from commercially available microarrays for model species onto nonmodel hybrid taxa. Increasingly therefore researchers studying nonmodel systems are turning to the development of 'anonymous' cDNA microarrays, where the time and cost of producing microarrays is reduced by printing unsequenced cDNA clones, and sequencing only those clones that display interesting expression patterns. Here we describe the creation, testing and preliminary use of anonymous cDNA microarrays to study changes in floral transcriptome associated with allopolyploid speciation in the genus Senecio. We report a comparison of gene expression between the allohexaploid hybrid, Senecio cambrensis, its parental taxa Senecio squalidus (diploid) and Senecio vulgaris (tetraploid), and the intermediate triploid (sterile) hybrid Senecioxbaxteri. Anonymous microarray analysis revealed dramatic differences in floral gene expression between these four taxa and demonstrates the power of this technique for studies of the genetic impact of hybridization in nonmodel flowering plants.

AB Environmental factors and their interactions are likely to have shaped specific breeding and survival strategies in top predators. Understanding how climatic factors affect populations requires detailed investigation of the demographic parameters and population modelling. Here, we focus on the modelling of a southern fulmar population over a 39 year period in Terre Adelie, Antarctica, using Leslie matrix models to understand from a prospective and retrospective point of view, how vital rates and their variations, affect the cyclic population dynamics. The elasticity of population growth rate to adult survival was very high (0.95), as predicted by a slow-fast continuum in avian life histories. However, adult survival varied little between years (mean +/- SD: 0.92 +/- 0.07), and could not explain the strong fluctuations observed in the number of breeders and chicks. The high temporal fluctuations of the proportion of breeders (0.57 +/- 0.22) and breeding success (0.70 +/- 0.14) had the strongest impact on population dynamics, despite their weak elasticities (0.05). Before the 1980s, population fluctuations were mainly explained by a direct impact of sea-ice extent (SIE) anomalies during summer (by a threshold effect) on the proportion of breeders. After 1980s, 3 years periodic population fluctuations were best predicted by 3 years cyclic variations in the proportion of breeders. SIE showed a marked change of periodicity during the 1980s, and SIE during winter fluctuated with a 3 years periodicity during 1980-1995. The marked change in population dynamics, through a change of the variations of the proportion of breeders, may be explained in the light of a regime shift that probably occurred around the 1980s, and which affected the sea ice environment, the availability of prey, and thus the demographic parameters and population dynamics of southern fulmars.

AB Some recent models Suggest a new role for evolutionary arms races between males and females in sexual selection. Female resistance to males is proposed to be driven by the direct advantage to the female of avoiding male-imposed reductions in the number of offspring she can produce, rather than by the indirect advantage of selecting among possible sires for her offspring, as in some traditional models of sexual selection by female choice. This article uses the massive but hitherto under-utilized taxonomic literature on genitalic evolution to test, in a two-step process, whether such new models of arms races between males and females have been responsible for rapid divergent evolution of male genitalia. The test revolves around the prediction that 'new arms races' arc less likely to occur in species in which females are largely or completely protected from unwanted sexual attentions from males (e.g. species which mate in leks or in male swarms, in which males attract females from a distance, or in which females initiate contact by attracting males from a distance). The multiple possible mechanical functions of male genitalia are summarized, and functions of male genitalic structures in 43 species in 21 families of Diptera are compiled. Functions associated with intromission and insemination (e.g. seizing and positioning the female appropriately, pushing past possible barriers within the female, orienting within the female to achieve sperm transfer), which are unlikely to be involved in new arms races which females are protected, are shown to be common (> 50 % of documented cases). This information is then used to generate the new arms race prediction: differences in genitalic form among congeneric species in which females are protected should be less common than differences among congeneric species in which females are vulnerable to harassment by males. This prediction was tested using a sample of 361 genera of insects and spiders. The prediction clearly failed, even when the data were adjusted to take into account several possible biases. Comparative analyses,within particular taxonomic groups also failed to show the predicted trends, as did less extensive data oil other non-genitalic male display traits. Arms races, as defined in some recent models, seem to have been less important in male-female coevolution of genitalic structures than has been suggested. By elimination, alternative interpretations, such as traditional female choice, which do not predict associations between female protection from harassment and rapid divergent evolution, are strengthened.

AB Extensive landscape modification by humans has led to the fragmentation of riparian forests across North America. We compared the vegetation of extant riparian forest along an urban-rural disturbance gradient. In 1999, twenty-five sites along Assiniboine River in Manitoba, Canada were categorized according to land use: urban, suburban, high intensity rural, low intensity rural, and relatively high quality reference forest. Differences in herbaceous, shrub, and tree species composition and diversity were related to the proportion of surrounding land use, forest patch size, connectivity, and area:perimeter ratio. Urban riparian forests were more disturbed and isolated. They were smaller and characterized by drier, more alkaline soils. Moreover, they had significantly lower native and overall understorey species diversity, and had a higher proportion of exotics including Solanum dulcamara and Hesperis matronalis. Suburban forests were less disturbed, faced greater development pressure, and had sandier soils. Although suburban understorey diversity was similar to that of rural forests, suburban sites had a higher proportion of exotic species, especially escaped horticultural and invasive species including Caragana arborescens and Rhamnus cathartica. Reference sites were relatively large and exhibited greater connectivity, but there was little difference in species composition and diversity among high intensity rural, low intensity rural, and reference sites. These site types were less disturbed than either urban or suburban forests, and reference sites were characterized by hydrophilic species including Scirpus fluviatilis and Carex aquatilis. Our results suggest that landscape measures of disturbance, and related changes in environment, may be confidently used to assess impacts of land use on vegetation along urban-rural gradients.

AB The spatial heterogeneity of the nematode community on an intertidal flat (the Molenplaat) in the Westerschelde estuary (SW Netherlands) has been investigated. The extent to which macroscale (km) variability was more important than microscale (m) variability was tested. In addition, the importance of vertical distribution profile in the sediment in explaining the horizontal macroscale variability was evaluated. Differences in the structure of the community were analysed at a kilometre scale at three sites that differed in chemico-physical features. The differences in geochemical and physical conditions on a horizontal scale were reflected in species composition and trophic structure of the nematode communities, and to a much lesser extent in their total abundance and species diversity.
   Detailed investigation of vertical depth profiles showed more pronounced differences between environmentally divergent sites. Sediment granulometry appears to be important in controlling the fauna in the upper sediment layers. At depth, similar faunal assemblages were found irrespective of sediment granulometry, suggesting that other environmental features are more dominant.
   Vertically, nematode species showed depth distributions that were indicative of sediment characteristics related to the site-specific hydrodynamic regime. Pronounced vertical segregation of nematode species was observed within sandy sediment under strong hydrodynamic and food-stressed conditions. A surface-dwelling nematode community of large predatory enoplids was separated from a deposit feeding xyalid-microlaimid community in deeper sediment layers (beneath 2 cm). Causal factors for this segregation are thought to be species interactions, feeding strategies and/or physical disturbance. In the finest sediments, with high silt content, almost all nematode species were confined to the upper sediment layers (1.5 cm). A sharp decline in density and diversity with depth was observed. Key factors for this distribution pattern are possibly related to the limited oxygen penetration in surface layers and the occurrence of sulphide in deeper sediment layers. At intermediate hydrodynamic and granulometric conditions, a gradual shifting of nematode community was observed with depth, with dominant nematode species maxima present at specific depth layers.

AB Wolf Canis lupus relationships with wild ungulates, domestic animals and humans were studied in an area of ca 800 km(2) at the head of the Lovat River in northeastern Belarus during 1990-2000. The region was dominated by natural habitats (78%) consisting mainly of forests and bogs, but also lakes and rivers. The abundance of wild ungulates, such as moose Alces alces, wild boar Sus scrofa, and roe deer Capreolus capreolus, as censused by snow tracking and assessed by game wardens, declined 5 to 6-fold between 1990 and 1996, most probably due to uncontrolled exploitation and poaching. During 1997-2000, the numbers of ungulates began to recover. Wolves responded to the shortage of wild ungulates by a strong shift in feeding habits. When wild ungulates were numerous, wolf diet as studied by scat analysis was composed of wild ungulates (80-88% of consumed biomass), with small additions of medium- and small-sized wild animals (7-13%), mainly beaver Castor fiber and hare Lepus sp., and domestic animals (4-6%), mainly cattle. In the years when the recorded numbers of wild ungulates were at their lowest, wolves preyed on domestic animals (38% of biomass consumed), wild ungulates (32%), and medium- and small-sized wild prey (29%). Wolf damage to domestic animals (28 head of cattle and 247 dogs killed) and wolf-human interaction (100 observations of wolves in and near villages, including one attack by a rabid wolf on I I people) were recorded in 14 villages. The rate of wolf predation on domestic animals and their appearances in villages increased exponentially with the declining biomass of wild ungulates and ceased again when wild ungulates began to recover; a one-year time lag in wolf response to changes in ungulate abundance was observed. The numbers of wolves as estimated by snow tracking and assessed by game wardens played a weaker role in shaping wolf-livestock and wolf-human interaction. The wolf population was strongly affected by hunting during the study. Wolves responded numerically with a 1 to 2-year time lag to the varying intensity of harvest by humans. Our study showed the role of the human factor in shaping wolf numbers and wolf-livestock interaction in eastern Europe. The three major components of this relationship were: 1) the manifold decline in wild ungulate abundance, which was most probably caused by uncontrolled exploitation by humans in the years of political transformation and economic regress, made wolves shift to predation on domestic animals; inevitably, wolves were frequently seen in the rural areas; 2) people interpreted the growing rates of wolf damage and appearances near the settlements as an effect of greatly increasing numbers of wolves, and demanded that authorities and hunters fight the 'wolf plague'; 3) hunting impact on wolves increased and led to a marked reduction in wolf numbers and a decline in wolf-human conflicts. This scenario was most probably repeated in many areas of eastern Europe during 19902000, which was a decade of political and economical transformation. From a management perspective, we suggested that predation levels and wolf-human conflicts could be reduced not only by increased wolf harvest but also by enhancing the density and diversity of wild ungulates.

AB In this investigation a body-condition index (BCI) was developed for polar bears (Ursus maritimus), black bears (Ursus americanus), and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos), based on residuals from the regression of total body mass against a linear measure of size, straight-line body length (SLBL). Transformation of mass-length data from 1198 polar bears, 595 black bears, and 126 grizzly bears to natural logarithms resulted in a linear relationship between mass and length. However, the relationship in polar bears differed from that in black and grizzly bears. SLBL had a close positive relationship with skeletal (bone) mass in polar bears (n = 31) and black bears (n = 33), validating the use of SLBL as an accurate index of body size. There was no correlation between SLBL and BCI for polar bears (r = 0.005, p = 0.87, n = 1198) or for black bears and grizzly bears (r = 0.04, p = 0.30, n = 721), indicating that the BCI was independent of body size. The BCI had a close positive relationship with true body condition, measured as the standardized residual of the combined mass of fat and skeletal muscle against SLBL, in polar and black bears that were dissected to determine individual tissue masses. The BCI also had a close positive relationship with the standardized residual of fat mass against SLBL. Estimation of BCI values for polar bears, or for black bears and grizzly bears, is facilitated by prediction equations that require measurement of total body mass and SLBL for individual animals.

AB Cydia molesta Busck (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), a major pest of stone fruits and an increasingly important late season pest of apple, is predominately monitored by pheromone trapping of male moths. We investigated flight performance in relation to sex, age, and mating status using computer-linked flight mills, and also examined the relationship between female flight and reproduction. The crepuscular flight pattern of the experimental moths in relation to photointensity was very similar to that reported from field studies. Female moths significantly outperformed males in all measured flight parameters including total distance flown, distance of longest single flight, and velocity. The proportion of long-flying females (categorised as those completing an unbroken flight of greater than 1 km) was three to six times greater than that of males. Female flight performance was not related to mating status, but mated males displayed significantly greater flight than unmated males. The maximal flight period of mated females commenced on the third day after eclosion, following 30% egg deposition. Male flight was not significantly related to age. The data suggest that a limited proportion of the population, in particular females, may have the capacity to make inter-orchard flights. The limitations of monitoring C. molesta populations in apple orchards solely by pheromone trapping of males are discussed.

AB 1. There is an established relationship between metabolism and behavioural dominance in several fish species, such that individuals with higher standard metabolic rates tend to be more dominant. It has also been suggested that metabolic scope increases with standard metabolic rate.
   2. Energetically expensive behaviours attributable to dominance, such as aggression, can be carried out to a greater extent within larger metabolic scopes. This study therefore tests the hypothesis that juvenile salmon with higher standard metabolic rates (which tend to be dominant) have larger metabolic scopes.
   3. It was found that salmon with high standard metabolic rates (corrected for body mass) in fact had smaller metabolic scopes than conspecifics with relatively low standard metabolic rates. Possible reasons for their potential dominance while having small metabolic scopes and high relative standard metabolic rates are discussed.

AB Allopatric processes of speciation have routinely been presented to explain the extraordinary radiation of the East African Great Lakes cichlid fish species flocks. The 21 or more species of pelagic cichlids within the Lake Malawi flock appear to have lake-wide distributions that challenge such a concept. Data from six microsalellite DNA loci indicate single, panmictic populations across the lake of three Diplotaxodon species. Levels of variability) at these loci suggest that populations have been large and stable. mitochondrial DNA sequence data (872bp of control region + 981 bp of the NADH-2) from 90 species, representing all major clades within the Lake Malawi flock, indicate reciprocal monophyly of the pelagic clade. We suggest that these data support a hypothesis that speciation in sympatry is more plausible land widespread) within the cichlid species flocks than previously thought.

AB The factors and plant processes that have been proposed to control treeline location are evaluated for European and North American treelines. While often presented as alternative determinants of treeline, the ideas of the increased environmental hazard and the idea of tree material limitation are considered to be complementary. This is because plant damage, rather than outright death, coupled with difficult conditions for material acquisition and small available material pools, eventually makes accretion of biomass untenable. The location where this balance is achieved varies with climate, but catastrophic events and human activities make correlation with climate tenuous and future predictions difficult. Field manipulation of conditions for many tree species in many geographic locations at and below the treeline are needed to develop generalizations that are both explanatory and predictive.

AB Periodic low-intensity fire (hazard-reduction burning) is a conspicuous management strategy in virtually all of Australia's dry forest communities where it is primarily used to reduce fuel levels with the intention of minimising the extent and severity of wildfires. Little is known, however, about the effects of its repeated use on natural ecosystems over long periods of time. This study investigated the long-term effects of frequent low-intensity fire on forest ant communities by comparing frequently burnt sites with long-unburnt control sites. While the richness of ant communities remained largely unchanged, the composition of assemblages differed substantially between treatments. Although frequent burning apparently resulted in the loss of a substantial number of species, the overall richness of frequently burnt areas was maintained by the addition of species not present on unburnt sites. These changes in species composition were accompanied by major changes in community organisation (structure) and were considered to be a response to altered habitat conditions, particularly litter biomass, vegetation structure and patterns of insolation at ground level. Appropriate fire prescriptions could therefore be applied to manipulate these habitat elements at a landscape scale to meet both management and conservation goals. A comparison of pitfall trapping and litter extraction techniques revealed the importance of a composite sampling strategy, with 22% of ant species detected only by litter extraction.

AB Ecologists need not despair of discovering the mechanisms that lend to large scale patterns. The search for process at higher scales has already led to enhanced confidence in the patterns and to improvements in their description. For example, species-area relationships turn out to form not one. but three patterns. Each is controlled by gain-loss dynamics at its own scale. At the macroscale, origination and global extinction reign. Ai the archipelagic scale, immigration and island extinction determine the results. Ar the local scale, metapopulation processes do. The three scales exhibit species-area curves with systematically different slopes in logarithmic space. We use the three scales of species-area to illuminate the relationship between local and regional diversity. Algebra shows that the latter pattern is an echo of species-area curves, and that those echoes ought to be nearly linear. So, we call the relationship of local and regional diversity. the Er hu pattern. Ecology has long known that species-area curl cs within a region reflect the accumulation of habitat variety. Thus. their connection to Echo patterns argues against concluding that local diversity has little or nothing to do with population interactions, To obtain a pure Echo pattern. one should draw data from independent regions rather than separate islands. The independence allows natural selection to adjust the fundamental niches of species to diversity. Theory suggests that higher diversity should shrink niches, allowing the coexistence of more species locally. Hence, independence should tend to produce the straightest Echoes. However, archipelagic species-area. curves predict that even when different islands are used as the regions, the Echoes should show only very gentle curvatures. Flouting theory, some archipelagic Echoes approach an asymptote as regional diversity increases. These must have logarithmic slopes that increase with regional pool size. We do not understand why.

AB To determine the effects of forest fragmentation on the abundance of small mammals, we livetrapped at edges and in the interior of forest patches in contiguous, logged, and agricultural landscapes in the southern boreal mixedwood forest of Saskatchewan. From 1994 to 1996, we captured 1548 small mammals (11 species) during 8172 trap-nights. The abundance of all small mammals combined was lower in forest patches isolated by logging than in contiguous forest or farm woodlots surrounded by agricultural land. This pattern was consistent in all years, despite significant annual fluctuations in numbers of the boreal red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi), one of the most abundant species in our study area. Red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) were more abundant in farm woodlots. The abundance of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculattus) was significantly lower in forest patches surrounded by clearcuts, and we speculate that they may have used clearcuts more than forest patches. In contrast, the numbers of boreal red-backed voles were similar among landscapes. The only species showing a response to edge was the deer mouse, which was significantly more abundant at edges of farm woodlots than in interiors. We also found no significant difference in abundance of any species between small(10 ha) and large (>20 ha) farm woodlots. For most species, within-landscape attributes such as edge and patch size seemed to have little effect on their abundance. However, for a variety of reasons, small-mammal numbers seem to vary considerably among forest patches in different landscapes.

ID LONG-TERM; ORGANISMS; DIVERSITY; SEDIMENT
AB Fringing reef development is limited around 22 degrees S along the inner Great Barrier Reef, although there is substantial development north and south of this latitude. This study examined the relationships among coral communities and the extent of reef development. Reefs were examined to determine coral composition, colony abundance, colony size and growth form between the latitudes 20 degrees S and 23 degrees S. Major reef framework builders (scleractinian genus Acropora and families Faviidae and Poritidae) dominated reefs north and south of 22 degrees S, but declined significantly at 22 degrees S where foliose and encrusting corals (Turbinaria and Montipora spp.) were most common. Porites spp. were present at 22 degrees S but had encrusting morphologies. Consistently high turbidity at this latitude, caused by a 10 m tidal range and strong tidal flows, resuspends silts from the shallow shelf, and appears to have precluded reef development throughout the Holocene, by limiting the abundance, stunting the growth, and shortening the life expectancies of reef framework corals. The distinctions between 'natural' and 'human-induced' degradation may be interpreted on the basis of the relationship between Holocene development and current benthic community longevity. A mismatch between substantial past reef building capacity (a broad and/or thick reef) and non-existent or limited present reef-building capacity could signify anything from a long-period, natural cycle to an unprecedented deterioration in ecosystem function caused by human influence.

AB The concept of energy security has received significant attention in studies. However, most of the studies often ignored to integrate environmental aspect in the energy security assessment. Therefore, to measure the energy security and environmental sustainability of South Asian countries, this study develops a new index, i.e., Energy Security and Environmental Sustainability Index (ESESI), which combines energy and environmental indicators. The study presents an analysis of the period 2006-2017. The results show that Bhutan outperforms the rest of the countries in South Asia based on different indicators. Likewise, the overall ESESI score reveals Bhutan as more secure regarding energy security and environmental sustainability. India comes second in the region with a stable score followed by Sri Lanka, which substantially increased its performance over time. Pakistan is ranked fourth; however, the country experienced a decreasing trend of ESESI score. Nepal, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan follow the list with reduced scores. Maldives obtained the lowest ESESI score during the study period 2006-2017. Lowest ESESI implies that the Maldives is the least energy secure and environmentally sustainable country in the region. Based on the above findings, this paper recommends cross-border energy trade and increase in trans-regional renewable energy investments for long-term energy security and environmental sustainability in the region.

AB The adaptive value of transgenerational effects (the ancestor environmental effects on offspring) in changing environments has received much attention in recent years, but the related empirical evidence remains equivocal. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis summarising 139 experimental studies in plants and animals with 1170 effect sizes to investigate the generality of transgenerational effects across taxa, traits, and environmental contexts. It was found that transgenerational effects generally enhanced offspring performance in response to both stressful and benign conditions. The strongest effects are in annual plants and invertebrates, whereas vertebrates appear to benefit mostly under benign conditions, and perennial plants show hardly any transgenerational responses at all. These differences among taxonomic/life-history groups possibly reflect that vertebrates can avoid stressful conditions through their mobility, and longer-lived plants have alternative strategies. In addition to environmental contexts and taxonomic/life-history groups, transgenerational effects also varied among traits and developmental stages of ancestors and offspring, but the effects were similarly strong across three generations of offspring. By way of a more comprehensive data set and a different effect size, our results differ from those of a recent meta-analysis, suggesting that transgenerational effects are widespread, strong and persistent and can substantially impact the responses of plants and animals to changing environments.

AB Climate change poses negative impacts on plant species, particularly for those of restricted ecology and distribution range. Rosa arabica Crep., an exclusive endemic species to Saint Catherine Protectorate in Egypt, has severely declined and become critically endangered in the last years. In this paper, we applied the maximum-entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) to predict the current and future potential distribution of this species in order to provide a basis for its protection and conservation. In total, 32 field-based occurrence points and 22 environmental variables (19 bioclimatic and three topographic) were used to model the potential distribution area under current and two future representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) for the years 2050 and 2070. Annual temperature, annual precipitation and elevation were the key factors for the distribution of R. arabica. The response curves showed that this species prefers habitats with an annual temperature of 8.05-15.4 degrees C, annual precipitation of 36 to 120 mm and elevation range of 1571 to 2273 m a.s.l. Most of the potential current suitable conditions were located at the middle northern region of Saint Catherine. Prediction models under two future climate change scenarios displayed habitat range shifts through the disappearance of R. arabica in sites below 1500 m a.s.l., an altitudinal range contraction at 1500-2000 m and possible expansions towards higher elevation sites (2000-2500 m a.s.l.). Our findings can be used to define the high priority areas for reintroduction or for protection against the expected climate change impacts and future modifications.

AB Measurements of the status and trends of key indicators for the ocean and marine life are required to inform policy and management in the context of growing human uses of marine resources, coastal development, and climate change. Two synergistic efforts identify specific priority variables for monitoring: Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) through the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), and Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) from the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON) (see Data Sheet 1 in Supplementary Materials for a glossary of acronyms). Both systems support reporting against internationally agreed conventions and treaties. GOOS, established under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), plays a leading role in coordinating global monitoring of the ocean and in the definition of EOVs. GEO BON is a global biodiversity observation network that coordinates observations to enhance management of the world's biodiversity and promote both the awareness and accounting of ecosystem services. Convergence and agreement between these two efforts are required to streamline existing and new marine observation programs to advance scientific knowledge effectively and to support the sustainable use and management of ocean spaces and resources. In this context, the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON), a thematic component of GEO BON, is collaborating with GOOS, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), and the Integrated Marine Biosphere Research (IMBeR) project to ensure that EBVs and EOVs are complementary, representing alternative uses of a common set of scientific measurements. This work is informed by the Joint Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM), an intergovernmental body of technical experts that helps international coordination on best practices for observing, data management and services, combined with capacity development expertise. Characterizing biodiversity and understanding its drivers will require incorporation of observations from traditional and molecular taxonomy, animal tagging and tracking efforts, ocean biogeochemistry, and ocean observatory initiatives including the deep ocean and seafloor. The partnership between large-scale ocean observing and product distribution initiatives (MBON, OBIS, JCOMM, and GOOS) is an expedited, effective way to support international policy-level assessments (e.g., the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services or IPBES), along with the implementation of international development goals (e.g., the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals).

AB Background: Development of the gut microbiota in infancy is important in maturation of the immune system. Deviations in colonization patterns have been associated with allergic manifestations such as eczema, but exact microbiome dysfunctions underlying allergies remain unclear. We studied the gut microbiota of 138 infants at increased risk of allergy, participating in a clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of a partially hydrolyzed protein formula supplemented with nondigestible oligosaccharides on the prevention of eczema.
   Objective: The effects of interventions and breast-feeding on fecal microbiota were investigated. Additionally, we aimed to identify microbial patterns associated with the onset of eczema.
   Methods: Bacterial taxonomic compositions in the first 26 weeks of life were analyzed by using 16SrRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, fecal pH and microbial metabolite levels were measured.
   Results: Fecal microbial composition, metabolites, and pH of infants receiving partially hydrolyzed protein formula supplemented with nondigestible oligosaccharides was closer to that of breast-fed infants than that of infants receiving standard cow's milk formula. Infants with eczema by 18 months showed discordant development of bacterial genera of Enterobacteriaceae and Parabacteroides species in the first 26 weeks, as well as decreased acquisition of lactate-utilizing bacteria producing butyrate, namely Eubacterium and Anaerostipes species, supported by increased lactate and decreased butyrate levels.
   Conclusions: We showed that a partially hydrolyzed protein infant formula with specific prebiotics modulated the gut microbiota closer to that of breast-fed infants. Additionally, we identified a potential link between microbial activity and onset of eczema, which might reflect a suboptimal implementation of gut microbiota at specific developmental stages in infants at high risk for allergy.

AB Crop models are used for an increasingly broad range of applications, with a commensurate proliferation of methods. Careful framing of research questions and development of targeted and appropriate methods are therefore increasingly important. In conjunction with the other authors in this special issue, we have developed a set of criteria for use of crop models in assessments of impacts, adaptation and risk. Our analysis drew on the other papers in this special issue, and on our experience in the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 and the MACSUR, AgMIP and ISIMIP projects.
   The criteria were used to assess how improvements could be made to the framing of climate change risks, and to outline the good practice and new developments that are needed to improve risk assessment. Key areas of good practice include: i. the development, running and documentation of crop models, with attention given to issues of spatial scale and complexity; ii. the methods used to form crop-climate ensembles, which can be based on model skill and/or spread; iii. the methods used to assess adaptation, which need broadening to account for technological development and to reflect the full range options available.
   The analysis highlights the limitations of focussing only on projections of future impacts and adaptation options using pre-determined time slices. Whilst this long-standing approach may remain an essential component of risk assessments, we identify three further key components:
   1. Working with stakeholders to identify the timing of risks. What are the key vulnerabilities of food systems and what does crop-climate modelling tell us about when those systems are at risk?
   2. Use of multiple methods that critically assess the use of climate model output and avoid any presumption that analyses should begin and end with gridded output.
   3. Increasing transparency and inter-comparability in risk assessments. Whilst studies frequently produce ranges that quantify uncertainty, the assumptions underlying these ranges are not always clear. We suggest that the contingency of results upon assumptions is made explicit via a common uncertainty reporting format; and/or that studies are assessed against a set of criteria, such as those presented in this paper.

AB The terrestrial carbon and water cycles are intimately linked: the carbon cycle is driven by photosynthesis, while the water balance is dominated by transpiration, and both fluxes are controlled by plant stomatal conductance. The ratio between these fluxes, the plant water-use efficiency (WUE), is a useful indicator of vegetation function.
   WUE can be estimated using several techniques, including leaf gas exchange, stable isotope discrimination, and eddy covariance. Here we compare global compilations of data for each of these three techniques.
   We show that patterns of variation in WUE across plant functional types (PFTs) are not consistent among the three datasets. Key discrepancies include the following: leaf-scale data indicate differences between needleleaf and broadleaf forests, but ecosystem-scale data do not; leaf-scale data indicate differences between C-3 and C-4 species, whereas at ecosystem scale there is a difference between C-3 and C-4 crops but not grasslands; and isotope-based estimates of WUE are higher than estimates based on gas exchange for most PFTs.
   Our study quantifies the uncertainty associated with different methods of measuring WUE, indicates potential for bias when using WUE measures to parameterize or validate models, and indicates key research directions needed to reconcile alternative measures of WUE.

AB Tropical forests contribute significantly to the global carbon cycle, but little is known about the temperature response of photosynthetic carbon uptake in tropical species, and how this varies within and across forests.
   We determined in situ photosynthetic temperature-response curves for upper canopy leaves of 42 tree and liana species from two tropical forests in Panama with contrasting rainfall regimes. On the basis of seedling studies, we hypothesized that species with high photosynthetic capacity - light-demanding, fast-growing species - would have a higher temperature optimum of photosynthesis (T-Opt) than species with low photosynthetic capacity - shade-tolerant, slow-growing species - and that, therefore, T-Opt would scale with the position of a species on the slow-fast continuum of plant functional traits.
   T-Opt was remarkably similar across species, regardless of their photosynthetic capacity and other plant functional traits. Community-average T-Opt was almost identical to mean maximum daytime temperature, which was higher in the dry forest. Photosynthesis above T-Opt appeared to be more strongly limited by stomatal conductance in the dry forest than in the wet forest.
   The observation that all species in a community shared similar T-Opt values suggests that photosynthetic performance is optimized under current temperature regimes. These results should facilitate the scaling up of photosynthesis in relation to temperature from leaf to stand level in species-rich tropical forests.

AB AimPositive relationships between plant species diversity and above-ground productivity have been observed across a wide range of terrestrial ecosystems. Despite a critical contribution of below-ground productivity to overall terrestrial productivity, no consensus exists about the nature of the relationship between species diversity and below-ground productivity.
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsWe collected data from published studies conducted in natural and planted forests and experimental grassland, crop and pot systems that were purposely implemented to isolate the effects of plant species diversity from other factors, such as soil conditions and topographic features. We conducted meta-analyses of 170 observations for root biomass and 23 observations for root production, derived from 48 published studies, using weighted linear modelling with bootstrap procedures to reconcile the effects of diversity on fine root productivity.
   ResultsWe found that species mixtures had, on average 28.4% higher fine root biomass and 44.8% higher annual production than monocultures. Higher fine root biomass in species mixtures than in monocultures was consistent across natural forests, planted grasslands, croplands and pot systems, except for young planted forests. Transgressive overyielding was only evident for planted grasslands. The log response ratio of fine root biomass in species mixtures to that in respective monocultures increased with species richness across all ecosystem types, and also increased with experiment age in grasslands.
   Main conclusionsOur meta-analysis reveals positive effects of species diversity on below-ground productivity. Despite profound differences in environments among terrestrial ecosystems, our analysis demonstrated that below-ground productivity responds similarly to variations in species richness. Furthermore, our study also reveals shifts in the effects of diversity over time in both forests and grasslands. Future efforts are needed to further understand below-ground productivity-diversity relationships.

AB It is expected that extreme climate events such as droughts will increase in both severity and intensity as a consequence of forecasted climate change. Complementarity among tree species in resource acquisition strategy may reduce interspecific competition and increase the occurrence of facilitative interactions, resulting in an improved tree growth and resilience to extreme climatic events. However, the response of individual trees growing in more functionally diverse stands to extreme events is still under debate.
   We investigate the growth response of silver fir (Abies alba) to an extreme drought event which occurred in 1985-1986 in the Central Spanish Pyrenees and how the growth and resilience of trees relate to their neighbourhood functional diversity, stand heterogeneity and intraspecific and interspecific competition. Dendroecological methods were used to reconstruct radial growth. We recorded all tree species living around each sampled tree and calculated indices of intra- and interspecific competition among coexisting trees. Functional diversity around each focal tree was calculated by using the Rao's quadratic entropy.
   Silver fir growth decreased significantly in response to the drought in the vast majority of trees, but most of them showed a growth recovery 3years later. Despite most trees showed negative growth trends following the drought event (70%), those trees growing in more functionally diverse stands were more resilient, recovered more quickly and displayed greater growth and growth trends.
   Synthesis. The presented findings support the growing body of evidence that shows a positive impact of diversity on forest function. In addition, we provide a direct linkage between tree growth response to climate at the individual tree scale and a direct quantification of neighbourhood functional diversity and competition. An enhanced functional diversity facilitating a more efficient use of resources at the interspecific level and potentially increasing facilitative interactions contributes to lessening the negative impacts of extreme events as droughts on forest growth.

TI Hybridization Capture Using RAD Probes (hyRAD), a New Tool for
   Performing Genomic Analyses on Collection Specimens

AB In the recent years, many protocols aimed at reproducibly sequencing reduced-genome subsets in non-model organisms have been published. Among them, RAD-sequencing is one of the most widely used. It relies on digesting DNA with specific restriction enzymes and performing size selection on the resulting fragments. Despite its acknowledged utility, this method is of limited use with degraded DNA samples, such as those isolated from museum specimens, as these samples are less likely to harbor fragments long enough to comprise two restriction sites making possible ligation of the adapter sequences (in the case of double-digest RAD) or performing size selection of the resulting fragments (in the case of single-digest RAD). Here, we address these limitations by presenting a novel method called hybridization RAD (hyRAD). In this approach, biotinylated RAD fragments, covering a random fraction of the genome, are used as baits for capturing homologous fragments from genomic shotgun sequencing libraries. This simple and cost-effective approach allows sequencing of orthologous loci even from highly degraded DNA samples, opening new avenues of research in the field of museum genomics. Not relying on the restriction site presence, it improves among-sample loci coverage. In a trial study, hyRAD allowed us to obtain a large set of orthologous loci from fresh and museum samples from a non-model butterfly species, with a high proportion of single nucleotide polymorphisms present in all eight analyzed specimens, including 58-year-old museum samples. The utility of the method was further validated using 49 museum and fresh samples of a Palearctic grasshopper species for which the spatial genetic structure was previously assessed using mtDNA amplicons. The application of the method is eventually discussed in a wider context. As it does not rely on the restriction site presence, it is therefore not sensitive to among-sample loci polymorphisms in the restriction sites that usually causes loci dropout. This should enable the application of hyRAD to analyses at broader evolutionary scales.

AB 1. Animal space use has been studied by focusing either on geographic (e.g. home ranges, species' distribution) or on environmental (e.g. habitat use and selection) space. However, all patterns of space use emerge from individual movements, which are the primary means by which animals change their environment.
   2. Individuals increase their use of a given area by adjusting two key movement components: the duration of their visit and/or the frequency of revisits. Thus, in spatially heterogeneous environments, animals exploit known, high-quality resource areas by increasing their residence time (RT) in and/or decreasing their time to return (TtoR) to these areas. We expected that spatial variation in these two movement properties should lead to observed patterns of space use in both geographic and environmental spaces. We derived a set of nine predictions linking spatial distribution of movement properties to emerging space-use patterns. We predicted that, at a given scale, high variation in RT and TtoR among habitats leads to strong habitat selection and that long RT and short TtoR result in a small home range size.
   3. We tested these predictions using moose (Alces alces) GPS tracking data. We first modelled the relationship between landscape characteristics and movement properties. Then, we investigated how the spatial distribution of predicted movement properties (i.e. spatial autocorrelation, mean, and variance of RT and TtoR) influences home range size and hierarchical habitat selection.
   4. In landscapes with high spatial autocorrelation of RT and TtoR, a high variation in both RT and TtoR occurred in home ranges. As expected, home range location was highly selective in such landscapes (i.e. second-order habitat selection); RT was higher and TtoR lower within the selected home range than outside, and moose home ranges were small. Within home ranges, a higher variation in both RT and TtoR was associated with higher selectivity among habitat types (i.e. third-order habitat selection).
   5. Our findings show how patterns of geographic and environmental space use correspond to the two sides of a coin, linked by movement responses of individuals to environmental heterogeneity. By demonstrating the potential to assess the consequences of altering RT or TtoR (e.g. through human disturbance or climatic changes) on home range size and habitat selection, our work sets the basis for new theoretical and methodological advances in movement ecology.

AB Lack of knowledge about how the various drivers of global climate change will interact with multiple stressors already affecting ecosystems is the basis for great uncertainty in projections of future biological change. Despite concerns about the impacts of changes in land use, eutrophication and climate warming in running waters, the interactive effects of these stressors on stream periphyton are largely unknown. We manipulated nutrients (simulating agricultural runoff), deposited fine sediment (simulating agricultural erosion) (two levels each) and water temperature (eight levels, 0-6 degrees C above ambient) simultaneously in 128 streamside mesocosms. Our aim was to determine the individual and combined effects of the three stressors on the algal and bacterial constituents of the periphyton. All three stressors had pervasive individual effects, but in combination frequently produced synergisms at the population level and antagonisms at the community level. Depending on sediment and nutrient conditions, the effect of raised temperature frequently produced contrasting response patterns, with stronger or opposing effects when one or both stressors were augmented. Thus, warming tended to interact negatively with nutrients or sediment by weakening or reversing positive temperature effects or strengthening negative ones. Five classes of algal growth morphology were all affected in complex ways by raised temperature, suggesting that these measures may prove unreliable in biomonitoring programs in a warming climate. The evenness and diversity of the most abundant bacterial taxa increased with temperature at ambient but not with enriched nutrient levels, indicating that warming coupled with nutrient limitation may lead to a more evenly distributed bacterial community as temperatures rise. Freshwater management decisions that seek to avoid or mitigate the negative effects of agricultural land use on stream periphyton should be informed by knowledge of the interactive effects of multiple stressors in a warming climate.

AB 1. Deterministic theories predict that local communities assemble from a regional species pool based on niche differences, thus by plant functional adaptations. We tested whether functional traits can also explain patterns in species dominance among the suite of co-occurring species.
   2. We predicted that along a gradient of secondary succession, the main driver of species dominance changes from environmental filtering in the relatively harsh (dry and hot) early successional conditions, towards increased competitive interactions and limiting similarity in later successional conditions (when light is limited).
   3. We used the Kurtosis (K) (a measure of peakedness) of the functional trait distribution of secondary forest communities in high-diversity tropical rain forest in Chiapas, Mexico. The forests ranged 1-25 years in age, and we used eight functional leaf traits related to a plants' carbon, water and heat balance. We calculated the functional trait distribution based on species dominance, where trait values were weighted by species' relative basal area, as well as based on species presence, all species counting once. 'K-ratio' was subsequently computed by dividing kurtosis based on species dominance by kurtosis based on species presence. If the K-ratio is high, the dominant species are functionally similar and we interpreted this as environmentally driven functional convergence allowing species to become dominant. If the K-ratio is small, dominant species are a functionally dissimilar subset of the species present and we interpreted this as competitively driven functional divergence allowing species to become dominant.
   4. We found that in early succession, dominant species represent a functionally narrow subset of species with similar traits, and in late succession, dominant species increasingly represent a wide subset of the species present. This trend was found for traits that reflect photosynthetic performance and light capture, and indicates increased competition for light with succession. No trend was found for traits that indicate defence against herbivory, suggesting no successional changes in herbivore pressure.
   5. Synthesis. This is one of the first studies showing that drivers of species dominance change along a gradient of secondary succession. During the early successional time window we evaluated, the importance of environmental filtering as a driving force fades away rapidly, and the importance of niche partitioning for species dominance starts to emerge.

AB A satellite-based water balance method is developed to model global evapotranspiration (ET) through coupling a water balance (WB) model with a machine-learning algorithm (the model tree ensemble, MTE) (hereafter WB-MTE). The WB-MTE algorithm was firstly trained by combining monthly WB-estimated basin ET with the potential drivers (e.g., radiation, temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and vegetation index) across 95 large river basins (5824 basin-months) and then applied to establish global monthly ET maps at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees from 1982 to 2009. The global land ET estimated from WB-MTE has an annual mean of 59317mm for 1982-2009, with a spatial distribution consistent with previous studies in all latitudes but the tropics. The ET estimated by WB-MTE also shows significant linear trends in both annual and seasonal global ET during 1982-2009, though the trends seem to have stalled after 1998. Moreover, our study presents a striking difference from the previous ones primarily in the magnitude of ET estimates during the wet season particularly in the tropics, where ET is highly uncertain due to lack of direct measurements. This may be tied to their lack of proper consideration to solar radiation and/or the rainfall interception process. By contrast, in the dry season, our estimate of ET compares well with the previous ones, both for the mean state and the variability. If we are to reduce the uncertainties in estimating ET, these results emphasize the necessity of deploying more observations during the wet season, particularly in the tropics.

AB Studies of reproductive isolation between homoploid hybrid species and their parent species have rarely been carried out. Here we investigate reproductive barriers between a recently recognized hybrid bird species, the Italian sparrow Passer italiae and its parent species, the house sparrow P. domesticus and Spanish sparrow P. hispaniolensis. Reproductive barriers can be difficult to study in hybrid species due to lack of geographical contact between taxa. However, the Italian sparrow lives parapatrically with the house sparrow and both sympatrically and parapatrically with the Spanish sparrow. Through whole-transcriptome sequencing of six individuals of each of the two parent species we identified a set of putatively parent species-diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. After filtering for coverage, genotyping success (>97%) and multiple SNPs per gene, we retained 86 species-informative, genic, nuclear and mitochondrial SNP markers from 84 genes for analysis of 612 male individuals. We show that a disproportionately large number of sex-linked genes, as well as the mitochondria and nuclear genes with mitochondrial function, exhibit sharp clines at the boundaries between the hybrid and the parent species, suggesting a role for mito-nuclear and sex-linked incompatibilities in forming reproductive barriers. We suggest that genomic conflict via interactions between mitochondria and sex-linked genes with mitochondrial function ("mother's curse") at one boundary and centromeric drive at the other may best explain our findings. Hybrid speciation in the Italian sparrow may therefore be influenced by mechanisms similar to those involved in non-hybrid speciation, but with the formation of two geographically separated species boundaries instead of one. Spanish sparrow alleles at some loci have spread north to form reproductive barriers with house sparrows, while house sparrow alleles at different loci, including some on the same chromosome, have spread in the opposite direction to form barriers against Spanish sparrows.

AB Organisms are built from thousands of genes that interact in complex ways. Still, the mathematical theory of evolution is dominated by a gene-by-gene perspective in which genes are assumed to have the same effects regardless of genetic background. Gene interaction, or epistasis, plays a role in some theoretical developments such as the evolution of recombination, reproductive isolation, and canalization, but is strikingly missing from our standard accounts of phenotypic adaptation. This absence is most puzzling within the field of quantitative genetics, which, despite its polygenic perspective and elaborate statistical representation of epistasis, has not found a single important role for gene interaction in evolution. To the contrary, there is a widespread consensus that epistasis is evolutionary inert, and that all we need to know to predict evolutionary dynamics is the additive component of the genetic variance. This view may have roots in convenience, but also in theoretical results showing that the response to selection derived from epistatic variance components is not permanent and will decay when selection is relaxed. I show that these results are tied to a conceptual confusion, and are misleading as general statements about the significance of epistasis for the selection response and adaptation.

AB Findings on climate change influence on plant pathogens are often inconsistent and context dependent. Knowledge of pathogens affecting agricultural crops and natural plant communities remains fragmented along disciplinary lines. By broadening the perspective beyond agriculture, this review integrates cross-disciplinary knowledge to show that at scales relevant to climate change, accelerated evolution and changing geographic distribution will be the main implications for pathogens. New races may evolve rapidly under elevated temperature and CO2, as evolutionary forces act on massive pathogen populations boosted by a combination of increased fecundity and infection cycles under favourable microclimate within enlarged canopy. Changing geographic distribution will bring together diverse lineages/genotypes that do not share common ecological niche, potentially increasing pathogen diversity. However, the uncertainty of model predictions and a lack of synthesis of fragmented knowledge remain as major deficiencies in knowledge. The review contends that the failure to consider scale and human intervention through new technology are major sources of uncertainty. Recognizing that improved biophysical models alone will not reduce uncertainty, it proposes a generic framework to increase focus and outlines ways to integrate biophysical elements and technology change with human intervention scenarios to minimize uncertainty. To synthesize knowledge of pathogen biology and life history, the review borrows the concept of fitness' from population biology as a comprehensive measure of pathogen strengths and vulnerabilities, and explores the implications of pathogen mode of nutrition to fitness and its interactions with plants suffering chronic abiotic stress under climate change. Current and future disease management options can then be judged for their ability to impair pathogenic and saprophytic fitness. The review pinpoints improving confidence in model prediction by minimizing uncertainty, developing management strategies to reduce overall pathogen fitness, and finding new sources of data to trawl for climate signatures on pathogens as important challenges for future research.

AB Over the past 20years, major advances have clarified how ecological patterns inform theory, and how in turn theory informs applied ecology. Also, there has been an increased recognition that the problem of scale at which ecological processes should be considered is critical if we are to produce general predictions. Ecological dynamics is always stochastic at small scales, but variability is conditional on the scale of description. The radical changes in the scope and aims of ecology over the past decades reflect in part the need to address pressing societal issues of environmental change. Technological advances in molecular biology, global positioning, sensing instrumentation and computational power should not be overlooked as an explanation for these radical changes. However, I argue that conceptual unification across ecology, genetics, evolution and physiology has fostered even more fertile questions. We are moving away from the view that evolution is played in a fixed ecological theatre: the theatre is being rapidly and relentlessly redesigned by the players themselves. The maintenance of ecosystem functions depends on shifts in species assemblages and on cellular metabolism, not only on flows of energy and matter. These findings have far reaching implications for our understanding of how ecosystem function and biodiversity will withstand (or not) environmental changes in the 21st century.

AB More humans reside in urban areas than at any other time in history. Protected urban green spaces and transportation greenbelts support many species, but diversity in these areas is generally lower than in undeveloped landscapes. Habitat degradation and fragmentation contribute to lowered diversity and urban homogenization, but less is known about the role of anthropogenic noise. Songbirds are especially vulnerable to anthropogenic noise because they rely on acoustic signals for communication. Recent studies suggest that anthropogenic noise reduces the density and reproductive success of some bird species, but that species which vocalize at frequencies above those of anthropogenic noise are more likely to inhabit noisy areas. We hypothesize that anthropogenic noise is contributing to declines in urban diversity by reducing the abundance of select species in noisy areas, and that species with low-frequency songs are those most likely to be affected. To examine this relationship, we calculated the noise-associated change in overall species richness and in abundance for seven common songbird species. After accounting for variance due to vegetative differences, species richness and the abundance of three of seven species were reduced in noisier locations. Acoustic analysis revealed that minimum song frequency was highly predictive of a species' response to noise, with lower minimum song frequencies incurring greater noise-associated reduction in abundance. These results suggest that anthropogenic noise affects some species independently of vegetative conditions, exacerbating the exclusion of some songbird species in otherwise suitable habitat. Minimum song frequency may provide a useful metric to predict how particular species will be affected by noise. In sum, mitigation of noise may enhance habitat suitability for many songbird species, especially for species with songs that include low-frequency elements.

AB Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (ca) will undoubtedly affect the metabolism of tropical forests worldwide; however, critical aspects of how tropical forests will respond remain largely unknown. Here, we review the current state of knowledge about physiological and ecological responses, with the aim of providing a framework that can help to guide future experimental research. Modelling studies have indicated that elevated ca can potentially stimulate photosynthesis more in the tropics than at higher latitudes, because suppression of photorespiration by elevated ca increases with temperature. However, canopy leaves in tropical forests could also potentially reach a high temperature threshold under elevated ca that will moderate the rise in photosynthesis. Belowground responses, including fine root production, nutrient foraging and soil organic matter processing, will be especially important to the integrated ecosystem response to elevated ca. Water use efficiency will increase as ca rises, potentially impacting upon soil moisture status and nutrient availability. Recruitment may be differentially altered for some functional groups, potentially decreasing ecosystem carbon storage. Whole-forest CO2 enrichment experiments are urgently needed to test predictions of tropical forest functioning under elevated ca. Smaller scale experiments in the understorey and in gaps would also be informative, and could provide stepping stones towards stand-scale manipulations.

AB Paternal environmental experiences are significant predictors of developmental outcomes in offspring and can occur even in the absence of paternal care. Although there has been a recent focus on the role of environmentally induced changes in the male germline in producing these effects, the potential mediating role of mothers has not been investigated. A role for mothers in the transmission of paternal effects has been well acknowledged in behavioral ecology, which predicts that females will dynamically adjust their reproductive investment in response to the qualities of their mate. In the present study, we show that a lifetime of socially enriched compared with impoverished housing conditions shifts anxiety-like behavior and gene expression of male mice. Females that mate with enriched-reared males exhibit increased levels of pup nursing and licking toward their offspring, which are associated with changes in gene expression within the maternal hypothalamus. Significantly, these changes in maternal behavior are correlated with the general levels of anxiety exhibited by their male mates. Further, we show that paternal environmental enrichment results in increased growth of their offspring. These results suggest that maternal-paternal interactions at mating may guide offspring development, with significant implications for the transgenerational transmission of paternal environmental experiences.

AB Numerous studies have explored the role of vegetation in controlling and mediating hydrological states and fluxes at the level of individual processes, which has led to improvements in our understanding of plot-scale dynamics. Relatively less effort has been directed toward spatially-explicit studies of vegetation-hydrology interactions at larger scales of a landscape. Only few continuous, process-oriented ecohydrological models had been proposed with structures of varying complexity. This study contributes to their further evolution and presents a novel ecohydrological model, Tethys-Chloris. The model synthesizes the state-of-the-art knowledge on individual processes and coupling mechanisms drawn from the disciplines of hydrology, plant physiology, and ecology. Specifically, the model reproduces all essential components of the hydrological cycle: it resolves the mass and energy budgets in the atmospheric surface layer at the hourly scale, while representing up to two layers of vegetation; it includes a module of snowpack evolution; it describes the saturated and unsaturated soil water dynamics, processes of runoff generation and flow routing. The component of vegetation dynamics parameterizes life cycle processes of different plant functional types, including photosynthesis, phenology, carbon allocation, and tissue turnover. This study presents a confirmation of the long-term, plot-scale model performance by simulating two types of ecosystems corresponding to different climate conditions. A consistent and highly satisfactory model skill in reproducing the energy and water budgets as well as physiological cycles of plants with minimum calibration overhead is demonstrated. Furthermore, these applications demonstrate that the model permits the identification of data types and observation frequencies crucial for appropriate evaluation of modeled dynamics. More importantly, through a synthesis of a wide array of process representations, the model ensures that climate, soil, vegetation, and topography collectively identify essential modes controlling ecohydrological systems, i.e., that satisfactory performance is a result of appropriate mimicking of internal processes.

AB 1. Determined by landscape structure as well as dispersal-related traits of species, connectivity influences various key aspects of population biology, ranging from population persistence to genetic structure and diversity. Here, we investigated differences in small-scale connectivity in terms of gene flow between populations of two ecologically important invertebrates with contrasting dispersal-related traits: an amphipod (Gammarus fossarum) with a purely aquatic life cycle and a mayfly (Baetis rhodani) with a terrestrial adult stage.
   2. We used highly polymorphic markers to estimate genetic differentiation between populations of both species within a Swiss pre-alpine catchment and compared these results to the broader-scale genetic structure within the Rhine drainage. Landscape genetic approaches were used to test for correlations of genetic and geographical structures and in-stream barrier effects.
   3. We found overall very weak genetic structure in populations of B. rhodani. In contrast, G. fossarum showed strong genetic differentiation, even at spatial scales of a few kilometres, and a clear pattern of isolation by distance. Genetic diversity decreased from downstream towards upstream populations of G. fossarum, suggesting asymmetric gene flow. Correlation of genetic structure with landscape topography was more pronounced in the amphipod. Our study also indicates that G. fossarum might be capable of dispersing overland in headwater regions and of crossing small in-stream barriers.
   4. We speculate that differences in dispersal capacity but also habitat specialisation and potentially the extent of local adaptation could be responsible for the differences in genetic differentiation found between the two species. These results highlight the importance of taking into account dispersal-related traits when planning management and conservation strategies.

AB Across different taxa, networks of mutualistic or antagonistic interactions show consistent architecture. Most networks are modular, with modules being distinct species subsets connected mainly with each other and having few connections to other modules. We investigate the phylogenetic relatedness of species within modules and whether a phylogenetic signal is detectable in the within- and among-module connectivity of species using 27 mammal-flea networks from the Palaearctic. In the 24 networks that were modular, closely related hosts co-occurred in the same module more often than expected by chance; in contrast, this was rarely the case for parasites. The within- and among-module connectivity of the same host or parasite species varied geographically. However, among-module but not within- module connectivity of host and parasites was somewhat phylogenetically constrained. These findings suggest that the establishment of host-parasite networks results from the interplay between phylogenetic influences acting mostly on hosts and local factors acting on parasites, to create an asymmetrically constrained pattern of geographic variation in modular structure. Modularity in host-parasite networks seems to result from the shared evolutionary history of hosts and by trait convergence among unrelated parasites. This suggests profound differences between hosts and parasites in the establishment and functioning of bipartite antagonistic networks.

AB The genetic analysis of faecal material represents a relatively non-invasive way to study animal diet and has been widely adopted in ecological research. Due to the heterogeneous nature of faecal material the primary obstacle, common to all genetic approaches, is a means to dissect the constituent DNA sequences. Traditionally, bacterial cloning of PCR amplified products was employed; less common has been the use of species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays. Currently, with the advent of High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technologies and indexed primers it has become possible to conduct genetic audits of faecal material to a much greater depth than previously possible. To date, no studies have systematically compared the estimates obtained by HTS with that of qPCR. What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of each technique and how quantitative are deep-sequencing approaches that employ universal primers? Using the locally threatened Little Penguin (Eudyptula minor) as a model organism, it is shown here that both qPCR and HTS techniques are highly correlated and produce strikingly similar quantitative estimates of fish DNA in faecal material, with no statistical difference. By designing four species-specific fish qPCR assays and comparing the data to the same four fish in the HTS data it was possible to directly compare the strengths and weaknesses of both techniques. To obtain reproducible quantitative data one of the key, and often overlooked, steps common to both approaches is ensuring that efficient DNA isolation methods are employed and that extracts are free of inhibitors. Taken together, the methodology chosen for long-term faecal monitoring programs is largely dependent on the complexity of the prey species present and the level of accuracy that is desired. Importantly, these methods should not be thought of as mutually exclusive, as the use of both HTS and qPCR in tandem will generate datasets with the highest fidelity.

AB In group-living species, individuals gain significant advantages from establishing an extensive network of social relationships. This results in complex organizations that are difficult to quantify in a comprehensive manner. In this respect, network analyses are an ideal means to pinpoint the overall properties of social structures, and the place of each individual within these structures. We used network measurements to investigate cross-species variations in the social style of macaques, and studied 12 groups from four species. Two species (Macaca mulatta, Macaca fuscata) were characterized by a relatively weak social tolerance, a steep gradient of dominance and a strong preference for kin. The other two species (Macaca nigra, Macaca tonkeana) were known to display higher levels of tolerance, relaxed dominance and low kinship bias. We used a centrality index based on eigenvector centrality to show that in a comparison of intolerant and tolerant species, top-ranking individuals were more central than other group members in the former species than the latter. We also found that networks had higher modularity in intolerant species, indicating that kin-related partners interacted more frequently in subgroups of these species than in those of tolerant species. Consistently, the matrix of body contacts was more strongly correlated with the kinship matrix in intolerant species. This study demonstrates the efficiency of network methodology in detecting fine and overall contrasts in social structures, and also reveals novel dimensions in the social style of macaques.

AB Sexually deceptive orchids mimic females of their pollinator species to attract male insects for pollination. Pollination by sexual deception has independently evolved in European, Australian, South African, and South American orchid taxa. Reproductive isolation is mainly based on pre-mating isolation barriers, the specific attraction of males of a single pollinator species, mostly bees, by mimicking the female species-specific sex-pheromone. However, in rare cases post-mating barriers have been found. Sexually deceptive orchids are ideal candidates for studies of sympatric speciation, because key adaptive traits such as the pollinator-attracting scent are associated with their reproductive success and with pre-mating isolation.
   During the last two decades several investigations studied processes of ecological speciation in sexually deceptive orchids of Europe and Australia. Using various methods like behavioural experiments, chemical, electrophysiological, and population-genetic analyses it was shown that minor changes in floral odour bouquets might be the driving force for pollinator shifts and speciation events. New pollinators act as an isolation barrier towards other sympatrically occurring species. Hybridization occurs because of similar odour bouquets of species and the overlap of flowering periods. Hybrid speciation can also lead to the displacement of species by the hybrid population, if its reproductive success is higher than that in the parental species. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB An ideal technology for non-invasive analysis of body composition should provide highly precise and accurate direct measurements of fat, lean mass and total water of non-anaesthetized subjects within minutes. We validate a quantitative magnetic resonance (QMR) body composition analyzer for birds using House Sparrows (Passer domesticus), European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), and Zebra Finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Subjects were scanned awake for three replicate scans of 1.5-3.5 min, and results were compared to gravimetric chemical analysis. Coefficients of variation were a parts per thousand currency sign3% for dry fat, wet lean mass and total water. Accuracy of the raw QMR data for fat and total water were high (relative errors a parts per thousand currency sign +/- 12.5 and a parts per thousand currency sign +/- 4%, respectively), but wet lean mass was significantly biased because QMR does not detect structural tissues. Calibration against gravimetric chemical analysis removed bias and improved accuracy; relative errors were +/- 6-11% for fat, +/- 1-2% for wet lean mass, and +/- 2-4% for total water. QMR is field-portable when transported in a temperature-controlled trailer, and can be used to study fuel storage and body composition dynamics during migration, reproduction, nestling growth, or wintering. In the laboratory, QMR can be used for longitudinal studies of birds under photoperiod, endocrine or other manipulations. Measurements taken before and after metabolic challenges, such as flight in a wind tunnel, make it possible to calculate energy costs, fuel selection and changes in hydration. QMR should find wide application in field and laboratory studies.

AB Objective: This study involves a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled trial to examine whether child-parent psychotherapy (CPP), an empirically based treatment focusing on the parent-child relationship as the vehicle for child improvement, is efficacious for children who experienced multiple traumatic and stressful life events (TSEs).
   Methods: Participants comprised 75 preschool-aged children and their mothers referred to treatment following the child's exposure to domestic violence. Dyads were randomly assigned to CPP or to a comparison group that received monthly case management plus referrals to community services and were assessed at intake, posttest, and 6-month follow-up. Treatment effectiveness was examined by level of child TSE risk exposure (<4 risks versus 4+ TSEs).
   Results: For children in the 4+ risk group, those who received CPP showed significantly greater improvements in PTSD and depression symptoms, PTSD diagnosis, number of co-occurring diagnoses, and behavior problems compared to those in the comparison group. CPP children with <4 risks showed greater improvements in symptoms of PTSD than those in the comparison group. Mothers of children with 4+ TSEs in the CPP group showed greater reductions in symptoms of PTSD and depression than those randomized to the comparison condition. Analyses of 6-month follow-up data suggest improvements were maintained for the high risk group.
   Conclusions: The data provide evidence that CPP is effective in improving outcomes for children who experienced four or more TSEs and had positive effects for their mothers as well.
   Practice implications: Numerous studies show that exposure to childhood trauma and adversity has negative consequences for later physical and mental health, but few interventions have been specifically evaluated to determine their effectiveness for children who experienced multiple TSEs. The findings suggest that including the parent as an integral participant in the child's treatment may be particularly effective in the treatment of young children exposed to multiple risks.

AB Various ecological mechanisms influence the forms of species richness relationships (SRRs). These mechanisms can be gathered under five general categories: more individuals, environmental heterogeneity, dispersal limitations, biotic interactions, and multiple species pools. Often only the first two categories are discussed. In contrast, we examine all five and explore how they can influence the form of SRRs. We discuss how various sampling schemes and methods of SRR construction can be used to gain insight about how various processes influence species richness patterns. The field is ripe for probing these effects through more complex simulation models or more sophisticated mathematical approaches. To facilitate deeper understanding, we need to embrace the full spectrum of SRRs and reconsider the assumed common knowledge about the functional form of SRRs.
   The relationship between species richness and the space or time over which it is sampled has received increasing attention over the past decade, resulting in extensive debates about terminology and methods of construction. These debates reflect deep conceptual issues; to resolve them we discuss the long history of species richness relationships (SRRs) and the connections among different methodological and terminological approaches. We reinforce recent calls to organize the variety of methods used to construct SRRs into a cohesive structure. SRRs are descriptors of various aspects of inventory (alpha-and gamma-) diversity and the various types of SRRs serve different purposes. Contrary to most claims, SRRs do not provide a direct measure of differentiation (beta-) diversity.

AB Background: Colobine monkeys constitute a diverse group of primates with major radiations in Africa and Asia. However, phylogenetic relationships among genera are under debate, and recent molecular studies with incomplete taxon-sampling revealed discordant gene trees. To solve the evolutionary history of colobine genera and to determine causes for possible gene tree incongruences, we combined presence/absence analysis of mobile elements with autosomal, X chromosomal, Y chromosomal and mitochondrial sequence data from all recognized colobine genera.
   Results: Gene tree topologies and divergence age estimates derived from different markers were similar, but differed in placing Piliocolobus/Procolobus and langur genera among colobines. Although insufficient data, homoplasy and incomplete lineage sorting might all have contributed to the discordance among gene trees, hybridization is favored as the main cause of the observed discordance. We propose that African colobines are paraphyletic, but might later have experienced female introgression from Piliocolobus/Procolobus into Colobus. In the late Miocene, colobines invaded Eurasia and diversified into several lineages. Among Asian colobines, Semnopithecus diverged first, indicating langur paraphyly. However, unidirectional gene flow from Semnopithecus into Trachypithecus via male introgression followed by nuclear swamping might have occurred until the earliest Pleistocene.
   Conclusions: Overall, our study provides the most comprehensive view on colobine evolution to date and emphasizes that analyses of various molecular markers, such as mobile elements and sequence data from multiple loci, are crucial to better understand evolutionary relationships and to trace hybridization events. Our results also suggest that sex-specific dispersal patterns, promoted by a respective social organization of the species involved, can result in different hybridization scenarios.

AB Sampling is a key issue for answering most ecological and evolutionary questions. The importance of developing a rigorous sampling design tailored to specific questions has already been discussed in the ecological and sampling literature and has provided useful tools and recommendations to sample and analyse ecological data. However, sampling issues are often difficult to overcome in ecological studies due to apparent inconsistencies between theory and practice, often leading to the implementation of simplified sampling designs that suffer from unknown biases. Moreover, we believe that classical sampling principles which are based on estimation of means and variances are insufficient to fully address many ecological questions that rely on estimating relationships between a response and a set of predictor variables over time and space. Our objective is thus to highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate sampling space and an appropriate sampling design. We also emphasize the importance of using prior knowledge of the study system to estimate models or complex parameters and thus better understand ecological patterns and processes generating these patterns. Using a semi-virtual simulation study as an illustration we reveal how the selection of the space (e.g. geographic, climatic), in which the sampling is designed, influences the patterns that can be ultimately detected. We also demonstrate the inefficiency of common sampling designs to reveal response curves between ecological variables and climatic gradients. Further, we show that response-surface methodology, which has rarely been used in ecology, is much more efficient than more traditional methods. Finally, we discuss the use of prior knowledge, simulation studies and model-based designs in defining appropriate sampling designs. We conclude by a call for development of methods to unbiasedly estimate nonlinear ecologically relevant parameters, in order to make inferences while fulfilling requirements of both sampling theory and field work logistics.

AB Question
   What are the main driving factors in 70 years of natural dynamics in tree recruitment in the Bialowieza National Park?
   Location
   Bialowieza National Park, Poland, is one of the least disturbed temperate, lowland forest systems in Europe.
   Methods
   We tested whether fluctuations in large herbivore populations, changes in climate and openness of the forest explained compositional dynamics. Tree recruitment (to size class DBH >= 5 cm) was measured on permanent transects (in total, 14.9 ha) six times between 1936-2002. These data were related to existing data on ungulate density, climatic parameters and estimates of forest openness collected during the same period.
   Results
   Total recruitment of all tree species combined was negatively correlated with total ungulate density and red deer density. The variation in response between species was related to the preferences of herbivores; the more preferred forage species (especially Carpinus betulus) were positively and the less preferred species negatively related to herbivore density. Total tree recruitment rates were not related to climatic parameters and openness of the forest. Only Alnus glutinosa recruitment was significantly related to climatic parameters, and Ulmus glabra related to forest openness, but there were no predictable patterns in recruitment among species in relation to these factors.
   Conclusion
   The present study indicated that changes in large herbivore density have played an important role in driving patterns in tree recruitment and species composition during the last 70 years in Bialowieza National Park. In contrast to other studies, increasing herbivore numbers were associated with higher recruitment of preferred and browsing-tolerant species. Periodical crashes in ungulate numbers, whether human-induced or caused by natural factors, may offer windows of opportunity for regeneration of a range of tree species and facilitate more diverse and dynamic forest development.

AB Genetic theories of adaptation generally overlook the genes in which beneficial substitutions occur, and the likely variation in their mutational effects. We investigate the consequences of heterogeneous mutational effects among loci on the genetics of adaptation. We use a generalization of Fisher's geometrical model, which assumes multivariate Gaussian stabilizing selection on multiple characters. In our model, mutation has a distinct variance-covariance matrix of phenotypic effects for each locus. Consequently, the distribution of selection coefficients s varies across loci. We assume each locus can only affect a limited number of independent linear combinations of phenotypic traits (restricted pleiotropy), which differ among loci, an effect we term "orientation heterogeneity." Restricted pleiotropy can sharply reduce the overall proportion of beneficial mutations. Orientation heterogeneity has little impact on the shape of the genomic distribution, but can substantially increase the probability of parallel evolution (the repeated fixation of beneficial mutations at the same gene in independent populations), which is highest with low pleiotropy. We also consider variation in the degree of pleiotropy and in the mean s across loci. The latter impacts the genomic distribution of s, but has a much milder effect on parallel evolution. We discuss these results in the light of evolution experiments.

AB Although most natural populations are genetically subdivided, they are often analysed as if they were panmictic units. In particular, signals of past demographic size changes are often inferred from genetic data by assuming that the analysed sample is drawn from a population without any internal subdivision. However, it has been shown that a bottleneck signal can result from the presence of some recent immigrants in a population. It thus appears important to contrast these two alternative scenarios in a model choice procedure to prevent wrong conclusions to be made. We use here an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach to infer whether observed patterns of genetic diversity in a given sample are more compatible with it being drawn from a panmictic population having gone through some size change, or from one or several demes belonging to a recent finite island model. Simulations show that we can correctly identify samples drawn from a subdivided population in up to 95% of the cases for a wide range of parameters. We apply our model choice procedure to the case of the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and find conclusive evidence that Western and Eastern chimpanzee samples are drawn from a spatially subdivided population.

AB P>1. Habitat fragmentation is a major threat to biodiversity and can lead to the loss of both species and ecosystem services, but fragmentation effects vary greatly between studies and studied organisms. Understanding the distinct effects of habitat amount and isolation at the patch and landscape scale may account for some of this variation.
   2. We studied biodiversity in 30 traditional orchards that were selected for independent variation in habitat amount and habitat isolation at the patch and landscape scale. We analysed species richness and abundance of snails, beetles, true bugs, spiders and breeding birds that avoid open farmland but occur in woody vegetation types. Additionally, the abundances of nine single species were analysed using specific habitat definitions.
   3. Surprisingly, the effects of habitat isolation were more important than the effects of habitat amount. Effects at the patch scale were more frequent than landscape-scale effects.
   4. Spider species richness decreased with increasing patch-scale habitat amount. Abundance of the weevil Phyllobius oblongus increased with landscape-scale habitat amount. Negative effects of patch isolation were greater for predatory birds and spiders, while the predominately herbivorous beetles, true bugs and snails were less affected. Species richness of birds, spiders and beetles, and abundance of birds, Cyanistes caeruleus, Parus major and Fringilla coelebs, decreased with increasing patch-scale habitat isolation. In contrast, species richness of spiders and beetles increased with increasing landscape-scale habitat isolation.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The effects of habitat fragmentation differed between taxonomic groups, with stronger and more consistent responses in birds than invertebrates. Our understanding of fragmentation effects may be biased due to the dominance of bird studies in the literature, and further invertebrate studies are encouraged. Landscape management to improve biodiversity or ecosystem services requires a group-specific approach and coordinated priority setting. High habitat connectivity benefited wood-preferring birds, spiders and beetles, lending support to national initiatives for increased habitat connectedness. The negative effects of patch isolation were greater for natural pest regulators, birds and spiders than for herbivorous beetles and bugs.

AB Genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity are two ways in which organisms can adapt to local environmental conditions. We examined genetic and plastic variation in gill and brain size among swamp (low oxygen; hypoxic) and river (normal oxygen; normoxic) populations of an African cichlid fish, Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor victoriae. Larger gills and smaller brains should be advantageous when oxygen is low, and we hypothesized that the relative contribution of local genetic adaptation vs. phenotypic plasticity should be related to potential for dispersal between environments (because of gene flow's constraint on local genetic adaptation). We conducted a laboratory-rearing experiment, with broods from multiple populations raised under high-oxygen and low-oxygen conditions. We found that most of the variation in gill size was because of plasticity. However, both plastic and genetic effects on brain mass were detected, as were genetic effects on brain mass plasticity. F-1 offspring from populations with the highest potential for dispersal between environments had characteristically smaller and more plastic brains. This phenotypic pattern might be adaptive in the face of gene flow, if smaller brains and increased plasticity confer higher average fitness across environment types.

AB Olive flies (Bactrocera oleae) are intimately associated with bacteria throughout their life cycle, and both larvae and adults are morphologically adapted for housing bacteria in the digestive tract. We tested the hypothesis that these bacteria contribute to the adult fly's fitness in a diet-dependent fashion. We predicted that when dietary protein is superabundant, bacterial contribution will be minimal. Conversely, in the absence of protein, or when only non-essential amino acids are present (as in the fly's natural diet), we predicted that bacterial contribution to fitness will be significant. Accordingly, we manipulated diet and the presence of bacteria in female olive flies, and monitored fecundity-an indirect measure of fitness. Bacteria did not affect fecundity when females were fed a nutritionally poor diet of sucrose, or a protein-rich, nutritionally complete diet. However, when females were fed a diet containing non-essential amino acids as the sole source of amino nitrogen, egg production was significantly enhanced in the presence of bacteria. These results suggest that bacteria were able to compensate for the skewed amino acid composition of the diet and may be indispensable for wild adult olive flies that subsist mainly on nitrogen-poor resources such as honeydew.

AB Urbanization may have a large affect on biodiversity patterns by enhancing biological invasions. Urban habitats harbour high numbers of introduced plant species and may function as starting points for invasions along urban-rural gradients. As information on underlying mechanisms is critical for managing biological invasions, we test the role of rivers as dispersal corridors for primarily wind-dispersed ornamentals. We released tagged fruits of three invasive tree species in the Spree River (Berlin, Germany) and directly observed the fate of the floating samaras. The number of floating samaras declined exponentially with distance from the release point. A quarter floated 1200 m within 3 h. Despite marked differences in fruit morphology, there were no interspecific differences in floating capacity. We showed hydrochory to be an effective dispersal agent in wind-dispersed tree species, extending wind-related transport distances by several times. In this way, rivers are expected to link urban propagule sources with natural habitats downstream. Our results suggest that planting native tree species along river corridors would help prevent invasion risks and contribute to implementing principles of ecological design in urban greenways and generally consider the importance of eradicating wind-dispersed invasive tree species in floodplains in early invasion stages to prevent further water-mediated dispersal.

AB Multiple clonal isolates from a geographic population of Alexandrium tamarense (M. Lebour) Balech from the North Sea exhibited high genotypic and phenotypic variation. Genetic heterogeneity was such that no clonal lineage was repeatedly sampled according to genotypic markers specified by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and microsatellites. Subsampling of genotypic data from both markers showed that ordination of individuals by pair-wise genetic dissimilarity indices was more reliable by AFLP (482 biallelic loci) than by microsatellites (18 loci). However, resulting patterns of pair-wise genetic similarities from both markers were significantly correlated (Mantel test P < 0.005). The composition of neurotoxins associated with paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) was also highly diverse among these isolates and allowed clustering of toxin phenotypes based on prevalence of individual toxins. Correlation analysis of pair-wise relatedness of individual clones according to PSP-toxin profiles and both genotypic characters failed to yield close associations. The expression of allelochemical properties against the cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina (Wislouch) D. R. A. Hill et Wetherbee and the predatory dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina Dujard. manifested population-wide variation of responses in the target species, from no visible effect to complete lysis of target cells. Whereas the high genotypic variation indicates high potential for adaptability of the population, we interpret the wide phenotypic variation as evidence for lack of strong selective pressure on respective phenotypic traits at the time the population was sampled. Population markers as applied here may elucidate the ecological significance of respective traits when followed under variable environmental conditions, thereby revealing how variation is maintained within populations.

AB Wing pattern evolution in Heliconius butterflies provides some of the most striking examples of adaptation by natural selection. The genes controlling pattern variation are classic examples of Mendelian loci of large effect, where allelic variation causes large and discrete phenotypic changes and is responsible for both convergent and highly divergent wing pattern evolution across the genus. We characterize nucleotide variation, genotype-by-phenotype associations, linkage disequilibrium (LD), and candidate gene expression patterns across two unlinked genomic intervals that control yellow and red wing pattern variation among mimetic forms of Heliconius erato. Despite very strong natural selection on color pattern, we see neither a strong reduction in genetic diversity nor evidence for extended LD across either patterning interval. This observation highlights the extent that recombination can erase the signature of selection in natural populations and is consistent with the hypothesis that either the adaptive radiation or the alleles controlling it are quite old. However, across both patterning intervals we identified SNPs clustered in several coding regions that were strongly associated with color pattern phenotype. Interestingly, coding regions with associated SNPs were widely separated, suggesting that color pattern alleles may be composed of multiple functional sites, conforming to previous descriptions of these loci as "supergenes." Examination of gene expression levels of genes flanking these regions in both H. erato and its co-mimic, H. melpomene, implicate a gene with high sequence similarity to a kinesin as playing a key role in modulating pattern and provides convincing evidence for parallel changes in gene regulation across co-mimetic lineages. The complex genetic architecture at these color pattern loci stands in marked contrast to the single casual mutations often identified in genetic studies of adaptation, but may be more indicative of the type of genetic changes responsible for much of the adaptive variation found in natural populations.

AB P>We develop a new conceptual model we call the Resource Pool Diversity Hypothesis (RPDH) aimed at explaining how soil resource pool diversity may mediate competition for soil resources between weeds and crops. The primary tenets of the RPDH are that (i) in plant communities, the intensity of inter-specific competition can depend upon the degree to which niche differentiation and resource partitioning occur among species, (ii) agricultural systems are unique in that management practices, such as crop rotation, source of fertility and weed management, result in inputs to the soil and (iii) these inputs directly or indirectly become soil resource pools from which crops and weeds may partition resources. The RPDH leads to the novel prediction that along a gradient of increasing cropping system diversity, yield loss due to weed-crop competition (i.e. the impact on yield per unit weed density) for soil resources should decrease. Similarly, the degree to which crops and weeds overlap in soil resource niche breadth (which is determined by species-specific functional traits for resource acquisition), will determine the extent to which weed-crop competition weakens as resource pool diversity increases. While there have been no direct tests of the RPDH, we highlight evidence from the agricultural literature that provides strong support for components of the hypothesis. Validation of the RPDH would have important implications across a broad range of cropping systems for the development of management strategies that aim to reduce yield loss impact per unit weed plant density and the fundamental principles of integrated weed management, such as the concepts of weed thresholds and critical periods.

AB Where do the genetic variants underlying adaptive change come from? Are currently adaptive alleles recruited by selection from standing genetic variation within populations, moved through introgression from other populations, or do they arise as novel mutations? Here, we examine the molecular basis of repeated adaptation to the toxin of deadly prey in 3 species of garter snakes (Thamnophis) to determine whether adaptation has evolved through novel mutations, sieving of existing variation, or transmission of beneficial alleles across species. Functional amino acid substitutions in the skeletal muscle sodium channel (Na(v)1.4) are largely responsible for the physiological resistance of garter snakes to tetrodotoxin found in their newt (Taricha) prey. Phylogenetic analyses reject the hypotheses that the unique resistance alleles observed in multiple Thamnophis species were present before the split of these lineages, or that alleles were shared among species through occasional hybridization events. Our results demonstrate that adaptive evolution has occurred independently multiple times in garter snakes via the de novo acquisition of beneficial mutations.

AB Saltcedars (Tamarix ramosissima and T. chinensis) are native to Asia, but since introduction into the USA have become common and invasive in many western riparian habitats. Recent molecular analysis of a single locus nuclear DNA sequence marker has shown that in their native range the two species are genetically distinct, but within the USA populations many of the plants (23%) are novel hybrids. Here, we used multilocus DNA markers (amplified fragment length polymorphisms) to determine the levels of introgression in USA plants. Species-specific diagnostic markers, principal coordinates analysis, and a Bayesian model-based clustering analysis all indicate a much higher incidence of hybridization (83-87%) than was revealed by the single locus marker, with USA plants forming a genetic continuum between the two parental types. Additionally, the level of introgression toward Tamarix ramosissima or T. chinensis was strongly correlated with latitude. Concordance of level of introgression was highest between principal coordinates analysis and the Bayesian analysis. The high percentage of novel hybrids may have implications for classical biological control efforts.

AB Although no mature tropical tree had ever been exposed to an experimentally CO2-enriched atmosphere, evidence from works with seedlings and saplings, theory, models, and proxy data suggest effects on biodiversity and enhanced forest dynamics. Tropical forest carbon stocking is unlikely to increase given, that carbon pool size is driven by tree and patch demography, with tree longevity unlikely to increase. Unlike epiphytes, tropical lianas are likely to play a more important role in a CO2-rich future.

AB 1. Under the effects of rapid environmental change, such as climate change and land degradation, assessment of plant species potential distribution is becoming increasingly important for conservation purposes. Moreover, land administrators need reliable predictions of species suitability for planning a wide range of management activities.
   2. In this study, we used the recent Maxent algorithm for modelling the niche of Arnica montana within a Site of Community Importance in the Alps, with the ultimate aim of providing a rigorous evidence base for management of this locally threatened species. We built a final suitability map taking into account (i) the minimization of spatial autocorrelation through the use of a constrained random split of sampled data; (ii) the use of a stepwise selection of predictors in order to obtain a reduced model containing only meaningful variables; (iii) the comparison of the predictive power of three sets of environmental predictors; (iv) the identification of the most suitable areas by overlaying predictions of three competing models; (v) the use of divergence maps as a complement to conventional performance comparison assessments.
   3. Maxent improved accuracy both on training and test data sets. Elevation, geomorphology and hosting habitats performed as effective primary predictors. A reduced model based on the outcomes of a preliminary stepwise selection analysis of predictors gave the best accuracy score on test data. Two parts of the study area have been selected for management as a result of areas of agreement between the three competing models.
   4. Synthesis and applications. There remain important methodological issues that need to be improved in order to increase confidence in niche modelling and ensure that reintroduction and management activities for threatened or rare plant species are based on reliable distribution models. Modellers can improve predictions of plant distribution by addressing methodological topics that are often overlooked, as demonstrated for A. montana in this study.

AB Urbanization has been cited as an important factor in worldwide amphibian declines, and although recent work has illustrated the important influence of broad-scale ecological patterns and processes on amphibian populations, little is known about the factors structuring amphibian communities in urban landscapes. We therefore examined amphibian community responses to wetland habitat availability and landscape characteristics along an urban - rural gradient in central Iowa, USA, a region experiencing rapid suburban growth. We conducted call surveys at 61 wetlands to estimate anuran calling activity, and quanti. ed wetland habitat structure and landscape context. We used canonical correspondence analysis ( CCA) to examine patterns in anuran community structure and identify the most important variables associated with those patterns. Urban density at the landscape scale had a signi. cant negative in. uence on overall anuran abundance and diversity. While every species exhibited a decrease in abundance with increasing urban density, this pattern was especially pronounced for species requiring post- breeding upland habitats. Anurans most affected by urbanization were those associated with short hydroperiods, early breeding activity, and substantial upland habitat use. We suggest that broad- scale landscape fragmentation is an important factor underlying anuran community structure in this region, possibly due to limitations on the accessibility of otherwise suitable habitat in fragmented urban landscapes. This study underscores the importance of a regional approach to amphibian conservation in urban and urbanizing areas; in fragmented landscapes, a network of interconnected wetland and upland habitats may be more likely to support a successful, diverse anuran community than will isolated sites.

AB Sperm competition is an important force driving the evolution of sperm design and function. Inter- and intraspecific variation in sperm design are strongly influenced by the risk of sperm competition in many taxa. In contrast, the variation among sperm of one male (intramale variation) is less well understood. We investigated intramale variation in sperm design in passerine birds and found that risk of sperm competition is negatively associated with intramale variation. This result is the first clear evidence that variation among sperm within an individual male is influenced by postcopulatory sexual selection. Our finding has important implications for male traits under pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection.

AB We analyze the impacts of the steady state assumption on inverse model parameter retrieval from biogeochemical models. An inverse model parameterization study using eddy covariance CO2 flux data was performed with the Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model under conditions of strict and relaxed carbon cycle steady state assumption (CCSSA) in order to evaluate both the robustness of the model's structure for the simulation of net ecosystem carbon fluxes and the assessment of the CCSSA effects on simulations and parameter estimation. Net ecosystem production (NEP) measurements from several eddy covariance sites were compared with NEP estimates from the CASA model driven by local weather station climate inputs as well as by remotely sensed fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation and leaf area index. The parameters considered for optimization are directly related to aboveground and belowground modeled responses to temperature and water availability, as well as a parameter (eta) that relaxed the CCSSA in the model, allowing for site level simulations to be initialized either as net sinks or sources. A robust relationship was observed between NEP observations and predictions for most of the sites through the range of temporal scales considered (daily, weekly, biweekly, and monthly), supporting the conclusion that the model structure is able to capture the main processes explaining NEP variability. Overall, relaxing CCSSA increased model efficiency (21%) and decreased normalized average error (-92%). Intersite variability was a major source of variance in model performance differences between fixed (CCSSA(f)) and relaxed (CCSSA(r)) CCSSA conditions. These differences were correlated with mean annual NEP observations, where an average increase in modeling efficiency of 0.06 per 100 g C m(-2) a(-1) (where a is years) of NEP is observed (alpha < 0.003). The parameter eta was found to be a key parameter in the optimization exercise, generating significant model efficiency losses when removed from the initial parameter set and parameter uncertainties were significantly lower under CCSSA(r). Moreover, modeled soil carbon stocks were generally closer to observations once the steady state assumption was relaxed. Finally, we also show that estimates of individual parameters are affected by the steady state assumption. For example, estimates of radiation-use efficiency were strongly affected by the CCSSA(f) indicating compensation effects for the inadequate steady state assumption, leading to effective and thus biased parameters. Overall, the importance of model structural evaluation in data assimilation approaches is thus emphasized.

AB The Mahalanobis distances have been introduced in habitat selection studies for the estimation of environmental suitability maps (ESMs). The pixels of raster maps of a given area correspond to points in the multidimensional space defined by the mapped environmental variables (ecological space). The Mahalanobis distances measure the distances in this space between these points and the mean of the ecological niche (i. e., the hypothesized optimum for the species) regarding the structure of the niche. The map of these distances over the area of interest is an estimated ESM. Several authors recently noted that the use of a single optimum for the niche of a species may lead to biased predictions of animal occurrence. They proposed to use instead a minimum set of basic habitat requirements, found by partitioning the Mahalanobis distances into a restricted set of biologically meaningful axes. However, the statistical approach they proposed does not take into account the environmental conditions on the area where the niche was sampled (i. e., the environmental availability), and we show that including this availability is necessary. We used their approach as a basis to develop a new exploratory tool, the Mahalanobis distance factor analysis (MADIFA), which performs an additive partitioning of the Mahalanobis distances taking into account this availability. The basic habitat requirements of a species can be derived from the axes of the MADIFA. This method can also be used to compute ESMs using only this small number of basic requirements, therefore including only the biologically relevant information. We also prove that the MADIFA is complementary to the commonly used ecological-niche factor analysis (ENFA). We used the MADIFA method to analyze the niche of the chamois Rupicapra rupicapra in a mountainous area. This method adds to the existing set of tools for the description of the niche.

AB Copepods play a central role in marine food webs as grazers of plankton and as key prey for many predators. Therefore, quantifying their specific trophic interactions is critical for understanding the role of copepods in ocean processes. However, because of methodological constraints, it remains difficult to investigate in situ copepod feeding without reliance on laborious intrusive and potentially biased incubation approaches. Recent advances in PCR-based methodologies have demonstrated the feasibility of directly identifying copepod diets based on prey DNA sequences. Yet, obtaining quantitative information from these approaches remains challenging. This study presents results of systematic efforts to develop a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay targeted to 18S rRNA gene fragments to estimate copepod gut content of specific species of prey algae. These results were first compared to gut content estimates based on fluorescence in the copepod Calanus finmarchicus fed monocultures of two different microalgae species in controlled laboratory studies. In subsequent field studies, we compared feeding rates obtained by microscopy and qPCR for Temora longicornis and Acartia clausi feeding on the haptophyte Phaeocystis globosa in natural blooms. These investigations demonstrate a semi-quantitative relationship between gut content estimates derived from qPCR, gut pigment, and direct microscopy. However, absolute estimates of gut content based on qPCR methodology were consistently lower than expected. This did not appear to be explained by the extraction methods used, or interference by non-target (predator) DNA in the PCR reactions, instead suggesting digestion of prey-specific nucleic acids. Furthermore, the 18S rDNA target gene copy number of the phytoplankton varied with growth phase. Nonetheless, when prey target gene copy number in the ambient water is quantified, the qPCR-approach can be compared to other methods, and then used to semi-quantitatively estimate relative copepod grazing on specific prey in situ without involving further incubations. A distinct advantage of a DNA-based molecular approach compared to gut fluorescence and direct microscopic observation, is the ability to detect non-pigmented and macerated prey. Future studies should aim to correct for breakdown in prey DNA and perform extensive calibrations to other methods in order to achieve a quantitative measure of feeding rates in situ.

AB Global changes are shaping the ecology and biogeography of marine species and their fisheries. Macroecology theory, which deals with large scale relationships between ecology and biogeography, can be used to develop models to predict the effects of global changes on marine species that in turn affect their fisheries. First, based on theories linking trophic energetics and allometric scaling of metabolism, we developed a theoretical model that relates maximum catch potential from a species to its trophic level, geographic range, and mean primary production within the species' exploited range. Then, using this theoretical model and data from 1000 species of exploited marine fishes and invertebrates, we analyzed the empirical relationship between species' approximated maximum catch potential, their ecology, and biogeography variables. Additional variables are included in the empirical model to correct for biases resulting from the uncertainty inherent in the original catch data. The empirical model has high explanatory power and agrees with theoretical expectations. In the future, this empirical model can be combined with a bioclimate envelope model to predict the socio-economic impacts of climate change on global marine fisheries. Such potential application is illustrated here with an example pertaining to the small yellow croaker Larimichthys polyactis (Sciaenidae) from the East China Sea.

Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled at 30 stream sites between 2,600 and 4,000 m a.s.l. in northern Ecuador. All four measures of local richness (total number of taxa, taxa in Surber samples, Fisher's alpha index and rarefied richness) decreased with increasing altitude. The MDE null model, water temperature and dissolved oxygen also decreased with altitude, while other measured variables were uncorrelated with altitude. Minimum oxygen saturation had the highest explanatory power of the density-corrected Fisher's alpha and rarefied richness (R = 0.48 and 0.52, respectively), but also minimum temperature (R = 0.48 and 0.41) and the MDE null model (R = 0.48 and 0.46) correlated significantly. Multiple regression analyses using several predictive variables showed that oxygen saturation had the greatest and only significant effect on density-corrected richness. The relationship between richness and oxygen corrected for the effect of altitude (using analyses of double residuals) was significant, whereas that of richness versus temperature was not. The results indicate that the decrease in richness with increasing altitude is mainly caused by a decrease in oxygen saturation rather than by a decrease in temperature. Levels of oxygen saturation such as those found at high altitudes do not appear to be lethal to any species, but could affect macroinvertebrates through long-term, sub-lethal effects. I suggest that low oxygen availability may limit biodiversity at high altitudes not only in the aquatic, but also in the terrestrial environment.

AB A persistent challenge in ecology is to explain the high diversity of tree species in tropical forests. Although the role of species characteristics in maintaining tree diversity in tropical forests has been the subject of theory and debate for decades, spatial patterns in local diversity have not been analyzed from the viewpoint of individual species. To measure scale-dependent local diversity structures around individual species, we propose individual species - area relationships (ISAR), a spatial statistic that marries common species-area relationships with Ripley's K to measure the expected a diversity in circular neighborhoods with variable radius around an arbitrary individual of a target species. We use ISAR to investigate if and at which spatial scales individual species increase in tropical forests' local diversity (accumulators), decrease local diversity (repellers), or behave neutrally. Our analyses of data from Barro Colorado Island (Panama) and Sinharaja (Sri Lanka) reveal that individual species leave identifiable signatures on spatial diversity, but only on small spatial scales. Most species showed neutral behavior outside neighborhoods of 20 m. At short scales (< 20 m), we observed, depending on the forest type, two strongly different roles of species: diversity repellers dominated at Barro Colorado Island and accumulators at Sinharaja. Nevertheless, we find that the two tropical forests lacked any key species structuring species diversity at larger scales, suggesting that '' balanced '' species-species interactions may be a characteristic of these species-rich forests. We anticipate our analysis method will be a starting point for more powerful investigations of spatial structures in diversity to promote a better understanding of biodiversity in tropical forests.

AB Phylogeography is concerned with the observation, description and analysis of the spatial distribution of genotypes and the inference of historical scenarios. In the past, the discipline has concentrated on the historical 'phylo-' component through the utilization of phylogenetic analyses. In contrast, the spatial '-geographic' component is not a prominent feature of many existing phylogenetic approaches and has often been dealt with in a relatively naive fashion. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in the importance of geography in evolutionary biology. Thus, we believe that it is time to assess how geographic information is currently handled and incorporated into phylogeographical analysis. Geographical information systems (GISs) are computer systems that facilitate the integration and interrelation of different geographically referenced data sets; however, so far they have been little utilized by the phylogeographical community to manage, analyse and disseminate phylogeographical data. However, the growth in individual studies and the resurgence of interest in the geographical components of genetic pattern and biodiversity should stimulate further uptake. Some advantages of GIS are the integration of disparate data sets via georeferencing, dynamic data base design and update, visualization tools and data mining. An important step in linking GIS to existing phylogeographical and historical biogeographical analysis software and the dissemination of spatial phylogenies will be the establishment of 'GeoPhylo' data standards. We hope that this paper will further stimulate the resurgence of geography as an equal partner in the symbiosis that is phylogeography as well as advertise some benefits that can be obtained from the application of GIS practices and technologies.

AB The combined effects of rapid habitat loss, fragmentation and disturbance on tropical forest avifaunas have not been examined to date. The southern Amazonian 'arc of deforestation' marks the boundary of the most aggressive agricultural frontier in tropical forests worldwide. We sampled 21 disturbed and undisturbed primary forest patches, ranging in size from 1.2 to 14,476 ha, to elucidate the synergistic effects of both forest disturbance and fragmentation on bird community structure, and pinpoint which species were the "winners" and "losers" from this process. A number of forest patch metrics, derived from an independent remote sensing approach, explained much of the resulting presence/absence matrix. The bird community exhibited a highly nested structure, with small patches being most dissimilar from one another. Bird species differed in their response to both forest patch size and forest canopy perforation according to their dependence on closed-canopy primary forest. Forest patch geometry, which clearly modulated the shape of species-area relationships accounted for 83-96% of the variation in species richness, but forest habitat quality resulting from logging and surface-fire disturbance was also a significant predictor of species richness for the most forest-dependent taxa.

AB Aim We explored the relative contributions of climatic and land-cover factors in explaining the distribution patterns of butterflies in a boreal region.
   Location Finland, northern Europe.
   Methods Data from a national butterfly atlas survey carried out during 1991 2003, with a 10-km grain grid system, were used in these analyses. We used generalized additive models (GAM) and hierarchical partitioning (HP) to explore the main environmental correlates (climate and land-cover) of the realized niches of 98 butterfly species. The accuracy of the distribution models (GAMs) was validated by resubstitution and cross-validation approaches, using the area under the curve (AUC) derived from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots.
   Results Predictive accuracies of the 98 individual environment-butterfly models varied from low to very high (cross-validated AUC values 0.48-0.99), with a mean of 0.79. The results of both the GAM and HP analyses were broadly concordant. Most of the variation in butterfly distributions is associated with growing degree-days, mean temperature of the coldest month and cover of built-up area in all six phylogenetic groups (butterfly families). There were no statistically significant differences in predictive accuracy among the different butterfly families.
   Main conclusions About three-quarters of the distributions of butterfly species in Finland appear to be governed principally by climatic, predominantly temperature-related, factors. This indicates that many butterfly species may respond rapidly to the projected climate change in boreal regions. By determining the ecological niches of multiple species, we can project their range shifts in response to changes in climate and land-cover, and identify species that are particularly sensitive to forecasted global changes.

AB Biological diversity is quantified for reasons ranging from primer design, to bioprospecting, and community ecology. As a common index for all levels, we suggest Shannon's H-S, already used in information theory and biodiversity of ecological communities. Since Lewontin's first use of this index to describe human genetic variation, it has been used for variation of viruses, splice-junctions, and informativeness of pedigrees. However, until now there has been no theory to predict expected values of this index under given genetic and demographic conditions. We present a new null theory for H-S at the genetic level, and show that this index has advantages including (i) independence of measures at each hierarchical level of organization; (ii) robust estimation of genetic exchange over a wide range of conditions; (iii) ability to incorporate information on population size; and (iv) explicit relationship to standard statistical tests. Utilization of this index in conjunction with other existing indices offers powerful insights into genetic processes. Our genetic theory is also extendible to the ecological community level, and thus can aid the comparison and integration of diversity at the genetic and community levels, including the need for measures of community diversity that incorporate the genetic differentiation between species.

AB A novel, quantitative saturation (QS) scanning strategy was developed to obtain a comprehensive data base of the structural and functional effects of all possible mutations across a large protein-protein interface. The QS scan approach was applied to the high affinity site of human growth hormone (hGH) for binding to its receptor (hGHR). Although the published structure-function data base describing this system is probably the most extensive for any large protein-protein interface, it is nonetheless too sparse to accurately describe the nature of the energetics governing the interaction. Our comprehensive data base affords a complete view of the binding site and provides important new insights into the general principles underlying protein-protein interactions. The hGH binding interface is highly adaptable to mutations, but the nature of the tolerated mutations challenges generally accepted views about the evolutionary and biophysical pressures governing protein-protein interactions. Many substitutions that would be considered chemically conservative are not tolerated, while conversely, many non-conservative substitutions can be accommodated. Furthermore, conservation across species is a poor predictor of the chemical character of tolerated substitutions across the interface. Numerous deviations from generally accepted expectations indicate that mutational tolerance is highly context dependent and, furthermore, cannot be predicted by our current knowledge base. The type of data produced by the comprehensive QS scan can fill the gaps in the structure-function matrix. The compilation of analogous data bases from studies of other protein-protein interactions should greatly aid the development of computational methods for explaining and designing molecular recognition.

AB In Northern China, high-yielding aerobic rice varieties are released to farmers to grow rice as a supplementary-irrigated upland crop to cope with water scarcity. If the key factors contributing to the high yield of these varieties are understood, rapid advancements can be made in developing aerobic rice varieties for water-scarce environments in other parts of Asia. In 2001-2002, we conducted experiments with aerobic varieties HD502 and HD297 and lowland variety JD305 under aerobic and flooded conditions. Five irrigation treatments were implemented in aerobic soil to create different soil moisture regimes. Under flooded conditions, all three varieties had comparable radiation use (RUE) efficiencies of 2.09-2.26 g dry matter (DM) MJ(-1) in 2001 and 2.40-2.53 g DM MJ-1 in 2002, and harvest indices (HI) of 0.38-0.40 in both years. Differences in yield among the varieties are explained by differences in growth duration. Under aerobic conditions, mean RUE over water treatments dropped to 1.70-1.72 g DM MJ-1 for all three varieties in 2001, and to 1.62 for HD502, 1.71 for HD297 and 1.86 for JD305 in 2002. With increasing dryness of the soil, the amount of intercepted light decreased at about the same rate for all varieties, but RUE decreased faster in the lowland than in the two aerobic varieties. The HI of JD305 decreased dramatically with increasing soil dryness and reached values of 0.19-0.21 in 2002. In contrast, the HI of both aerobic varieties remained relatively high under aerobic conditions, with lowest values of 0.27-0.28 for HD297 and 0.34-0.35 for HD502 in 2002. The relatively high HI of the aerobic varieties compensated for their relatively short growth duration so that their yields were higher than that of JD305 in all treatments. A high percentage filled grains is a key factor contributing to the high HI of the aerobic varieties under aerobic conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Apparent source levels were calculated for 819 pulsed calls and 24 whistles produced by free-ranging resident killer whales by triangulating the angles-of-arrival of sounds on two beamforming arrays towed in series. Levels in the 1-20 kHz band ranged from 131 to 168 dB re 1 mu Pa at 1 m, with differences in the means of different sound classes (whistles: 140.2 +/- 4.1 dB; variable calls: 146.6 +/- 6.6 dB; stereotyped calls: 152.6 +/- 5.9 dB), and among stereotyped call types. Repertoire diversity carried through to estimates of active space, with "long-range" stereotyped calls all containing overlapping, independently-modulated high-frequency components (mean estimated active space of 10-16 km in sea state zero) and "short-range" sounds (5-9 km) included all stereotyped calls without a high-frequency component, whistles, and variable calls. Short-range sounds are reported to be more common during social and resting behaviors, while long-range stereotyped calls predominate in dispersed travel and foraging behaviors. These results suggest that variability in Sound pressure levels may reflect diverse social and ecological functions of the acoustic repertoire of killer whales.

AB Understanding the mechanisms causing latitudinal gradients in species richness and species range size is a central issue in ecology, particularly in the current context of global climate change. Different hypotheses have been put forward to explain these patterns, emphasizing climatic variability, energy availability and competition. Here we show, using a comparative analysis controlling for phylogeny on 234 temperate/boreal tree species, that these hypotheses can be included into a single framework in an attempt to explain latitudinal gradients in species range size. We find that species tend to have larger ranges when (i) closer to the poles, (ii) successionally seral, (iii) having small and light seeds, and (iv) having short generations. The patterns can simply be explained by energy constraints associated with different life-history strategies. Overall, these findings shed a new light on our understanding of species distribution and biodiversity patterns, bringing new insights into underlying large-scale evolutionary processes.

AB Picophytoplankton are a small or major component of the phytoplankton community and present in all oceanic systems, from pole to pole. They dominate in the low chlorophyll biomass areas, such as the (sub)tropical regions, but also contribute considerably (up to 20%) in the high chlorophyll biomass areas. The ecosystems of occurrence contrast significantly in physical and chemical settings. This includes a strongly mixed upper water column replete in nutrients as well as a strongly thermally stratified euphotic zone depleted in nutrients at the surface with a steep inverse light and nutrient gradient. These changes impose a strong impact on the composition of the picophytoplankton community but also on the biochemical and physiological properties of the species present. In particular, the pigmentation and cellular carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus quota and requirement will differ from a stratified compared to a well-mixed water column. As a result no characteristic values for the parameters required for this specific algal group in a global phytoplankton carbon model (the SWAMCO model, Lancelot et al. (2000), Deep-Sea Res. 1, 47, 162 1) can be given. In the present paper an inventory is made of the biochemical, physiological and photosynthetic parameters of two species of cyanobacteria (Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus) and the pico-size class fraction of the eukaryote phytoplankton component. Other groups of phytoplankton, such as diatoms, Trichodesmium, Phaeocystis and coccolithophorids, will be discussed in separate papers in this issue. This inventory is a mixture of laboratory experiments using well-defined algal populations as well as data derived from field surveys including a mixture of species. Where possible, the relevance of the parameters will be discussed in relation to the nature of the physico-chemical conditions of the area of occurrence. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Wildfires are often followed by severe, sediment-laden floods in burned catchments. In this study, we documented resistance and resilience of stream insect communities to repeated postfire flash floods in a 'burned stream'. We employed a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design, where communities in comparable reaches of a burned stream and a reference stream were sampled from 2 years before, to 6 years after, a crown wildfire in north-central New Mexico.
   2. The first 100-year flood following the 1996 Dome wildfire reduced total insect density and taxon richness to near zero in the burned stream. Despite showing low resistance, density returned rapidly to prefire levels because of colonisation by simuliids, chironomids and the mayfly Baetis tricaudatus. In general, taxa that were generalist feeders (collectors) with strong larval dispersal dominated communities in early postfire years with repeated, moderate flash floods.
   3. Taxon richness and community composition were less resilient to postfire hydrologic disturbances. Taxon richness did not recover until floods dampened 4 years after the fire. Despite hydrologic recovery, composition in the burned stream still differed from prefire and reference stream compositions after 6 years postfire. A unique assemblage, dominated by taxa with strong larval or adult dispersal, was established after flash floods abated. Specialist feeders (shredders and grazers) that were common in prefire years were reduced or absent in the postfire assemblage.
   4. Community succession in the burned stream was explained by the interaction between species traits, geographic barriers to colonisation and hydrologic conditions after the fire. Comparable changes in insect density, taxon richness, community composition and trait representation were not found in the reference stream, providing strong evidence that repeated postfire flash floods shaped community responses in the burned stream.

AB Artificial nest experiments have been used in an attempt to understand patterns of predation affecting natural nests. A growing body of literature suggests that neither relative rates nor patterns of predation are the same for artificial and natural nests. We studied nest predation and daily mortality rates and patterns at real and artificial ground and shrub nests to test the validity of artificial nest experiments. We monitored 1667 artificial and 344 natural nests, over seven trials, in three regions, across 58 sites in Ontario. We controlled for many of the factors thought to be responsible for previously reported differences between predation rates on natural and artificial nests. Although artificial nests in our study resembled natural nests, contained eggs of appropriate size, shape, and color of target bird species, and were placed in similar microhabitats as natural nests, the rates of predation on these nests did not parallel rates on natural nests for any region in terms of absolute rate or pattern. Predation rates on artificial nests did not vary between years, as they tended to for natural nests, and the magnitude of predation pressure on artificial ground nests compared with shrub nests did not show the same pattern as that on natural nests. In general, rates of predation on artificial nests were significantly bigger than on natural nests. Our results suggest that conclusions derived from artificial nest studies may be unfounded. Given that Many influential ideas in predation theory are based on results of artificial nest experiments, it may be time to redo these experiments with natural nests.

AB Temporal dynamics of insect communities in terrestrial habitat fragments have been rarely studied. Here it was tested whether immigration, extinction, and turnover of butterfly species change with area and isolation of 31 calcareous grasslands. The area ranged from 0.03 to 5.14 ha, the isolation index from 2,100 to 86,000 (edge-to-edge distance 55-1,894 m). In both study years (1996, 2000), the total number of individuals (16,466, 15,101) and species (60, 54) sampled across all sites were similar and number of species increased with area in both years indicating an equilibrium. Rates of extinction (38% for habitat specialists vs. 20% for generalists) and turnover (51% vs. 35%) were higher, and rates of immigration (11% vs. 30%) were lower for habitat specialists than for generalists. Extinction and turnover rates decreased with increasing fragment size for both specialist (n =25 species) and generalist (n =36) butterflies, but specialists showed a significantly steeper decrease with increasing fragment size than generalists. Immigration rates increased with area. As a result, species number of habitat specialists declined in small habitats but not in large habitats between 1996 and 2000. No significant impact of habitat isolation on the butterfly community was found. The data suggest that large habitat fragments are of special importance for the conservation of the specialized, most endangered butterfly species. Habitat isolation appears to be less important, as butterflies can cope with the habitat mosaic in our study region.

AB Habitat selection ("preference") models are widely used to manage fish and wildlife. Their use assumes that (1) habitat with high animal densities (highly selected habitat) is high quality habitat, and low densities indicate low quality habitat; and (2) animal populations respond positively to the availability of highly selected habitat. These assumptions are increasingly questioned but very difficult to test. We evaluated these assumptions in an individual-based model (IBM) of stream trout that reproduces many natural complexities and habitat selection behaviors. Trout in the IBM select habitat to maximize their potential fitness, a function of growth potential (including food competition) and mortality risks. We know each habitat cell's intrinsic habitat quality, the fitness potential a trout in the cell would experience in the absence of competition. There was no strong relation between fitness potential and the density of fish in the IBM; cells where fitness potential was high but density low were common for all age classes, and fitness potential was not proportional to density. This result was consistent at high and low abundance and high and low overall habitat quality. We developed a statistical model of trout density observed in the IBM as a function of the four habitat variables that vary among cells. We then tested the ability of modeled mean density to predict population response to habitat changes resulting from stream flow modification. Modeled density partially explained population response to flow, but only at flows near the flow at which the density model was developed, and not for groups (e.g., juveniles) experiencing strong competition for habitat. Modeled density predicted population response opposite that observed for age-0 trout and incorrectly predicted response of all age classes to major changes in flow. These results make sense if habitat selection is understood as an emergent property of (1) the mechanisms by which habitat affects fitness, (2) habitat availability, (3) population abundance and size structure, and (4) how, individuals compete with each other. We identified eight reasons why animal density may not reflect habitat quality and several inherent limitations of habitat selection modeling.

AB This study on the nightingale, Luscinia megarhynchos, is the first to examine both nocturnal and diurnal singing activity of mated and unmated males throughout a species' entire breeding cycle. Nocturnal song was sung mostly by unmated males. After pair formation, males ceased nocturnal singing and resumed it if their mate deserted. These results strongly suggest that nocturnal song of unmated males functions to attract a mate. Diurnal singing activity before females settled was low and did not predict future mating status. However, unmated males showed a continuous increase in diurnal singing activity until the end of the breeding cycle, but diurnal singing activity of mated males decreased after the egg-laying period. Mated males resumed nocturnal song for, on average, 3 nights during egg laying by their mates. This second period of nocturnal song coincided with the peak of diurnal singing activity. Such a high male singing effort during egg laying might allow the female to adjust her reproductive effort to male quality, deter rival males (e.g. through honest announcement of the female's fertility) or attract females for extrapair copulations.

AB Diatoms from the surface sediments of 61 lakes on Baffin Island, Nunavut, were identified, enumerated, and interpreted quantitatively. The samples span a latitudinal transect from 62 to 74 degreesN, reflecting climatic and vegetational gradients that range from low Arctic to transitional mid-Arctic to high Arctic. While the sampled lakes encompass both predominantly maritime and continental climatic regimes, sites have been deliberately restricted to basins in Precambrian crystalline terrain to mitigate the edaphic consequences of alkaline sedimentary bedrock. Canonical correspondence analysis, using forward selection and Monte Carlo permutation tests, identified pH, conductivity, summer lake water temperature, and mean annual air temperature as significant environmental controls over diatom assemblages. Using weighted-averaging regression and calibration, predictive models for these parameters have been developed. When applied to down-core assemblages, the summer lake water temperature model provides realistic reconstructions when compared with other paleoenvironmental records. Over the past 5000 years, the amplitude of reconstructed summer lake water temperature is on the order of 4.0 degreesC, expressed primarily as progressive Neoglacial cooling culminating in the Little Ice Age. Diatom-inferred summer water temperatures have increased by 2.0 degreesC in the past 150 years, again in agreement with independent paleoclimatic reconstructions.

AB 1 Associations between abiotic variables and patterns of species distribution and abundance are a major preoccupation of community ecologists. In many habitats, this association is manifest in discrete zones of vegetation.
   2 We used statistical methods to examine tree species distribution patterns in relatively undisturbed regions of the Sundarbans of Bangladesh. We tested the hypothesis that mangroves occur in discrete zones with respect to elevation. These data were gathered with explicit attention to local and regional differences in edaphic characteristics so that species-environment relationships could be analysed at several spatial scales.
   3 Correlations were also assessed between mangrove species composition and edaphic variables that co-vary with elevation, i.e. salinity, field capacity, cation exchange capacity, percentage silt, and mangrove physiognomic category (slope, basin, levee and flat).
   4 Quantitative statistical analysis using randomization techniques failed to detect species zonation along any of 33 individual 200-m transects, within 1-km(2) blocks, or within 1200-km(2) regions.
   5 Canonical correspondence analysis relating edaphic variables to species distributions accounted for a total of only 24% of the variance in species composition.
   6 Our data suggest that the absence of zonation in the Bangladesh Sundarbans reflects the underlying biology of the system and is not an artefact of long-term human disturbance.

AB Lianas, or woody climbing plants, are a major constituent of seasonally dry tropical forests, and are thought to impact negatively their host trees. In this study we evaluated whether liana presence was associated with reduced leaf water potentials and growth in adult Senna multijuga trees during the dry season in a lowland Bolivian forest. We used leaf water potentials in trees as a first approach to assess trees' water status, under the assumption that leaf water potentials become more negative when water losses (via transpiration) exceed gains (by uptake). We measured relative growth in girth at 1.5 m height (gbh) to quantify tree growth. At the beginning of the 1996 dry season (early June), we selected 20 S. multijuga trees 10-20 cm dbh, and measured their gbh. We also recorded pre-dawn and mid-day leaf water potentials in these trees. In ten experimental trees all lianas were then cut, while the remaining trees were used as controls. Pre-dawn and mid-day water potentials were re-measured 1 day after liana-cutting, and then every week in all trees for 1 month and then at 3 and 5 months, until the beginning of the next rainy season (November); gbh was measured again in July 1997 to estimate relative growth rate. Liana removal was associated with less negative pre-dawn (-0.3 vs -0.4 MPa) and mid-day (-0.5 vs -0.7 MPa) water potentials in trees during the dry season. This difference appeared as early as 1 day after cutting, and disappeared once the rainy season began. Liana-cut trees grew more (0.4 mm/mm year) than liana uncut trees (0.2 mm/mm year). These findings suggest that lianas may interfere with water availability to these trees during the dry season, and may also hinder tree growth.

ID CRUSTACEA
AB An extensive survey was undertaken of 117 (mostly helocrene-type) springs on the eastern Iberian Peninsula to generate an ostracod database of use for palaeoecological studies. For this purpose, the main physico-chemical parameters of the habitat, including water chemistry, temperature, pH and oxygen content, were recorded. Twenty-eight species, with an average of two species per site, were recorded. Some of these are new records for the Iberian Peninsula (Sarscypridopsis lanzarotensis and Paralimnocythere messanai). In addition, the presence in this area of several ran acid little-known species is validated. Autoecological traits, deduced by means of Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), have allowed the main habitat factors affecting the distribution of non-marine ostracods in this area to be determined. According to this analysis, four groups of springs, each one characterised by principal and secondary species, are distinguished: (1) Bicarbonate-rich springs with relatively low water temperature, low mineralisation and wet climate are characterised by Potamocypris zschokkei, Herpetocypris intermedia, and secondary species Ilyocypris bradyi, Ilyocypris inermis, Potamocypris villosa and Cyclocypris ovum. (2) Bicarbonate-rich springs with warm and oxygenated waters are characterised by Herpetocypris brevicaudata, S. lanzarotensis and Cypridopsis vidua as main species, and Notodromas persica, P. villosa and Cyclocypris ovum as secondary species. These latter two species are related to wetter climates and higher altitudes. (3) Bicarbonate-rich waters enriched with sulphate and/or chloride, also with warm water and often with high mineral content. Characteristic species are Paralimnocythere messanai, Ilyocypris gibba and Pseudocandona pratensis and secondary species Heterocypris incongruens, Heterocypris salina, Darwinula stevensoni, C. vidua, and Herpetocypris helenae (4) The last group is defined by brackish sulphate-rich and chlorinated waters with high temperature, and it is mainly composed of typical brackish species as Cyprideis torosa, Xestoleberis nitida or Loxoconcha elliptica. Secondary species are Sarscypridopsis cf. aculeata, Paralimnocythere psammophila, D. stevensoni and H. salina. The combination of biogeographical factors (i.e. latitude) and the relatively constant conditions of the springs (i.e. constant temperature) may explain the common occurrence of species which had previously been reported only in distant areas. S. lanzarotensis and P. messanai are examples of such species, their distributions were thought to be confined to the Canary Islands and the Italian Peninsula, respectively. Distinctive morphological carapace traits are provided for most species to facilitate the use of these ostracod species in the interpretation of past environments from sedimentary deposits.

AB Here we construct a fundamental mathematical theory of population dynamics in the context of the normalized spectra of abundance and biomass of plankton. The theory begins with the distribution function of abundance as a function of individual body weight and growth rate, and the law of the conservation of mass. The basic governing equations for population growth and biomass production are then deduced without empirical assumptions. The governing equations represent the fundamental mass balance between the biomass flux iron small to large sizes due to individual growth and the sum of sources and sinks such as birth, natural death and predation. The slope of the normalized biomass spectrum at steady state is proved to be approximately equal to the ratio of the intrinsic rate of increase in abundance to individual weight-specific growth rate. We demonstrate that measurements of biomass spectra in nature can be used to estimate population-dynamics parameters of individual growth rate and the intrinsic rate of increase. We further apply this population dynamics theory to data collected by an Optical Plankton Counter in the California Current region during June and July, 1993. These data cover a range in the marine biomass spectrum from 10(0) to 10(4) mu g C individual body weight.

AB The aim of this study was to determine the optimal temperature for growth and growth efficiency for different size-classes of immature halibut. In experiment A, lasting for 99 days, six groups of fish of initial mean weight 8 g were reared at 7.3, 10.0, and 12.8 degrees C, two replicates at each temperature. In experiment B, lasting for 216 days, six groups of fish of initial mean weight 140 g were oared at 5.0, 7.4, 9.0, 11.1, 13.0, and 14.9 degrees C. In experiment C, lasting for 189 days, six groups of fish of initial mean weight 2.9 kg were reared at 2.4, 4.6, 7.0, 9.8, 12.6, and 15.1 degrees C, The halibut were fed dry feed in experiments A and B, and fish (capelin and herring) in experiment C. In all three experiments growth rate and growth efficiency peaked at intermediate temperatures. Optimal temperature for growth decreased with increasing fish size, being approximately 14 degrees C for 10-60 g fish, 11.4 degrees C for 100-500 g fish and 9.7 degrees C for 3-5 kg fish. Optimal temperature for growth efficiency also decreased with increasing fish size, being approximately 14 degrees C for 10-60 g fish, 10.6 degrees C for 100-500 g fish and 5.5 degrees C for 3-5 kg fish. The dome-shaped relationships of growth rate and growth efficiency versus temperature became flatter with increased size of fish, suggesting that thermal sensitivity close to the optimum decreases as fish size increases.

AB We monitored nine butterfly communities with varying degrees of human disturbance by conducting a census twice a month during 1980 by the line transect method in and around Tsukuba City, central Japan. We analyzed the biodiversity and community structures using the generalist/specialist concept. The site (community) order based on decreasing human disturbance was positively correlated with butterfly species diversity (H'), species richness (the total number of species), and the number of specialist species in a community, but not with the number of generalist species. The number of generalist species was rather constant, irrespective of the degree of human disturbance. Thus, both the butterfly species diversity and species richness were more dependent on the specialists than the generalists. Our analyses also showed that the generalist species were distributed widely over the communities, and they maintained high population densities, resulting in high rank status in abundance in a community, with more spatial variation in density per species. Specialist species showed the opposite trends. These results demonstrate that the generalist/specialist concept is a powerful tool applicable to analyse the biodiversity and structure of natural communities.

AB To study topotecan-DNA interaction and topotecan determination with a modified carbon paste electrode (CPE), a new electrochemical biosensor is introduced. The biosensor was prepared through modification of a CPE with ionic liquid (IL), graphene quantum dots and double stranded DNA (ds-DNA). Compared to reported conventional DNA sensors, the modified electrode displayed high sensitivity and selectivity, respectable reproducibility and satisfactory stability. Moreover, the differential-pulse voltammetric (DPV) peak current was linear to topotecan concentration in the range of 0.35-100.0 mu M, with a detection limit (LOD) of 0.1 mu M. Applying the proposed method to determine topotecan in blood serum and urine, the use of this screening method for analyzing real sample was studied. In general, the results indicated that this DNA biosensor could be used for the fast, simple, sensitive, and cost effective determination of topotecan in urine and serum samples.

AB Recent progress in observing sun-induced Chl fluorescence (SIF) provides an unprecedented opportunity to advance photosynthesis research in natural environments. However, we still lack an analytical framework to guide SIF studies and integration with the well-developed active fluorescence approaches. Here, we derive a set of coupled fundamental equations to describe the dynamics of SIF and its relationship with C-3 and C-4 photosynthesis. These equations show that, although SIF is dynamically as complex as photosynthesis, the measured SIF simplifies photosynthetic modeling from the perspective of light reactions by integrating over the dynamic complexities of photosynthesis. Specifically, the measured SIF contains direct information about the actual electron transport from photosystem II to photosystem I, giving a quantifiable link between light and dark reactions. With much-reduced requirements on inputs and parameters, the light-reactions-centric, SIF-based biophysical model complements the traditional, dark-reactions-centric biochemical model of photosynthesis. The SIF-photosynthesis relationship, however, is nonlinear. This is because photosynthesis saturates at high light whereas SIF has a stronger tendency to keep increasing, as fluorescence quantum yield has a relatively muted sensitivity to light levels. Successful applications of the SIF-based model of photosynthesis will depend on a predictive understanding of several previously underexplored physiological and biophysical processes. Advances can be facilitated by coordinated efforts in plant physiology, remote sensing, and eddy covariance flux observations.

AB Phenotypic plasticity is a major mechanism of response to global change. However, current plastic responses will only remain adaptive under future conditions if informative environmental cues are still available. We briefly summarize current knowledge of the evolutionary origin and mechanistic underpinnings of environmental cues for phenotypic plasticity, before highlighting the potentially complex effects of global change on cue availability and reliability. We then illustrate some of these aspects with a case study, comparing plasticity of blue tit breeding phenology in two contrasted habitats: evergreen and deciduous forests. Using long-term datasets, we investigate the climatic factors linked to the breeding phenology of the birds and their main food source. Blue tits occupying different habitats differ extensively in the cues affecting laying date plasticity, as well as in the reliability of these cues as predictors of the putative driver of selective pressure, the date of caterpillar peak. The temporal trend for earlier laying date, detected only in the evergreen populations, is explained by increased temperature during their cue windows. Our results highlight the importance of integrating ecological mechanisms shaping variation in plasticity if we are to understand how global change will affect plasticity and its consequences for population biology.
   This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of plasticity in phenotypic adaptation to rapid environmental change'.

AB Plant hydraulic traits capture the impacts of drought stress on plant function, yet vegetation models lack sufficient information regarding trait coordination and variation with climate-of-origin across species. Here, we investigated key hydraulic and carbon economy traits of 12 woody species in Australia from a broad climatic gradient, with the aim of identifying the coordination among these traits and the role of climate in shaping cross-species trait variation. The influence of environmental variation was minimized by a common garden approach, allowing us to factor out the influence of environment on phenotypic variation across species. We found that hydraulic traits (leaf turgor loss point, stomatal sensitivity to drought [P-gs], xylem vulnerability to cavitation [P-x], and branch capacitance [C-branch]) were highly coordinated across species and strongly related to rainfall and aridity in the species native distributional range. In addition, trade-offs between drought tolerance and plant growth rate were observed across species. Collectively, these results provide critical insight into the coordination among hydraulic traits in modulating drought adaptation and will significantly advance our ability to predict drought vulnerability in these dominant trees species.

AB Increases in the severity and frequency of drought in a warming climate may negatively impact agricultural production and food security. Unlike previous studies that have estimated agricultural impacts of climate condition using single-crop yield distributions, we develop a multivariate probabilistic model that uses projected climatic conditions (e.g., precipitation amount or soil moisture) throughout a growing season to estimate the probability distribution of crop yields. We demonstrate the model by an analysis of the historical period 1980-2012, including the Millennium Drought in Australia (2001-2009). We find that precipitation and soil moisture deficit in dry growing seasons reduced the average annual yield of the five largest crops in Australia (wheat, broad beans, canola, lupine, and barley) by 25-45% relative to the wet growing seasons. Our model can thus produce region-and crop-specific agricultural sensitivities to climate conditions and variability. Probabilistic estimates of yield may help decision-makers in government and business to quantitatively assess the vulnerability of agriculture to climate variations. We develop a multivariate probabilistic model that uses precipitation to estimate the probability distribution of crop yields. The proposed model shows how the probability distribution of crop yield changes in response to droughts. During Australia's Millennium Drought precipitation and soil moisture deficit reduced the average annual yield of the five largest crops.

AB The extraordinary adaptations of birds to contend with atmospheric conditions during their migratory flights have captivated ecologists for decades. During the 21st century technological advances have sparked a revival of research into the influence of weather on migrating birds. Using biologging technology, flight behaviour is measured across entire flyways, weather radar networks quantify large-scale migratory fluxes, citizen scientists gather observations of migrant birds and mechanistic models are used to simulate migration in dynamic aerial environments. In this review, we first introduce the most relevant microscale, mesoscale and synoptic scale atmospheric phenomena from the point of view of a migrating bird. We then provide an overview of the individual responses of migrant birds (when, where and how to fly) in relation to these phenomena. We explore the cumulative impact of individual responses to weather during migration, and the consequences thereof for populations and migratory systems. In general, individual birds seem to have a much more flexible response to weather than previously thought, but we also note similarities in migratory behaviour across taxa. We propose various avenues for future research through which we expect to derive more fundamental insights into the influence of weather on the evolution of migratory behaviour and the life-history, population dynamics and species distributions of migrant birds.

AB Intergroup conflict is evident throughout the history of our species, ubiquitous across human societies, and considered crucial for the evolution of humans' large-scale cooperative nature. Like humans, chimpanzee societies exhibit intragroup coordination and coalitionary support during violent intergroup conflicts. In both species, cooperation among group members is essential for individuals to gain access to benefits from engaging in intergroup conflict. Studies suggest that a contributive mechanism regulating in-group cooperation during intergroup conflicts in humans involves the neuropeptide hormone oxytocin, known to influence trust, coordination, and social cognition, although evidence from natural settings is lacking. Here, applying a noninvasive method, we investigate oxytocinergic system involvement during natural intergroup conflicts in wild chimpanzees. We found that chimpanzees of both sexes had significantly higher urinary oxytocin levels immediately before and during intergroup conflict compared with controls. Also, elevated hormone levels were linked with greater cohesion during intergroup conflicts, rather than with the level of potential threat posed by rival groups, intragroup affiliative social interactions, or coordinated behavior alone. Thus, the oxytocinergic system, potentially engendering cohesion and cooperation when facing an out-group threat, may not be uniquely human but rather a mechanism with evolutionary roots shared by our last common ancestor with chimpanzees, likely expediting fitness gains during intergroup conflict.

AB Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) are probabilistic graphical models that can capture and integrate both quantitative and qualitative data, thus accommodating data-limited conditions. This paper systematically reviews applications of BBNs with respect to spatial factors, water domains, and the consideration of climate change impacts. The methods used for constructing and validating BBN models, and their applications in different forms of decision-making support are examined. Most reviewed publications originate from developed countries (70%), in temperate climate zones (42%), and focus mainly on water quality (42%). In 60% of the reviewed applications model validation was based on the expert or stakeholder evaluation and sensitivity analysis, and whilst in 27% model performance was not discussed. Most reviewed articles applied BBNs in strategic decision-making contexts (52%). Integrated modelling tools for addressing challenges of dynamically complex systems were also reviewed by analysing the strengths and weaknesses of BBNs, and integration of BBNs with other modelling tools.

AB The boom of massive parallel sequencing (MPS) technology and its applications in conservation of natural and managed populations brings new opportunities and challenges to meet the scientific questions that can be addressed. Genomic conservation offers a wide range of approaches and analytical techniques, with their respective strengths and weaknesses that rely on several implicit assumptions. However, finding the most suitable approaches and analysis regarding our scientific question are often difficult and time-consuming. To address this gap, a recent workshop entitled 'ConGen 2015' was held at Montana University in order to bring together the knowledge accumulated in this field and to provide training in conceptual and practical aspects of data analysis applied to the field of conservation and evolutionary genomics. Here, we summarize the expertise yield by each instructor that has led us to consider the importance of keeping in mind the scientific question from sampling to management practices along with the selection of appropriate genomics tools and bioinformatics challenges.

AB Global climate change is altering freshwater ecosystems and affecting fish populations and communities. Underpinning changes in fish distribution and assemblage-level responses to climate change are individual-level physiological constraints. In this review, we synthesize the mechanistic effects of climate change on neuroendocrine, cardiorespiratory, immune, osmoregulatory, and reproductive systems of freshwater and diadromous fishes. Observed climate change effects on physiological systems are varied and numerous, including exceedance of critical thermal tolerances, decreased cardiorespiratory performance, compromised immune function, and altered patterns of individual reproductive investment. However, effects vary widely among and within species because of species, population, and even sex-specific differences in sensitivity and resilience and because of habitat-specific variation in the magnitude of climate-related environmental change. Research on the interactive effects of climate change with other environmental stressors across a broader range of fish diversity is needed to further our understanding of climate change effects on fish physiology.

AB While an increasing number of indices for estimating the functional trait diversity of biological communities are being proposed, there is a growing demand by ecologists to clarify their actual implications and simplify index selection. Several key indices relate to mean trait dissimilarity between species within biological communities. Among them, the most widely used include (a) the mean species pairwise dissimilarity (MPD) and (b) the Rao quadratic entropy (and related indices). These indices are often regarded as redundant and promote the unsubstantiated yet widely held view that Rao is a form of MPD. Worryingly, existing R functions also do not always simplify the use and differentiation of these indices. In this paper, we show various distinctions between these two indices that warrant mathematical and biological consideration. We start by showing an existing form of MPD that considers species abundances and is different from Rao both mathematically and conceptually. We then show that the mathematical relationship between MPD and Rao can be presented simply as Rao = MPD x Simpson, where the Simpson diversity index is defined as 1 - dominance. We further show that this relationship is maintained for both species abundances and presence/absence. This evidence dismantles the paradigm that the Rao diversity is an abundance-weighted form of MPD and indicates that both indices can differ substantially at low species diversities. We discuss the different interpretations of trait diversity patterns in biological communities provided by Rao and MPD and then provide a simple R function, called "melodic," which avoids the unintended results that arise from existing mainstream functions.

AB Evaporation from wet canopies (E) can return up to half of incident rainfall back into the atmosphere and is a major cause of the difference in water use between forests and short vegetation. Canopy water budget measurements often suggest values of E during rainfall that are several times greater than those predicted from Penman-Monteith theory. Our literature review identified potential issues with both estimation approaches, producing several hypotheses that were tested using micrometeorological observations from 128 FLUXNET sites world-wide. The analysis shows that FLUXNET eddy-covariance measurements tend to provide unreliable measurements of E during rainfall. However, the other micrometeorological FLUXNET observations do provide clues as to why conventional Penman-Monteith applications underestimate E. Aerodynamic exchange rather than radiation often drives E during rainfall, and hence errors in air humidity measurement and aerodynamic conductance calculation have considerable impact. Furthermore, evaporative cooling promotes a downwards heat flux from the air aloft as well as from the biomass and soil; energy sources that are not always considered. Accounting for these factors leads to E estimates and modelled interception losses that are considerably higher. On the other hand, canopy water budget measurements can lead to overestimates of E due to spatial sampling errors in throughfall and stem-flow, underestimation of canopy rainfall storage capacity, and incorrect calculation of rainfall duration. There are remaining questions relating to horizontal advection from nearby dry areas, infrequent large-scale turbulence under stable atmospheric conditions, and the possible mechanical removal of splash droplets by such eddies. These questions have implications for catchment hydrology, rainfall recycling, land surface modelling, and the interpretation of eddy-covariance measurements. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB One of the most celebrated examples of sympatric speciation in nature are monophyletic radiations of cichlid fishes endemic to Cameroon crater lakes. However, phylogenetic inference of monophyly may not detect complex colonization histories involving some allopatric isolation, such as double invasions obscured by genome-wide gene flow. Population genomic approaches are better suited to test hypotheses of sympatric speciation in these cases. Here, we use comprehensive sampling from all four sympatric crater lake cichlid radiations in Cameroon and outgroups across Africa combined with next-generation sequencing to genotype tens of thousands of SNPs. We find considerable evidence of gene flow between all four radiations and neighboring riverine populations after initial colonization. In a few cases, some sympatric species are more closely related to outgroups than others, consistent with secondary gene flow facilitating their speciation. Our results do not rule out sympatric speciation in Cameroon cichlids, but rather reveal a complex history of speciation with gene flow, including allopatric and sympatric phases, resulting in both reproductively isolated species and incipient species complexes. The best remaining non-cichlid examples of sympatric speciation all involve assortative mating within microhabitats. We speculate that this feature may be necessary to complete the process of sympatric speciation in nature.

AB The ingestion of imidacloprid treated seeds by farmland birds may result in exposure to toxic amounts of this insecticide. Here we report on the effects that the exposure to the recommended application rate and to 20% of that rate may produce on birds feeding on treated seeds. Experimental exposure to imidacloprid treated seeds was performed on red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) (n=15 pairs per treatment group: control, 20% or 100% of the recommended application rate) during two periods that corresponded to the autumn (duration of exposure: 25 days) and late winter (10 days) cereal sowing times in Spanish farmlands. We studied effects on the survival, body condition, oxidative stress biomarkers, plasma biochemistry, carotenoid-based coloration, T-cell mediated immune response and reproduction of exposed adult partridges, and on the survival and T-cell immune response of their chicks. The high dose (recommended application rate) killed all partridges, with mortality occurring faster in females than in males. The low dose (20% the recommended application rate) had no effect on mortality, but reduced levels of plasma biochemistry parameters (glucose, magnesium and lactate dehydrogenase), increased blood superoxide dismutase activity, produced changes in carotenoid-based integument coloration, reduced the clutch size, delayed the first egg lay date, increased egg yolk vitamins and carotenoids and depressed T-cell immune response of chicks. Moreover, the analysis of the livers of dead partridges revealed an accumulation of imidacloprid during exposure time. Despite the moratorium on the use of neonicotinoids in the European Union, birds may still be at high risk of poisoning by these pesticides through direct sources of exposure to coated seeds in autumn and winter.

AB Hill numbers (or the "effective number of species'') are increasingly used to characterize species diversity of an assemblage. This work extends Hill numbers to incorporate species pairwise functional distances calculated from species traits. We derive a parametric class of functional Hill numbers, which quantify "the effective number of equally abundant and (functionally) equally distinct species'' in an assemblage. We also propose a class of mean functional diversity (per species), which quantifies the effective sum of functional distances between a fixed species to all other species. The product of the functional Hill number and the mean functional diversity thus quantifies the (total) functional diversity, i.e., the effective total distance between species of the assemblage. The three measures (functional Hill numbers, mean functional diversity and total functional diversity) quantify different aspects of species trait space, and all are based on species abundance and species pairwise functional distances. When all species are equally distinct, our functional Hill numbers reduce to ordinary Hill numbers. When species abundances are not considered or species are equally abundant, our total functional diversity reduces to the sum of all pairwise distances between species of an assemblage. The functional Hill numbers and the mean functional diversity both satisfy a replication principle, implying the total functional diversity satisfies a quadratic replication principle. When there are multiple assemblages defined by the investigator, each of the three measures of the pooled assemblage (gamma) can be multiplicatively decomposed into alpha and beta components, and the two components are independent. The resulting beta component measures pure functional differentiation among assemblages and can be further transformed to obtain several classes of normalized functional similarity (or differentiation) measures, including N-assemblage functional generalizations of the classic Jaccard, Sorensen, Horn and Morisita-Horn similarity indices. The proposed measures are applied to artificial and real data for illustration.

AB Climate change effects on growth rates of tropical trees may lead to alterations in carbon cycling of carbon-rich tropical forests. However, climate sensitivity of broad-leaved lowland tropical trees is poorly understood. Dendrochronology (tree-ring analysis) provides a powerful tool to study the relationship between tropical tree growth and annual climate variability. We aimed to establish climate-growth relationships for five annual-ring forming tree species, using ring-width data from 459 canopy and understory trees from a seasonal tropical forest in western Thailand. Based on 183/459 trees, chronologies with total lengths between 29 and 62 years were produced for four out of five species. Bootstrapped correlation analysis revealed that climate-growth responses were similar among these four species. Growth was significantly negatively correlated with current-year maximum and minimum temperatures, and positively correlated with dry-season precipitation levels. Negative correlations between growth and temperature may be attributed to a positive relationship between temperature and autotrophic respiration rates. The positive relationship between growth and dry-season precipitation levels likely reflects the strong water demand during leaf flush. Mixed-effect models yielded results that were consistent across species: a negative effect of current wet-season maximum temperatures on growth, but also additive positive effects of, for example, prior dry-season maximum temperatures. Our analyses showed that annual growth variability in tropical trees is determined by a combination of both temperature and precipitation variability. With rising temperature, the predominantly negative relationship between temperature and growth may imply decreasing growth rates of tropical trees as a result of global warming.

AB Due to the extreme variation of venom, which consequently results in drastically variable degrees of neutralization by CroFab antivenom, the management and treatment of envenoming by Crotalus oreganus helleri (the Southern Pacific Rattlesnake), one of the most medically significant snake species in all of North America, has been a clinician's nightmare. This snake has also been the subject of sensational news stories regarding supposed rapid (within the last few decades) evolution of its venom. This research demonstrates for the first time that variable evolutionary selection pressures sculpt the intraspecific molecular diversity of venom components in C. o. helleri. We show that myotoxic beta-defensin peptides (aka: crotamines/small basic myotoxic peptides) are secreted in large amounts by all populations. However, the mature toxin-encoding nucleotide regions evolve under the constraints of negative selection, likely as a result of their non-specific mode of action which doesn't enforce them to follow the regime of the classic predator prey chemical arms race. The hemorrhagic and tissue destroying snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) were secreted in larger amounts by the Catalina Island and Phelan rattlesnake populations, in moderate amounts in the Loma Linda population and in only trace levels by the Idyllwild population. Only the Idyllwild population in the San Jacinto Mountains contained potent presynaptic neurotoxic phospholipase A(2) complex characteristic of Mohave Rattlesnake (Crotalus scutulatus) and Neotropical Rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus terrificus). The derived heterodimeric lectin toxins characteristic of viper venoms, which exhibit a diversity of biological activities, including anticoagulation, agonism/antagonism of platelet activation, or procoagulation, appear to have evolved under extremely variable selection pressures. While most lectin alpha- and beta-chains evolved rapidly under the influence of positive Darwinian selection, the beta-chain lectin of the Catalina Island population appears to have evolved under the constraint of negative selection. Both lectin chains were conspicuously absent in both the proteomics and transcriptomics of the Idyllwild population. Thus, we not only highlight the tremendous biochemical diversity in C. o. venom-arsenal, but we also show that they experience remarkably variable strengths of evolutionary selection pressures, within each toxin class among populations and among toxin classes within each population. The mapping of geographical venom variation not only provides additional information regarding venom evolution, but also has direct medical implications by allowing prediction of the clinical effects of rattlesnake bites from different regions. Such information, however, also points to these highly variable venoms as being a rich source of novel toxins which may ultimately prove to be useful in drug design and development.
   Biological significance
   These results have direct implications for the treatment of envenomed patients.

AB Preventing and mitigating human-wildlife conflicts are a top conservation priority, particularly in India where wildlife and high densities of people co-occur. We surveyed 1972 households from 1371 villages in a 7449-km(2) area surrounding five reserves in the Western Ghats. Our observational study modeled self-reported crop and livestock loss and compensation access by households. Crop loss was reported by 64% of households and associated with growing cotton, sugarcane, coffee and rice. Livestock loss was reported by 15% of households, and associated with grazing animals inside reserves. Losses incurred by households varied across reserves, averaging INR Rs 23,010 for crop loss and Rs 5423 for livestock loss. Compensation receipt was reported by 31% of households, and associated with reporting loss to authorities and elephant related incidents. Overall, landscape estimated probability of crop loss was 0.91, livestock loss was 0.19 and compensation was 0.29. Common mitigation measures for crop protection were night watching (46%), fencing (34%) and scare devices (34%); and for livestock protection were closer watch on animals (7%), guard animals (3%) and fencing (2%). Among 13 reported mitigation measures, no individual measure appeared to be associated with lowering crop or livestock loss. Unexpectedly, reported losses were similar across all reserves with higher losses incurred by households closer to the reserves. We identified conflict hot spots and influential factors across five reserves to improve current management efforts directed at conflict prevention and mitigation, and this approach is extendable to other human-dominated wildlife rich landscapes.

AB 1. The mechanisms driving nonrandom assembly patterns in plant communities have long been of interest in ecological research. Competing ecological theories predict that coexisting species may either be more functionally dissimilar than expected by chance (with functional divergence' mainly reflecting niche differentiation) or be functionally more similar than expected (with functional convergence' reflecting either the outcome of environmental filtering or weaker-competitor exclusion effects). Assembly patterns are usually assessed at a single scale and disturbance regime, whereas considering different spatial scales and disturbance regimes may clarify the underlying assembly mechanisms.
   2. We tested the prediction that convergence and divergence are scale- and disturbance- dependent in grazed and abandoned species-rich dry grasslands within a 22km(2) landscape in south-eastern Sweden. Convergence and divergence were tested for plant species' traits and phylogenetic relationships at three nested spatial scales: within 412 plots (50x50cm, divided into 10x10cm subplots), within 117 grassland patches (from 0.02 to 11.63ha) and within the whole landscape (across patches).
   3. At the finest scale (10x10cm subplots within plots), coexisting species were more different than expected by chance (divergence), both functionally and phylogenetically, suggesting niche differentiation. At the intermediate scale (50x50cm plots within patches), coexisting species showed convergence, suggesting environmental filtering. No significant deviations from random expectations were detected at the broadest scale (patches within the 22km(2) landscape) - suggesting the prevalence of dispersal limitation at this scale. The fact that nonrandom patterns were particularly evident under grazed conditions is consistent with the prediction that assembly patterns are disturbance dependent.
   4. Synthesis. This study shows that multiple trait-based assembly processes operate simultaneously in species-rich communities, across spatial scales and disturbance regimes. The results support earlier theoretical predictions that divergence between coexisting species may be an important driver of community assembly, particularly at finer spatial scales, where species compete for the same local resources. In contrast, environmental filtering is expected at broader spatial scales, where species growing in particular environmental conditions share traits that are adaptive under those conditions. Within given habitat types, dispersal limitation may, however, override environmental filtering at increasing spatial scales of observation.

AB Next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS) have revolutionized biological research by significantly increasing data generation while simultaneously decreasing the time to data output. For many ecologists and evolutionary biologists, the research opportunities afforded by NGS are substantial; even for taxa lacking genomic resources, large-scale genome-level questions can now be addressed, opening up many new avenues of research. While rapid and massive sequencing afforded by NGS increases the scope and scale of many research objectives, whole genome sequencing is often unwarranted and unnecessarily complex for specific research questions. Recently developed targeted sequence enrichment, coupled with NGS, represents a beneficial strategy for enhancing data generation to answer questions in ecology and evolutionary biology. This marriage of technologies offers researchers a simple method to isolate and analyze a few to hundreds, or even thousands, of genes or genomic regions from few to many samples in a relatively efficient and effective manner. These strategies can be applied to questions at both the infra- and interspecific levels, including those involving parentage, gene flow, divergence, phylogenetics, reticulate evolution, and many more. Here we provide a brief overview of targeted sequence enrichment, and emphasize the power of this technology to increase our ability to address a wide range of questions of interest to ecologists and evolutionary biologists, particularly for those working with taxa for which few genomic resources are available.

AB Detailed comparative karyotype analyses have proved to be an important tool for taxonomy and for understanding chromosome evolution. The basic principle of cytotaxonomy is that closely related species share a more similar karyotype than less related ones. However, phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that some karyotype features are more often recurrent than previously thought, meaning that similarity is not all. Two other criticisms to the cytotaxonomical interpretation are intraspecific variation, traditionally neglected, and the interpretation of chromosomal alterations based only on classical structural changes, without any investigative support. Chromosome numbers and nuclear DNA content are among the most reliable and practical characters for cytotaxonomical analyses involving a large number of species, whereas chromosome mapping with molecular probes is more recommended for a restricted number of species. In both cases, a robust phylogenetic tree is necessary to understand the relationships between species and their karyotype evolution. Evolutionary inferences based only on putative karyological trends are no longer sustainable.

AB Urbanization has not only altered land cover types, but also changed acoustic environments to which animals must adapt or emigrate for effective communication. Although many studies have addressed the effects of urban noise on acoustic communication of vocal organisms, little work has been done to understand the acoustic characteristics and the interaction between biological and anthropogenic sounds across urban-rural landscapes. The objectives of this study were to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of soundscape characteristics along an urban-rural gradient, and how soundscape properties are related to avian species community. We established 17 locations across the city of Lansing, Michigan from February to December 2006 to record environmental sounds. A multilevel regression model (MLRM) was used to understand the variability of acoustic power of biological and anthropogenic sounds (biophony and anthrophony) with temporal and spatial data structures. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was employed to investigate how bird species respond along an environmental gradient.
   We found that soundscape characteristics were associated with the structure and composition of urban-rural landscapes. Biophony was inversely correlated with anthrophony along an urban-rural gradient. The results of the MLRM showed that the acoustic variability of biophony and anthrophony were associated with landscape attributes. The CCA revealed that the distribution of bird species was significantly related to the percent area of different land cover types. The study suggests that recording acoustic characteristics in urban systems can offer opportunities to not only measure ambient noise levels, but also understand how each component of soundscape is related to another.

AB People who were small at birth and had poor infant growth have an increased risk of adult cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and type 2 diabetes, particularly if their restricted early growth was followed by increased childhood weight gain. These relations extend across the normal range of birth size in a graded manner, so reduced size is not a prerequisite. In addition, larger birth size is associated with risks of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The associations appear to reflect developmental plastic responses made by the fetus and infant based on cues about the environment, influenced by maternal characteristics including diet, body composition, stress, and exercise levels. These responses involve epigenetic processes that modify the offspring's phenotype. Vulnerability to ill health results if the environment in infancy, childhood, and later life is mismatched to the phenotype induced in development, informed by the developmental cues. This mismatch may arise through unbalanced diet or body composition of the mother or a change in lifestyle factors between generations. These insights offer new possibilities for the early diagnosis and prevention of chronic disease.

AB After several decades during which applied statistical inference in research on animal behaviour and behavioural ecology has been heavily dominated by null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), a new approach based on information theoretic (IT) criteria has recently become increasingly popular, and occasionally, it has been considered to be generally superior to conventional NHST. In this commentary, I discuss some limitations the IT-based method may have under certain circumstances. In addition, I reviewed some recent articles published in the fields of animal behaviour and behavioural ecology and point to some common failures, misunderstandings and issues frequently appearing in the practical application of IT-based methods. Based on this, I give some hints about how to avoid common pitfalls in the application of IT-based inference, when to choose one or the other approach and discuss under which circumstances a mixing of the two approaches might be appropriate.

AB Lake eutrophication is influenced by both anthropogenic and natural factors. Few studies have examined relationships between eutrophication parameters and natural factors at a large spatial scale. This study explored these relationships using data from 103 lakes across China. Eutrophication parameters including total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), TN:TP ratio, chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), Secchi depth (SD), and trophic state index (TSI) were collected for the period 2001-2005. Sixteen natural factors included three of geographic location, five of lake morphology, and eight of climate variables. Pearson correlation analysis showed that TP and TSI were negatively related to elevation, lake depth, and lake volume, and positively related to longitude. All eutrophication parameters, except for CODMn and Chl-a, showed no significant correlation with climate variables. Multiple regression analyses indicated that natural factors together accounted for 13-58% of the variance in eutrophication parameters. When the 103 study lakes were classified into different groups based on longitude and elevation, regression analyses demonstrated that natural factors explained more variance in TN, TP, CODMn, Chl-a, and TSI in western lakes than in eastern lakes. Lake depth, volume, elevation, and mean annual precipitation were the main predictors of eutrophication parameters for different lake groups. Although anthropogenic impacts such as point- and nonpoint-source pollution are considered as the main determinants of lake eutrophication, our results suggest that some natural factors that reflect lake buffer capacity to nutrient inputs can also play important roles in explaining the eutrophication status of Chinese lakes.

AB P>1. Studying the spatial pattern of plants may provide significant insights into processes and mechanisms that maintain species richness. We used data from a fully mapped 25-ha temperate forest plot at Changbaishan (CBS), north-eastern China, to conduct a community-wide assessment of the type and frequency of intra- and interspecific spatial association patterns. We analysed complex scale effects in the patterning of large trees of 15 common species. First, we tested for overall spatial patterning at 6, 30 and 50 m neighbourhoods and classified the types of bivariate association patterns at these spatial scales (analysis 1). We then explored small-scale (0-20 m) association patterns conditioning on the larger-scale pattern (analysis 2) and tested for positive large-scale (50-250 m) association patterns (analysis 3).
   2. Analysis 1 provided ample evidence for non-random spatial patterning, and the type and frequency of spatial association patterns changed with scale. Trees of most species pairs co-occurred less than expected by chance and positive associations were rare in local neighbourhoods. Analysis 2 revealed a separation of scales in which significant small-scale interactions faded away at distances of 10-15 m. One third of all species pairs showed significant and mostly negative bivariate small-scale association, which occurred more often than expected by chance between species sharing attributes such as family, fruit type and habitat association. This suggests the occurrence of competitive interactions. Analysis 3 showed that only 8% of all species pairs co-occurred at large scales.
   3. Comparison of our results with an analogous study conducted in the species-rich tropical forest at Sinharaja, Sri Lanka, revealed several structural similarities including the dominance of segregation and partial overlap in the overall patterning (analysis 1) and the separation of scales (analysis 2). However, species pairs at CBS showed considerably more significant negative small-scale associations (31% vs. 6% at Sinharaja).
   4. Synthesis. The techniques presented here allow for a detailed analysis of the complex spatial associations in species-rich forests and have the potential to reveal indicative patterns that may allow researchers to discriminate among competing hypotheses of community assemblage and dynamics. However, this will require comparative studies involving a large number of plots.

AB 1. The provision of environmental flows and the removal of barriers to water flow are high priorities for restoration where changes to flow regimes have caused degradation of riverine ecosystems. Nevertheless, flow regulation is often accompanied by changes in catchment and riparian land-use, which also can have major impacts on river health via local habitat degradation or modification of stream energy regimes.
   2. The challenges are determining the relative importance of flow, land-use and other impacts as well as deciding where to focus restoration effort. As a consequence, flow, catchment and riparian restoration efforts are often addressed in isolation. River managers need decision support tools to assess which flow and catchment interventions are most likely to succeed and, importantly, which are cost-effective.
   3. Bayesian networks (BNs) can be used as a decision support tool for considering the influence of multiple stressors on aquatic ecosystems and the relative benefits of various restoration options. We provide simple illustrative examples of how BNs can address specific river restoration goals and assist with the prioritisation of flow and catchment restoration options. This includes the use of cost and utility functions to assist decision makers in their choice of potential management interventions.
   4. A BN approach facilitates the development of conceptual models of likely cause and effect relationships between flow regime, land-use and river conditions and provides an interactive tool to explore the relative benefits of various restoration options. When combined with information on the costs and expected benefits of intervention, one can derive recommendations about the best restoration option to adopt given the network structure and the associated cost and utility functions.

AB A major question in our understanding of eukaryotic biodiversity is whether small bodied taxa have cosmopolitan distributions or consist of geographically localized cryptic taxa. Here, we explore the global phylogeography of the freshwater cladoceran Polyphemus pediculus (Linnaeus, 1761) (Crustacea, Onychopoda) using two mitochondrial genes, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and 16s ribosomal RNA, and one nuclear marker, 18s ribosomal RNA. The results of neighbour-joining and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses reveal an exceptionally pronounced genetic structure at both inter- and intra-continental scales. The presence of well-supported, deeply divergent phylogroups across the Holarctic suggests that P. pediculus represents an assemblage of at least nine, largely allopatric cryptic species. Interestingly, all phylogenetic analyses support the reciprocal paraphyly of Nearctic and Palaearctic clades. Bayesian inference of ancestral distributions suggests that P. pediculus originated in North America or East Asia and that European lineages of Polyphemus were established by subsequent intercontinental dispersal events from North America. Japan and the Russian Far East harbour exceptionally high levels of genetic diversity at both regional and local scales. In contrast, little genetic subdivision is apparent across the formerly glaciated regions of Europe and North America, areas that historical demographic analyses suggest that were recolonized just 5500-24 000 years ago.

AB Pseudoreplication is one of the most influential methodological issues in ecological and animal behavior research today. At its inception, the idea of pseudoreplication highlighted important concerns about the design and analysis of experiments in ecology. The doctrine purported to provide a unified view of experimental design and analysis, wherein precise criteria Could be used to assess manuscripts and research proposals for acceptance or rejection. Few methodological doctrines have had its much impact as pseudoreplication, yet there has been very little critical analysis of it. In this paper, the authors extend the growing criticism of the concept of pseudoreplication. The authors argue that the core ideas behind pseudoreplication are based on a misunderstanding of statistical independence, the nature of control groups in science, and contexts of statistical inference. The authors also highlight how other areas of research have found and responded to similar issues in the design and analysis of experiments through the use of more advanced statistical methods. Ultimately. there are no universal criteria for accepting or rejecting experimental research; all research must be judged on its own merits.

AB Habitat quality is typically inferred by assuming a direct relationship between consumer density and resource abundance, although it has been suggested that consumer fitness may be a more accurate measure of habitat quality. We examined density vs. fitness-based measures of habitat quality for lions in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. A 40-year average of female reproductive success (yearling cubs per female) was best explained by proximity to river confluences, whereas patterns of productivity (yearling cubs per km<SU2</SU) and adult female density (individuals per km<SU2</SU) were associated with more general measures of habitat quality and areas of shelter in poor habitat. This suggests that density may not accurately distinguish between high-quality 'source' areas and low-quality sites that merely provide refuges for effectively non-reproductive individuals. Our results indicate that density may be a misleading indicator of real estate value, particularly for populations that do not conform to an ideal free distribution.

AB Non-native invasive plants can greatly alter community and ecosystem properties, but efforts to predict which invasive species have the greatest impacts on these properties have been generally unsuccessful. An hypothesis that has considerable promise for predicting the effects of invasive non-native plant species is the mass ratio hypothesis (i.e. that dominant species exert the strongest effects). We tested this hypothesis using data from a four year removal experiment in which the presence of two dominant shrub species (one native and the other not), and subordinate plant species, were manipulated in factorial combinations over four years in a primary successional floodplain system. We measured the effects of these manipulations on the plant community, soil nutrient status and soil biota in different trophic levels of the soil food web. Our experiment showed that after four years, low-biomass non-native plant species exerted disproportionate belowground effects relative to their contribution to total biomass in the plant community, most notably by increasing soil C, soil microbial biomass, altering soil microbial community structure and increasing the abundance of microbial-feeding and predatory nematodes. Low-biomass, non-native plant species had distinct life history strategies and foliar traits (higher foliar N concentrations and higher leaf area per unit mass) compared with the two dominant shrub species (97% of total plant mass). Our results have several implications for understanding species' effects in communities and on soil properties. First, high-biomass species do not necessarily exert the largest impacts on community or soil properties. Second, low-biomass, inconspicuous non-native species can influence community composition and have important trophic consequences belowground through effects on soil nutrient status or resource availability to soil biota. Our finding that low-biomass non-native species influence belowground community structure and soil properties more profoundly than dominant species demonstrates that the mass ratio hypothesis does not accurately predict the relative effects of different coexisting species on community- and ecosystem-level properties.

AB Detection of hybridization and introgression in wild populations that have been supplemented by hatchery fish is necessary during development of conservation and management strategies. Initially, allozyme data and more recently highly polymorphic microsatellite markers have been used to obtain this information. We used both markers to assess the effectiveness of four assignment methods (STRUCTURE, NEWHYBRIDS, BAPS and GeneClass) to detect hatchery introgression in wild stocked populations. Simulations of hybrid genotypes from real parental data revealed that the number and type of markers used with STRUCTURE, NEWHYBRIDS and BAPS can identify as admixed most first and second generation hybrids as well as first generation backcrosses. In wild populations, introgression rates estimated from different markers and methods were correlated. However, slight disagreements were observed at both population and individual levels. Overall, the fully Bayesian (STRUCTURE, NEWHYBRIDS and BAPS) performed better than partially Bayesian (GeneClass) assignment tests. In wild collections, BAPS analyses were limited because of the lack of a native baseline. In all cases, the efficiency of methods was reduced as introgression increased.

AB There is an increasing need and interest in including indicators of landscape fragmentation in monitoring systems of sustainable landscape management. Landscape fragmentation due to transportation infrastructure and urban development threatens human and environmental well-being by noise and pollution from traffic, reducing the size and viability of wildlife Populations, facilitating the spread of invasive species, and impairing the scenic and recreational qualities of the landscape. This paper provides the rationale, method, and data for including landscape fragmentation in monitoring systems, using as an example the Swiss Monitoring System of Sustainable Development (MONET). We defined and compared four levels of fragmentation analysis, Or fragmentation geometries (FGs), each based on different fragmenting elements, e.g., only anthropogenic, or combinations of anthropogenic and natural elements. As each FG has specific strengths and weaknesses, the most appropriate choice of FG depends on the context and objectives of a study. We present data on the current degree of landscape fragmentation for the five ecoregions and 26 cantons in Switzerland for all four FGs. Our results show that the degree of landscape fragmentation as quantified by the effective mesh size method is strongly supported by the postulates and indicator selection criteria Of MONET, and we identify the most suitable FG focusing on the land area below 2100 m (e.g., excluding lakes) and allowing for an equitable comparison of fragmentation degrees among regions that differ in area covered by lakes and high mountains. For a more detailed analysis of landscape fragmentation in the context of environmental impact assessments and strategic environmental assessments, a combination of all four FGs may provide a more informative tool than any single FG.

AB In Mediterranean ecosystems, forest fires are a common phenomenon. They involve the transformation of vegetation and litter, leaving charred residues and so influencing the carbon cycle by changing (a) the amounts of soil organic matter and (b) the proportions within it of pools with differing stability. In addition to affecting C cycles, fires also affect the amounts of N within soil organic matter, and its availability.
   Because of the difficulties associated with solvent-based methods for the investigation of char and other highly stable carbon forms within soil, physical methods based on pyrolysis have several advantages. We have used thermal analysis coupled with on-line analysis of evolved gas species to determine the proportions of soil organic matter of differing stability and the pattern of evolution of gaseous nitrogen-bearing species during heating. Burnt soil clearly has a lower content of labile organic matter than unburnt soil, and nitrogen is closely associated with more stable forms of soil organic matter.
   Using the decomposition temperatures observed from TG, triple shot pyrolysis-GC/MS shows clear differences between the molecular composition of burnt and unburnt samples. At 340 degrees C, the unburnt soil has a diverse content of polysaccharide-derived and aliphatic compounds, while the burnt soil yields only two furan compounds. At 520 degrees C, alkyl and aromatic compounds are observed, including PAHs from the burnt soil. The 600 degrees C shot is dominated by aromatic compounds, with no differences between burnt and unburnt samples.
   Taken together, the results of elemental analysis, TG-DSC-QMS and pyrolysis-GC/MS are a very helpful tools in the deciphering of changes in the soil organic matter Properties, specifically the main changes observed are (a) to increase the proportion of thermally-stable components, and (b) to increase the proportion of nitrogen relative to C through the development of thermally stable heterocyclic N.

TI Using supernetworks to distinguish hybridization from lineage-sorting
SO BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY

DT Article
ID RETICULATE EVOLUTION; CONSENSUS NETWORKS; GENE; HYPOTHESES; RADIATION;
   TREES
AB Background: A simple and widely used approach for detecting hybridization in phylogenies is to reconstruct gene trees from independent gene loci, and to look for gene tree incongruence. However, this approach may be confounded by factors such as poor taxon-sampling and/or incomplete lineage-sorting.
   Results: Using coalescent simulations, we investigated the potential of supernetwork methods to differentiate between gene tree incongruence arising from taxon sampling and incomplete lineage-sorting as opposed to hybridization. For few hybridization events, a large number of independent loci, and well-sampled taxa across these loci, we found that it was possible to distinguish incomplete lineage-sorting from hybridization using the filtered Z-closure and Q-imputation supernetwork methods. Moreover, we found that the choice of supernetwork method was less important than the choice of filtering, and that count-based filtering was the most effective filtering technique.
   Conclusion: Filtered supernetworks provide a tool for detecting and identifying hybridization events in phylogenies, a tool that should become increasingly useful in light of current genome sequencing initiatives and the ease with which large numbers of independent gene loci can be determined using new generation sequencing technologies.

AB Under a particular set of selective forces, specific combinations of traits (strategies) will be favored in a given population, within the particular constraints of the considered species. For fishes, three demographic strategies have been suggested to result from adaptive responses to environmental predictability (i.e., seasonality): periodic, opportunistic and equilibrium [Winemiller KO, Rose KA (1992) Patterns of life-history diversification in North American fishes: implications for population regulation. Can J Fish Aquat Sci 49:2196-2218]. These strategies optimize fitness within predictable, unpredictable and stable systems, respectively. We tested these predictions of life history trait distribution along a gradient of hydrologic seasonality in West African tropical rivers at the drainage basin scale. We used logistic regression of species presence-absence data to test whether dominant life history traits of species caused community compositional change in response to a gradient of seasonality in hydrologic regime across basins. After accounting for taxonomic relatedness, species body size and statistical redundancy inherent to related traits, we found a higher proportion of species producing a great number of small oocytes, reproducing within a short period of time and presenting a low degree of parental care (the periodic strategy) in highly seasonal drainage basins (e.g., rivers with a short and predictable favorable season). Conversely, in more stable drainage basins (e.g., rivers with a wet season of several months), we observed a greater proportion of species producing small numbers of large oocytes, reproducing within a long period of time and providing parental care to their offspring (the equilibrium strategy). Our results suggest that distributions of tropical freshwater fishes at the drainage basin scale can be partly explained by the match between life history strategies and seasonality gradients in hydrological conditions.

AB Agricultural environments are critical to the conservation of biota throughout the world: Efforts to identify key influences on the conservation status of fauna in such environments have taken complementary approaches. Many studies have focused on the role of remnant or seminatural vegetation and emphasized the influence on biota of spatial patterns in the landscape. Others have recognized that many species use diverse "countryside" elements within farmland, and emphasize the benefits of landscape heterogeneity for conservation. Here, we investigated the effect of independent measures of both the spatial pattern (extent and configuration) and heterogeneity of elements (i.e., land uses/vegetation types) on bird occurrence in farm-scale agricultural mosaics in southeastern Australia. Birds were sampled in all types of elements in 27 mosaics (each I X I km) selected to incorporate variation in cover of native vegetation and the number of different element,types in the mosaic. We used an information-theoretic approach to identify the mosaic properties that most strongly influenced bird species richness. Subgroups of birds based on habitat requirements responded most strongly to the extent of preferred elements in mosaics. Woodland birds were richer in mosaics with higher cover of native vegetation while open-tolerant species responded to the extent of scattered trees. In contrast, for total species richness, mosaic heterogeneity (richness of element types) and landscape context (cover of native vegetation in surrounding area) had the greatest influence. These results showed that up to 76%, of landscape-level variation in richness of bird groups is attributable to mosaic properties directly amenable to management by landowners. Key implications include (1) conservation goals for farm landscapes must be carefully defined because the richness of different faunal components is influenced by different mosaic properties; (2) the extent of native vegetation is a critical influence in agricultural environments because it drives the farm-scale richness of woodland birds and has a broader context effect on total bird richness in mosaics; (3) land-use practices that enhance the heterogeneity of farmland mosaics are beneficial for native birds; and (4) the cumulative effect of even small elements in farm mosaics contribute to the structural properties of entire landscapes.

AB Models for the development of species distribution in Europe typically invoke restriction in three temperate Mediterranean refugia during glaciations, from where recolonization of central and northern Europe occurred. The brown bear, Ursus arctos, is one of the taxa from which this model is derived. Sequence data generated from brown bear fossils show a complex phylogeographical history for western European populations. Long-term isolation in separate refugia is not required to explain our data when considering the palaeontological distribution of brown bears. We propose continuous gene flow across southern Europe, from which brown bear populations expanded after the last glaciation.

AB Knowledge of cross-transmission and hybridization between parasites of humans and reservoir hosts is critical for understanding the evolution of the parasite and for implementing control programmes. There is now a consensus that populations of pig and human Ascaris ( roundworms) show significant genetic subdivision. However, it is unclear whether this has resulted from a single or multiple host shift( s). Furthermore, previous molecular data have not been sufficient to determine whether sympatric populations of human and pig Ascaris can exchange genes. To disentangle patterns of host colonization and hybridization, we used 23 microsatellite loci to conduct Bayesian clustering analyses of individual worms collected from pigs and humans. We observed strong differentiation between populations which was primarily driven by geography, with secondary differentiation resulting from host affiliation within locations. This pattern is consistent with multiple host colonization events. However, there is low support for the short internal branches of the dendrograms. In part, the relationships among clusters may result from current hybridization among sympatric human and pig roundworms. Indeed, congruence in three Bayesian methods indicated that 4 and 7% of roundworms sampled from Guatemala and China, respectively, were hybrids. These results indicate that there is contemporary cross-transmission between populations of human and pig Ascaris.

AB Genetically identical animals are very much in demand as laboratory objects because they allow conclusions about environmental and epigenetic effects on development, structures, and behavior. Furthermore, questions about the relative fitness of various genotypes can be addressed. However, genetically identical animals are relatively rare, in particular, organisms that combine a high reproduction rate and a complex organization. Based on its exclusively parthenogenetic reproduction mode, it has been suggested that the Marmorkrebs (Crustacea, Decapoda, Astacida), a recently discovered crayfish, is an excellent candidate for research addressing the aforementioned questions. However, until now, a study using molecular markers that clearly proves the genetic uniformity of the offspring has been lacking. Here, with this first molecular study, we show that this crayfish indeed produces genetically uniform clones. We tested this with 19 related individuals of various generations of a Marmorkrebs population by means of six different microsatellite markers. We found that all examined specimens were identical in their allelic composition. Furthermore, half of the analyzed loci were heterozygous. These results and the absence of meioses in previous histological studies of the ovaries lead us to conclude the Marmorkrebs propagates apomictically. Thus, a genetically uniform organism with complex morphology, development, and behavior is now available for various laboratory studies.

AB The constraining effect of gene flow on adaptive divergence is often inferred but rarely quantified. We illustrate ways of doing so using stream populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) that experience different levels of gene flow from a parapatric lake population. In the Misty Lake watershed (British Columbia, Canada), the inlet stream population is morphologically divergent from the lake population, and presumably experiences little gene flow from the lake. The outlet stream population, however, shows an intermediate phenotype and may experience more gene flow from the lake. We first used microsatellite data to demonstrate that gene flow from the lake is low into the inlet but high into the outlet, and that gene flow from the lake remains relatively constant with distance along the outlet. We next combined gene flow data with morphological and habitat data to quantify the effect of gene flow on morphological divergence. In one approach, we assumed that inlet stickleback manifest well-adapted phenotypic trait values not constrained by gene flow. We then calculated the deviation between the observed and expected phenotypes for a given habitat in the outlet. In a second approach, we parameterized a quantitative genetic model of adaptive divergence. Both approaches suggest a large impact of gene flow, constraining adaptation by 80-86% in the outlet (i.e., only 14-20% of the expected morphological divergence in the absence of gene flow was observed). Such approaches may be useful in other taxa to estimate how important gene flow is in constraining adaptive divergence in nature.

AB Quantification of the magnitude of net terrestrial carbon (C) uptake, and how it varies inter-anually, is an important question with future potential sequestration influenced by both increased atmospheric CO2 and changing climate. However the assessment of differences in measured and modeled C accumulation is a challenging task due to the significant fine scale variation occurring in terrestrial productivity due to soil, climate and vegetation characteristics as well as difficultie,s in measuring carbon accumulation over large spatial areas. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) offers a means of monitoring gross primary production (GPP), both spatially and temporally, routinely from space. However it is critical to compare and contrast the temporal dynamics of the C and water fluxes with those measured from ground-based networks, or estimated using physiological models. In this paper, using a number of approaches, our objective is to determine if any systematic biases exists in either the MODIS, or the modeled estimates of fluxes, relative to the measurements made over an evergreen, needleleaf temperate rainforest on Vancouver Island, Canada. Results indicate that 8-day GPP as predicted with a simple physiological model (3PGS), forced using local meteorology and canopy characteristics, matched measured fluxes very well (r(2)-0.86, p < 0.001) with no significant difference between eddy covariance (EC) and modeled GPP (p < 0.001). In addition, modeled water supply closely matched measured relative available soil water content at the site. Using canopy characteristics from the MODIS fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (WAR) algorithm, slightly reduced the correspondence of the predictions due to a large number of unsuccessful retrievals (83%) due to sun angle, snow and cloud. Predictions of GPP based on the MODIS GPP algorithm, forced using local meteorology and canopy characteristics, were also highly correlated with EC measurements (r(2) = 0.88, p < 0.001) however these estimates were biased under predicting GPP. Estimates of GPP based on the most recent MODIS reprocessing (collection 4.5) remained highly correlated (r(2)=0.88, p < 0.001) yet were also the most biased with the estimates being 30% less than the EC-measured GPP. Most of the variance in GPP at the site was explained by the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation. We also compared the nighttime respiration as measured over 2 years at the site with the minimum 8-day MODIS land surface temperature and found a significant relationship (r(2)=0.57), similar to other studies.

AB Fire profoundly modifies the terrestrial C cycle of about 40% of the Earth's land surface. The immediate effect of fire is that of a net loss of C as CO2 gas and soot particles to the atmosphere. Nevertheless, a proportion of the ecosystem biomass is converted into charcoal, which contains highly recalcitrant molecular structures that contribute to long-term C storage. The present study aimed to assess simultaneously losses to the atmosphere and charcoal production rates of C and N compounds as a result of prescription fire in a Florida scrub-oak ecosystem. Pre-fire and post-fire charred and unburned organic matter stocks were determined for vegetation leaves and stems, litter and soil in 20 sub-plots installed in a 30-ha area that was subjected to prescribed fire. Concentrations of C and N were determined, and fluxes among pools and to the atmosphere were derived from these measurements. Soil C and N stocks were unchanged by the fire. Post-fire standing dead biomass contained 30% and 12% of pre-fire vegetation C and N stocks, respectively. In litter, post-fire stocks contained 64% and 83% of pre-fire C and N stocks, respectively. Most of the difference in relative losses between vegetation and litter could be attributed to substantial litter fall of charred and unburned leaves during the fire event. Indeed, an estimated 21% of pre-fire vegetation leaf C was found in the post-fire litter, while the remaining 79% was lost to the atmosphere. About 3/4 of the fire-induced leaf litter fall was in the form of unburned tissue and the remainder was charcoal, which amounted to 5% of pre-fire leaf C stocks. Charcoal production ranged between 4% and 6% of the fire-affected biomass, i.e. the sum of charcoal production and atmospheric losses. This value is below the range of literature values for the transformation of plant tissue into stable soil organic matter through humification processes, which suggests that fire generates a smaller quantity of stable organic C than humification processes over decades and potentially centuries.

AB Based on our current knowledge about population genetics, phylogeography and speciation, we begin to understand that the deep sea harbours more species than suggested in the past. Deep-sea soft-sediment environment in particular hosts a diverse and highly endemic invertebrate fauna. Very little is known about evolutionary processes that generate this remarkable species richness, the genetic variability and spatial distribution of deep-sea animals. In this study, phylogeographic patterns and the genetic variability among eight populations of the abundant and widespread deep-sea isopod morphospecies Betamorpha fusiformis [Barnard, K.H., 1920. Contributions to the crustacean fauna of South Africa. 6. Further additions to the list of marine isopods. Annals of the South African Museum 17, 319-438] were examined. A fragment of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene of 50 specimens and the complete nuclear 18S rRNA gene of 7 specimens were sequenced. The molecular data reveal high levels of genetic variability of both genes between populations, giving evidence for distinct monophyletic groups of haplotypes with average p-distances ranging from 0.0470 to 0.1440 (d-distances: 0.0592-0.2850) of the 16S rDNA, and 18S rDNA p-distances ranging between 0.0032 and 0.0174 (d-distances: 0.0033-0.0195). Intermediate values are absent. Our results show that widely distributed benthic deep-sea organisms of a homogeneous phenotype can be differentiated into genetically highly divergent populations. Sympatry of some genotypes indicates the existence of cryptic speciation. Flocks of closely related but genetically distinct species probably exist in other widespread benthic deep-sea asellotes and other Peracarida. Based on existing data we hypothesize that many widespread morphospecies are complexes of cryptic biological species (patchwork hypothesis). (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Long-term effects of developmental conditions on health, longevity and other fitness components in humans are drawing increasing attention. In evolutionary ecology, such effects are of similar importance because of their role in the trade-off between quantity and quality of offspring. The central role of energy consumption is well documented for some long-term health effects in humans (e.g. obesity), but little is known of the long-term effects of rearing conditions on energy requirements later in life. We manipulated the rearing conditions in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) using brood size manipulation and cross-fostering. It has previously been shown in this species that being reared in a large brood has negative fitness consequences, and that such effects are stronger in daughters than in sons. We show that, independent of mass, standard metabolic rate of 1-year-old birds was higher when they had been reared in a large brood, and this is to our knowledge the first demonstration of such an effect. Furthermore, the brood size effect was stronger in daughters than in sons. This suggests that metabolic efficiency may play a role in mediating the long-term fitness consequences of rearing conditions.

AB Evolutionary plasticity is limited, to a certain extent, by phylogenetic constraints. We asked whether the diel activity patterns of animals reflect their phylogenies by analyzing daily activity patterns in the order Rodentia. We carried out a literature survey of activity patterns of 700 species, placing each in an activity time category: diurnal, nocturnal, or active at both periods (a-rhythmic). The proportion of rodents active at these categories in the entire order, was compared to the activity patterns of species of different families for which we had data for over ten species each: Dipodidae, Echimyidae, Geomyidae, Heteromyidae, Muridae, and Sciuridae. Activity times of rodents from different habitat types were also compared to the ordinal activity time pattern. We also calculated the probability that two random species (from a particular subgroup: family, habitat, etc.) will be active in the same period of the day and compared it to this probability with species drawn from the entire order. Activity patterns at the family level were significantly different from the ordinal pattern, emphasizing the strong relationship between intra-family taxonomic affiliation and daily activity patterns. Large families (Muridae and Sciuridae) analyzed by subfamilies and tribes showed a similar but stronger pattern than that of the family level. Thus it is clear that phylogeny constrains the evolution of activity patterns in rodents, and may limit their ability to use the time niche axis for ecological separation. Rodents living in cold habitats differed significantly from the ordinal pattern, showing more diurnal and a-rhythmic activity patterns, possibly due to physiological constraints. Ground-dwelling rodents differed significantly, showing a high tendency towards a-rhythmic activity, perhaps reflecting their specialized habitat.

AB The effects of landscape fragmentation oil nest predation and brood parasitism, the two primary Causes of avian reproductive failure, have been difficult to generalize across landscapes, yet few Studies have clearly considered the context and spatial scale of: fragmentation. Working in two river systems fragmented by agricultural and rural-housing development, we tracked nesting Success and brood parasitism in > 2500 bird nests in 38 patches of deciduous riparian woodland. Patches oil both river Systems were embedded in one of two local contexts (buffered from agriculture by coniferous forest, or adjacent to agriculture), but the abundance of agriculture and human habitation within 1 km of each patch was highly variable. We examined evidence for three models of landscape effects oil nest predation based on (1) the relative importance of generalist agricultural nest predators, (2) predators associated with the natural habitats typically removed by agricultural development, or (3) an additive combination of: these two predator communities. We found strong support for all additive predation model in which landscape features affect nest predation differently at different spatial scales. Riparian habitat with forest buffers had higher nest predation rates than sites adjacent to agriculture, but nest predation also increased with increasing agriculture in the larger landscape Surrounding each site. These results suggest that predators living in remnant woodland buffers, as well as generalist nest predators associated with agriculture, affect nest predation rates, but they appear to respond at different spatial scales. Brood parasitism, in Contrast, Was unrelated to agricultural abundance oil the landscape, but showed a strong nonlinear relationship with farm and house density, indicating a critical point at which increased human habitat Causes increased brood parasitism. Accurate predictions regarding landscape effects oil nest predation and brood parasitism will require an increased appreciation of the multiple scales at which landscape components influence predator and parasite behavior.

AB Aim We analysed latitudinal range, centres of distribution and northern range boundaries of dragonflies and damselflies occurring in Europe and North America with respect to larval habitat (standing water = lentic and running water = lotic). As lentic water bodies are thought to be less predictable in space and time than lotic habitats, species adapted to standing waters depend on effective dispersal ability for long-term survival. If species occurring in lentic habitats have a higher propensity for dispersal, then larger range sizes in lentic than in lotic species, as well as an increase in the proportion of lentic species with latitude, would be expected.
   Location Europe, North America.
   Methods Distributional and habitat data were collected from published sources for all odonates of Europe and North America. Species were assigned to lentic and lotic habitats according to the habitat of the larvae. From distribution maps we estimated the latitudinal range, centre of distribution and northern range boundary of each species. Differences in these distribution variables between lentic and lotic species were evaluated using ANOVA. We related the proportion of lentic species by latitudinal interval in Europe, and by political unit (state, province) in North America, to area, altitudinal range, longitude (only for North America) and latitude by means of generalized linear models.
   Results Lentic damselflies and dragonflies had larger latitudinal spans, and more northern distribution centres and range boundaries, than lotic species. The proportion of lentic species increased with latitude. These findings were consistent between continents.
   Main conclusions Our results support previous findings that distribution patterns of freshwater species depend on habitat preference. Evolution of dispersal propensity according to habitat characteristics is the most likely explanation. However, at present, alternative explanations, such as an increase in lentic habitats with latitude, cannot be ruled out.

AB Traditional species-based conservation programmes are appropriate in situations where species are readily identifiable. However, in certain taxonomically complex groups of organisms, generally characterized by the presence of uniparental lineages and reticulate evolution, it is not possible to classify biodiversity into discrete and unambiguous species. Attempts to impose species-based conservation on such taxonomically complex groups are proving untenable, and threaten to divert scarce resources and taxonomic expertise from the conservation of other priority groups. We argue here that a new approach should be adopted for taxonomically complex groups. We advocate the conservation of evolutionary processes that generate taxonomic biodiversity, rather than the preservation of a limited number of poorly defined taxa arising from this evolution..

AB We describe an association mapping approach using natural populations of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) to identify molecular markers associated with heading date, an important trait affecting seasonal production, tillering, digestibility and grassland management regimes. Twenty-three natural populations originating from throughout Europe, with heading date phenotypes ranging from very early to very late, as well as three synthetic populations (varieties) were used for molecular marker genotyping using AFLP. In total, 589 polymorphic markers were identified. Hierarchical clustering, principal coordinate and other statistical analyses identified four outlying populations forming a clearly distinct sub-group. Removal of those four populations from the subsequent analysis reduced population sub-structure twofold. However, this made relatively little difference to the result of the association analysis. Linear regression identified three markers whose frequency of occurrence correlated with the heading date phenotype. Moreover, these markers were shown to be closely linked to each other within a major QTL on Chromosome 7, explaining 70% of the total variation in heading date. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium among them was also significant. These results suggest that association mapping approaches may be feasible in L. perenne, and that the use of natural populations could provide a useful source of genetic variation in traits of importance in crop improvement.

AB A widespread but controversial idea in ecology states that the number of invaders of a species assemblage depends oil its species richness. Both negative and positive relationships have been reported. We examined whether a simple neutral model where assemblages are generated by drawing individuals from two pools of identical species (native and alien) call predict this relationship. We performed a meta-analysis of published data oil this relationship.
   The neutral model showed that in communities with low and fixed numbers of individuals. the relationship between the number of aliens and native species is strong and negative. This becomes weaker as the proportion of species from both pools already present in the community increases. The relationship between alien and native species richness becomes positive when the number of individuals is allowed to vary, because the richness depends on number of individuals and/or area sampled. The meta-analysis showed that scale-dependence of the relationship between alien and native species richness is universal and compatible with the neutral model. Unless more evidence is available to refute it. the relationship between native and alien species richness should be considered a result of a neutral processes due to constraints on the number of individuals in the community.

AB Biodiversity is declining worldwide from reductions in both species richness and evenness. Field experiments have shown that primary productivity is often reduced when richness of plant species is lowered. However, experiments testing richness effects have used evenness levels that are much higher than normally encountered in plant communities and have been based on the assumption that species extinctions are random. We experimentally varied, for the first time, both species richness (1-8 perennial species/m(2)) and species evenness (near maximal vs. realistically low) in grassland plots. Net primary productivity (NPP) and ecosystem CO2 uptake declined when richness was reduced, and reductions were similar between evenness treatments. Richness effects were associated more with a selection effect than with complementarity (found only with high evenness). Importantly, extinctions in plots during the second year were not random, but were greater at low than at high evenness (i.e., with increased rarity) and in species with low above-ground growth rates. Thus, species evenness can affect grassland ecosystem processes indirectly by affecting species richness, and it will be imperative to understand. how nonrandom extinctions affect NPP in future studies. Our results indicate that richness studies may not be biased by using mixtures with artificially high evenness levels, but the results also demonstrate that results from these studies are directly applicable only to communities in which plant extinctions are random.

AB The exact location of glacial refugia and the patterns of postglacial range expansion of European mammals are not yet completely elucidated. Therefore, further detailed studies covering a large part of the Western Palearctic region are still needed. In this order, we sequenced 972 bp of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome h (mtDNA cyt b) from 124 yellow-necked fieldmice (Apodemus flavicollis) collected from 53 European localities. The aims of the study were to answer the following questions:
   Did the Mediterranean peninsulas act as the main refuge for yellow-necked fieldmouse or did the species also survive in more easterly refugia (the Caucasus or the southern Ural) and in Central Europe?
   What is the role of Turkey and Near East regions as Quaternary glacial refuges for this species and as a source for postglacial recolonisers of the Western Palearctic region?
   The results provide a clear picture of the impact of the quaternary glaciations on the genetic and geographic structure of the fieldmouse. This species survived the ice ages in two main refuges, the first one in the Italo-Balkan region; the second one in Turkey and the Near East regions. It is from the Balkan refuge that it recolonised all European regions at the end of the last glaciation. The Turkish and Near East populations are distinct from the European ones and they did not recolonise the Palearctic region probably because: (i) they were blocked by the Black Sea and the Caucasus, (ii) the long term presence of fieldmice populations in the Balkans prevented their expansion. These are genetically differentiated from the European and Russian ones and could be described as a particular subspecies. This result emphasises the importance of Turkey and the Near and Middle East regions as a refuge for Palearctic mammals. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The evolutionary success of polyploidy most directly requires the ability of polyploid individuals to reproduce and transmit their genes to subsequent generations. As a result, the sexual system (i.e. the mating system and the sex allocation of a species) will necessarily play a key role in determining the fate of a new polyploid lineage. The effects of the sexual system on the evolution of polyploidy are complex and interactive. They include both aspects of the genetic system, the genetic load maintained in a population and the ecological context in which selection takes place. Here, we explore these complexities and review the empirical evidence for several potentially important genetic and ecological interactions between ploidy and the sexual system in plants. We place particular emphasis on work in our laboratory on the European annual plant Mercurialis annua, which offers promising scope for detailed investigations on this topic. M. annua forms a polyploid complex that varies in its sexual system from dioecy (separate sexes) through androdioecy (males and hermaphrodites) to functional hermaphroditism.

AB A nutrient enrichment experiment was conducted in order to study the role of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and the N:P ratio on the early summer phytoplankton community in the Archipelago Sea, northern Baltic Sea. The phytoplankton community was, in terms of chlorophyll a and total biomass, primarily N-limited, but the individual species varied in their responses to the nutrient supply. The recorded overall N limitation was due to fast growth responses of a few N-limited species such as the diatom Chaetoceros wighamii (Brightwell) and the mixotrophic chrysophyte Uroglena sp. Another dominating diatom, Skeletonema costatum (Greville) Cleve was most clearly P-limited. The N:P ratio had the strongest effect on Uroglena sp., which grew exponentially in the enrichments with a high N:P ratio. This can be explained by the ability of the species to feed on P-rich bacteria, which gives it a competitive advantage in P-limited conditions. The species-specific differences in the responses to the nutrient enrichments can generally be explained by differences in the species physiology and they were consistent with the theory of resource competition.

   SPECIALIZATION
AB Over 400 species of achlorophyllous vascular plants are thought to obtain all C from symbiotic fungi. Consequently, they are termed 'myco-heterotrophic.' However, direct evidence of myco-heterotrophy in these plants is limited.
   During an investigation of the patterns of N and C stable isotopes of various ecosystem pools in two old-growth conifer forests, we sampled six species of mycoheterotrophic achlorophyllous plants to determine the ability of stable isotope ratios to provide evidence of myco-heterotrophy and host-specificity within these symbioses.
   Dual-isotope signatures of the myco-heterotrophic plants differed from those of all other pools. They were most similar to the signatures of ectomycorrhizal fungi, and least like those of green plants. delta(15)N values of the myco-heterotrophic plants correlated strongly and positively with those of putative mycobionts.
   Used in conjunction with other techniques, N and C stable isotope ratios can be used to demonstrate myco-heterotrophy and host-specificity in these plants when other ecosystem pools are well characterized. They also appear promising for estimating the degree of heterotrophy in photosynthetic, partially myco-heterotrophic plants.

AB Vegetative regeneration of individual genotypes of Asian Reynoutria taxa. which are invasive in the Czech Republic, was studied in R. sachalinensis (five genotypes), R. japonica (a single genotype present in the country), and their hybrid R. X bohemica (nine genotypes). Identity of genotypes was confirmed by isozyme analysis. Ten rhizome segments of each genotype were planted in a randomized block design. After 30 d, the regeneration rate of each genotype was measured as the proportion of rhizomes that produced shoots. Emergence time and final mass of each shoot were recorded. The regeneration rate and final shoot mass were significantly affected by genotype in R. X bohemica but not in R. sachalinensis. In R. X bohemica, easily regenerating genotypes grew faster. Regeneration characteristics that crucially contribute to the fitness of these vegetatively spreading plants are closely related to each other. In genotypes with a low regeneration rate, early-emerging shoots produced more biomass, while in those with a high regeneration rate. shoot mass was independent of emergence time. Mean clone size recorded in the field was marginally significantly related to emergence time during regeneration; regeneration characteristics might thus affect the extent of R. X bohemica invasion at a regional scale. Hybrids genetically intermediate between the parents regenerated better than those closely related to parents. Novel hybrid invasive genotypes may be produced by rare sexual reproduction, fixed by clonal growth, and present a previously unknown threat to native vegetation.

AB I analyzed patterns of variation in root mass allocation and root morphology among seedlings of woody species in relation to environmental factors in four Neotropical forests. Among forests, I explored the response of root traits to sites varying in water or nutrient availability. Within each forest, I explored the plastic response of species to different microhabitats: gaps and understory. Additionally, I explored evidence for life history correlation of root and shoot traits by comparing species differing in their successional group (light-demanding [22 spp.] or shade tolerant [27 spp.]) and germination type (species with photosynthetic cotyledons or species with reserve cotyledons). At each forest site, young seedlings from 10 to 20 species were excavated. A total of 55 species was collected in understory conditions and 31 of them were also collected in gaps. From each seedling, six morphological ratios were determined. Allocation to roots was higher in forest sites with the lowest soil resources. Roots were finer and longer in the most infertile site, while roots were deeper in the site with the longest dry season. Seedling traits did not differ between germination types. Shade tolerant species allocated more to roots and developed thicker roots than light-demanding species. Light-demanding species showed stronger plastic responses to habitat than shade tolerant species, and species with photosynthetic cotyledons showed lower plasticity than species with reserve cotyledons. Overall, these results suggest that among Neotropical species, root allocation and root morphology of seedlings reflect plant adjustments to water or nutrient availability at geographic and microhabitat scales. In addition, life history specialization to light environments is suggested by differences among groups of species in their allocation to roots and in their root morphology.

AB Subtidal vegetation distribution patterns in relation to environmental conditions (pollution, wave exposure, sedimentation, substratum slope and depth) were studied along the western Basque coast, northern Spain, by applying canonical correspondence analysis and log-linear regressions. A total of 90 species of macrophytes were recorded by systematic sampling along 21 transects. Mesophyllum lichenoides and Cystoseira baccata were the most abundant (accounting for 47% of the overall algal cover). Gelidium sesquipedale, Pterosiphonia complanata, Zanardinia prototypus, Codium decorticatum and Asparagopsis armata (Falkenbergia phase) were other macrophytes with significant cover. Ordination analysis indicates that the five environmental variables explored account between them for 52% of the species data variance. Pollution, sedimentation and wave exposure were the principal factors explaining differences in flora composition and abundance (24, 14 and 12% of the explained variance, respectively). Log linear regressions and canonical correspondence analyses reveal that C. baccata and G. sesquipedale exhibit a negative relationship with pollution, while sediment loading negatively affects G. sesquipedale, and C. baccata cannot stand high wave exposure levels. In contrast, P. complanata and C. decorticatum show a positive relationship with pollution and can bear high levels of sedimentation and wave exposure. M. lichenoides and Z prototypus present a wide tolerance range for all these factors. Macroalgal cover, species richness and diversity remain practically constant from unpolluted to slightly polluted sites, but they decrease sharply under moderately polluted conditions. In the same way, algal cover decreases as sediment loading increases, but diversity and species richness show the highest values at intermediate levels of sedimentation. In relation to wave exposure, maximum algal cover was achieved at very exposed habitats whereas diversity and species richness were higher under semi-exposed conditions.

AB The polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique was applied to elucidate the glacial history of the alpine cushion plant Saponaria pumila in the European Alps. Special emphasis was given to a dense sampling of populations. Our data support a survival of S. pumila during the last ice age in at least three refugia, which are characterized by unique marker sets. Patterns of genetic diversity and divergence can be explained by survival in peripheral refugia and additional in situ survival within the ice sheet on peripheral nunataks. A nunatak survival in interior parts of the Alps needs not be postulated to explain our results. The level of genetic diversity is dramatically different between populations (Shannon's diversity index: 0.87-19.86). Some peripheral populations are characterized by a high number of rare fragments indicating long isolation, but not necessarily by a high level of genetic diversity. Parts of the present distributional area were recolonized via recent long-distance dispersal, leading to severely bottlenecked populations lacking private or rare fragments. The combination of our data with palaeogeological and palaeoclimatological evidence allows us to confine Pleistocene refugia to certain regions and to draw a detailed scenario of the glacial and postglacial history of S. pumila.

AB 1. Parallel to the large-scale changes in land-use patterns over the last century in Europe, many deer species have expanded their range and increased in density, but the role of habitat changes for their population ecology remains poorly documented.
   2. We tested for effects of variability in agricultural (proportion of meadow and density of sheep) and forestry practices (proportion of coniferous and deciduous forest) in 106 municipalities in Norway on body weight of 10 206 female and 15 499 male adult red deer collected over the period 1965-2000.
   3. Long-term temporal changes in body weights may also be due to delayed density effects, either due to that persistent high density of red deer through grazing and browsing may affect vegetation composition (i.e. an effect of cumulative density after present-day density is controlled for), or that individuals born at high density start to penetrate the population (cohort-effects). As these effects may be confounding to variability in forestry or agricultural practice, we also test whether cohort and/or cumulative density may affect body weight of red deer.
   4. There was a strong negative effect of cohort density, but no effect of cumulative density in the previous 10 years once the cohort effect was accounted for.
   5. There was a clear positive effect of proportion of meadow on red deer body weight, while there was no effect of sheep density once the effect of proportion of meadow was adjusted for. Proportion of meadow increased during the study, but most of the variation was between municipalities (i.e. in space).
   6. Neither proportional area of coniferous or deciduous forest consistently affected body weight of red deer in Norway.
   7. Our study emphasizes the multitude of factors over time and space that affects body weight, and hence demography and population dynamics, of large herbivores.

AB Data containing many variables are often collected in weed science research, but until recently few weed scientists have used multivariate statistical methods to examine such data. Multivariate analysis can be used for both descriptive and predictive modeling. This paper provides an intuitive geometric introduction to the more commonly used and relevant multivariate methods in weed science research, including ordination, discriminant analysis, and canonical analysis. These methods are illustrated using a simple artificial data set consisting of abundance measures of six weed species and two soil variables over 12 sample plots.

AB We tested whether the intensity of hardwood midstory reduction causes commensurate improvements of herbaceous groundcover in fire-suppressed Pinus palustris (longleaf pine) sandhills. Using a complete randomized block design, we compared the effects of three hardwood reduction techniques (spring burning, application of the ULW(R) form of the herbicide hexazinone, chainsaw felling/girdling) and a no-treatment control on plant species richness, and on life form and common species densities at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, U.S.A., from 1995 to 1998. ULW(R) and felling/girdling plots were burned for fuel reduction two years after initial treatment application. We also sampled the same variables in frequently-burned reference sandhills to establish targets for restoration. Spring bums achieved partial topkill of oaks (17.6-41.1% from 1995 to 1998) compared to reductions of 69.1-94% accomplished by ULW(R) and of 93.2-67.8% by felling/girdling treatments. We predicted that plant species richness and densities of herbaceous groundcover life forms would increase according to the percent hardwood reductions. Predictions were not supported by treatment effects for species richness because positive responses to fire best explained increases in plant richness, whereas ULW(R) effects accounted for the largest initial decreases. Legumes, non-legume forbs, and graminoids did not respond to treatments as predicted by the hypothesis. Again, positive responses to fire dominated the results, which was supported by greater herbaceous densities observed in reference plots. Overall, we found that the least effective and least expensive hardwood midstory reduction method, fire, resulted in the greatest groundcover improvements as measured by species richness and herbaceous groundcover plant densities.

AB The behaviour of long-distance migratory birds is assumed to partly be under the influence of genes, as demonstrated by selection experiments. Furthermore, competition for early arrival among males may lead to condition-dependent migration associated with fitness benefits of early arrival achieved by individuals in prime condition. Here I present field data on the repeatability and the heritability of arrival date in a trans-equatorial migratory bird, the barn swallow Hirundo rustica, and I test for a genetic correlation between arrival date and the expression of a condition-dependent secondary sexual character. The repeatability was statistically significant and the heritability of arrival date was estimated to be 0.54 (s.e. =0.15). There was no significant evidence of this estimate being inflated by environmental or maternal condition during rearing. Arrival date and migration are condition dependent in the barn swallow, with males with the most exaggerated secondary sexual characters also arriving the earliest. There was a significant genetic correlation between arrival date and tail length in male barn swallows, providing indirect evidence for a genetic basis of this condition dependence. Given the high level of heritability, arrival date could readily respond to selection caused by environmental change.

AB Soft-sediment macrobenthos data from the southern part of the Norwegian continental shelf was used to study faunal patterns and spatial variability, and to evaluate different measures of marine biodiversity. Water depth and sediment characteristics were remarkably uniform over the spatial sampling scale of 130 x 70 km, and relations between measured environmental variables and community structure were weak. Out of 175 recorded species, 10 % spanned the entire sampling area (16 sites), while 27 % were restricted to a single site. The number of rare species was positively correlated with species richness. Common species were widely spatially distributed, while species of low abundance had strongly compressed range sizes. The distribution of species varied among the 4 dominant taxonomic groups: the polychaetes, crustaceans, molluscs, and echinoderms, Polychaetes were the most common taxonomic group and had the highest proportion of widespread species. Whittaker's beta diversity measure (beta (W), extent of change in species composition among sites) varied among the dominant taxonomic groups and was highest for crustaceans, followed by molluscs. Neither the number of shared species nor the complementarity (biotic distinctness) between all pairwise permutations of sites was linked to spatial distance. However, the Bray-Curtis similarity between all pairwise combinations of sites was a function of spatial arrangement and was the most sensitive measure of beta diversity. Faunal pattern changed across the study area, despite the uniform habitat. Furthermore, faunal pattern and variability changed with scales. The measurement of biodiversity is therefore dependent on spatial scale, and cross-scale studies are important. The abstract concept of biodiversity as the 'variety of life' cannot be encapsulated by a single measure, Distributions of species and community differences should be taken into account in addition to species diversity when measuring marine biodiversity and planning conservation areas, and more than 1 taxonomic group should be studied in a system.

AB To assess the relationship between the regenerative potential of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) and the latitudinal and thermal gradients, the cone crop was monitored in the same selection of trees during the 1989-1995 period in the northern boreal forest (sites A, n = 49, and B, n = 48), in the southern forest-tundra transition zone (site C, n = 35), and at the tree line (site D, n = 21). The size of the cone crop, the amount of seeds extracted per cone, along with the percentages of filled seed and germination were measured on each tree. There was no south to north trend associated with the cone crop. The cone crop at tree line was not significantly lower than in either of the southerly sites in six of the seven observed years. The number of seeds extracted per cone, the percentage of filled seeds, and the germination of filled seeds showed significant decrease northward according to year. Although there was no significant relationship between temperature and the cone production over the study area, the percentages of filled seeds and germination were significantly (0.51 greater than or equal to r(2) greater than or equal to 0.44; p < 0.001) associated with the regional variation in heat sum.

AB 1 Seedlings of 16 West African timber tree species were grown in six neutral shade-houses with irradiances 2%, 6%, 10%, 28%, 44% and 66% of unshaded values.
   2 Tested species included well-known pioneers, which showed negative growth in 2% irradiance but which responded strongly to increased irradiance, and very shade-tolerant non-pioneers, which had positive growth in 2% irradiance but responded only slightly to increased irradiance.
   3 For all species, maximum growth occurred at an irradiance varying between 10% and 44%. The inhibition of growth at higher irradiance was greater in the more shade-tolerant species.
   4 Data from growth analyses were used in a principal components analysis to quantify the species' positions on a light response gradient. The growth variables most strongly correlated with this gradient were relative growth rate (RGR) and relative diameter growth in 2% irradiance, and also apparent quantum efficiency and leaf mortality rate in both 2% and 66% irradiance. These results draw attention to the importance of performance in deep forest shade in defining differences among tropical forest tree species.
   5 The second (independent) axis of the principal components analysis separated three species that are known from other experiments to be drought tolerant. Other species' traits of functional significance (adult deciduousness, seed size, seed dispersal) were only weakly, if at all, associated with the gradient of light response.
   6 Possible methods for efficient placement of other species on the gradient of light response are discussed. Formulation of standardized conditions simulating deep shade would allow diameter growth to be used as a simple non-destructive measure of a species' position on the gradient of light response, which could then be applied to any tropical forest flora.

DE size spectrum; diversity; fish assemblages
AB In this paper we investigate whether single and multispecies fisheries models call be used to predict the response of sire and diversity spectra of fish assemblages to changes in exploitation. Both types of models estimate that the slope of the size spectrum will steepen and the intercept will increase when fishing intensity increases, while the response of the slope and intercept of the diversity spectrum depend on the model used. The changes in the slope and intercept of the size spectrum are found to be proportional to the change in fishing intensity. The proportionality is insensitive to changes in natural mortality, but sensitive to changes in growth and to the relationship between stock and recruitment. The results agree will with results obtained from previous analysis of survey data from the North Sea and suggest that the slope of the size spectrum is a useful measure of fishing impacts.

AB We compared the effects of late dormant-season and late growing-season prescribed fires on herbaceous species in restored shortleaf pine-(Pinus echinata) grassland communities in the Ouachita Highlands of western Arkansas. Herbaceous species richness, diversity, and total forb and legume abundance increased following fire. Late growing-season burns reduced distribution and abundance of panicums (primarily Panicum boscii, P. dichotomum, and P. linearifolium) while late dormant-season burns increased Panicum distribution and abundance. Density of legumes (such as Stylosanthes biflora) increased following frequent or annual dormant-season fires. However, season of fire influenced the distribution and abundance of fewer than 10 % of the species. Fire plays an essential role in pine-grassland communities by creating and maintaining open canopy conditions that perpetuate understory herbaceous plant communities.

AB Biodiversity mapping (e.g., the Gap Analysis Program [GAP]), in which vegetative features and categories of land use are mapped at coarse spatial scales, has been proposed as a reliable tool for land use decisions (e.g., reserve identification, selection, and design). This implicitly assumes that species richness data collected at coarse spatiotemporal scales provide a first-order approximation to community and ecosystem representation and persistence. This assumption may be false because (1) species abundance distributions and species richness are poor surrogates for community/ecosystem processes, and are scale dependent; (2) species abundance and richness data are unreliable because of unequal and unknown sampling probabilities and species-habitat models of doubtful reliability; (3) mapped species richness data may be inherently resistant to ''scaling up'' or ''scaling down''; and (4) decision-making based on mapped species richness patterns may be sensitive to errors from unreliable data and models, resulting in suboptimal conservation decisions. We suggest an approach in which mapped data are linked to management via demographic models, multiscale sampling, and decision theory. We use a numerical representation of a system in which vegetation data are assumed to be known and mapped without error, a simple model relating habitat to predicted species persistence, and statistical decision theory to illustrate use of mapped data in conservation decision-making and the impacts of uncertainty in data or models on the decision outcome.

AB 1. Epiphytes on Quercus petraea and Fraxinus excelsior were studied in the native woodlands around Loch Sunart, western Scotland, to obtain information on community variation and habitat requirements of the Lobarion pulmonariae alliance at an unpolluted site.
   2. Percentage cover data for 119 species were obtained from 207 randomly located 20-cm x 20-cm quadrats on Quercus and Fraxinus and from a further 18 quadrats subjectively sited in Lobarion communities on Quercus. Bark pH and cation levels and direct and diffuse radiation inputs (hemispherical photography) were measured for each quadrat.
   3. The bark chemical factors and radiation estimates, respectively, showed many strong inter-correlations. Mean bark pH was 0.7 units higher and mean bark Mg and K were, respectively, 1.8 and 3.7 times higher in Fraxinus than in Quercus. Bark pH was positively correlated with bark Ca in Quercus, whereas in Fraxinus, bark pH increased with girth but was unrelated to cation levels. In Quercus, bark Mg content declined with increasing altitude probably due to increasing insect defoliation of the canopy at higher altitudes. Bark pH or cation concentrations were positively correlated with soil exchangeable cation levels.
   4. Correlations between the epiphytic flora and environmental variables were explored using numerical classification (two-way indicator species analysis), indirect ordination (detrended correspondence analysis) and direct ordination (canonical correspondence analysis).
   5. Height on the bole and bark angle were identified as the most important factors influencing epiphytes. They probably determine the degree to which water is available on, or evaporated from, the bark surface. Bark pH correlated strongly with the second ordination axes but radiation was a relatively unimportant predictor of epiphyte community composition.
   6. Classification of the floristic data resulted in the recognition of eight quadrat groups. Species of the phytosociological Lobarion pulmonariae alliance were distributed between two groups, one predominantly on Quercus, the other, with richer representation of cyanobacterial lichens, on Fraxinus. Both groups were characteristic of bark with high pH and high cation levels, and were best developed in low-altitude sites, possibly indicating that acidic inputs may restrict their colonization at higher altitudes. Neither group was strongly associated with high light levels which were previously thought to be important for Lobarion lichens.

AB Empirical evidence for the response of soil carbon cycling to the combined effects of warming, drought and diversity loss is scarce. Microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) plays a central role in regulating the flow of carbon through soil, yet how biotic and abiotic factors interact to drive it remains unclear. Here, we combine distinct community inocula (a biotic factor) with different temperature and moisture conditions (abiotic factors) to manipulate microbial diversity and community structure within a model soil. While community composition and diversity are the strongest predictors of CUE, abiotic factors modulated the relationship between diversity and CUE, with CUE being positively correlated with bacterial diversity only under high moisture. Altogether these results indicate that the diversity x ecosystem-function relationship can be impaired under non-favorable conditions in soils, and that to understand changes in soil C cycling we need to account for the multiple facets of global changes.

AB While the application of machine-learning algorithms has been highly simplified in the last years due to their well-documented integration in commonly used statistical programming languages (such as R or Python), there are several practical challenges in the field of ecological modeling related to unbiased performance estimation. One is the influence of spatial autocorrelation in both hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation. Grouped cross-validation strategies have been proposed in recent years in environmental as well as medical contexts to reduce bias in predictive performance. In this study we show the effects of spatial autocorrelation on hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation by comparing several widely used machine-learning algorithms such as boosted regression trees (BRT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) with traditional parametric algorithms such as logistic regression (GLM) and semi-parametric ones like generalized additive models (GAM) in terms of predictive performance. Spatial and non-spatial cross-validation methods were used to evaluate model performances aiming to obtain bias-reduced performance estimates. A detailed analysis on the sensitivity of hyperparameter tuning when using different resampling methods (spatial/non-spatial) was performed. As a case study the spatial distribution of forest disease (Diplodia sapinea) in the Basque Country (Spain) was investigated using common environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, soil and lithology as predictors. Random Forest (mean Brier score estimate of 0.166) outperformed all other methods with regard to predictive accuracy. Though the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning differed between the ML algorithms, there were in most cases no substantial differences between spatial and non-spatial partitioning for hyperparameter tuning. However, spatial hyperparameter tuning maintains consistency with spatial estimation of classifier performance and should be favored over non-spatial hyperparameter optimization. High performance differences (up to 47%) between the bias-reduced (spatial crossvalidation) and overoptimistic (non-spatial cross-validation) cross-validation settings showed the high need to account for the influence of spatial autocorrelation. Overoptimistic performance estimates may lead to false actions in ecological decision making based on biased model predictions.

AB Information on where species occur is an important component of conservation and management decisions, but knowledge of distributions is often coarse or incomplete. Species distribution models provide a tool for mapping habitat and can produce credible, defensible, and repeatable information with which to inform decisions. However, these models are sensitive to data inputs and methodological choices, making it important to assess the reliability and utility of model predictions. We provide a rubric that model developers can use to communicate a model's attributes and its appropriate uses. We emphasize the importance of tailoring model development and delivery to the species of interest and the intended use and the advantages of iterative modeling and validation. We highlight how species distribution models have been used to design surveys for new populations, inform spatial prioritization decisions for management actions, and support regulatory decision-making and compliance, lying these examples back to our model assessment rubric.

AB Global fire regimes are shifting due to climate and land use changes. Understanding the responses of belowground communities to fire is key to predicting changes in the ecosystem processes they regulate. We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of 1634 observations from 131 empirical studies to investigate the effect of fire on soil microorganisms and mesofauna. Fire had a strong negative effect on soil biota biomass, abundance, richness, evenness, and diversity. Fire reduced microorganism biomass and abundance by up to 96%. Bacteria were more resistant to fire than fungi. Fire reduced nematode abundance by 88% but had no significant effect on soil arthropods. Fire reduced richness, evenness and diversity of soil microorganisms and mesofauna by up to 99%. We found little evidence of temporal trends towards recovery within 10 years post-disturbance suggesting little resilience of the soil community to fire. Interactions between biome, fire type, and depth explained few of these negative trends. Future research at the intersection of fire ecology and soil biology should aim to integrate soil community structure with the ecosystem processes they mediate under changing global fire regimes.

AB For millennia Indigenous communities worldwide have maintained diverse knowledge systems informed through careful observation of dynamics of environmental changes. Although Indigenous communities and their knowledge systems are recognized as critical resources for understanding and adapting to climate change, no comprehensive, evidence-based analysis has been conducted into how environmental studies engage Indigenous communities. Here we provide the first global systematic review of levels of Indigenous community participation and decision-making in all stages of the research process (initiation, design, implementation, analysis, dissemination) in climate field studies that access Indigenous knowledge. We develop indicators for assessing responsible community engagement in research practice and identify patterns in levels of Indigenous community engagement. We find that the vast majority of climate studies (87%) practice an extractive model in which outside researchers use Indigenous knowledge systems with minimal participation or decision-making authority from communities who hold them. Few studies report on outputs that directly serve Indigenous communities, ethical guidelines for research practice, or providing Indigenous community access to findings. Further, studies initiated with (in mutual agreement between outside researchers and Indigenous communities) and by Indigenous community members report significantly more indicators for responsible community engagement when accessing Indigenous knowledges than studies initiated by outside researchers alone. This global assessment provides an evidence base to inform our understanding of broader social impacts related to research design and concludes with a series of guiding questions and methods to support responsible research practice with Indigenous and local communities.

AB AimUnderstanding the relative importance of climatic and non-climatic distribution drivers for co-occurring, functionally similar species is required to assess potential consequences of climate change. This understanding is, however, lacking for most ecosystems. We address this knowledge gap and forecast changes in distribution for habitat-forming seaweeds in one of the world's most species-rich temperate reef ecosystems.
   LocationThe Great Southern Reef. The full extent of Australia's temperate coastline.
   MethodsWe assessed relationships between climatic and non-climatic environmental data known to influence seaweed, and the presence of 15 habitat-forming seaweeds. Distributional data (herbarium records) were analysed with MAXENT and generalized linear and additive models, to construct species distribution models at 0.2 degrees spatial resolution, and project possible distribution shifts under the RCP 6.0 (medium) and 2.6 (conservative) emissions scenarios of ocean warming for 2100.
   ResultsSummer temperatures, and to a lesser extent winter temperatures, were the strongest distribution predictors for temperate habitat-forming seaweeds in Australia. Projections for 2100 predicted major poleward shifts for 13 of the 15 species, on average losing 78% (range: 36%-100%) of their current distributions under RCP 6.0 and 62% (range: 27%-100%) under RCP 2.6. The giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) and three prominent fucoids (Durvillaea potatorum, Xiphophora chondrophylla and Phyllospora comosa) were predicted to become extinct from Australia under RCP 6.0. Many species currently distributed up the west and east coasts, including the dominant kelp Ecklonia radiata (71% and 49% estimated loss for RPC 6.0 and 2.6, respectively), were predicted to become restricted to the south coast.
   Main conclusionsIn close accordance with emerging observations in Australia and globally, our study predicted major range contractions of temperate seaweeds in coming decades. These changes will likely have significant impacts on marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning because large seaweeds are foundation species for 100s of habitat-associated plants and animals, many of which are socio-economically important and endemic to southern Australia.

AB BACKGROUND: Circulating metals from both the natural environment and pollution have been linked to cardiovascular disease. However,few prospective studies have investigated the associations between exposure to multiple metals and incident coronary heart disease (CHD).
   OBJECTIVES: We conducted a nested case control study in the prospective Dongfeng-Tongji cohort, to investigate the prospective association between plasma metal concentrations and incident CHD.
   METHODS: A total of 1,621 incident CHD cases and 1,621 controls free of major cardiovascular disease at baseline and follow-up visits were matched on age (+/- 5 years) and sex. We measured baseline fasting plasma concentrations of 23 metals and used conditional logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) of CHI) for metal concentrations categorized according to quartiles in controls.
   RESULTS: Five metals (titanium, arsenic, selenium, aluminum, and barium) were significantly associated with CHD based on trend tests from single metal multivariable models adjusted for established cardiovascular risk factors. When all five were included in the same model, adjusted ORs for barium and aluminum were close to the null, whereas associations with titanium, arsenic, and selenium were similar to estimates from single-metal models, and ORs comparing extreme quartiles were 1.32 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.69; p-trend = 0.04), 1.78 (95% CI: 1.29, 2.46; p-trend = 0.001), and 0.67 (95% Cl: 0.52, 0.85; p-trend = 0.001), respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that incident CHD was positively associated with plasma levels of titanium and arsenic, and inversely associated with selenium. Additional research is needed to confirm these findings in other populations.

TI Weakening of annual temperature cycle over the Tibetan Plateau since the

ID CLIMATIC VARIABILITY; SEASONAL CYCLE; RECONSTRUCTION; SIGNAL; MOUNTAIN;
   DENSITY
AB The annual cycle of extra-tropical surface air temperature is an important component of the Earth's climate system. Over the past decades, a reduced amplitude of this mode has been observed in some regions. Although attributed to anthropogenic forcing, it remains unclear when dampening of the annual cycle started. Here we use a residual series of tree-ring width and maximum latewood density from the Tibetan Plateau >4,000 m asl to reconstruct changes in temperature seasonality over the past three centuries. The new proxy evidence suggests that the onset of a decrease in summer-to-winter temperature difference over the Tibetan Plateau occurred in the 1870s. Our results imply that the influence of anthropogenic forcing on temperature seasonality might have started in the late nineteenth century, and that future human influence may further contribute to a weakening of the annual temperature cycle, with subsequent effects on ecosystem functioning and productivity.

AB In biofilm systems for wastewater treatment (e.g., moving bed biofflms reactors-MBBRs) biofilm thickness is typically not under direct control. Nevertheless, biofilm thickness is likely to have a profound effect on the microbial diversity and activity, as a result of diffusion limitation and thus substrate penetration in the biofilm. In this study, we investigated the impact of biofilm thickness on nitrification and on the removal of more than 20 organic micropollutants in laboratory-scale nitrifying MBBRs. We used novel carriers (Z-carriers, AnoxKaldnes) that allowed controlling biofilm thickness at 50, 200, 300, 400, and 500 mu m. The impact of biofilm thickness on microbial community was assessed via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) abundance quantification through quantitative PCR (qPCR). Results from batch experiments and microbial analysis showed that (i) the thickest biofilm (500 mu m) presented the highest specific biotransformation rate constants (k(bio), L g(-1) d(-1)) for 14 out of 22 micropollutants; (ii) biofilm thickness positively associated with biodiversity, which was suggested as the main factor for the observed enhancement of k(bio); (iii) the thinnest biofilm (50 mu m) exhibited the highest nitrification rate (gN d(-1) g(-1)), amoA gene abundance and k(bio) values for some of the most recalcitrant micropollutants (i.e., diclofenac and targeted sulfonamides). Although thin biofilms favored nitrification activity and the removal of some micropollutants, treatment systems based on thicker biofflms should be considered to enhance the elimination of a broad spectrum of micropollutants.

AB The development of unconventional oil and gas (UOG) resources has rapidly increased in recent years; however, the environmental impacts and risks are poorly understood. A single well can generate millions of liters of wastewater, representing a mixture of formation brine and injected hydraulic fracturing fluids. One of the most common methods for wastewater disposal is underground injection; we are assessing potential risks of this method through an intensive, interdisciplinary study at an injection disposal facility in West Virginia. In June 2014, waters collected downstream from the site had elevated specific conductance (416 mu S/cm) and Na, Cl, Ba, Br, Sr, and Li concentrations, compared to upstream, background waters (conductivity, 74 mu S/cm). Elevated TDS, a marker of UOG wastewater, provided an early indication of impacts in the stream. Wastewater inputs are also evident by changes in Sr-87/Sr-86 in streamwater adjacent to the disposal facility. Sediments downstream from the facility were enriched in Ra and had high bioavailable Fe(III) concentrations relative to upstream sediments. Microbial communities in downstream sediments had lower diversity and shifts in composition. Although the hydrologic pathways were not able to be assessed, these data provide evidence demonstrating that activities at the disposal facility are impacting a nearby stream and altering the biogeochemistry of nearby ecosystems.

AB Niche and neutral processes drive community assembly and metacommunity dynamics, but their relative importance might vary with the spatial scale. The contribution of niche processes is generally expected to increase with increasing spatial extent at a higher rate than that of neutral processes. However, the extent to what community composition is limited by dispersal (usually considered a neutral process) over increasing spatial scales might depend on the dispersal capacity of composing species. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the distribution and diversity of species known to have great powers of dispersal (hundreds of kilometres), we analysed the relative importance of niche processes and dispersal limitation in determining beta-diversity patterns of aquatic plants and cladocerans over regional (up to 300 km) and continental (up to 3300 km) scales. Both taxonomic groups were surveyed in five different European regions and presented extremely high levels of beta-diversity, both within and among regions. High beta-diversity was primarily explained by species replacement (turnover) rather than differences in species richness (i.e. nestedness). Abiotic and biotic variables were the main drivers of community composition. Within some regions, small-scale connectivity and the spatial configuration of sampled communities explained a significant, though smaller, fraction of compositional variation, particularly for aquatic plants. At continental scale (among regions), a significant fraction of compositional variation was explained by a combination of spatial effects (exclusive contribution of regions) and regionally-structured environmental variables. Our results suggest that, although dispersal limitation might affect species composition in some regions, aquatic plant and cladoceran communities are not generally limited by dispersal at the regional scale (up to 300 km). Species sorting mediated by environmental variation might explain the high species turnover of aquatic plants and cladocerans at regional scale, while biogeographic processes enhanced by dispersal limitation among regions might determine the composition of regional biotas.

AB Hybridization in fungi has recently been recognized as a major force in the generation of new fungal plant pathogens. These include the grass pathogen Zymoseptoria pseudotritici and the powdery mildew pathogen Blumeria graminis triticale of triticale. Hybridization also plays an important role in the transfer of genetic material between species. This process is termed introgressive hybridization and involves extensive backcrossing between hybrid and the parental species. Introgressive hybridization has contributed substantially to the successful spread of plant pathogens such as Ophiostoma ulmi and O. novo-ulmi, the causal agents of Dutch elm disease, and other tree pathogens such as the rust pathogen Melampsora. Hybridization occurs more readily between species that have previously not coexisted, so-called allopatric species. Reproductive barriers between allopatric species are likely to be more permissive allowing interspecific mating to occur. The bringing together of allopatric species of plant pathogens by global agricultural trade consequently increases the potential for hybridization between pathogen species. In light of global environmental changes, agricultural development, and the facilitated long-distance spread of fungal plant pathogens, hybridization should be considered an important mechanism whereby new pathogens may emerge. Recent studies have gained insight into the genetics and biology of fungal hybrids. Here I summarize current knowledge about hybrid speciation and introgressive hybridization. I propose that future studies will benefit greatly from the availability of large genome data sets and that genome data provide a powerful resource in combination with experimental approaches for analyses of hybrid species.

AB Estimating evaporation is important when managing water resources and cultivating crops. Evaporation can be estimated using land surface heat flux models and remotely sensed land surface temperatures (LST), which have recently become obtainable in very high resolution using lightweight thermal cameras and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In this study a thermal camera was mounted on a UAV and applied into the field of heat fluxes and hydrology by concatenating thermal images into mosaics of LST and using these as input for the two-source energy balance (TSEB) modelling scheme. Thermal images are obtained with a fixed-wing UAV overflying a barley field in western Denmark during the growing season of 2014 and a spatial resolution of 0.20 m is obtained in final LST mosaics. Two models are used: the original TSEB model (TSEB-PT) and a dual-temperature-difference (DTD) model. In contrast to the TSEB-PT model, the DTD model accounts for the bias that is likely present in remotely sensed LST. TSEB-PT and DTD have already been well tested, however only during sunny weather conditions and with satellite images serving as thermal input. The aim of this study is to assess whether a lightweight thermal camera mounted on a UAV is able to provide data of sufficient quality to constitute as model input and thus attain accurate and high spatial and temporal resolution surface energy heat fluxes, with special focus on latent heat flux (evaporation). Furthermore, this study evaluates the performance of the TSEB scheme during cloudy and overcast weather conditions, which is feasible due to the low data retrieval alti-tude (due to low UAV flying altitude) compared to satellite thermal data that are only available during clear-sky conditions. TSEB-PT and DTD fluxes are compared and validated against eddy covariance measurements and the comparison shows that both TSEB-PT and DTD simulations are in good agreement with eddy covariance measurements, with DTD obtaining the best results. The DTD model provides results comparable to studies estimating evaporation with similar experimental setups, but with LST retrieved from satellites instead of a UAV. Further, systematic irrigation patterns on the barley field provide confidence in the veracity of the spatially distributed evaporation revealed by model output maps. Lastly, this study outlines and discusses the thermal UAV image processing that results in mosaics suited for model input. This study shows that the UAV platform and the lightweight thermal camera provide high spatial and temporal resolution data valid for model input and for other potential applications requiring high-resolution and consistent LST.

AB Bile acids (BAs) are a group of important physiological agents for cholesterol metabolism, intestinal nutrient absorption, and biliary secretion of lipids, toxic metabolites, and xenobiotics. Extensive research in the last two decades has unveiled new functions of BAs as signaling molecules and metabolic regulators that modulate hepatic lipid, glucose, and energy homeostasis through the activation of nuclear receptors and G-protein-coupled receptor signaling in gut-liver metabolic axis involving host-gut microbial co-metabolism. Therefore, investigation of serum BA profiles, in healthy human male and female subjects with a wide range of age and body mass index (BMI), will provide important baseline information on the BA physiology as well as metabolic homeostasis among human subjects that are regulated by two sets of genome, host genome, and symbiotic microbiome. Previous reports on age- or gender-related changes on BA profiles in animals and human showed inconsistent results, and the information acquired from various studies was highly fragmentary. Here we profiled the serum BAs in a large population of healthy participants (n = 502) and examined the impact of age, gender, and BMI on serum BA concentrations and compositions using a targeted metabonomics approach with ultraperformance liquid chromatography triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry. We found that the BA profiles were dependent on gender, age, and BMI among study subjects. The total BAs were significantly higher in males than in females (p < 0.05) and higher in obese females than in lean females (p < 0.05). The difference in BA profiles between male and female subjects was decreased at age of 50-70 years, while the difference in BA profiles between lean and obese increased for subjects aged 50-70 years. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the BA profiles in healthy subjects and highlights the need to take into account age, gender, and BMI differences when investigating pathophysiological changes of BAs resulting from gastrointestinal diseases.

AB Many populations of threatened mammals persist outside formally protected areas, and their survival depends on the willingness of communities to coexist with them. An understanding of the attitudes, and specifically the tolerance, of individuals and communities and the factors that determine these is therefore fundamental to designing strategies to alleviate human-wildlife conflict. We conducted a meta-analysis to identify factors that affected attitudes toward 4 groups of terrestrial mammals. Elephants (65%) elicited the most positive attitudes, followed by primates (55%), ungulates (53%), and carnivores (44%). Urban residents presented the most positive attitudes (80%), followed by commercial farmers (51%) and communal farmers (26%). A tolerance to damage index showed that human tolerance of ungulates and primates was proportional to the probability of experiencing damage while elephants elicited tolerance levels higher than anticipated and carnivores elicited tolerance levels lower than anticipated. Contrary to conventional wisdom, experiencing damage was not always the dominant factor determining attitudes. Communal farmers had a lower probability of being positive toward carnivores irrespective of probability of experiencing damage, while commercial farmers and urban residents were more likely to be positive toward carnivores irrespective of damage. Urban residents were more likely to be positive toward ungulates, elephants, and primates when probability of damage was low, but not when it was high. Commercial and communal farmers had a higher probability of being positive toward ungulates, primates, and elephants irrespective of probability of experiencing damage. Taxonomic bias may therefore be important. Identifying the distinct factors explaining these attitudes and the specific contexts in which they operate, inclusive of the species causing damage, will be essential for prioritizing conservation investments.

AB Variation is key to the adaptability of species and their ability to survive changes to the Earth's climate and habitats. Plasticity in movement strategies allows a species to better track spatial dynamics of habitat quality. We describe the mechanisms that shape the movement of a long-distance migrant bird (turkey vulture, Cathartes aura) across two continents using satellite tracking coupled with remote-sensing science. Using nearly 10 years of data from 24 satellite-tracked vultures in four distinct populations, we describe an enormous amount of variation in their movement patterns. We related vulture movement to environmental conditions and found important correlations explaining how far they need to move to find food (indexed by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and how fast they can move based on the prevalence of thermals and temperature. We conclude that the extensive variability in the movement ecology of turkey vultures, facilitated by their energetically efficient thermal soaring, suggests that this species is likely to do well across periods of modest climate change. The large scale and sample sizes needed for such analysis in a widespread migrant emphasizes the need for integrated and collaborative efforts to obtain tracking data and for policies, tools and open datasets to encourage such collaborations and data sharing.

AB Abiotic filtering is a major driver of gradients in the structure and functioning of ecosystems from the tropics to the poles. It is thus likely that environmental filtering is an important assembly process at the transition of biogeographical zones where many species occur at their range limits. Shifts in species abundances and association patterns along environmental gradients can be indicative of environmental filtering, which is predicted to be stronger in areas of high abiotic stress and to promote increased similarity of ecological characteristics among co-occurring species. Here we test these hypotheses for scleractinian corals along a broad latitudinal gradient in high-latitude eastern Australia, where corals occur at the margins of their ranges and environmental tolerances. We quantify variation in taxonomic, zoogeographic, and functional patterns combined with null model approaches and demonstrate systematic spatial variation in community structure and significant covariance of species abundance distributions and functional characteristics along the latitudinal gradient. We describe a strong biogeographic transition zone, consistent with patterns expected under abiotic filtering, whereby species are sorted along the latitudinal gradient according to their tolerances for marginal reef conditions. High-latitude coastal reefs are typified by widely distributed, generalist, stress-tolerant coral species with massive and horizontally spreading morphologies and by diminishing influence of tropical taxa at higher latitudes and closer to the mainland. Higher degree of ecological similarity among co-occurring species than expected by chance supports the environmental filtering hypothesis. Among individual traits, the structural traits corallite size and colony morphology were filtered most strongly, suggesting that characteristics linked to energy acquisition and physical stability may be particularly important for coral survival in high-latitude environments. These findings highlight interspecific differences and species interactions with the environment as key drivers of community organization in biogeographic transition zones and support the hypothesis that environmental filters play a stronger role than biotic interactions in structuring ecological communities in areas of high abiotic stress.

AB Streams and rivers in mediterranean-climate regions (med-rivers) are subjected to sequential, yet contrasting hydrologic disturbances of drying and flooding. Although seasonally predictable, these disturbances can vary in intensity and duration within and among mediterranean-climate regions (med-regions). Consequently, med-rivers differ in the permanence of their aquatic habitats. To persist, species have acquired matched resistance and resilience adaptations. They gain resistance either by enduring the stress or avoiding it. Community recovery (or resilience) is achieved with cessation of hydrologic stress that permits maximization of re-colonization and reproduction. Endurance strategies are usually disturbance-specific, but avoidance enables organisms to cope with both drying and flooding, and is the prevalent resistance strategy. Correspondingly, community persistence depends to a large extent on the integrity of refuges, an aspect that has so far been little explored. Existing information suggests that seasonal community succession becomes more pronounced with increasing aridity and declining water permanence. The invertebrate community in semi-arid med-rivers can therefore undergo succession through three to four identifiable assemblages, whereas in perennial streams the difference between wet and dry period assemblages is smaller. Community turnover is influenced by the intensity of the hydrologic disturbances and varies between wet and drought years.

AB Patterns of interspecific introgression may vary geographically, and the distribution of introgressed variants can yield insight into the historical dynamics of genetic interactions between hybridizing species. Urodele amphibians, often characterized by limited mobility, deep intraspecific genetic structuring and vulnerability to climatic changes, constitute suitable models for such historical inferences. Here, we combine an extensive survey of the mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear (15 microsatellites) genomes in the Carpathian newt, Lissotriton montandoni (Lm) with species distribution modelling (SDM). Populations of the smooth newt, L.vulgaris (Lv) from the areas surrounding the Lm range were also sampled to test whether gene flow between these hybridizing species extends beyond the area of strict syntopy. The extent of introgression differs dramatically between the mitochondrial genome and the nuclear genome. While multiple, spatially and temporally distinct introgression events from Lv resulted in complete mtDNA replacement in Lm, there was little evidence of recent interspecific nuclear gene flow in the assayed markers. Microsatellite differentiation within Lm defines three units, probably derived from separate glacial refugia, located in the northern, eastern and southern part of the Carpathians. In situ survival and range fragmentation of Lm are supported by SDM, corroborating the role of the Carpathians as a major refugial area. Our results, in combination with previous reports of extensive introgression of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, emphasize the complexity of historical gene exchange between Lm and Lv.

AB Local plant community assembly is influenced by a series of filters that affect the recruitment and establishment of species. These filters include regional factors that limit seeds of any given species from reaching a local site as well as local interactions such as post-dispersal seed predation and disturbance, which dictate what species actually establish. How these filters interact to influence recruitment into local assemblages, and whether they act differentially on individual species based on traits such as seed size or their provenance (i.e. native vs. exotic), has not been well examined. Such studies, however, are crucial for understanding community assembly and for making predictions about what species might be favoured under specific ecological circumstances. We added 20 native and 19 exotic species that varied in seed size to undisturbed or experimentally disturbed subplots in and out of larger rodent exclusion plots at ten grassland sites across the Blackfoot River drainage in western Montana, USA. Individually, exclusion of rodent seed predators and disturbance substantially increased cumulative (summed across all species) seedling recruitment. Exclusion of rodent seed predators enhanced recruitment to a greater extent in disturbed rather than undisturbed plots and for native species compared with exotics, while disturbance enhanced recruitment to a greater extent for exotics compared with natives. Examination of individual species responses indicated that results were generalizable across species within each group and not driven by the response of a few species. Seed size mediated these patterns. Notably, the positive effect of rodent exclusion on recruitment was greater for large- versus small-seeded species, while the impact of disturbance on recruitment was more pronounced for small-seeded exotics relative to other groups. Synthesis. These results reveal that local filters such as post-dispersal seed predation and disturbance can individually and collectively impose strong limitation on seedling recruitment into local assemblages. Seed size importantly predicts how strongly individual species are influenced by these local filters. Interestingly, in situ community filters have differential effects on native versus exotic species, suggesting that processes that limit native recruitment may not have the same inhibitory influence on exotics.

AB Background: The regression of similarity against distance unites several ecological phenomena, and thus provides a highly useful approach for illustrating the spatial turnover across sites. Our aim was to test whether the rates of decay in community similarity differ between diatom growth forms suggested to show different dispersal ability. We hypothesized that the diatom group with lower dispersal ability (i.e. periphyton) would show higher distance decay rates than a group with higher dispersal ability (i.e. plankton).
   Methods/Principal findings: Periphyton and phytoplankton samples were gathered at sites distributed over an area of approximately 800 km length in the Negro River, Amazon basin, Brazil, South America (3 degrees 08'00 '' S; 59 degrees 54'30 '' W). Distance decay relationships were then estimated using distance-based regressions, and the coefficients of these regressions were compared among the groups with different dispersal abilities to assess our predictions. We found evidence that different tributaries and reaches of the Negro River harbor different diatom communities. As expected, the rates of distance decay in community similarity were higher for periphyton than for phytoplankton indicating the lower dispersal ability of periphytic taxa.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our study demonstrates that the comparison of distance decay relationships among taxa with similar ecological requirements, but with different growth form and thus dispersal ability provides a sound approach to evaluate the effects of dispersal ability on beta diversity patterns. Our results are also in line with the growing body of evidence indicating that microorganisms exhibit biogeographic patterns. Finally, we underscore that clumbing all microbial taxa into one group may be a flawed approach to test whether microbes exhibit biogeographic patterns.

AB Female preferences for specific male phenotypes have been documented across a wide range of animal taxa, including numerous species where males contribute only gametes to offspring production. Yet, selective pressures maintaining such preferences are among the major unknowns of evolutionary biology. Theoretical studies suggest that preferences can evolve if they confer genetic benefits in terms of increased attractiveness of sons (Fisherian models) or overall fitness of offspring (good genes models). These two types of models predict, respectively, that male attractiveness is heritable and genetically correlated with fitness. In this meta-analysis, we draw general conclusions from over two decades worth of empirical studies testing these predictions (90 studies on 55 species in total). We found evidence for heritability of male attractiveness. However, attractiveness showed no association with traits directly associated with fitness (life-history traits). Interestingly, it did show a positive correlation with physiological traits, which include immunocompetence and condition. In conclusion, our results support Fisherian models of preference evolution, while providing equivocal evidence for good genes. We pinpoint research directions that should stimulate progress in our understanding of the evolution of female choice.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation are often concurrent to land conversion and urbanization. Simple application of GIS-based landscape pattern indicators may be not sufficient to support meaningful biodiversity impact assessment. A review of the literature reveals that habitat definition and habitat fragmentation are frequently inadequately considered in environmental assessment, notwithstanding the increasing number of tools and approaches reported in the landscape ecology literature.
   This paper presents an approach for assessing impacts on habitats on a local scale, where availability of species data is often limited, developed for an alpine valley in northern Italy. The perspective of the methodology is multiple scale and species-oriented, and provides both qualitative and quantitative definitions of impact significance. A qualitative decision model is used to assess ecological values in order to support land-use decisions at the local level. Building on recent studies in the same region, the methodology integrates various approaches, such as landscape graphs, object-oriented rule-based habitat assessment and expert knowledge. The results provide insights into future habitat loss and fragmentation caused by land-use changes, and aim at supporting decision-making in planning and suggesting possible ecological compensation.

AB Cell wall fibre and lamina density may interactively affect leaf toughness and leaf lifespan. Here, we tested this with seedlings of 24 neotropical tree species differing in shade tolerance and leaf lifespan under standardized field conditions (140867 d in gaps; longer in shade). We quantified toughness with a cutting test, explicitly seeking a mechanistic linkage to fibre.
   Lamina density, but not fracture toughness, exhibited a plastic response to gaps vs shade, while neither trait was affected by leaf age. Toughness corrected for lamina density, a recently recognized indicator of material strength per unit mass, was linearly correlated with cellulose content per unit dry mass.
   Leaf lifespan was positively correlated with cellulose and toughness in shade-tolerant species but only weakly in gap-dependent species. Leaf lifespan was uncorrelated with lamina thickness, phenolics and tannin concentrations. In path analysis including all species, leaf lifespan was directly enhanced by density and toughness, and indirectly by cellulose via its effect on toughness. Different suites of leaf traits were correlated with early seedling survival in gaps vs shade.
   In conclusion, cellulose and lamina density jointly enhance leaf fracture toughness, and these carbon-based physical traits, rather than phenolic-based defence, explain species differences in herbivory, leaf lifespan and shade survival.

AB We assessed whether (1) arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization of roots (RC) and/or plant responses to arbuscular mycorrhizae (MR) vary with plant phylogeny and (2) MR and RC can be more accurately predicted with a phylogenetic predictor relative to a null model and models with plant trait and taxonomic predictors. In a previous study, MR and RC of 95 grassland species were measured. We constructed a phylogeny for these species and found it explained variation in MR and RC. Next, we used multiple regressions to identify the models that most accurately predicted plant MR. Models including either phylogenetic or phenotypic and taxonomic information similarly improved our ability to predict MR relative to a null model. Our study illustrates the complex evolutionary associations among species and constraints of using phylogenetic information, relative to plant traits, to predict how a plant species will interact with AMF.

AB Data limitations can lead to unrealistic fits of predictive species distribution models (SDMs) and spurious extrapolation to novel environments. Here, we want to draw attention to novel combinations of environmental predictors that are within the sampled range of individual predictors but are nevertheless outside the sample space. These tend to be overlooked when visualizing model behaviour. They may be a cause of differing model transferability and environmental change predictions between methods, a problem described in some studies but generally not well understood. We here use a simple simulated data example to illustrate the problem and provide new and complementary visualization techniques to explore model behaviour and predictions to novel environments. We then apply these in a more complex real-world example. Our results underscore the necessity of scrutinizing model fits, ecological theory and environmental novelty.

AB Aim Understanding which human or environmental factors interact to enable or to limit the occurrence and persistence of large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes is an important issue for their effective conservation, especially under the current scenario of global change where most of their former habitat is being transformed by humans.
   Location NW Iberian Peninsula.
   Methods We combine data on the distribution of Iberian wolves (Canis lupus signatus) living in a human- dominated landscape in NW Spain and variation and partitioning methods to investigate the relative importance of three groups of predictors: food availability, humans and landscape attributes - each group expected to have unequal effects on wolf reproduction and survival - and their interactions on the occurrence of this species.
   Results We found that the group of predictors related with landscape attributes (altitude, roughness and refuge) strongly determined wolf occurrence, followed by humans and food availability. Variance partitioning analysis revealed that the three most important components determining wolf occurrence were related with landscape attributes: (1) the joint effects of the three predictor groups, (2) the joint effect of humans and landscape attributes and (3) the pure effect of landscape attributes. Altitude had the main independent contribution to explain the probability of wolf occurrence.
   Main conclusions In human- dominated landscapes, the occurrence of wolves is the result of a complex interaction among several environmental and human factors. Our results suggest that the characteristics of the landscape (spatial context) - factors associated with the security of wolves facilitating that animals go unnoticed by humans, wolf movements, dispersal events and short- time colonization - become more important in human- dominated landscapes and may have played a key role in the occurrence and persistence of this species throughout decades modulating the relationship between humans and wolf distribution.

AB The eddy-covariance method has become a cornerstone in the study of the surface energy and water balances, yet the oft-reported lack of energy-balance closure adds uncertainty to its measurements of evapotranspiration. This study explores the issue of closure based on 10 years of energy and water balance measurements at seven flux-tower sites in the southern boreal forests of western Canada. The sites include mature aspen, black spruce and jack pine forests, three young jack pine forests following harvesting, and one fen. Careful attention was paid to the measurement of evapotranspiration E, surface available energy (net radiation minus storage), precipitation P. and soil water storage S including root-zone soil water and water table elevation. Stand-level outflow O at the flux-tower sites was estimated annually as a residual term in the vertical water balance (O = P - E - Delta S), with and without energy-closure adjustments to E. Six of the flux towers were located within or near the gauged White Gull Creek watershed (603 km(2)). The comparison of measured streamflow from the White Gull Creek with estimated outflow, scaled from the flux towers to the watershed, provides an independent test of the need for energy-closure adjustments to flux-tower E.
   Measured streamflow from the White Gull Creek watershed had a long-term mean (S.D.) of 101 (54) mm y(-1) but was highly variable among years, ranging from 30 mm y(-1) during an extreme dry year to 204 mm y(-1) during an extreme wet year. Stand-level outflow, estimated with an energy-closure adjustment to E, varied by land-cover type, from a mean (S.D.) of 30 (35)mm y(-1) at the mature aspen forest and 52 (125)mm y(-1) at the fen to 108 (85)mm y(-1) at the mature black spruce forest and 187 (55) and 250 (64)mm y(-1) at the mature and young (harvested) jack pine forests, respectively. The dominant land-cover type, mature black spruce forest, typified the hydrology of the boreal forest landscape, with outflow similar to the watershed mean.
   The warm-season, eddy-covariance sensible and latent heat fluxes were 15 +/- 4% (annual mean +/- S.D.) smaller than surface available energy, with reasonable similarity among sites and years. When scaled from stand to watershed, the tower-based estimates of outflow agreed with measured streamflow only when outflow was calculated with an energy-closure adjustment to E. The annual means for the 2002-2009 hydrologic years were: 131 mm y(-1) (measured streamflow); 182 mm y(-1) (tower-based outflow calculated without energy-closure adjustments to E); and 112 and 127 mm y(-1) (tower-based outflow calculated with energy-closure adjustments to E from two different schemes). This result corroborates the need for energy-closure adjustments to eddy-covariance measurements of E, but it does not provide guidance about how the adjustments should be implemented. (C) 2012 A.G.

AB Macroecology examines the relationship between organisms and their environment at large spatial (and temporal) scales. Typically, macroecologists explain the large-scale patterns of abundance, distribution and diversity. Despite the difficulties in sampling and characterizing microbial diversity, macroecologists have recently also been interested in unicellular organisms. Here, I review the current advances made in microbial macroecology, as well as discuss related ecosystem functions. Overall, it seems that microorganisms suit surprisingly well to known species abundance distributions and show positive relationship between distribution and adundance. Microbial species-area and distance-decay relationships tend to be weaker than for macroorganisms, but nonetheless significant. Few findings on altitudinal gradients in unicellular taxa seem to differ greatly from corresponding findings for larger taxa, whereas latitudinal gradients among microorganisms have either been clearly evident or absent depending on the context. Literature also strongly emphasizes the role of spatial scale for the patterns of diversity and suggests that patterns are affected by species traits as well as ecosystem characteristics. Finally, I discuss the large role of local biotic and abiotic variables driving the community assembly in unicellular taxa and eventually dictating how multiple ecosystem processes are performed. Present review highlights the fact that most microorganisms may not differ fundamentally from larger taxa in their large-scale distribution patterns. Yet, review also shows that many aspects of microbial macroecology are still relatively poorly understood and specific patterns depend on focal taxa and ecosystem concerned.

AB The prevailing view that insects lack endogenous enzymes for plant cell wall (PCW) digestion had led to the hypothesis that PCW digestion evolved independently in different insect taxa through the establishment of symbiotic relationships with microorganisms. However, recent studies reporting endogenous PCW-degrading genes and enzymes for several insects, including phylogenetically basal insects and closely related arthropod groups, challenge this hypothesis. Here, we summarize the molecular and biochemical evidence on the mechanisms of PCW digestion in insects to analyze its evolutionary pathways. The evidence reveals that the symbiotic-independent mechanism may be the ancestral mechanism for PCW digestion. We discuss the implications of this alternative hypothesis in the evolution of plant-insect interactions and suggest that changes in the composition of lignocellulolytic complexes were involved in the evolution of feeding habits and diet specializations in insects, playing important roles in the evolution of plant-insect interactions and in the diversification of insects.

AB Functional diversity (FD) 'those components of biodiversity that influence how an ecosystem operates or functions' is a promising tool to assess the effect of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning. FD has received ample theoretical attention, but empirical studies are limited. We evaluate changes in species richness and FD during tropical secondary forest succession after shifting cultivation in Mexico. We also test whether species richness is a good predictor of FD. FD was calculated based on a combination of nine functional traits, and based on two individual traits important for primary production (specific leaf area) and carbon sequestration (wood density). Stand basal area was a good predictor of successional changes in diversity and FD, in contrast to fallow age. Incidence-based FD indices increased logarithmically with stand basal area, but FD weighted by species' importance values lacked pattern with succession. Species richness and diversity are strong predictors of FD when all traits were considered; linear relationships indicate that all species are equally functionally complementary, suggesting there is little functional redundancy. In contrast, when FD was calculated for individual traits and weighted for abundances, species richness may underestimate FD.
   Selection of functional trait(s) critically determines FD, with large consequences for studies relating biodiversity to ecosystem functioning. Careful consideration of the traits required to capture the ecosystem process of interest is thus essential. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Tropical forests are important sources of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and of nitric oxide (NO), a precursor of ozone. In tropical montane forests nitrogen limitation is common which affects both soil N2O and NO fluxes and forest productivity. Here we present evidence that forest productivity and N-oxide (N2O + NO) fluxes are linked through N availability along elevation and topographic gradients in tropical montane forests. We measured N-oxide fluxes, several indices of N availability, and forest productivity along an elevation gradient from 1000 m to 3000 m and along topographic gradients. Organic layer thickness of the soils increased and N availability decreased with increasing elevation and along the topographic gradient from the lower slope position to the ridges. Annual N2O fluxes ranged from -0.53 mu g(N)m(-2)h(-1) to 14.54 mu g(N)m(-2)h(-1) while NO fluxes ranged from -0.02 mu g(N)m(-2)h(-1) to 1.13 mu g(N)m(-2)h(-1). Both N-oxide fluxes and forest productivity increased with increasing N availability and showed close positive correlations with indices of N availability (C/N ratio and delta N-15 signature of litterfall). We interpret the close correlations of N-oxide fluxes with total litterfall and tree basal area increment as evidence that N availability links N-oxide fluxes and forest productivity. This opens the possibility to include forest productivity as co-variable in predictions of N-oxide fluxes in nitrogen limited tropical montane forests. Especially increment of tree basal area was a promising proxy to predict soil N-oxide fluxes in these N limited ecosystems, possibly because it better reflects long-term forest productivity than total litterfall.

AB It is widely accepted that biodiversity is lower in more extreme environments. In this study, we sought to determine whether this trend, well documented for macroorganisms, also holds at the microbial level for bacteria. We used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) with phylum-specific primers to quantify the taxon richness (i.e., the DGGE band numbers) of the bacterioplankton communities of 32 pristine Tibetan lakes that represent a broad salinity range (freshwater to hypersaline). For the lakes investigated, salinity was found to be the environmental variable with the strongest influence on the bacterial community composition. We found that the bacterial taxon richness in freshwater habitats increased with increasing salinity up to a value of 1 parts per thousand. In saline systems (systems with >1 parts per thousand salinity), the expected decrease of taxon richness along a gradient of further increasing salinity was not observed. These patterns were consistently observed for two sets of samples taken in two different years. A comparison of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries revealed that the bacterial community of the lake with the highest salinity was characterized by a higher recent accelerated diversification than the community of a freshwater lake, whereas the phylogenetic diversity in the hypersaline lake was lower than that in the freshwater lake. These results suggest that different evolutionary forces may act on bacterial populations in freshwater and hypersaline lakes on the Tibetan Plateau, potentially resulting in different community structures and diversity patterns.

AB Human-orangutan conflict and hunting are thought to pose a serious threat to orangutan existence in Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo. No data existed prior to the present study to substantiate these threats. We investigated the rates, spatial distribution and causes of conflict and hunting through an interview-based survey in the orangutan's range in Kalimantan, Indonesia. Between April 2008 and September 2009, we interviewed 6983 respondents in 687 villages to obtain socio-economic information, assess knowledge of local wildlife in general and orangutan encounters specifically, and to query respondents about their knowledge on orangutan conflicts and killing, and relevant laws. This survey revealed estimated killing rates of between 750 and 1800 animals killed in the last year, and between 1950 and 3100 animals killed per year on average within the lifetime of the survey respondents. These killing rates are higher than previously thought and are high enough to pose a serious threat to the continued existence of orangutans in Kalimantan. Importantly, the study contributes to our understanding of the spatial variation in threats, and the underlying causes of those threats, which can be used to facilitate the development of targeted conservation management.

AB Aim The drivers of species assembly, by limiting the possible range of functional trait values, can lead to either convergent or divergent distributions of traits in realized assemblages. Here, to evaluate the strengths of these species assembly drivers, we partition trait variance across global, regional and community scales. We then test the hypothesis that, from global to community scales, the outcome of co-occurring trait convergence and divergence is highly variable across biomes and communities.
   Location Global: nine biomes ranging from subarctic highland to tropical rain forest.
   Methods We analysed functional trait diversity at progressively finer spatial scales using a global, balanced, hierarchically structured dataset from 9 biomes, 58 communities and 652 species. Analyses were based on two key leaf traits (foliar nitrogen content and specific leaf area) that are known to drive biogeochemical cycling.
   Results While 35% of the global variance in these traits was between biomes, only 15% was between communities within biomes and as much as 50% occurred within communities. Despite this relatively high within-community variance in trait values, we found that trait convergence dominated over divergence at both global and regional scales through comparisons of functional trait diversity in regional and community assemblages against random (null) models of species assembly.
   Main conclusions We demonstrate that the convergence of traits occurring from global to regional assemblages can be twice as strong as that from regional to community assemblages, and argue that large differences in the nature and strength of abiotic and biotic drivers of dominant species assembly can, at least partly, explain the variable outcome of simultaneous trait convergence and divergence across sites. Ultimately, these findings stress the urgent need to extend species assembly research to address those scales where trait variance is the highest, i.e. between biomes and within communities.

AB Mediterranean soils under heathland are often shallow, with low capacity for water storage, and a high risk of erosion. In this context, recurrent wildfires can negatively affect their chemical and physical properties. Very little research has been carried out concerning the long-term variations on the ground surface after burning. The behaviour of plant communities and plant cover can regulate and control soil processes in the post-fire period, so that the evolution of vegetation communities must be taken into account when studying the evolution of soil processes after disturbance. In this study, the impact of fire on several physical and chemical soil properties has been investigated during 3 years after experimental burning in a Mediterranean heathland. On average, the soil organic matter content after the fire decreased strongly, and one year after the fire it did not vary substantially, although it increased slightly during the following two years until the end of experiments. Burning led to coarser texture immediately after fire, but clay content decreased strongly during the following 3 years due to post-fire erosion processes and selective detachment of fine particles. Soil pH and electrical conductivity increased ephemerally and returned to initial values just 1-year after the fire. Soil water repellency was partly destroyed by the scorching, but pre-fire proportion of water-repellent soil samples was observed just after 1 year. Water-repellent aggregates may have been removed by post-fire erosion, but water repellency also appears as a natural attribute of these soils. Reduction in organic matter content after the fire and changes in texture and water repellency contributed to a decreased stability of aggregates and an increased bulk density. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Urban habitat heterogeneity can modify interactions across species and lead to spatially fine grained differences in beta-diversity patterns and their associated ecosystem services. Here, we study the impacts of landscape heterogeneity and climatic variability on: (1) the richness and diversity patterns of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) and (2) the abundance and West Nile virus infection rate of the house mosquito, Culex pipiens, in Chicago, USA. We conducted a four year long study (2005-2008) in 8 sites that captured a gradient of urban heterogeneities. We found a total of 19 mosquito species, a representative sample of mosquito species richness in the area, according to both model estimation (Chao2 +/- S. E. = 20.50 +/- 2.29) and faunal records for Chicago. We found that heterogeneity in the landscape was the best predictor of both mosquito species richness and diversity, with the most heterogeneous landscapes harboring the largest number of species. In general there were no changes in species richness over the years that could be associated with weather patterns and climatic variability (WPCV). In contrast, changes in diversity were associated with WPCV. Our results also showed that WPCV had major impacts on house mosquito abundance and West Nile virus mosquito infection rate (MIR) patterns. Although MIR was independent of mosquito diversity, it was associated with overall mosquito abundance, which had a convex association with species richness (i.e., abundance increases to a point after which it decreases as function of species richness). Finally, our results highlight the importance of considering dominant vector species as part of a community of vectors, whose biodiversity patterns can directly or indirectly impact the risk of infectious disease transmission.

AB Microorganisms inhabit very different soil habitats in the ice-free areas of Antarctica, playing a major role in nutrient cycling in cold environments. We studied the soil characteristics and the dominant bacterial composition from nine different soil profiles located on Livingston Island (maritime Antarctica). The total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) values were high for the vegetated soils, decreasing with depth, whereas the values for the mineral soils were generally low. Soil pH was more acidic for moss-covered soils and neutral to alkaline for mineral soils. Numbers of culturable heterotrophic bacteria were higher at vegetated sites, but significant numbers were also detectable in carbon-depleted soils. Patterns of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) revealed a highly heterogeneous picture throughout the soil profiles. Subsequent sequencing of DGGE bands revealed in total 252 sequences that could be assigned to 114 operational taxonomic units, showing the dominance of members of the Bacteroidetes and Acidobacteria. The results of phospholipid fatty acid analysis showed a lack of unsaturated fatty acids for most of the samples. Samples with a prevalence of unsaturated over saturated fatty acids were restricted to several surface samples. Statistical analysis showed that the dominant soil bacterial community composition is most affected by TC and TN contents and soil physical factors such as grain size and moisture, but not pH.

AB To increase ecosystem services provided by their lands, farmers in the United States are managing non-production areas to create a more biodiverse set of habitats and greater landscape heterogeneity. Relatively little is known, however, of the actual environmental outcomes of this practice, termed 'farmscaping'. We inventoried communities of plant and soil organisms and monitored indicators of ecosystem functions in six distinct habitats of an organic farm in California's Central Valley to better understand the ecological costs and benefits of farmscaping. A riparian corridor, hedgerows, a system of drainage ditches, and tailwater ponds supported different plant life history/functional groups and greater native plant diversity than the two production fields. Differences were less pronounced for belowground organisms, i.e., nematode functional groups, microbial communities (based on phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis) and earthworm taxa. Partial ordination analysis showed that environmental variables, rather than spatial location, explained much of the distribution of soil and plant taxa across the farmscape. Riparian and hedgerow habitats with woody vegetation stored 18% of the farmscape's total carbon (C), despite occupying only 6% of the total area. Infiltration rates in the riparian corridor were >230% higher than those observed in the production fields, and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil solution were as much as 65% higher. The tailwater pond reduced total suspended solids in irrigation runoff by 97%. Drainage ditches had the highest N2O-N emissions (mean values of 16.7 mu g m(-2) h(-1)) and nitrate (NO3--N) leaching (12.1 g m(-2) year(-1) at 75 cm depth). Emissions of N2O-N and leaching of NO3--N were, however, quite low for all the habitats. Non-production habitats increased biodiversity (particularly plants) and specific ecosystem functions (e.g. water regulation and carbon storage). Extrapolating relative tradeoffs to the entire farmscape showed that greater habitat enhancement through farmscaping could increase both biodiversity and multiple ecosystem functions of agricultural lands with minor loss of production area.

AB Sustainable high-performance buildings are being more widely adopted around the world to reduce energy costs and improve the well being of occupants. To achieve the set goals for these building projects within realistic financial and time constraints, superior planning, design, and construction processes are needed. The available literature lacks the descriptive project delivery metrics identifying scientific methods for providing insight or feedback about the performance of project delivery processes for sustainable high-performance buildings. This paper describes an exploratory study examining more than 100 variables in green project delivery to scientifically identify important metrics. Limited by a rather small sample due to the relatively young market of green buildings, the outcome of this paper, nevertheless, provides important direction for the continued development of meaningful metrics to assist in the establishment of a decision making support tool for project teams to facilitate optimum project delivery processes for sustainable high-performance buildings.

AB Bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing of the 16S rDNA gene was used to evaluate bacterial diversity of a clay loam soil (fine, mixed, thermic Torrertic Paleustolls) after 10 years under an integrated livestock (beef)-cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production system compared to continuous cotton in a semiarid region. In the integrated system, cattle alternatively grazed a perennial warm-season grass [Bothriochloa bladhii (Retz) S.T. Blake] paddock and small grains grown in two paddocks of a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow-rye (Secale cereal L.)-cotton rotation. Areas excluded from grazing in the integrated system were also evaluated. Maximum observed number of unique sequences operational taxonomic units (OTU) at 3% dissimilarity level (roughly corresponding to the species level) corresponded to 1200 and 1100 at 0-5 and 5-15 cm depths, respectively. Predominant phyla (up to 65% of abundance) at 0-5 and 5-15 cm in this soil were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Gemmatitnonadetes. Proteobacteria were predominant in soil under all components of the integrated livestock-cotton system compared to continuous cotton whereas Bacteroidetes were predominant under continuous cotton. Firmicutes (i.e., Clostridia) and Chlorofexi (i.e., Thermomicrobia) were more abundant in soil under fallow periods of the rotation compared to under cotton (Rye-Cotton-Wheat-Fallow or continuous cotton) or grass (i.e., pasture). The lowest OTUs were detected in soil under fallow periods of the rotation (Wheat-Fallow-Rye-Cotton) compared to the other treatments. Grazing effects were significant for Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Chlorofexi. Compared to the continuous cotton system, this study revealed significant changes in bacterial phyla distribution under integrated livestock-cotton systems for a semiarid soil after 10 years. Positive correlations were found between certain bacteria (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Verrucomicrobiae and Fibrobacteres) and the activities of alkaline phosphatase and beta-glucosidase or beta-glucosaminidase.

AB P>1. Natal dispersal has the potential to affect most ecological and evolutionary processes. However, despite its importance, this complex ecological process still represents a significant gap in our understanding of animal ecology due to both the lack of empirical data and the intrinsic complexity of dispersal dynamics.
   2. By studying natal dispersal of 74 radiotagged juvenile eagle owls Bubo bubo (Linnaeus), in both the wandering and the settlement phases, we empirically addressed the complex interactions by which individual phenotypic traits and external cues jointly shape individual heterogeneity through the different phases of dispersal, both at nightly and weekly temporal scales.
   3. Owls in poorer physical conditions travelled shorter total distances during the wandering phase, describing straighter paths and moving slower, especially when crossing heterogeneous habitats. In general, the owls in worse condition started dispersal later and took longer times to find further settlement areas. Net distances were also sex biased, with females settling at further distances. Dispersing individuals did not seem to explore wandering and settlement areas by using a search image of their natal surroundings. Eagle owls showed a heterogeneous pattern of patch occupancy, where few patches were highly visited by different owls whereas the majority were visited by just one individual. During dispersal, the routes followed by owls were an intermediate solution between optimized and randomized ones. Finally, dispersal direction had a marked directionality, largely influenced by dominant winds. These results suggest an asymmetric and anisotropic dispersal pattern, where not only the number of patches but also their functions can affect population viability.
   4. The combination of the information coming from the relationships among a large set of factors acting and integrating at different spatial and temporal scales, under the perspective of heterogeneous life histories, are a fruitful ground for future understanding of natal dispersal.

Thus, in the forest-town interface most, but not all, aerial insectivorous bats were present in town and regularly foraged around streetlights, suggesting a species-specific tolerance for habitat alteration. Bats foraging at streetlights used microhabitats, and some species even changed microhabitats, according to season or moon phase.

AB Aim To investigate the potential impacts of climate change on stream fish assemblages in terms of species and biological trait diversity, composition and similarity.
   Location One-thousand one-hundred and ten stream sections in France.
   Methods We predicted the future potential distribution of 35 common stream fish species facing changes in temperature and precipitation regime. Seven different species distribution models were applied and a consensus forecast was produced to limit uncertainty between single-models. The potential impacts of climate change on fish assemblages were assessed using both species and biological trait approaches. We then addressed the spatial distribution of potential impacts along the upstream-downstream gradient.
   Results Overall, climate change was predicted to result in an increase in species and trait diversity. Species and trait composition of the fish assemblages were also projected to be highly modified. Changes in assemblages' diversity and composition differed strongly along the upstream-downstream gradient, with upstream and midstream assemblages more modified than downstream assemblages. We also predicted a global increase in species and trait similarity between pairwise assemblages indicating a future species and trait homogenization of fish assemblages. Nevertheless, we found that upstream assemblages would differentiate, whereas midstream and downstream assemblages would homogenize. Our results suggested that colonization could be the main driver of the predicted homogenization, while local extinctions could result in assemblage differentiation.
   Main conclusions This study demonstrated that climate change could lead to contrasted impacts on fish assemblage structure and diversity depending on the position along the upstream-downstream gradient. These results could have important implications in terms of ecosystem monitoring as they could be useful in establishing areas that would need conservation prioritization.

Conservation policies regarding the Atlantic forest strongly emphasize the core formation (i.e. the rainforest stricto sensu) rather than the marginal habitats (e.g. restingas, swamps, and high altitude campos) and species that are rare/endemic. To discuss this issue I revisit a hypothesis I have forwarded in 2002 that postulates that plant colonization of habitats marginal to the Atlantic rain forests of the State of Rio de Janeiro was largely related to terrestrial nurse plants that originally, in the rainforest habitat, were canopy plants such as epiphytes or hemi-epiphytes. Adaptations to water and nutrient restrictions, typical of life in the canopy, granted success to such plants upon migration to sandy. swampy or rocky substrates in neighbouring areas. Many such species, then, behaved as nurse plants and favoured colonization of these more extreme habitats by a number of other rainforest species. I now review recent evidence that corroborate this hypothesis, while examining the nature of such nurse plants. In all marginal habitats, nurse plants are often highly abundant locally and have high ecophysiological vigour, while both widespread and endemic species are found among them. Thus, nursing effect, local abundance, and ecophysiological performance are not related to species geographic distribution or to their spectrum of habitat preference. Paradoxically, several abundant nurse plant species have low Darwinian fitness. These studies provoke two reflections. First, the Atlantic forest sensu lato, i.e. the core formation plus the peripheral ones, should be treated collectively as a biodiversity hotspot, rather than the core rainforest formation alone. Second, widespread or common species play important functional roles in such marginal habitats and, despite their ubiquity, ecologically they might be less fit than rare/endemic ones at the local level due, for instance, to current constraints to sexual reproduction. Thus, they should also be targeted as conservation priorities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We used daily MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery obtained over a five-year period to analyze the seasonal and inter-annual variability of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) and photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE) for the Southern Old Aspen (SOA) flux tower site located near the southern limit of the boreal forest in Saskatchewan, Canada. To obtain the spectral characteristics of a standardized land area to compare with tower measurements, we scaled up the nominal 500 m MODIS products to a 2.5 km x 2.5 kin area (5 x 5 MODIS 500 m grid cells). We then used the scaled-up MODIS products in a coupled canopy-leaf radiative transfer model, PROSAIL-2, to estimate the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) by the part of the canopy dominated by chlorophyll (FAPAR(chl)) versus that by the whole canopy (FAPAR(canopy)). Using the additional information provided by flux tower-based measurements of gross ecosystem production (GEP) and incident PAR, we determined 90-minute averages for APAR and LUE (slope of GEP:APAR) for both the physiologically active foliage (APAR(chl), LUEchl) and for the entire canopy (APAR(canopy), LUEcanopy).
   The flux tower measurements of GEP were strongly related to the MODIS-derived estimates of APAR(chl), (r(2)=0.78) but only weakly related to APAR(canopy) (r(2)=0.33). Gross LUE between 2001 and 2005 for LUEchl was 0.0241 mu mol C mu mol(-1) PPFD whereas LUEcanopy 6% lower. Time series of the 5-year normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used to estimate the average length of the core growing season as days of year 152-259. Inter-annual variability in the core growing season LUEchl (mu mol C mu mol(-1) PPFD) ranged from 0.0225 in 2003 to 0.0310 in 2004. The five-year time series of LUEchl corresponded well with both the seasonal phase and amplitude of LUE from the tower measurements but this was not the case for LUEcanopy. We conclude that LUE,h, derived from MODIS observations could provide a more physiologically realistic parameter than the more commonly used LUEcanopy as an input to large-scale photosynthesis models.

AB Understanding the factors determining the transition from introduction of aliens to the establishment of invasive populations is a critical issue of the study of biological invasions, and has key implications for management. Differences in fitness among areas of introduction can define the zones where aliens become invasive. The American slider turtle Trachemys scripta has been introduced worldwide, and has negative effects on freshwater communities, but only a subset of introduced populations breed successfully. We used species distribution models to assess the factors influencing the slider distribution in Italy, by analysing bioclimatic features that can cause the transition from presence of feral adults to breeding populations. We also evaluated whether climate change might increase the future suitability for reproduction.
   Central and Northern Italy.
   The distribution of slider turtle was obtained from the literature, unpublished reports and field surveys. We used Maxent to build bioclimatic models.
   Reproductive populations are associated to a clear bioclimatic envelope with warmer climate, more solar radiation and higher precipitations than populations where reproduction is not observed. Several Mediterranean areas currently have climatic features suitable for sliders. Scenarios of climate change predict the expansion of these areas. In the near future (2020), the proportion of populations in areas suitable for reproduction will dramatically increase.
   Our study shows that bioclimatic differences can determine the areas where aliens become invaders. Management should be focused to these source areas. However, climate change can increase fitness in the future, and therefore the interactions between climate change and fitness can boost the invasiveness of this alien species.

AB Geological events of biological importance in the history of the Andes include their impact oil global eliminates through an influence oil atmospheric circulation, rainfall patterns, and the atmospheric concentration of CO2; habitat diversification from lowlands through paramo to glaciated peaks; and migratory pathways ranging front discontinuous (mesic elements), highly discontinuous (paramo elements), barriers (to cast-west migrations), to selective pathways (via the (In, Andean valleys). The timing of these effects is a function of the Uplift history of three (to nine) morphotectonic segments of the Andes resulting in (1) mostly lowalnd swamp and fluvial environment., in the, Cretaceous and Paleocene, (2) Moderate Uplands beginning in flit, Late Eocene (ca. 40 million years ago [Ma]), (3) appression of art offshore volcanic chain (the proto-Cordillera Occidental) in the Oligocene (ca, 30 Ma), (4) uplift of the proto-Cordillera Oriental and the Altiplano to about half their present altitude by the Middle Miocene (ca. 15 Ma). and (5) uplift of the remaining half within approximately the past 10 million years. The early appearance of a biological community recognizable as the Atacama Desert is estimated at ca. 15 Ma, and the beginnings of a paramo at ca. 3.5 Ma. Longer-term (Milankovitch) and shorter-term (Younger Dryas, Medieval warm/dry period, Little Ice Age, Heinrich, and Dansgaard-Oeschger [D-O]) climatic events, known initially front the high latitudes, are now widely recognized throughout Latin America, including the Andes. They document if dynamic physical environment from the Cretaceous through the Holocene and off till timescales.

AB 1. Maternal effects describe how mothers influence offspring life histories. In many taxa, maternal effects arise by differential resource allocation to young, often identified by variation in propagule size, and which affects individual traits and population dynamics.
   2. Using a laboratory model system, the soil mite Sancassania berlesei, we show that, controlling for egg size, older mothers lay eggs that hatch later, develop more slowly, and mature at larger body sizes.
   3. Such differences in life histories lead to marked population dynamical effects lasting for multiple generations, as evidenced by an experiment initiated with similarly sized eggs that came from young or old mothers. Differences in maturation from the initial cohort led to differences in population structure and life history that propagated the initial differences over time.
   4. Maternal-age effects, which are not related to gross provisioning of the egg and are therefore phenotypically cryptic, can have profound implications for population dynamics, especially if environmental variation can affect the age structure of the adult population.

AB Aim Variation in species richness has been related to (1) environmental conditions (water, energy and habitat characteristics) and (2) regional differences (contingent historical events and regional particularities that result in differences between regional faunas acting at broad extents). Whereas climatic factors have been widely studied, the effects of regional differences are less often quantified. This work aims to characterize global trends in the species richness of mammal assemblages with respect to both current and historical influences.
   Location All terrestrial biogeographical realms except Antarctica.
   Methods Species richness in checklists from 224 sites distributed worldwide were investigated by partitioning the variation between a general set of habitat/climate factors, biogeographical regions, and their overlaps. Additional analyses studied the specific overlaps of region, water and energy. Data were also divided according to area to determine if the strength of these effects varies according to the size of sites.
   Results Environmental effects explained 38% of richness variation across all sites, whereas environmentally independent regional effects explained 11% and the overlap between region and environment explained 13%. Results were similar when only larger sites (between 1000 km(2) and 10,000 km(2)) were considered. However, the importance of the overlap between region and all environmental variables was greater in smaller sites (between 100 km(2) and 1000 km(2)). In contrast, the specific importance of water and energy variables and their overlap with region was greater in larger sites. The strength of the independent effect of region remained almost invariant regardless of the size of the sites studied.
   Main conclusions The relationship between species richness and climate varies with scale and among regions. Although environmental variables are the strongest correlates of richness, the unique history and physiographic characteristics of a region produce differences between the richness of mammal assemblages and their response to environmental gradients. The importance of environmental variables varies with scale: climatic gradients are more important at coarse grain (larger sites), possibly as a result of their effects on species ranges, whereas habitat type is more important at the smaller sites, where the importance of ecological interactions increases. Therefore, regional differences and the scale at which richness is measured should be taken into account when evaluating species richness-energy hypotheses.

AB A paradox of invasion biology is that even though native species are locally adapted to environmental conditions, nonnative species without this advantage often invade. Ecologists have advanced four main theories to explain why invaders are successful in some places and not others: biotic resistance, environmental resistance, human disturbance, and natural enemies. However, none of these theories alone can account for invasions by two trout species outside their native ranges in North America. Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) are able to displace native cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) in the inland western US, but are themselves displaced by nonnative rainbow trout (O. mykiss) in the southeastern US. An alternative hypothesis is that an interaction among zoogeography, evolutionary history, and environmental resistance from the natural flow regimes can account for this paradox. The nonnative species invade successfully at the southern edge of the ranges of the native species, which are farthest from their ancestral origins. Due to their evolutionary history, the native species are poorly adapted to the natural disturbance regime at the southern limit of their ranges, but the nonnative species are preadapted by chance due to theirs. This alternative hypothesis about the interaction between the historical contingency of evolution and environmental resistance should be more widely tested, to inform both invasion biology and the conservation of native trout.

AB The role of agricultural change in transforming Greek rural landscapes is analysed within the broader context and theory of agricultural transition from traditional to productivist and post-productivist regimes. The analysis is based on remote sensing data following a case study approach in two study sites - Tymfi and Konitsa - located in the Epirus mountain area. Vegetation maps were created for 1945, 1969 and 1995 via 'object oriented image analysis' of a series of air-photographs. A number of landscape metrics was then calculated for each map and the interpreted spatial analysis illustrates that the observed landscape changes are linked to agricultural restructure. During the post war period when agriculture in Western Europe had entered a productivist phase, agricultural change was marked by trends of agricultural abandonment predominantly evident in the upland areas. In contrast, farming persisted at the lowlands and the gradual aggregation of crop fields in few large patches, indicates the existence of productivist agriculture. This landscape transformation suggests that productivist agriculture and land abandonment can coexist in a spatially differentiated pattern. Although since the mid-1980s, the rationale of agricultural policy priorities shifted towards post-productivism, the findings of this study do not support the existence of such a transition. The results are further discussed within the broader context of agricultural change in Europe providing an additional dimension to the discussions regarding the spatio-temporal properties of agricultural transition. Understanding the process of agricultural change could enhance the role of agricultural policy as a tool for landscape management and regional planning. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Information sent by multimodal communication (i.e. signals in multiple sensory modalities) may be redundant('backup' signals) or may vary in content with each mode ('multiple messages'). Males of the brush-legged wolf spider, Schizocosa ocreata ( Hentz) ( Araneae: Lycosidae), use complex multimodal ( visual and seismic) courtship signals. The visual component has previously been shown to be a condition-dependent signal used by females in mate choice. Here, we examine female choice based on isolated seismic signals to identify which aspects females use to evaluate males, and to determine whether visual and seismic signals are redundant. Females showed receptivity when exposed to the seismic component of male courtship alone. The attributes of seismic signals best predicting female receptivity were peak amplitude, peak frequency and maximum frequency of percussive strikes and stridulation pulse duration. Moreover, two behavioural attributes associated with seismic signals, cheliceral strike rate and double-tap rate, were also good predictors of receptivity. Males eliciting female receptivity were in better condition, and attributes of seismic communication were correlated with male size and mass, suggesting the possibility of information about male quality in seismic communication. Trait correlations also revealed overlap in information contained within visual and seismic channels. Given this overlap, we conclude that seismic and visual signals are largely redundant and may serve as backup signals but might also convey information about different male attributes. The use of redundant signalling would be adaptive in S. ocreata because this species inhabits structurally complex forest leaf litter environments where signals can be attenuated rapidly.

AB We asked whether species richness or species identity contributed more to ecosystem function in a trait-based functional group, burrowing, filter-feeding bivalves (freshwater mussels: Unionidae), and whether their importance changed with environmental context and species composition. We conducted a manipulative experiment in a small river examining the effects of mussel assemblages varying from one to eight species on benthic algal standing crop across two sets of environmental conditions: extremely low discharge and high water temperature (summer); and moderate discharge and water temperature (fall). We found strong species identity effects within this guild, with one species (Actinonaias ligamentina) influencing accrual of benthic algae more than other species, but only under summer conditions. We suspect that this effect is due to a combination of the greater biomass of this species and its higher metabolic and excretion rates at warm Summer temperatures, resulting in increased nitrogen subsidies to benthic algae. We also found that Actinonaias influenced the condition of other mussel species, likely through higher consumption, interference, or both. This study demonstrates that species within trait-based functional groups do not necessarily have the same effects on ecosystem properties, particularly under different environmental conditions.

AB Recent studies point to contact and possible admixture among contemporaneous hominin species during the Plio-Pleistocene. However, detection of hybridization in fossils-and especially fossil hominins-is contentious, and it is hindered in large part by our lack of understanding about how morphological hybridity is manifested in the primate skeleton. Here, we report on a study of known-pedigree, purebred yellow and olive baboons (n=112) and their hybrids (n=57), derived from the baboon colony of the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research. The hybrids were analyzed in two different groups: (1) F-1 = olive x yellow first-generation hybrids; (2) B-1 = olive x F-1 backcross hybrids. Thirtynine metric variables were tested for heterosis and dysgenesis. Nonmetric data were also collected from the crania. Results show that these primate hybrids are somewhat heterotic relative to their parental populations, are highly variable, and display novel phenotypes. These effects are most evident in the dentition and probably indicate the mixing of two separately coadapted genomes and the breakdown in the coordination of early development, despite the fact that these populations diverged fairly recently. Similar variation is also observed in museum samples drawn from natural hybrid zones. The results offer a strategy for detecting hybrid zones in the fossil record; implications for interpreting the hominin fossil record are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite the dramatic decrease of atmospheric lead (Pb) concentrations in urban areas of most industrialised countries, we hypothesised that urban common blackbirds (Turdus merula) may still be contaminated by Pb concentrations of toxicological concern due to transfer from soil through the food chain. We sampled blackbirds and earthworms, one of their main preys, in Besanqon, a middle-size city of Eastern France (where atmospheric Pb concentrations decreased from 0.5 mu g/m(3) in 1987 to nearly 0 in 2002) and in a rural reference site. Lead concentrations were determined in the tissues of the different functional groups of earthworms (anecic, epigeous and endogeous) and in blood, washed and unwashed outermost tail feathers and breast feathers of blackbirds. Fresh masses and an index of individual body condition were measured in the two blackbird populations as biomarkers of possible toxic effects. Lead concentrations in earthworms did not differ among functional groups but were significantly higher in urban individuals than in rural ones. Concentrations in outermost tail feathers, breast feathers and blood were significantly higher in urban blackbirds (7.75 +/- 4.50, 3.15 +/- 1.77 and 0.15 +/- 0.09 mu g/g, respectively) than in rural individuals. In urban blackbirds, concentrations in washed and unwashed outermost tail feathers allowed estimating the external contamination (probably due to deposition of dusts and/or to excretion of the uropygial gland) at 37% of the total Pb concentration of the unwashed feathers. Remaining 63% should be linked to food chain transfer of persistent Pb from urban soils. Among the 23 sampled blackbirds, 4 of them (3 in the urban site and I in the rural site) exhibited blood Pb concentrations higher than the benchmark value (0.20 mu g/g) related to subclinical and physiological effects in birds. Variations in body condition index were not correlated to Pb concentrations in blackbird tissues. Present results suggest that Pb may still be of environmental concern for blackbirds in urban areas because of the persistence of Pb in soils and its transfer through the food chain.

AB Understanding the genetic architecture of reproductive barriers and the evolutionary forces that drove their divergence represents a considerable challenge towards understanding speciation. The objective of this study was to determine the genetic basis of intrinsic and extrinsic post-zygotic isolation in diverging populations of dwarf and normal lake whitefish with allopatric glacial origins. We found that the rate of embryonic mortality was 5.3-6.5 times higher in dwarf-normal hybrid backcrosses during development than in F1 dwarf and normal crosses. When comparing embryos that died during development against larvae that successfully hatched, patterns of Mendelian segregation at 101 loci whose linkage is known identified 13 loci distributed over seven linkage groups that exhibited significant shifts in segregation ratios leading to significant segregation distortion at these loci in the surviving progeny. Controlled crosses and quantitative trait loci analysis revealed a significant genetic basis for developmental time until emergence, a trait critical to fish larval survival in nature. Hatching backcross progeny exhibited asynchronous emergence and transgressive segregation, suggesting that extrinsic post-zygotic isolation may select against hybridization in specific environmental contexts. Evidence of a genetic basis for increased embryonic mortality followed by asynchronous emergence indicated that intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms are not mutually exclusive in the formation and maintenance of reproductive isolation, but may be jointly promoting population divergence and ultimately speciation.

AB We are currently experiencing a resurgence of interest in ecogeographical rules, which describe general trends in morphology and related traits along geographical gradients. In order to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the generality and underlying causal mechanisms for these patterns, we recommend a new, more integrated research agenda. In particular, we recommend studies that simultaneously consider different clines in morphology, geographical ranges and diversity as intricately related phenomena; all being ecological, evolutionary and biogeographical responses of organisms to selection regimes that vary non-randomly over space and time, and among species with different ecological and evolutionary histories.

AB Greatly reduced area of old-growth forests and the very low amount of dead wood in managed forests in northern Europe have caused a marked decline in the populations of saproxylic species. It is less clear at which spatial and temporal scales these adverse changes are taking place, and more information is needed to reliably predict which species are especially sensitive to loss and fragmentation of habitat. Here we compare species richness, incidence of occurrence in forest fragments, and abundance of polyporous fungal species and species groups between two regions in Finland with contrasting histories of forestry and a marked difference in the amount and spatial configuration of old-growth forests. We also analyse the consequences of increasing loss of connectivity on the presence and abundance of polypores in a study region with a documented short-term history of old-growth fragmentation. Our results show that the species number, incidence of occurrence, and abundance of especially the rare, threatened, and near-threatened species are much lower in the old-growth fragments in Hame in southern Finland in comparison with Kuhmo in eastern Finland, most probably because of the longer history of intensive forestry in Hame. Among the rare species, the species that show the greatest difference between the two regions (at the scale of 500 km) also tended to respond most strongly to the more recent forest fragmentation within the study region in Kuhmo (at the scale of 50 km). Polypores associated with spruce seem to be more strongly affected by forestry than species associated with pine, possibly reflecting the differences in the natural dynamics of spruce-dominated and pine-dominated forests.

AB The Ranunculus cassubicus complex, comprising diploids and polyploids, is a good model for studying the role of hybridization and polyploidy in the origin of apomixis.
   Results from amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) analyses performed on 448 individuals were combined with evidence from morphology, isozymes, karyology and distribution.
   Our results indicated a unique hybrid origin for the apomictic hexaploid R. carpaticola from north-western Slovakia, involving two sexual parents: autotetraploid R. cassubicifolius from the northern pre-Alps, and diploid R. carpaticola from central Slovakia. The hybrids were intermediate to the parents, but unique alleles have resulted from genomic reorganisation in the allopolyploids, which might also have triggered apomixis. Their distribution patterns and estimated ages suggest that hybridization may be correlated with the last glacial period.
   Hybridization seems to be the major origination for apomicts in the R. cassubicus complex. Polyploidy creates novel sexual genotypes and acts as a springboard for the production of new hybrids, but it only results in a combination with hybridization in apomixis. In turn, asexuality has permitted the perpetuation and establishment of ecologically divergent hybrid genotypes.

AB A recent hypothesis proposes that the bright colors, especially blue and green, of many avian eggs may function as signals of female or offspring phenotypic quality or condition to males in species with biparental care, inducing them to allocate more effort to their offspring. The pigment determining blue and green egg colors is an antioxidant whose availability for eggshell coloring may be limited. To test the signaling function on a species with blue eggs, the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, we measured egg color with a spectrophotometer on the day of laying and obtained two principal components from their reflectance spectra that together explained 99% of variation and represented shell lightness, and hue and saturation, respectively. We also measured female immunocompetence during the nestling period through the response to phytohemagglutinin as a measure of cell-mediated immunity and the response to a tetanus vaccination as a measure of Immoral immunity. The total amount of immunoglobulins in blood of females and of nestlings before fledging was also estimated. Mean within-clutch egg darkness was positively associated with both measures of female immunocompetence, while better female condition was associated with colors tending away from intermediate and toward short wavelengths. Ageing female laid lighter eggs. The mean within-brood level of nestling IgY was also associated with mean within-clutch egg colors tending away from intermediate and toward short wavelengths. Mean egg darkness decreased linearly during the laying sequence, suggesting pigment limitation. Males were observed frequently visiting nests during the laying period, allowing them to observe eggs before the start of incubation. These results support the signaling hypothesis for explaining bright colors of avian eggs.

AB Elucidating the causes of population divergence is a central goal of evolutionary biology. Rock pocket mice, Chaeotdipus intermedius, are an ideal system in which to study intraspecific phenotypic divergence because of the extensive color variation observed within this species. Here, we investigate whether phenotypic variation in color is correlated with local environmental conditions or with phylogenetic history. First, we quantified variation in pelage color ( n = 107 mice) and habitat color ( n = 51 rocks) using a spectrophotometer, and showed that there was a correlation between pelage color and habitat color across 14 sampled populations (R-2 = 0.43). Analyses of mtDNA sequences from these same individuals revealed strong population structure in this species across its range, where most variation (63%) was partitioned between five geographic regions. Using Mantel tests, we show that there is no correlation between color variation and mtDNA phylogeny, suggesting that pelage coloration has evolved rapidly. At a finer geographical scale, high levels of gene flow between neighboring melanic and light populations suggest the selection acting on color must be quite strong to maintain habitat-specific phenotypic distributions. Finally, we raise the possibility that, in some cases, migration between populations of pocket mice inhabiting different lava flows may be responsible for similar melanic phenotypes in different populations. Together, the results suggest that color variation can evolve very rapidly over small geographic scales and that gene flow can both hinder and promote local adaptation.

AB The number and abundance of exotic weeds in native forest fragments are known to correlate with the distance to the nearest large town. This is of concern as land near lowland forest is increasingly being subdivided for housing throughout much of New Zealand. We quantified the relationship between settlements and exotic plants for the coastal forests in eastern Northland, New Zealand. Exotic plant species were sampled in 18 coastal forest areas of varying size, and related to attributes of nearby settlements (housing proximity, density, age, and the exotic plant species present). All settlement attributes were significantly related to the number of exotic species present in neighbouring forest fragments, unlike fragment size. The exotic species found in a particular forest area were significantly more likely to be present in the neighbouring settlement than in other settlements. The number of houses within 250 m of a forest area, alone, explained 66.8% of the variation in the number of exotic plant species in these forests. Our results suggest that proximity and size of settlements are currently the dominant factors controlling the number of exotic plant species in these forest areas, rather than ecological conditions within the forests. Properly managing the locations and densities of new subdivisions, as well as the species grown in gardens in existing and new subdivisions near forest reserves, will reduce the weed pressure and subsequent cost of weed control in these reserves.

AB This study deals with the spatial distribution of macrobenthic communities (biomass and abundance) in the Rio de la Plata estuary, Argentina-Uruguay, and the adjacent shelf waters. The benthic invertebrates were caught with an epibenthic dredge (41 samples). Multivariate analysis (cluster, MDS), SIMPER and BIO-ENV analyses were applied to analyze benthic community structure and their relationships with environmental variables. A consistent large-scale diversity pattern was found: a distinctive estuarine zone could be distinguished, with muddy sediments and a wide range of salinity, characterized by higher abundance of fauna and lower diversity, dominated by the deposit-feeding bivalve Mactra isabelleana; and a marine zone, with sandy-shell debris sediments and higher and less variable salinity values, with higher values of diversity. Major presence of deposit feeders was related to higher particulate organic matter in the estuarine area. Bottom type, salinity and the presence of a turbidity front are considered the main physical variables in structuring benthic communities of the Rio de la Plata estuary. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Shade coffee certification programs have emerged over the past six years to verify that coffee marketed as "shade grown" is actually grown on farms that provide higher quality habitat for biodiversity. In spite of good intentions and an increasing market, little consensus exists on whether current criteria can successfully identify coffee farms of conservation significance. This paper provides the first ecological evaluation and comparison of shade-grown coffee criteria used by major certification programs. Using vegetative data, we evaluated criteria developed by the Rainforest Alliance, the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center (SMBC), and the Specialty Coffee Association of America across a range of coffee agroecosystems in Chiapas, Mexico, to determine which management practices each program would certify. Fruit-feeding butterflies and forest bird species found in these coffee agroecosystems were compared with nearby forest reserves as indicators of biodiversity and conservation potential. These agroecosystems fall into three categories: rustic, commercial polyculture, and shaded monoculture. The rustic system contained significantly higher fruit-feeding butterfly diversity and an avifauna more similar to that found in forest reserves than the other systems. This was also the only agroecosystem that met the criteria for all certification programs, while the shaded monoculture fell short of all sets of criteria. This suggests that certification programs are succeeding in discriminating between the extremes of shade coffee production. Certification programs differed, however, in their treatment of the intermediate, commercial polyculture systems, reflecting different philosophies for conservation in managed ecosystems. Programs promoted by SMBC use high standards that would exclude all but the most diverse commercial polyculture or rustic systems to certify only those systems that support high levels of biodiversity. The program supported by the Rainforest Alliance only excludes the. shaded monoculture while engaging the others in the move toward greater sustainability. The merits of each approach should be put to rigorous debate, and their ability to contribute to biodiversity conservation should be reflected in product marketing. This study suggests that further research can provide a stronger scientific basis and independent verification for the certification of green products that claim to enhance biodiversity conservation in tropical agroecosystems.

AB This study examines the short-term impact of forest soil compaction and organic matter removal on soil mesofauna, in general, and oribatid mite species, in particular. Both soil compaction and organic matter removal reduced the density of soil mesofauna. Stem-only harvesting reduced total mesofauna densities by 20% relative to uncut forest values. A combination of whole-tree harvest and forest floor removal with heavy soil compaction significantly reduced total soil mesofauna densities by 93% relative to the uncut forest control. Removal of the forest floor represents a substantial loss of habitat for most soil mesofauna. The forest floor apparently buffered the mineral soil by limiting both the impact of soil compaction and fluctuations in soil temperature and moisture. The relative abundance of Prostigmata and Mesostigmata increased with treatment severity, whereas that of Oribatida decreased. Species richness of the oribatid mite fauna was reduced as the severity of treatments increased. The number of rare oribatid species (those representing <1% of the total oribatid mite sample) decreased by 40% or more relative to the uncut forest control. Evenness also decreased as treatment severity increased. Oppiella nova and Suctobelbella sp. near acutidens were the dominant oribatid species in both the forest floor and mineral soil, regardless of treatment. Soil compaction and organic matter removal significantly impacted the density and diversity of soil mesofauna and oribatid mite fauna in the short term at these study sites.

AB The azooxanthellate scleractinian coral Lophelia pertusa has a near-cosmopolitan distribution, with a main depth distribution between 200 and 1000 m. In the northeast Atlantic it is the main framework-building species, forming deep-sea reefs in the bathyal zone on the continental margin, offshore banks and in Scandinavian fjords. Recent studies have shown that deep-sea reefs are associated with a highly diverse fauna. Such deep-sea communities are subject to increasing impact from deep-water fisheries, against a background of poor knowledge concerning these ecosystems, including the biology and population structure of L. pertusa. To resolve the population structure and to assess the dispersal potential of this deep-sea coral, specific microsatellites markers and ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences ITS1 and ITS2 were used to investigate 10 different sampling sites, distributed along the European margin and in Scandinavian fjords. Both microsatellite and gene sequence data showed that L. pertusa should not be considered as one panmictic population in the northeast Atlantic but instead forms distinct, offshore and fjord populations. Results also suggest that, if some gene flow is occurring along the continental slope, the recruitment of sexually produced larvae is likely to be strongly local. The microsatellites showed significant levels of inbreeding and revealed that the level of genetic diversity and the contribution of asexual reproduction to the maintenance of the subpopulations were highly variable from site to site. These results are of major importance in the generation of a sustainable management strategy for these diversity-rich deep-sea ecosystems.

AB Classical metapopulation (CM) theory considers that species persistence in the landscape depends on a turnover of extinction-(re)colonisation of suitable habitat patches at each generation. Therefore, metapoputation dynamics are approximated by binary changes in the state of individual patches. This approach has allowed rigorous mathematical analyses of metapopulation dynamics, establishing links with general laws in ecology or deriving operational concepts in conservation biology. However, a critical review of the literature shows that only a few spatially structured populations function according to CM theory. Moreover, empirical studies of CMs usually focus on species (1) at the margin of their distribution range, (2) with small or extremely small local population sizes and (3) declining in the study area (expanding in one case). Such non-equilibrium population systems are far from the equilibrium world idealised in CM models. Furthermore, empirical comparisons of metapopulations in highly fragmented landscapes show that extinction-(re)colonisation dynamics match those predicted by the theory only when local populations are very small. The lack of correspondence between CM theory and the real, natural world may explain why models and concepts derived from the theory are not used in population viability analysis or conservation strategies. The final message of this paper is three-fold: (1) exclusive, implicit assimilation of spatially structured populations to CMs should be avoided, (2) attempts to manage any population using CM theory should be preceded by careful examination of the correspondence between the field situation and assumptions of the theory (particularly regarding the high rate of local population turnover and the equilibrium state of the metapopulation) and (3) theorists should avoid to present CM theory and derived concepts as the only conservation framework for populations confronted with habitat loss and fragmentation.

AB Due primarily to anthropogenic influences such as land use change, exotic species introductions, livestock grazing, altered hunting regimes, and predator control, wild ungulate populations have undergone tremendous shifts in recent decades. Although the result has been endangerment or extirpation in some regions, ungulate numbers have increased to locally or regionally high levels in other areas, causing shifts in plant species composition, problems for forest regeneration, and conflict with humans and domestic livestock. Our ability to find solutions to these problems is limited because we lack sufficient understanding of how ungulate species interact with predators, habitat, forage, competing species, and humans at multiple scales from small foraging patches to large regions.
   To bring together new findings in this area, encompassing various scales and foci of investigation, an international conference on "Forest Dynamics and Ungulate Herbivory" was held from 3 to 6 October 2001 in Davos, Switzerland. We provide a synthetic overview of the papers contained in this Special Issue, arising from that conference. A companion Special Issue of the Journal for Nature Conservation is devoted to the more management-oriented aspects of forest-ungulate interactions, entitled "Forest-Ungulate Interactions: Monitoring, Modeling and Management."
   From the papers in this issue, a number of important generalizations emerge to guide our understanding and further research. Our predictive understanding of foraging ecology needs to be generalized and scaled up, if it is to become useful for predicting the consequences of herbivory for broad-scale vegetation dynamics. Further, it is important to move beyond single-factor studies, to embrace the complexity of ungulate-vegetation interactions. The direction and magnitude of ungulate influences can be difficult to gauge because of complex interactions among species, structural units of vegetation or landscapes, ecosystem processes, and natural disturbances. Researchers need to look beyond the simplistic concept of "game damage", and comprehensively address the direct and indirect effects of ungulates on communities, ecosystems and landscapes. This may require a more systems-oriented, and less species-oriented approach. Ungulate-vegetation interactions need to be better understood over multiple scales, and particularly at the coarser scales that are of interest to managers and policy-makers. Finally, a long-term view of ungulate-vegetation interactions, where past, present, and future effects are considered in their appropriate temporal context, is absolutely essential.

AB This paper investigates the possible contribution of Short Rotation Cultures (SRC) to carbon sequestration in both current and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CO2]). A dense poplar plantation (1 x 1 m) was exposed to a [CO2] of 550 ppm in Central Italy using the free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technique. Three species of Populus were examined, namely P. alba L., P. nigra L. and P. x euramericana Dode (Guinier). Aboveground woody biomass of trees exposed to elevated [CO2] for three growing seasons increased by 15 to 27%, depending on species. As a result, light-use efficiency increased. Aboveground biomass allocation was unaffected, and belowground biomass also increased under elevated [CO2] conditions, by 22 to 38%. Populus nigra, with total biomass equal to 62.02 and 72.03 Mg ha(-1) in ambient and elevated [CO2], respectively, was the most productive species, although its productivity was stimulated least by atmospheric CO2 enrichment. There was greater depletion of inorganic nitrogen from the soil after three growing seasons in elevated [CO2], but no effect of [CO2] on stem wood density, which differed significantly only among species.

AB The impact of disturbance on species diversity may be related to the spatial scales over which it occurs. Here I assess the impact of logging and ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) -induced burning and forest isolation on the species richness (477 species out of more than 28,000 individuals) and community composition of butterflies and butterfly guilds using small (0.9 ha) plots nested within large (450 ha) landscapes. The landscapes were located in three habitat classes: (1) continuous, unburned forest; (2) unburned isolates surrounded by burned forest; and (3) burned forest. Plots with different logging histories were sampled within the two unburned habitat classes, allowing for independent assessment of the two disturbance factors (logging and burning). Disturbance within habitat classes (logging) had a very different impact on butterfly diversity than disturbance among habitat classes (due to ENSO-induced burning and isolation). Logging increased species richness, increased evenness, and lowered dominance. Among guilds based on larval food plants, the species richness of tree and herb specialists was higher in logged areas but their abundance was lower. Both generalist species richness and abundance was higher in logged areas. Among habitat classes, species richness was lower in burned forest and isolates than continuous forest but there was no overall difference in evenness or dominance. Among guilds, generalist species richness was significantly lower in burned forest and isolates than continuous forest. Generalist abundance was also very low in the isolates. There was no difference among disturbance classes in herb specialist species richness but abundance was significantly higher in the isolates and burned forest than in continuous forest. Tree specialist species richness was lower in burned forest than continuous forest but did not differ between continuous forest and isolates.
   The scale of assessment proved important in estimating the impact of disturbance on species richness. Within disturbance classes, the difference in species richness between primary and logged forest was more pronounced at the smaller spatial scale. Among disturbance classes, the difference in species richness between continuous forest and isolates or burned forest was more pronounced at the larger spatial scale. The lower levels of species richness in ENSO-affected areas and at the larger (landscape) spatial scale indicate that future severe ENSO events may prove one of the most serious threats to extant biodiversity.

AB 1. Factors influencing post-fledging movements before the first breeding attempt were studied in individually marked greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber roseus ) born in the Camargue, southern France, between their natal area and their principal wintering grounds (Spain, Sardinia, Tunisia and France) from 1995 to 1999.
   2. We tested whether post-fledging dispersal was affected by sex, age, year, body condition, body mass and tarsus length using a multistate capture-recapture modelling approach. We focused particularly on the hypothesis that increased movement probabilities were associated with good and poor body condition. Because long-distance dispersal is energetically expensive and may involve a high risk of mortality, the acquisition of a robust physical condition prior to dispersal probably plays a critical role in determining the extent to which animals disperse. At the other extreme, birds in poor condition either leave their natal area or starve, which should result in relatively high dispersal rates.
   3. Movement probabilities were not sex-dependent, but were age-dependent with high movement probabilities during the first year of life (above 0.6) and low probabilities after the first year (0.055). Movement probabilities also differed between years and localities.
   4. Movement probability from the natal area was related to the body condition (and body mass) of the fledglings, with a high movement probability (0.873) when juveniles were in good body condition, and a relatively lower probability (from 0.629 to 0.724) when juveniles were in poorer condition. The proportion of variability in dispersal explained by body condition and body mass were 90.9% and 63.5%, respectively.
   5. Results support the hypothesis that condition affects dispersal patterns from the natal area. They also suggest that body condition and local environmental conditions during the early growth play a role in dispersal.

AB Little is known about the mechanisms behind positive effects of species richness on ecosystem functioning. In a previous study that showed a positive effect of aquatic detritivore species richness on leaf litter breakdown (process) rates, we proposed that facilitation and release from intra-specific interference were the two most likely mechanisms. To test the interference hypothesis, we performed an experiment using three densities of each of three detritivore species and found varying effects on leaf breakdown rates across species: one species showed no effect, one a positive, marginally insignificant, effect, and a third species showed a significant, positive effect of decreasing density. The density (interference) effect thus partly explained the results from our previous study. The facilitation hypothesis was tested by sequentially introducing and removing two species. We predicted that, if this hypothesis were true, facilitation would be expressed in higher process rates than when replacing with individuals of the same species. We found that process rate per unit biomass did increase when one species was introduced after the other species, while the opposite sequence did not show any increase. Hence, this result was also confirmative of our previous results. Therefore, we conclude that both intra-specific interference and inter-specific facilitation may explain the positive effect of species richness observed in our system. Since many species exhibit intra-specific interference that inhibits foraging efficiency, this may be a general mechanism generating effects of species richness per se. If facilitation is unidirectional, or if it involves few species, it is more likely to be species specific with species identities being more important than species richness per se. We conclude that species loss may be expected to have negative consequences on ecosystem functioning if any species is lost, with additional effects in the event of losing "facilitator" species.

AB To investigate the effects of urbanization on carabid beetles (Carabidae) and ground dwelling spiders (Araneae) a study was completed along a 20 km urban-rural forest gradient in the Helsinki-Espoo area of southern Finland. To study changes in assemblage structure, abundance and species richness, these taxa were collected in the year 2000 using pitfall traps, which had been placed in four forest sites within each of the urban, suburban and rural zones. We expected to find changes in the abundances and species richnesses in the two taxa across the urban-rural gradient, but did not find any. Our second and third hypotheses, stating that generalist species and small-bodied species should gain dominance along the gradient from rural to urban sites, were partly supported as carabid specialists were more characteristic of suburban and rural environments whereas generalists were more likely to be collected from rural areas compared to suburban or urban sites. Furthermore, medium to large-sized carabid individuals were more likely to be collected in the rural sites compared to urban forests. We found no evidence for significant changes in spider abundance or species richness across the urban-rural gradient in relation to body size or habitat specialization. We suggest that urbanization does not have significant effects on the total abundances and species richnesses in these two taxa. However, individual species responded differently to urbanization, and there were significant differences in the specialization and body sizes of carabids across the gradient.

AB We used the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method to obtain genetic markers distinguishing two subspecies of willow warblers Phylloscopus trochilus that have different migratory behaviours but are not differentiated in mitochondrial DNA or at several microsatellite loci. With the inverse-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach we converted a dominant AFLP-marker to a codominant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Across Scandinavia we typed 621 birds at the SNP locus AFLP-WW1 and we found a sigmoid change in allele frequencies centred around 62 degrees latitude. North of the latitudinal cline was a west-east cline. Both clines are narrower than one would expect from dispersal distances in willow warblers, which suggests that these are maintained by selection. The latitudinal cline at the locus AFLP-WW1 is paralleled by changes in several other traits, all of which might be maintained by a single selective force. The most plausible selection factor that we have identified is selection against hybrids because of inferior migratory behaviour. The selective force maintaining the east-west cline is less obvious. We discuss alternatives to the selection scenario, involving colonization history and asymmetric gene flow.

AB This study aims to define the level of naturalness in the protected forests of eastern Fennoscandia, i.e. to determine how natural or semi-natural are the currently protected and unmanaged forests, and the extent to which the past human influence has affected the current forest structure. The plots used in the study represent both currently unmanaged and managed forests. The unmanaged forests are located in nature protection areas. We have used data from earlier forest inventories, determined by the visual estimation of compartments, together with the measured stand variables. The data cover detailed analysis of 79 forest sites or stands in both in mesic and sub-xeric forests. The whole successional gradient is included in the data.
   In unmanaged forests, fellings have occurred on 39% of the sample plots in sub-xeric areas, and on 28% of the sample plots in mesic areas. According to the historical records 33% of all the unmanaged forests have definitely been (selectively) felled, 21% possibly, and 46% show no signs of fellings. In general, the unmanaged forests in eastern Finland bear ample evidence of light selection felling, Thus, these stands could better be regarded as semi-natural rather than natural forests. Mesic old-growth stands are less affected (73% are completely untouched), but the tree volume data, number of tree storeys and the signs of slash-and-burn cultivation are nevertheless clear evidence of the impact of human activities.
   The growing intensity of human activities since the 1950s can also be seen in semi-natural succession forests as the presence of cut stumps and the probability of felling in young stages. Real natural/semi-natural sapling and young forests are very rare and occur only in Russia. The diameter distribution in semi-natural sapling and young forests with reverse J-shaped distributions showed considerably greater variation. Also the mature and old-growth, semi-natural forests were characterised by the decrease in reverse J-shaped distributions. The timber volume in stands was generally lower at the beginning of the 20th century. Overall, the forests in nature reserves axe structurally rather different to those growing at the beginning of the 20th century, and show patterns not typical of natural forests. The slash-and-burn agriculture practised during the 1800s and earlier has profoundly affected the natural spatial and temporal disturbance regimes, with clear consequences for the current tree species and age composition. More recent deviations from the natural forest structures are, however, largely due to the absence of natural and anthropogenic forest fires during the 1900s. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB We examined factors influencing the structure of naturally replicated. taxonomically unrestricted communities inhabiting South American tank bromeliads. We measured aspects of plant physical structure and collected the entire macroscopic fauna of 209 bromeliads from the Yasuni Scientific Reserve in lowland eastern Ecuador. We collected a total of 11219 individuals of 354 morphospecies, The morphospecies abundance distribution of our sample was approximated by a log-series distribution dominated by rare morphospecies (57% of the morphospecies ere represented by a single individual. Six methods for estimating the total number of bromeliad associated morphospecies in our study area gave results which varied by a factor of three. illustrating that caution should be exercised in interpreting the results of am single estimator. Variation in plant volume, number of leases. detritus content. and water volume explained 62%, of the variation in morphospecies richness among plants. Finally there as a quadratic relationship between bode mass and both individual abundance and morphospecies richness in Our sample. These results illustrate an important role of both biotic and abiotic factors influencing the Structure of taxonomically unrestricted. ecologically defined natural communities.

AB Differences in growth conditions during early life have been suggested to cause long-lasting effects on morphology and quality of adult birds. We experimentally investigated the effect of early growth conditions on the expression of sexual ornaments later in life in male ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus). We also investigated the effects on immune function, as it could be a functional link between early nutrition and ornament expression. We manipulated the dietary protein intake during the first eight weeks post hatching. Males receiving fodder with 27% protein during the first three weeks of life grew larger and more colourful wattles when sexually mature than males receiving a low-protein diet (20.5% protein). Spur length was unaffected by diet treatment. Manipulation of food protein levels during weeks 4-8 after hatching had no effect on the development of ornaments. The different protein treatments had no long-term effect on either humoral or cell-mediated immune responses. There was, however, a positive relationship between spur length and cell-mediated immune responsiveness. Our study shows that expression of a sexual ornament in adult pheasants reflects nutritional conditions early in life. Because the expression of secondary sexual ornaments is affected by conditions during early growth, by selecting more ornamented males, females would choose mates that are superior at handling early nutritional stress. If the susceptibility to early nutritional stress also has a hereditary basis, females may benefit by obtaining 'good genes'.

AB Tropical forest gaps are ephemeral and patchily distributed within forest areas and have very different light environments compared with closed-canopy forest. We used fruit-baited traps to investigate if gaps are exploited by more opportunistic butterfly species compared with closed-canopy forest. Gaps supported a higher diversity of butterflies in terms of species evenness but closed-canopy sites contained species with more restricted geographical distributions. There was little similarity between the assemblages of butterflies trapped in the canopy and those in either gap or closed-canopy sites, but the greater similarity was with gaps, and increased diversity in gaps was partly due to canopy species turning up in gaps. Dispersal rates (as measured by recapture rates) were higher in gaps and there was evidence that butterflies in gaps had relatively larger and broader thoraxes, indicating a flight morphology adapted for faster flight. These results support the notion of a distinctive gap fauna comprising more widespread, mobile species. Habitat modification that opens up the canopy is likely to result in an increase in these widespread species and a decline in understorey species with restricted distributions.

AB We studied the zooplankton community structure in a set of 33 interconnected shallow ponds that are restricted to a relatively small area ('De Maten', Genk, Belgium, 200 ha). As the ponds share the same water source, geology and history, and as the ponds are interconnected (reducing chance effects of dispersal with colonisation), differences in zooplankton community structure can be attributed to local biotic and abiotic interactions. We studied zooplankton community, biotic (phytoplankton, macrophyte cover, fish densities, macroinvertebrate densities), abiotic (turbidity, nutrient concentrations, pH, conductivity, iron concentration) and morphometric (depth, area, perimeter) characteristics of the different ponds. Our results indicate that the ponds differ substantially in their zooplankton community structure, and that these differences are strongly related to differences in trophic structure and biotic interactions, in concordance with the theory of alternative equilibria. Ponds in the clear-water state are characterised by large Daphnia species and species associated with the littoral zone, low chlorophyll-a concentrations, low fish densities and high macroinvertebrate densities. Ponds in the turbid-water state are characterised by high abundances of rotifers, cyclopoid copepods and the opposite environmental conditions. Some ponds show an intermediate pattern, with a dominance of small Daphnia species. Our results show that interconnected ponds may differ strongly in zooplankton community composition, and that these differences are related to differences in predation intensity (top-down) and habitat diversity (macrophyte cover).

AB The diversity of beetle assemblages in different habitat types (primary forest, logged forest, acacia plantation and oil palm plantation) in Sabah, Malaysia was investigated using three different methods based on habitat levels (Winkler sampling, flight-interception-trapping and mist-blowing). The overall diversity was extremely high, with 1711 species recorded from only 8028 individuals and 81 families (115 family and subfamily groups). Different degrees of environmental changes had varying effects on the beetle species richness and abundance, with oil palm plantation assemblage being most severely affected, followed by acacia plantation and then logged forest. A few species became numerically dominant in the oil palm plantation. In terms of beetle species composition, the acacia fauna showed much similarity with the logged forest fauna, and the oil palm fauna was very different from the rest. The effects of environmental variables (number of plant species, sapling and tree densities, amount of leaf litter, ground cover, canopy cover, soil pH and compaction) on the beetle assemblage were also investigated. Leaf litter correlated with species richness, abundance and composition of subterranean beetles. Plant species richness, tree and sapling densities correlated with species richness, abundance and composition of understorey beetles while ground cover correlated only with the species richness and abundance of these beetles. Canopy cover correlated only with arboreal beetles. In trophic structure, predators represented more than 40% of the species and individuals. Environmental changes affected the trophic structure with proportionally more herbivores (abundance) but fewer predators (species richness and abundance) in the oil palm plantation. Biodiversity, conservation and practical aspects of pest management were also highlighted in this study.

AB To determine whether plant genotype can affect long-term herbivore population dynamics, we used a density manipulation experiment to compare the dynamics of Mexican bean beetle populations living on four genotypes of soybeans. Five densities of beetle populations were created on each plant genotype. Each combination of density and genotype was replicated four times, yielding 80 experimental beetle populations. Populations were initiated by releasing adult beetles into 2.25 m(2) cages filled with soybeans and located in a small soybean field. Beetle populations were censused weekly for one generation. Recruitment curves for beetle populations on each soybean genotype were plotted by fitting a Picker model to the data using likelihood methods. The recruitment curves for all genotypes were significantly different from the curves for all other genotypes. The equilibrium beetle density predicted from the curves varied among genotypes by nearly twofold, and the predicted dynamics were fluctuating for all genotypes, with the period of fluctuations differing among genotypes. Performance of beetles also differed among genotypes, suggesting that these genotypes vary in some aspect of their quality as hosts for the beetles. These results indicate that differences in quality among genotypes have the potential to affect long-term herbivore dynamics.

AB Morphological correlates of diet were sought among 18 species of distantly related freshwater fishes from Guinea (West Africa). With regard to the percentage occurrence of six food items, the studied species could be classified into four broad trophic categories reflecting what was eaten and where: detritivores. piscivores, surface feeders and benthic invertivores. Detrivory was associated with a high relative gut length and eyes in a dorsal position: piscivory with large body and mouth size; surface feeding with a dorsally orientated mouth; and benthic invertivory with eyes in a lateral position and small relative gut length. Similarity in diet and in morphology were both significantly correlated with taxonomic relatedness. Nevertheless, when taxonomic relatedness was accounted for, the relationship between observed similarity in diet and similarity in diet predicted from morphology was still significant. This result leads to the conclusion that species having similar diet lend to converge for some morphological attributes. (C) 1999 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

AB The stimulatory effect of earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris is L.) on soil microbial activity was studied under microcosm-controlled conditions. The hypothesis was tested that microbial stimulation observed in the presence of a soil invertebrate would be due to the utilization of additional nutritive substances (secretion and excretion products) that it provides. Changes in microbial activity were monitored by measuring simultaneously CO2 release and protozoan population density. The increase in CO2 released in the presence of earthworms was found to result from both earthworm respiration and enhanced microbial respiration. The stimulation of microbial activity was confirmed by a significant increase in protozoan population density, which was 3-19 times greater in the presence of earthworms. The respiratory rate of L. terrestris was estimated to be 53 mu l O-2 g(-1) h(-1). Earthworm respiration significantly correlated with individual earthworm weight, but there was no correlation between the increase in microbial respiration and earthworm weight. This finding does not support the hypothesis given above that enhanced microbial respiration is due to utilization of earthworm excreta, A new hypothesis that relationships between microbial activity and earthworms are not based on trophic links alone but also on catalytic mechanisms is proposed and discussed.

AB Disruption of grazer populations, or mismatches between phytoplankton blooms and population dynamics of their planktonic and benthic grazers, may play an important role in the initiation of some harmful algal blooms. The Laguna Madre of Texas has experienced a persistent, nearly monospecific phytoplankton bloom since January 1990 commonly referred to as the ''brown tide.'' Whole-water samples collected in the area where the bloom began reveal the pattern of bloom initiation and dispersion during the first few months of the bloom. Enumeration of microzooplankton from these same samples also reveals that protozoan grazer populations were depressed and nearly eliminated before the bloom began. Benthic biomass and species diversity also declined before the onset of the bloom. The disruption of planktonic and benthic grazers may have been due to extreme hypersaline conditions caused by an extended period of drought (salinities > 60 parts per thousand). A massive fish kill caused by an abnormal period of below freezing temperatures released a pulse of nutrients into an already disturbed environment allowing this nuisance bloom to become established. Planktonic and benthic grazers have been unable to contribute to the demise of this bloom, which has persisted for >7 yr without interruption.

AB 1. Atyid (Decapoda: Atyidae) shrimps influence the distribution of algal communities over different scales in tropical montane streams of Puerto Rico. Within pools of an atyid-dominated stream, atyid shrimps enhanced patchiness in algal communities along the depth gradient. Algal bands occurred in shallow pool margins where atyids did not forage (< 3 cm below water surface), with significantly greater standing crop, taxon richness, and structural complexity than deeper areas. In deeper water, atyids reduced small-scale patchiness in algal community composition and maintained a low-growing understorey turf dominated by sessile diatoms (Bacillariophyta) and, sometimes, closely cropped, filamentous blue-greens (Cyanophyta).
   2. Among pools of the atyid-dominated stream, atyids interacted with light to determine algal patchiness between stream margins and deeper areas. In sunny pools, algal standing crop was 140-fold greater in pool margins than in peeper areas where atyids foraged. In shaded pools, however, standing crop in pool margins was only 5-fold greater than in deeper areas. Effects of light on algal standing crop were greater outside atyid foraging areas than within,indicating that shrimp grazing overrides the positive effects of light.
   3. In contrast to the atyid-dominated stream, algal communities in an atyid-poor stream were characterized by a high biomass of loosely attached epipelic diatoms and no depth zonation. Interstream rock and shrimp transplant experiments indicated that atyids significantly reduced algal standing crop and altered community composition on rocks from atyid-poor streams within 24 h. Results support the hypothesis that atyid shrimps play a major role in determining observed interstream differences in algal communities.

AB Information about the changing status and extinction rates of invertebrates in the United Kingdom during the past 100-300 years is reviewed. Although historical recording was more thorough in the U.K. than elsewhere, the data are patchy and difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, we conclude that the extinction rates of U.K. invertebrates have matched, and probably exceeded, those of vertebrates and vascular plants in the present century. The main reasons for decline are analysed. No clear pattern of threat was found among aquatic species, but there was a very clear pattern in terrestrial biotopes, where most endangered species inhabit either the earliest or latest successional stages. The former group consists mainly of thermophilous species, which may be relies from a period when U.K. summer temperatures were warmer, and which survived in warm refugia created by the land management of prehistoric man. These types of habitat have largely disappeared from modern biotopes, and their dynamics have also changed. In all systems, many invertebrates are too sedentary to track their habitats in the modern landscape.

SO WEED RESEARCH

DT Article
ID WEEDS
AB Two cultivars of each of three spring cereals (wheat, barley and oats) were grown with Avena fatua in a box experiment, where the effects of root and shoot competition were separated using soil and aerial partitions.  Measures of resource complementarity (RYT) and of the relative severity of competition indicated that competition for soil resources, particularly nitrogen, was more severe than competition for aerial resources, i.e. light.  When both root and shoot competition occurred, oats and barley were generally more competitive than wheat, but there were significant differences in competitive ability between cultivars of all three cereals.  Although competition between cereals and A. fatua occurred predominantly below-ground, the various cultivars only differed slightly in root competitive ability against weeds.  Nitrogen fertilizer did not significantly change the ranking of competitive abilities of the cultivars.  Although shoot competition had less effect than root competition, the various cereals differed markedly in shoot competitive ability.  The two oat cultivars, and the barley cultivar Egmont, had higher shoot competitive abilities than the two wheat cultivars or the barley cultivar Goldmarker.  There was little evidence that differences in shoot competitive ability were due to differences in plant height.

AB Freshwater fish represent one-fourth of the world's vertebrates and provide irreplaceable goods and services but are increasingly affected by human activities. A new index, Cumulative Change in Biodiversity Facets, revealed marked changes in biodiversity in >50% of the world's rivers covering >40% of the world's continental surface and >37% of the world's river length, whereas <14% of the world's surface and river length remain least impacted. Present-day rivers are more similar to each other and have more fish species with more diverse morphologies and longer evolutionary legacies. In temperate rivers, where the impact has been greatest, biodiversity changes were primarily due to river fragmentation and introduction of non-native species.

AB On-line analysis of exhaled breath offers insight into a person's metabolism without the need for sample preparation or sample collection. Due to its noninvasive nature and the possibility to sample continuously, the analysis of breath has great clinical potential. The unique features of this technology make it an attractive candidate for applications in medicine, beyond the task of diagnosis. We review the current methodologies for on-line breath analysis, discuss current and future applications, and critically evaluate challenges and pitfalls such as the need for standardization. Special emphasis is given to the use of the technology in diagnosing respiratory diseases, potential niche applications, and the promise of breath analysis for personalized medicine. The analytical methodologies used range from very small and low-cost chemical sensors, which are ideal for continuous monitoring of disease status, to optical spectroscopy and state-of-the-art, high-resolution mass spectrometry. The latter can be utilized for untargeted analysis of exhaled breath, with the capability to identify hitherto unknown molecules. The interpretation of the resulting big data sets is complex and often constrained due to a limited number of participants. Even larger data sets will be needed for assessing reproducibility and for validation of biomarker candidates. In addition, molecular structures and quantification of compounds are generally not easily available from on-line measurements and require complementary measurements, for example, a separation method coupled to mass spectrometry. Furthermore, a lack of standardization still hampers the application of the technique to screen larger cohorts of patients. This review summarizes the present status and continuous improvements of the principal on-line breath analysis methods and evaluates obstacles for their wider application.

AB In a rapidly changing climate, alpine plants may persist by adapting to new conditions. However, the rate at which the climate is changing might exceed the rate of adaptation through evolutionary processes in long-lived plants. Persistence may depend on phenotypic plasticity in morphology and physiology. Here we investigated patterns of leaf trait variation including leaf area, leaf thickness, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nutrients (C, N, P) and isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) across an elevation gradient on Gongga Mountain, Sichuan Province, China. We quantified inter- and intra-specific trait variation and the plasticity in leaf traits of selected species to experimental warming and cooling by using a reciprocal transplantation approach. We found substantial phenotypic plasticity in most functional traits where ON, leaf area, and leaf P showed greatest plasticity. These traits did not correspond with traits with the largest amount of intraspecific variation. Plasticity in leaf functional traits tended to enable plant populations to shift their trait values toward the mean values of a transplanted plants' destination community, but only if that population started with very different trait values. These results suggest that leaf trait plasticity is an important mechanism for enabling plants to persist within communities and to better tolerate changing environmental conditions under climate change.

AB Governance is one of the most important factors for ensuring effective environmental management and conservation actions. Yet, there is still a relative paucity of comprehensive and practicable guidance that can be used to frame the evaluation, design, and analysis of systems of environmental governance. This conceptual review and synthesis article seeks to addresses this problem through resituating the broad body of governance literature into a practical framework for environmental governance. Our framework builds on a rich history of governance scholarship to propose that environmental governance has four general aims or objectives - to be effective, to be equitable, to be responsive, and to be robust. Each of these four objectives need to be considered simultaneously across the institutional, structural, and procedural elements of environmental governance. Through a review of the literature, we developed a set of attributes for each of these objectives and relate these to the overall capacity, functioning, and performance of environmental governance. Our aim is to provide a practical and adaptable framework that can be applied to the design, evaluation, and analysis of environmental governance in different social and political contexts, to diverse environmental problems and modes of governance, and at a range of scales.

AB Human activities pose severe threats to ecosystems. As the Earth's third pole, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) provides various ecosystem services for human beings, including water resources for nearly 40% of the world's population. In this study, four categories of human pressures on the environment were analyzed firstly and then summed cumulatively to map the human influence intensity (HII) in the TP for 1990-2010 at county and 1 km scales. Subsequently, HII characteristics within valuable regions for water retention and biodiversity conservation were analyzed. The results showed that HII of the TP was low overall. The eastern and southeastern TP and the central part of the Tibet Autonomous Region saw high HII. For 1990-2010, the 1 km scale mean HII increased by 28.43%, which is much greater than the global level of 9% for 1993-2009, suggesting that the TP and the ecosystem services it provided may face with more threats. HII increase was mainly observed in the northeastern TP. Rapid increase of human activities within valuable regions for water retention and biodiversity conservation during 1990-2010 were detected, especially for the former. The obtained temporally-consistent HII datasets will be conducive to ecosystem services related decision making. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ecological data often exhibit spatial pattern, which can be modeled as autocorrelation. Conditional autoregressive (CAR) and simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models are network-based models (also known as graphical models) specifically designed to model spatially autocorrelated data based on neighborhood relationships. We identify and discuss six different types of practical ecological inference using CAR and SAR models, including: (1) model selection, (2) spatial regression, (3) estimation of autocorrelation, (4) estimation of other connectivity parameters, (5) spatial prediction, and (6) spatial smoothing. We compare CAR and SAR models, showing their development and connection to partial correlations. Special cases, such as the intrinsic autoregressive model (IAR), are described. Conditional autoregressive and SAR models depend on weight matrices, whose practical development uses neighborhood definition and row-standardization. Weight matrices can also include ecological covariates and connectivity structures, which we emphasize, but have been rarely used. Trends in harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in southeastern Alaska from 463 polygons, some with missing data, are used to illustrate the six inference types. We develop a variety of weight matrices and CAR and SAR spatial regression models are fit using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Profile likelihood graphs illustrate inference for covariance parameters. The same data set is used for both prediction and smoothing, and the relative merits of each are discussed. We show the nonstationary variances and correlations of a CAR model and demonstrate the effect of row-standardization. We include several take-home messages for CAR and SAR models, including (1) choosing between CAR and IAR models, (2) modeling ecological effects in the covariance matrix, (3) the appeal of spatial smoothing, and (4) how to handle isolated neighbors. We highlight several reasons why ecologists will want to make use of autoregressive models, both directly and in hierarchical models, and not only in explicit spatial settings, but also for more general connectivity models.

AB Birds that travel long distances between their wintering and breeding grounds may be particularly susceptible to neurotoxic insecticides, but the influence of insecticides on migration ability is poorly understood. Following acute exposure to two widely used agricultural insecticides, imidacloprid (neonicotinoid) and chlorpyrifos (organophosphate), we compared effects on body mass, migratory activity and orientation in a seed-eating bird, the white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys). During spring migration, sparrows were captured, held and dosed by gavage daily for 3 days with either the vehicle control, low (10% LD50) or high (25% LD50) doses of imidacloprid or chlorpyrifos and tested in migratory orientation trials pre-exposure, post-exposure and during recovery. Control birds maintained body mass and a seasonally appropriate northward orientation throughout the experiment. Imidacloprid dosed birds exhibited significant declines in fat stores and body mass (mean loss: -17% low, -25% high dose) and failed to orient correctly. Chlorpyrifos had no overt effects on mass but significantly impaired orientation. These results suggest that wild songbirds consuming the equivalent of just four imidacloprid-treated canola seeds or eight chlorpyrifos granules per day over 3 days could suffer impaired condition, migration delays and improper migratory direction, which could lead to increased risk of mortality or lost breeding opportunity.

AB Many species in the family Pinaceae are invaders. These species are relatively easy to control because of some of their intrinsic characteristics and because they are highly visible and easy to eliminate. Many Pinaceae species have been well studied because of their use in forestry and their invasive behavior in many countries. The impacts of invasive Pinaceae are not only ecological, but also economic and social. We review the ecology and management of Pinaceae invasions and explore how restoration of invaded areas should be addressed. There are many ways to prevent invasions and to deal with them. Planting less invasive species, better site selection, and invasion monitoring are used successfully in different parts of the world to prevent invasion. Mechanical and chemical methods are used effectively to control Pinaceae invasions. Control is more effective at the early stages of invasion. Old invasions are more problematic as their elimination is more expensive, and the restoration of native vegetation is challenging. In some areas, native vegetation cannot thrive after Pinaceae have been removed, and weeds colonize cleared areas. More attention is needed to prevent the initiation and spread of invasions by focusing control interventions at early stages of invasion. Finding new ways of dealing sustainably with conflicts of interest between foresters and conservationists is crucial. Non-native Pinaceae are important parts of the economies and landscapes in several countries and they will continue to play such a role in the future. Despite the numerous challenges facing Pinaceae invasion management, several approaches can be successful at controlling them. Proper application of current techniques and development of more efficient ones is needed if the goal of maximizing benefits and minimizing negative impacts is to be achieved.

AB Pollinators are in global decline and agricultural pesticides are a potential driver of this. Recent studies have suggested that pesticides may significantly impact bumblebee colonies-an important and declining group of pollinators. Here, we show that colony-founding queens, a critical yet vulnerable stage of the bumblebee lifecycle, are less likely to initiate a colony after exposure to thiamethoxam, a neonicotinoid insecticide. Bombus terrestris queens were exposed to field-relevant levels of thiamethoxam and two natural stressors: the parasite Crithidia bombi and varying hibernation durations. Exposure to thiamethoxam caused a 26% reduction in the proportion of queens that laid eggs, and advanced the timing of colony initiation, although we did not detect impacts of any experimental treatment on the ability of queens to produce adult offspring during the 14-week experimental period. As expected from previous studies, the hibernation duration also had an impact on egg laying, but there was no significant interaction with insecticide treatment. Modelling the impacts of a 26% reduction in colony founding on population dynamics dramatically increased the likelihood of population extinction. This shows that neonicotinoids can affect this critical stage in the bumblebee lifecycle and may have significant impacts on population dynamics.

AB Aim We studied global variation in beta diversity patterns of lake macrophytes using regional data from across the world. Specifically, we examined (1) how beta diversity of aquatic macrophytes is partitioned between species turnover and nestedness within each study region, and (2) which environmental characteristics structure variation in these beta diversity components.
   Location Global.
   Methods We used presence-absence data for aquatic macrophytes from 21 regions distributed around the world. We calculated pairwise-site and multiple-site beta diversity among lakes within each region using SOrensen dissimilarity index and partitioned it into turnover and nestedness coefficients. Beta regression was used to correlate the diversity coefficients with regional environmental characteristics.
   Results Aquatic macrophytes showed different levels of beta diversity within each of the 21 study regions, with species turnover typically accounting for the majority of beta diversity, especially in high-diversity regions. However, nestedness contributed 30-50% of total variation in macrophyte beta diversity in low-diversity regions. The most important environmental factor explaining the three beta diversity coefficients (total, species turnover and nestedness) was elevation range, followed by relative areal extent of freshwater, latitude and water alkalinity range.
   Main conclusions Our findings show that global patterns in beta diversity of lake macrophytes are caused by species turnover rather than by nestedness. These patterns in beta diversity were driven by natural environmental heterogeneity, notably variability in elevation range (also related to temperature variation) among regions. In addition, a greater range in alkalinity within a region, likely amplified by human activities, was also correlated with increased macrophyte beta diversity. These findings suggest that efforts to conserve aquatic macrophyte diversity should primarily focus on regions with large numbers of lakes that exhibit broad environmental gradients.

AB The notion that shifts to new hosts can initiate insect speciation is more than 150 years old, yet widespread conflation with paradigms of sympatric speciation has led to confusion about how much support exists for this hypothesis. Here, we review 85 insect systems and evaluate the relationship between host shifting, reproductive isolation, and speciation. We sort insects into five categories: (1) systems in which a host shift has initiated speciation; (2) systems in which a host shift has made a contribution to speciation; (3) systems in which a host shift has caused the evolution of new reproductive isolating barriers; (4) systems with host-associated genetic differences; and (5) systems with no evidence of host-associated genetic differences. We find host-associated genetic structure in 65 systems, 43 of which show that host shifts have resulted in the evolution of new reproductive barriers. Twenty-six of the latter also support a role for host shifts in speciation, including eight studies that definitively support the hypothesis that a host shift has initiated speciation. While this review is agnostic as to the fraction of all insect speciation events to which host shifts have contributed, it clarifies that host shifts absolutely can and do initiate speciation.

AB Sourdough has traditionally been used as leavening agent in artisanal baking. The production of baked and steamed cereal products increasingly employs sourdough as baking improver to achieve improved bread quality, or to obtain "clean label" products. Sourdoughs are maintained in bakeries by continuous propagation; composition and metabolic activity of sourdough microbiota and their impact on bread quality are therefore shaped by processing parameters and fermentation substrates. The diversity of fermentation processes leads to diverse compositions of sourdough microbiota. This communication explores whether concepts in community assembly support an improved understanding of the microbial ecology of sourdough. Community assembly is determined by diversification, drift, dispersal, and selection. Evidence for diversification in sourdoughs is inconclusive. Drift has been shown to shape sourdough microbiota only in specific cases. Increasing knowledge on the primary habitat of sourdough lactobacilli indicates that dispersal (limitation) is an important determinant in sourdoughs that are propagated only for short periods of time. In contrast, selection of adapted organisms mainly determines the microbiota of sourdoughs that are propagated for a long time. Bacterial metabolic traits that determine competitiveness in sourdough fermentation, i.e. effective use of maltose, exopolysaccharide formation from sucrose, the use of electron acceptors by heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria, and acid resistance mediated by arginine and glutamine conversion, also determine bread quality. The concepts in community assembly thus provide a valuable tool to understand the influence of the technology of sourdough fermentation on microbial ecology and on bread quality.

AB Carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere (CDR)-also known as 'negative emissions'-features prominently in most 2 degrees C scenarios and has been under increased scrutiny by scientists, citizens, and policymakers. Critics argue that 'negative emission technologies' (NETs) are insufficiently mature to rely on them for climate stabilization. Some even argue that 2 degrees C is no longer feasible or might have unacceptable social and environmental costs. Nonetheless, the Paris Agreement endorsed an aspirational goal of limiting global warming to even lower levels, arguing that climate impacts-especially for vulnerable nations such as small island states-will be unacceptably severe in a 2 degrees C world. While there are few pathways to 2 degrees C that do not rely on negative emissions, 1.5 degrees C scenarios are barely conceivable without them. Building on previous assessments of NETs, we identify some urgent research needs to provide a more complete picture for reaching ambitious climate targets, and the role that NETs can play in reaching them.

AB Explaining the evolution of species geographical ranges is fundamental to understanding how biodiversity is distributed and maintained. The solution to this classic problem in ecology and evolution remains elusive: we still do not fully know how species geographical ranges evolve and what factors fuel range expansions. Resolving this problem is now more crucial than ever with increasing biodiversity loss, global change and movement of species by humans. Here, we describe and evaluate the hypothesis that hybridization between species can contribute to species range expansion. We discuss how such a process can occur and the empirical data that are needed to test this hypothesis. We also examine how species can expand into new environments via hybridization with a resident species, and yet remain distinct species. Generally, hybridization may play an underappreciated role in influencing the evolution of species ranges. Whether-and to what extent-hybridization has such an effect requires further study across more diverse taxa.

   DUPLICATION
AB An unintended consequence of global change is an increase in opportunities for hybridization among previously isolated lineages. Here we illustrate how global change can facilitate the breakdown of reproductive barriers and the formation of hybrids, drawing on the flora of the British Isles for insight. Although global change may ameliorate some of the barriers preventing hybrid establishment, for example by providing new ecological niches for hybrids, it will have limited effects on environment-independent post-zygotic barriers. For example, genic incompatibilities and differences in chromosome numbers and structure within hybrid genomes are unlikely to be affected by global change. We thus speculate that global change will have a larger effect on eroding pre-zygotic barriers (eco-geographical isolation and phenology) than post-zygotic barriers, shifting the relative importance of these two classes of reproductive barriers from what is usually seen in naturally produced hybrids where pre-zygotic barriers are the largest contributors to reproductive isolation. Although the long-term fate of neo-hybrids is still to be determined, the massive impact of global change on the dynamics and distribution of biodiversity generates an unprecedented opportunity to study large numbers of unpredicted, and often replicated, hybridization experiments', allowing us to peer into the birth and death of evolutionary lineages.

AB In the land use and land cover (LULC) literature, narrative scenarios are qualitative descriptions of plausible futures associated with a combination of socio-economic, policy, technological, and climate changes. LULC models are then often used to translate these narrative descriptions into quantitative characterizations of possible future societal and ecological impacts and conditions. To respect the intent of the underlying scenario descriptions, this process of translation needs to be thoughtful, transparent, and reproducible. This paper evaluates the current state of the art in scenario translation methods and outlines their relative advantages and disadvantages, as well as the respective roles of stakeholders and subject matter experts. We summarize our findings in the form of a decision matrix that can assist land use planners, scientists, and modelers in choosing a translation method appropriate to their situation.

AB Marine fish and invertebrates are shifting their regional and global distributions in response to climate change, but it is unclear whether their productivity is being affected as well. Here we tested for time-varying trends in biological productivity parameters across 262 fish stocks of 127 species in 39 large marine ecosystems and high-seas areas (hereafter LMEs). This global meta-analysis revealed widespread changes in the relationship between spawning stock size and the production of juvenile offspring (recruitment), suggesting fundamental biological change in fish stock productivity at early life stages. Across regions, we estimate that average recruitment capacity has declined at a rate approximately equal to 3% of the historical maximum per decade. However, we observed large variability among stocks and regions; for example, highly negative trends in the North Atlantic contrast with more neutral patterns in the North Pacific. The extent of biological change in each LME was significantly related to observed changes in phytoplankton chlorophyll concentration and the intensity of historical overfishing in that ecosystem. We conclude that both environmental changes and chronic overfishing have already affected the productive capacity of many stocks at the recruitment stage of the life cycle. These results provide a baseline for ecosystem-based fisheries management and may help adjust expectations for future food production from the oceans.

AB Next generation sequencing transformed the field of evolutionary biology and high throughput sequencing platforms are routinely used in phylogenomic, population genomic or metagenomic studies. Here I review the recent technical advancements of third generation sequencing instruments, thereby covering nanopore sequencing and single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing. The output and error rates are compared with sequencing platforms of the second generation (454 pyrosequencing, Illumina and Ion Torrent). Third generation sequencers produce sequence reads in hitherto unprecedented lengths and will help to strongly increase the quality of genome assemblies. Moreover, the speed of sequencing and ease of sample preparation enables sequencing in the field. Even though the output and error rate of the new generation of sequencer remains to be improved, new possibilities for evolutionary research will open up in the near future by these new techniques.

AB Consistent expanding urbanization dramatically transforms natural habitats and exposes organisms to novel environmental challenges, often leading to reduced species richness and diversity in cities. However, it remains unclear how individuals are affected by the urban environment and how they can or cannot adjust to the specific characteristics of urban life (e.g. food availability). In this study, we used an integrative multi-component approach to investigate the effects of urbanization on the nutritional status of house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We assessed several morphological and physiological indices of body condition in both juveniles (early post-fledging) and breeding adults from four sites with different levels of urbanization in France, Western Europe. We found that sparrows in more urbanized habitats have reduced body size and body mass compared to their rural conspecifics. However, we did not find any consistent differences in a number of complementary indices of condition (scaled mass index, muscle score, hematocrit, baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels) between urban and rural birds, indicating that urban sparrows may not be suffering nutritional stress. Our results suggest that the urban environment is unlikely to energetically constrain adult sparrows, although other urban-related variables may constrain them. On the other hand, we found significant difference in juvenile fat scores, suggesting that food types provided to young sparrows differed highly between habitats. In addition to the observed smaller size of urban sparrows, these results suggest that the urban environment is inadequate to satisfy early-life sparrows' nutritional requirements, growth, and development. The urban environment may therefore have life-long consequences for developing birds.

TI A bioinformatic framework for immune repertoire diversity profiling
   enables detection of immunological status

AB Background: Lymphocyte receptor repertoires are continually shaped throughout the lifetime of an individual in response to environmental and pathogenic exposure. Thus, they may serve as a fingerprint of an individual's ongoing immunological status (e.g., healthy, infected, vaccinated), with far-reaching implications for immunodiagnostics applications. The advent of high-throughput immune repertoire sequencing now enables the interrogation of immune repertoire diversity in an unprecedented and quantitative manner. However, steadily increasing sequencing depth has revealed that immune repertoires vary greatly among individuals in their composition; correspondingly, it has been reported that there are few shared sequences indicative of immunological status ('public clones'). Disconcertingly, this means that the wealth of information gained from repertoire sequencing remains largely unused for determining the current status of immune responses, thereby hampering the implementation of immune-repertoire-based diagnostics.
   Methods: Here, we introduce a bioinformatics repertoire-profiling framework that possesses the advantage of capturing the diversity and distribution of entire immune repertoires, as opposed to singular public clones. The framework relies on Hill-based diversity profiles composed of a continuum of single diversity indices, which enable the quantification of the extent of immunological information contained in immune repertoires.
   Results: We coupled diversity profiles with unsupervised (hierarchical clustering) and supervised (support vector machine and feature selection) machine learning approaches in order to correlate patients' immunological statuses with their B-and T-cell repertoire data. We could predict with high accuracy (greater than or equal to 80 %) a wide range of immunological statuses such as healthy, transplantation recipient, and lymphoid cancer, suggesting as a proof of principle that diversity profiling can recover a large amount of immunodiagnostic fingerprints from immune repertoire data. Our framework is highly scalable as it easily allowed for the analysis of 1000 simulated immune repertoires; this exceeds the size of published immune repertoire datasets by one to two orders of magnitude.
   Conclusions: Our framework offers the possibility to advance immune-repertoire-based fingerprinting, which may in the future enable a systems immunogenomics approach for vaccine profiling and the accurate and early detection of disease and infection.

AB Photosynthetic picoeukaryotes (PPE) are recognized as major primary producers and contributors to phytoplankton biomass in oceanic and coastal environments. Molecular surveys indicate a large phylogenetic diversity in the picoeukaryotes, with members of the Prymnesiophyceae and Chrysophyseae tending to be more common in open ocean waters and Prasinophyceae dominating coastal and Arctic waters. In addition to their role as primary producers, PPE have been identified in several studies as mixotrophic and major predators of prokaryotes. Mixotrophy, the combination of photosynthesis and phagotrophy in a single organism, is well established for most photosynthetic lineages. However, green algae, including prasinophytes, were widely considered as a purely photosynthetic group. The prasinophyte Micromonas is perhaps the most common picoeukaryote in coastal and Arctic waters and is one of the relatively few cultured representatives of the picoeukaryotes available for physiological investigations. In this study, we demonstrate phagotrophy by a strain of Micromonas (CCMP2099) isolated from Arctic waters and show that environmental factors (light and nutrient concentration) affect ingestion rates in this mixotroph. In addition, we show size-selective feeding with a preference for smaller particles, and determine P vs I (photosynthesis vs irradiance) responses in different nutrient conditions. If other strains have mixotrophic abilities similar to Micromonas CCMP2099, the widespread distribution and frequently high abundances of Micromonas suggest that these green algae may have significant impact on prokaryote populations in several oceanic regimes.

AB While there is a large consensus that plantplant interactions are a crucial component of the response of plant communities to the effects of climate change, available data remain scarce, particularly in alpine systems. This represents an important obstacle to making consistent predictions about the future of plant communities. Here, we review current knowledge on the effects of climate change on facilitation among alpine plant communities and propose directions for future research. In established alpine communities, while warming seemingly generates a net facilitation release, earlier snowmelt may increase facilitation. Some nurse plants are able to buffer microenvironmental changes in the long term and may ensure the persistence of other alpine plants through local migration events. For communities migrating to higher elevations, facilitation should play an important role in their reorganization because of the harsher environmental conditions. In particular, the absence of efficient nurse plants might slow down upward migration, possibly generating chains of extinction. Facilitationclimate change relationships are expected to shift along latitudinal gradients because (1) the magnitude of warming is predicted to vary along these gradients, and (2) alpine environments are significantly different at low vs. high latitudes. Data on these expected patterns are preliminary and thus need to be tested with further studies on facilitation among plants in alpine environments that have thus far not been considered. From a methodological standpoint, future studies will benefit from the spatial representation of the microclimatic environment of plants to predict their response to climate change. Moreover, the acquisition of long-term data on the dynamics of plantplant interactions, either through permanent plots or chronosequences of glacial recession, may represent powerful approaches to clarify the relationship between plant interactions and climate change.

AB Aims
   Understanding what drives the variation in species composition and diversity among local communities can provide insights into the mechanisms of community assembly. Because ecological traits are often thought to be phylogenetically conserved, there should be patterns in phylogenetic structure and phylogenetic diversity in local communities along ecological gradients. We investigate potential patterns in angiosperm assemblages along an elevational gradient with a steep ecological gradient in Changbaishan, China.
   Methods
   We used 13 angiosperm assemblages in forest plots (32 x 32 m) distributed along an elevational gradient from 720 to 1900 m above sea level. We used Faith's phylogenetic diversity metric to quantify the phylogenetic alpha diversity of each forest plot, used the net relatedness index to quantify the degree of phylogenetic relatedness among angiosperm species within each forest plot and used a phylogenetic dissimilarity index to quantify phylogenetic beta diversity among forest plots. We related the measures of phylogenetic structure and phylogenetic diversity to environmental (climatic and edaphic) factors.
   Important Findings
   Our study showed that angiosperm assemblages tended to be more phylogenetically clustered at higher elevations in Changbaishan. This finding is consistent with the prediction of the phylogenetic niche conservatism hypothesis, which highlights the role of niche constraints in governing the phylogenetic structure of assemblages. Our study also showed that woody assemblages differ from herbaceous assemblages in several major aspects. First, phylogenetic clustering dominated in woody assemblages, whereas phylogenetic overdispersion dominated in herbaceous assemblages; second, patterns in phylogenetic relatedness along the elevational and temperature gradients of Changbaishan were stronger for woody assemblages than for herbaceous assemblages; third, environmental variables explained much more variations in phylogenetic relatedness, phylogenetic alpha diversity and phylogenetic beta diversity for woody assemblages than for herbaceous assemblages.

AB Warming, watering and elevated atmospheric CO2-concentration effects have been extensively studied separately; however, their combined impact on plants is not well understood. In the current research, we examined plant growth and physiological responses of three dominant species from the Eurasian Steppe with different functional traits to a combination of elevated CO2, high temperature, and four simulated precipitation patterns. Elevated CO2 stimulated plant growth by 10.8-41.7 % for a C-3 leguminous shrub, Caragana microphylla, and by 33.2-52.3 % for a C-3 grass, Stipa grandis, across all temperature and watering treatments. Elevated CO2, however, did not affect plant biomass of a C-4 grass, Cleistogenes squarrosa, under normal or increased precipitation, whereas a 20.0-69.7 % stimulation of growth occurred with elevated CO2 under drought conditions. Plant growth was enhanced in the C-3 shrub and the C-4 grass by warming under normal precipitation, but declined drastically with severe drought. The effects of elevated CO2 on leaf traits, biomass allocation and photosynthetic potential were remarkably species-dependent. Suppression of photosynthetic activity, and enhancement of cell peroxidation by a combination of warming and severe drought, were partly alleviated by elevated CO2. The relationships between plant functional traits and physiological activities and their responses to climate change were discussed. The present results suggested that the response to CO2 enrichment may strongly depend on the response of specific species under varying patterns of precipitation, with or without warming, highlighting that individual species and multifactor dependencies must be considered in a projection of terrestrial ecosystem response to climatic change.

AB The Ross-Macdonald model has dominated theory for mosquito-borne pathogen transmission dynamics and control for over a century. The model, like many other basic population models, makes the mathematically convenient assumption that populations are well mixed; i.e., that each mosquito is equally likely to bite any vertebrate host. This assumption raises questions about the validity and utility of current theory because it is in conflict with preponderant empirical evidence that transmission is heterogeneous. Here, we propose a new dynamic framework that is realistic enough to describe biological causes of heterogeneous transmission of mosquito-borne pathogens of humans, yet tractable enough to provide a basis for developing and improving general theory. The framework is based on the ecological context of mosquito blood meals and the fine-scale movements of individual mosquitoes and human hosts that give rise to heterogeneous transmission. Using this framework, we describe pathogen dispersion in terms of individual-level analogues of two classical quantities: vectorial capacity and the basic reproductive number, R-0. Importantly, this framework explicitly accounts for three key components of overall heterogeneity in transmission: heterogeneous exposure, poor mixing, and finite host numbers. Using these tools, we propose two ways of characterizing the spatial scales of transmissionpathogen dispersion kernels and the evenness of mixing across scales of aggregationand demonstrate the consequences of a model's choice of spatial scale for epidemic dynamics and for estimation of R-0, both by a priori model formulas and by inference of the force of infection from time-series data.

AB Based on the loudness of different soundscape elements perceived on site, soundscapes were analysed in a multi-functional urban area in Rostock, Germany. The aim was to examine how urban soundscape composition changes spatiotemporally at different levels over a relatively large scale, and how soundscape perception is related to the underlying landscape. The results show that although anthropogenic sounds (anthrophony) dominated urban soundscape both spatially and temporally, certain biological sounds (biophony) and geophysical sounds (geophony), especially bird song, also played a significant role. Urban soundscapes showed diverse spatiotemporal patterns. Spatial variation of urban soundscape patterns was explained by underlying landscape characteristics, while temporal variation was mainly driven by urban activities, among which human activities were the major component. It is demonstrated that the thematic soundscape mapping techniques developed in this study is an effective tool. Landscape composition and configuration indicators could affect soundscape perception significantly, among which normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and landscape shape index (LSI) are the two most important predictors. The results highlight the importance of introducing more natural sounds into urban environments to achieve "noise control" through an ecological urban/landscape planning process.

AB Dynamic vegetation models have been widely used for analyzing ecosystem dynamics and their interactions with climate. Their performance has been tested extensively against observations and by model intercomparison studies. In the present analysis, Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ-GUESS), a state-of-the-art ecosystem model, was evaluated by performing a global sensitivity analysis. The study aims at examining potential model limitations, particularly with regard to long-term applications. A detailed sensitivity analysis based on variance decomposition is presented to investigate structural model assumptions and to highlight processes and parameters that cause the highest variability in the output. First- and total-order sensitivity indices were calculated for selected parameters using Sobol's methodology. In order to elucidate the role of climate on model sensitivity, different climate forcings were used based on observations from Switzerland. The results clearly indicate a very high sensitivity of LPJ-GUESS to photosynthetic parameters. Intrinsic quantum efficiency alone is able to explain about 60% of the variability in vegetation carbon fluxes and pools for a wide range of climate forcings. Processes related to light harvesting were also found to be important together with parameters affecting forest structure (growth, establishment, and mortality). The model shows minor sensitivity to hydrological and soil texture parameters, questioning its skills in representing spatial vegetation heterogeneity at regional or watershed scales. In the light of these results, we discuss the deficiencies of LPJ-GUESS and possibly that of other, structurally similar, dynamic vegetation models and we highlight potential directions for further model improvements.

AB Mitigating crop and livestock loss to wildlife and improving compensation distribution are important for conservation efforts in landscapes where people and wildlife co-occur outside protected areas. The lack of rigorously collected spatial data poses a challenge to management efforts to minimize loss and mitigate conflicts. We surveyed 735 households from 347 villages in a 5154 km 2 area surrounding Kanha Tiger Reserve in India. We modeled self-reported household crop and livestock loss as a function of agricultural, demographic and environmental factors, and mitigation measures. We also modeled self-reported compensation received by households as a function of demographic factors, conflict type, reporting to authorities, and wildlife species involved. Seventy-three percent of households reported crop loss and 33% livestock loss in the previous year, but less than 8% reported human injury or death. Crop loss was associated with greater number of cropping months per year and proximity to the park. Livestock loss was associated with grazing animals inside the park and proximity to the park. Among mitigation measures only use of protective physical structures were associated with reduced livestock loss. Compensation distribution was more likely for tiger related incidents, and households reporting loss and located in the buffer. Average estimated probability of crop loss was 0.93 and livestock loss was 0.60 for surveyed households. Estimated crop and livestock loss and compensation distribution were higher for households located inside the buffer. Our approach modeled conflict data to aid managers in identifying potential conflict hotspots, influential factors, and spatially maps risk probability of crop and livestock loss. This approach could help focus allocation of conservation efforts and funds directed at conflict prevention and mitigation where high densities of people and wildlife co-occur.

AB Estimates of hybrid fitness have been used as either a platform for testing the potential role of natural hybridization in the evolution of species and species complexes or, alternatively, as a rationale for dismissing hybridization events as being of any evolutionary significance. From the time of Darwin's publication of The Origin, through the neo-Darwinian synthesis, to the present day, the observation of variability in hybrid fitness has remained a challenge for some models of speciation. Yet, Darwin and others have reported the elevated fitness of hybrid genotypes under certain environmental conditions. In modern scientific terminology, this observation reflects the fact that hybrid genotypes can demonstrate genotype x environment interactions. In the current review, we illustrate the development of one plant species complex, namely the Louisiana Irises, into a 'model system' for investigating hybrid fitness and the role of genetic exchange in adaptive evolution and diversification. In particular, we will argue that a multitude of approaches, involving both experimental and natural environments, and incorporating both manipulative analyses and surveys of natural populations, are necessary to adequately test for the evolutionary significance of introgressive hybridization. An appreciation of the variability of hybrid fitness leads to the conclusion that certain genetic signatures reflect adaptive evolution. Furthermore, tests of the frequency of allopatric versus sympatric/parapatric divergence (that is, divergence with ongoing gene flow) support hybrid genotypes as a mechanism of evolutionary diversification in numerous species complexes.

AB Hybrid zones are common in nature and can offer critical insights into the dynamics and components of reproductive isolation. Hybrids between diverged lineages are particularly informative about the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation, because introgression in an admixed population is a direct measure of isolation. In this paper, we combine simulations and a new statistical model to determine the extent to which different genetic architectures of isolation leave different signatures on genome-level patterns of introgression. We found that reproductive isolation caused by one or several loci of large effect caused greater heterogeneity in patterns of introgression than architectures involving many loci with small fitness effects, particularly when isolating factors were closely linked. The same conditions that led to heterogeneous introgression often resulted in a reasonable correspondence between outlier loci and the genetic loci that contributed to isolation. However, demographic conditions affected both of these results, highlighting potential limitations to the study of the speciation genomics. Further progress in understanding the genomics of speciation will require large-scale empirical studies of introgression in hybrid zones and model-based analyses, as well as more comprehensive modelling of the expected levels of isolation with different demographies and genetic architectures of isolation.

AB The physiological mechanisms leading to Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) decline in the dry inner alpine valleys are still unknown. Testing the carbon starvation hypothesis, we analysed the seasonal course of mobile carbohydrate pools (NSC) of Scots pine growing at a xeric and a dry-mesic site within an inner alpine dry valley (750 m a.s.l., Tyrol, Austria) during 2009, which was characterised by exceptional soil dryness. Although, soil moisture content dropped to ca. 10% at both sites during the growing season, NSC concentrations rose in all tissues (branch, stem, root) until the end of July, except in needles, where maxima were reached around bud break. NSC concentrations were not significantly different in the analysed tissues at the xeric and the dry-mesic site. At the dry-mesic site, NSC concentrations in the aboveground tree biomass were significantly higher during the period of radial growth. An accumulation of NSC in roots at the end of July indicates a change in carbon allocation after an early cessation in aboveground growth, possibly due to elevated belowground carbon demand. In conclusion, our results revealed that extensive soil dryness during the growing season did not lead to carbon depletion. However, even though carbon reserves were not exhausted, sequestration of carbohydrate pools during drought periods might lead to deficits in carbon supply that weaken tree vigour and drive tree mortality.

AB Deleterious mutations tend to be recessive. Several theories, notably those of Fisher (based on selection) and Wright (based on metabolism), have been put forward to explain this pattern. Despite a long-lasting debate, the matter remains unresolved. This debate has focused on the average dominance of mutations. However, we also know very little about the distribution of dominance coefficients among mutations, and about its variation across environments. In this article we present a new approach to predicting this distribution. Our approach is based on a phenotypic fitness landscape model. First, we show that under a very broad range of conditions (and environments), the average dominance of mutation of small effects should be approximately one-quarter as long as adaptation of organisms to their environment can be well described by stabilizing selection on an arbitrary set of phenotypic traits. Second, the theory allows predicting the whole distribution of dominance coefficients among mutants. Because it provides quantitative rather than qualitative predictions, this theory can be directly compared to data. We found that its prediction on mean dominance (average dominance close to 0.25) agreed well with the data, based on a meta-analysis of dominance data for mildly deleterious mutations. However, a simple landscape model does not account for the dominance of mutations of large effects and we provide possible extension of the theory for this class of mutations. Because dominance is a central parameter for evolutionary theory, and because these predictions are quantitative, they set the stage for a wide range of applications and further empirical tests.

AB Deterministic or rule-based succession is expected under homogeneous biotic and abiotic starting conditions. Effects of extreme climatic events such as drought, however, may alter these assembly rules by adding stochastic elements. We monitored the succession of species composition of 30 twin grassland communities with identical biotic and abiotic starting conditions in an initially sown diversity gradient between 1 and 16 species over 13 years. The stochasticity of succession, measured as the synchrony in the development of the species compositions of the twin plots, was strongly altered by the extreme warm and dry summer of 2003. Moreover, it was independent from past and present plant diversity and neighbourhood species compositions. Extreme climatic events can induce stochastic effects in community development and therefore impair predictability even under homogeneous abiotic conditions. Stochastic events may result in lasting shifts of community composition, as well as adverse and unforeseeable effects on the stability of ecological services.

AB Hybridization between two closely related species is a natural evolutionary process that results in an admixture of previously isolated gene pools. The exchange of genes between species may accelerate adaptation and lead to the formation of new lineages. Hybridization can be regarded as one important evolutionary mechanism driving speciation processes. Although recent studies have highlighted the taxonomic breadth of natural. hybridization in the primate order, information about primate hybridization is still limited compared to that about the hybridization of fish, birds, or other mammals. In primates, hybridization has occurred mainly between subspecies and species, but has also been detected between genera and even in the human lineage. Here we provide an overview of cases of natural hybridization in all major primate radiations. Our review emphasizes a phylogenetic approach. We use the data presented to discuss the impact of hybridization on taxonomy and conservation.

AB P>1. Current national and international frameworks for assessing threats to species have not been developed in the context of climate change, and are not framed in a way that recognises new opportunities that arise from climate change.
   2. The framework presented here separates the threats and benefits of climate change for individual species. Threat is assessed by the level of climate-related decline within a species' recently occupied (e.g. pre-1970s) historical distribution, based on observed (e.g. repeat census) and/or projected changes (e.g. modelled bioclimate space). Benefits are assessed in terms of observed and/or projected increases outside the recently occupied historical range.
   3. Exacerbating factors (e.g. small population size, low dispersal capacity) that might increase levels of threat or limit expansion in response to climate change are taken into consideration within the framework. Protocols are also used to identify levels of confidence (and hence research and/or monitoring needs) in each species' assessment.
   4. Observed and projected changes are combined into single measures of expected decline and increase, together with associated measures of confidence. We weight risk classifications towards information that is most certain. Each species is then placed in one of six categories (high risk, medium risk, limited impact, equivalent risks & benefits, medium benefit, high benefit) reflecting whether climate change is expected (or has been observed) to cause net declines or increases in the region considered, based on the balance of benefits and threats.
   5. We illustrate the feasibility of using the framework by applying it to (i) all British butterflies (N = 58 species) and (ii) an additional sample of British species: 18 species of plants, bats, birds and beetles.
   6. Synthesis. Our framework assesses net declines and increases associated with climate change, for individual species. It could be applied at any scale (regional, continental or global distributions of species), and complements existing conservation assessment protocols such as red-listing. Using observed and projected population and/or range data, it is feasible to carry out systematic conservation status assessments that inform the development of monitoring, adaptation measures and conservation management planning for species that are responding to climate change.

AB Riparian areas are among the most threatened habitats in the world, due to human activities and land use in adjacent areas. In this study we sought to identify landscape metrics for describing the spatial patterns of riparian vegetation affected by land use. We also hypothesize that land use in the immediate vicinity of the riparian area (considered as a 30-m buffer) can have a greater effect on the structure of riparian vegetation than that in an enlarged buffer (i.e. 200 m). The study was conducted in the highly humanized River Tagus watershed (Central Portugal; Western Iberia), along over 80 km of river stretches. Riparian vegetation and land use data were obtained from high-resolution digital images (RGB-NIR 0.5 m x 0.5 m, spring 2005). Patch analyst was used to calculate landscape metrics related to the spatial configuration, isolation, inter-connectivity, and distribution of patches of three riparian cover classes (tree, shrub, and herbaceous). We quantified and accounted for the global and local spatial autocorrelation of data. Data treatment included redundancy analysis and geostatistic methods. Results showed that only a combined interpretation of various landscape metrics can consistently describe the spatial patterns of riparian vegetation. Riparian vegetation near agricultural areas (irrigation crops, rice fields, orchards, and vineyards), presented a low number of much smaller riparian tree patches with less complex shapes, and a low interspersion of the patch distribution. We found that proximal land use affects the structure of riparian vegetation more than distal land use - an important consideration for the establishment of streamside protection buffers.

AB 1. Fires are nowadays small, yet frequent, in temperate Central European conifer forests, but little is known about the fire history in this region. This is likely due to the lack of intact forests that contain old trees and dead wood from which fire history may be reconstructed. An exception is the Bialowieza Primeval Forest (BPF) in Poland for which we were able to reconstruct the fire history in detail.
   2. From 886 tree ring samples collected in a 13-ha conifer-dominated area, we reconstructed fire events and tree establishment back to the mid 1600s. From 1653 to the late 1700s fires were very frequent, with mean point (single tree) fire intervals of 18 years and mean stand scale fire intervals of 6 years. After 1781, the intervals between the fires increased dramatically, and since 1874 no major fire was recorded.
   3. Tree establishment underwent substantial changes, closely tracking shifts in fire frequency. When fires were frequent, Pinus sylvestris establishment occurred only sporadically. Later, less frequent fires promoted massive establishment of both P. sylvestris and Picea abies. At present, only P. abies and a few deciduous trees regenerate.
   4. Synthesis. We present the first high-resolution fire history in the Central European temperate lowland forest area. The discovery of old P. sylvestris trees and stumps with fire scars in many conifer-dominated parts of BPF show that fire was a major component in the past dynamics of this forest. We also show that historically, fires were recurring at very close intervals, supporting an open, Pinus-dominated forest. These result contrasts with the written history of BPF, which focus on a few, large fires from the past. Human influence on the fire regime was probably substantial, although the disentangling of climatic and human impacts needs further studies. We propose that fire should be increasingly taken into consideration in models of disturbance, vegetation development and forest openness in the whole Central European lowland forest region.

AB Few studies of kinship in mammalian societies have been able to consider the complex interactions between home range overlap, association patterns and kinship, which have created a critical gap in our understanding of social evolution. We investigated the association patterns of female bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, in the eastern gulf of Shark Bay, Western Australia and found that they depended upon the complex interplay of at least three factors: home range overlap, matrilineal kinship and biparental kinship. While home range overlap was positively correlated with female association patterns, preferred associations were found between females showing as little as 27% home range overlap, and some pairs showed avoidance despite 100% home range overlap. Furthermore, on average, both casual and preferred associations took place between females that were more closely biparentally related than expected by chance and this pattern varied depending upon whether or not pairs of females shared the same matriline.

AB Quantifying landscape dynamics is a central goal of landscape ecology, and numerous metrics have been developed to measure the influence of human activities on natural landscapes. Composite scores that characterize human modifications to landscapes have gained widespread use. A parsimonious alternative is to estimate the proportion of a cover type (i.e. natural) within a spatial neighborhood to characterize both compositional and structural aspects of natural landscapes. Here I extend this approach into a multi-scale, integrated metric and apply it to national datasets on land cover, housing density, road existence, and highway traffic volume to measure the dynamics of natural landscapes in the conterminous US. Roughly one-third of the conterminous US (2.6 million km(2)) in 1992 was classified as human-dominated. By 2001 this expanded by 80,800 km(2), and forecasted residential growth by 2030 will potentially lead to an additional loss of up to 92,200 km(2). Wetland cover types were particularly affected. The natural landscapes metric developed here provides a simple, robust measure of landscape dynamics that has a direct physical interpretation related to proportion of natural habitat affected at a location, represents landscapes as a gradient of conditions rather predicated on patch/matrix definition, and measures the spatial context of natural areas.

AB Urban environments have become an increasingly important part of the world's ecosystems, and the characteristics that enable animals to live there are not fully understood. A typical urban characteristic is the high level of ambient noise, which presents difficulties for animals that use vocal communication. Urban noise is most intense at lower frequencies, and, therefore, species vocalizing at higher frequencies may be less affected and thus better able to inhabit urban environments. We tested this hypothesis with within-genera comparisons of the vocalization frequency of 529 bird species from 103 genera. We found that species occurring in urban environments generally vocalize at higher dominant frequency than strictly nonurban congeneric species, without differing in body size or in the vegetation density of their natural habitats. In most passerine genera with low-frequency songs, which are more subject to masking by noise, minimum song frequency was also higher for urban species. These results suggest that species using high frequencies are preadapted to inhabit urban environments and that reducing noise pollution in urban areas may contribute to restore more diverse avian communities.

AB In the multi-use landscape of southern Norway, the distribution of lynx is likely to be determined both by the abundance of their favoured prey - the roe deer - and the risk associated with the presence of humans because most lynx mortalities are caused by humans (recreational harvest, poaching, vehicle collisions). We described the distribution of the reproductive portion of the lynx population based on snow-track observations of females with dependent kittens collected over 10 yr (1997-2006) in southern Norway. We used the ecological-niche factor analysis to examine how lynx distribution was influenced by roe deer, human activity, habitat type, environmental productivity and elevation. Our first prediction that lynx should be found in areas of relatively high roe deer abundance was supported. However, our second prediction that lynx should avoid human activity was rejected, and lynx instead occupied areas more disturbed in average than those available (with the exception of the most densely occupied areas). Lynx, however, avoided the most disturbed areas and our third prediction of a trade-off between abundance of prey and avoidance of human activity was supported. On the one hand, roe deer in the most disturbed areas benefit to a large extent from current human land use practices, potentially allowing them to escape predation from lynx. On the other hand, the situation is not so favourable for the predators who are restricted in competition refuges with medium to low prey densities. The consequence is that lynx conservation will have to be achieved in a human modifed environment where the potential for a range of conflicts and high human-caused mortality will remain a constant threat.

AB Genital morphology is informative phylogenetically and strongly selected sexually. We use a recent species-level phylogeny of nephilid spiders to synthesize phylogenetic patterns in nephilid genital evolution that document generalized conflict between male and female interests. Specifically, we test the intersexual coevolution hypothesis by defining gender-specific indices of genital complexity that summarize all relevant and phylogenetically informative traits. We then use independent contrasts to show that male and female genital complexity indices correlate significantly and positively across the phylogeny rather than among sympatric sister species, as predicted by reproductive character displacement. In effect, as females respond to selection for fecundity-driven fitness via giantism and polyandry (perhaps responding to male-biased effective sex ratios), male mechanisms evolve to monopolize females (male monogamy) via opportunistic mating, pre- and postcopulatory mate guarding, and/or plugging of female genitalia to exclude subsequent suitors. In males morphological symptoms of these phenomena range from self-mutilated genitalia to total castration. Although the results are compatible with both recently favored sexual selection hypotheses, sexually antagonistic coevolution, and cryptic female choice, the evidence of strong intersexual conflict and genitalic damage in both sexes is more easily explained as sexually antagonistic coevolution due to an evolutionary arms race.

AB Marine scallops, with extended planktonic larval stages which can potentially disperse over large distances when advected by marine currents, are expected to possess low geographical differentiation. However, the sessile lifestyle as adult tends to form discrete "sea beds" with unique population dynamics and structure. The narrow distribution of Zhikong scallop (Chlamys farreri), its long planktonic larval stage, and the extremely hydrographic complexity in its distribution range provide an interesting case to elucidate the impact of marine currents on geographical differentiation for marine bivalves at a fine geographical scale. In this study, we analyzed genetic variation at nine microsatellite DNA loci in six locations throughout the distribution of Zhikong scallop in the Northern China. Very high genetic diversity was present in all six populations. Two populations sampled from the same marine gyre had no detectable genetic differentiation (F-ST = 0.0013); however, the remaining four populations collected from different marine gyres or separated by strong marine currents showed low but significant genetic differentiation (FST range 0.0184-0.0602). Genetic differentiation was further analyzed using the Monmonier algorithm to identify genetic barriers and using the assignment test conducted by software GeneClass2 to ascertain population membership of individuals. The genetic barriers fitting the orientation of marine gyres/currents were clearly identified, and the individual assignment analysis indicated that 95.6% of specimens were correctly allocated to one of the six populations sampled. The results support the hypothesis that significant population structure is present in Zhikong scallop at a fine geographical scale, and marine currents can be responsible for the genetic differentiation.

AB To improve the estimation of aboveground biomass of grassland having a high canopy cover based on remotely sensed data, we measured in situ hyperspectral reflectance and the aboveground green biomass of 42 quadrats in an alpine meadow ecosystem on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We examined the relationship between aboveground green biomass and the spectral features of original reflectance, first-order derivative reflectance (FDR), and band-depth indices by partial least squares (PLS) regression, as well as the relationship between the aboveground biomass and narrow-band vegetation indices by linear and nonlinear regression analyses. The major findings are as follows. (1) The effective portions of spectra for estimating aboveground biomass of a high-cover meadow were within the red-edge and near infrared (NIR) regions. (2) The band-depth ratio (BDR) feature, using NIR region bands (760-950 nm) in combination with the red-edge bands, yields the best predictive accuracy (RMSE = 40.0 gm(-2)) for estimating biomass among all the spectral features used as independent variables in the partial least squares regression method. (3) The ratio vegetation index (RVI2) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI2) proposed by Mutanga and Skidmore (Mutanga, O. and Skidmore, A. K., 2004a, Narrow band vegetation indices solve the saturation problem in biomass estimation. International Journal of Remote Sensing, 25, pp. 1-6) are better correlated to the aboveground biomass than other VIs (R-2 = 0.27 for NDVI2 and 0.26 for RVI2), while RDVI, TVI and MTV1 predicted biomass with higher accuracy (RMSE - 37.2 g m(-2), 39.9 gm(-2) and 39.8 g m(-2), respectively). Although all of the models developed in this study are probably acceptable, the models developed in this study still have low accuracy, indicating the urgent need for further efforts.

AB Direct evidence of the effects of intense wildfire on forest soil is rare because reliable prefire data are lacking. By chance, an established large-scale experiment was partially burned in the 2002 Biscuit fire in southwestern Oregon. About 200 grid points were sampled across seven burned and seven unburned stands before and after the fire. Fire-related soil changes - including losses of soil organic and inorganic matter - were so large that they became complicated to measure. The 51 Mg.ha(-1) of loose rocks on the soil surface after fire suggests erosion of 127 Mg.ha(-1) of fine mineral soil, some of which likely left in the fire plume. After accounting for structural changes and erosion with a comparable-layers approach, combined losses from the O horizon and mineral soil totaled 23 Mg C.ha(-1) and 690 kg N.ha(-1), of which 60% (C) and 57% (N) were lost from mineral horizons. Applying a fixed-depth calculation - commonly used in previous fire studies - that disregards structural changes and erosion led to underestimates of loss of nearly 50% for C and 25% for N. Although recent debate has centered on the effects of postwildfire forest management on wood, wildlife habitat, and fuels, this study indicates that more consideration should be given to the possible release of greenhouse gases and reduction of future forest productivity and CO2 uptake.

AB Phylogeographic analyses based on the sole use of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule reveal only a small part of the evolutionary history of a species or a set of related species. In this study, we have combined the application of slow- and fast-evolving nuclear markers (proteins and microsatellites, respectively) together with the analysis of two-gene genealogies to further understand the history of the Iberian endemic Schreiber's green lizard, Lacerta schreiberi, a species for which a well established phylogeographical scenario is available. In sharp contrast with the observation of four divergent and almost allopatric mtDNA clades, our nuclear data revealed how two groups of populations diverged, persisted and began to admix along the mountains of the Iberian Central System. In addition, the combination of mtDNA and nuclear data showed how the core area of the species distribution responded to ice ages, first by relatively old processes of population expansion to the south followed by episodes of contraction that are at the origin of present-day isolates, and more recently by a postglacial expansion to the Iberian Northwest where new habitats were made available after climatic amelioration. Taken together with recently published results for a variety of other organisms, our results suggest that complex processes of fragmentation, expansion and admixture can only be properly addressed through the use of several and complementary types of molecular markers. Finally, we also suggest that southern European refugia are both hotspots and melting pots of genetic diversity.

AB Antipredator defenses are expected to decrease toward higher latitudes because predation rates are predicted to decrease with latitude. However, latitudinal variation in predator avoidance and defense mechanisms has seldom been studied. We studied tadpole antipredator defenses in seven Rana temporaria populations collected along a 1500-km latitudinal gradient across Sweden, along which previous studies have found increasing tadpole growth and development rates. In a laboratory common garden experiment, we measured behavioral and morphological defenses by raising tadpoles in the presence and absence of a predator (Aeshna dragonfly larva) in two temperature treatments. We also estimated tadpole survival in the presence of free-ranging predators and compared predator densities between R. temporaria breeding ponds situated at low and high latitudes. Activity and foraging were generally positively correlated with latitude in the common garden experiment. While all populations responded to predator presence by decreasing activity and foraging, high-latitude populations maintained higher activity levels in the presence of the predator. All populations exhibited defensive morphology in body and tail shape. However, whereas tail depth tended to increase with latitude in the presence of predator, it did not change with latitude in the absence of the predator. Predator presence generally increased larval period and decreased growth rate. In the southern populations, predator presence tended to have a negative effect on metamorphic size, whereas in the northern populations predators had little or a positive effect on size. Latitude of origin had a strong effect on survival in the presence of a free-ranging predator, with high-latitude tadpoles experiencing higher mortality than those from the low latitudes. In the wild, predator densities were significantly lower in high-latitude than in mid-latitude breeding ponds. Although the higher activity level in the northern populations seems to confer a significant survival disadvantage under predation risk, it is probably needed to maintain the high growth and development rates. However, the occurrence of R. temporaria at high latitudes may be facilitated by the lower predator densities in the north.

AB The paper provides a list of the non-indigenous animal species occurring today in Italian inland waters. Xenodiversity was found to amount to 112 species (64 invertebrates and 48 vertebrates), which contribute for about 2% to the inland-water fauna in Italy. Northern and central regions are most affected, and Asia, North America, and the rest of Europe are the main donor continents. The large majority of non-indigenous species entered Italy as a direct or indirect effect of human intervention. A difference between invertebrates and vertebrates was found for their mode of arrival (unintentional for invertebrates and intentional for vertebrates). Accidental transport, in association with both fish (for aquaculture or stock enhancement) and crops, has been the main vector of invertebrate introductions, whereas vertebrates were mostly released for stocking purposes. Overall stock enhancement (47.92%) and culture (37.5%) prevailed over the other pathways. Seventeen and 7 species of our list are included among the 100 worst invasive species of Europe (DAISIE) and of the world (IUCN), respectively. For some (but not all) non-indigenous species recorded in Italy the multilevel impact exerted on the recipient communities and ecosystems is known, even if rarely quantified, but knowledge on their chronic impact is still missing. Additional research is needed to provide criteria for prioritizing intervention against well established invaders and identify which new potential invader should be targeted as "unwanted".

AB Hybrids between the acid-loving species Rhododendron ferrugineum and the basic soil species Rhododendron hirsutum occur on soils of intermediate pH in the European Alps. Material from two hybrid zones similar to 500 m apart, and also nearby populations of each parent species, was surveyed for presence/absence of 31 random amplified polymorphic DNA markers that distinguish parents. Based on morphological assessment, the material comprised 51 putative hybrids, 18 putative R. ferrugineum individuals and 26 putative R. hirsutum plants. RAPD data were analysed using a Bayesian approach implemented by the program NEWHYBRIDS, and also by principal coordinates analysis. The identity of all R. ferrugineum plants examined was confirmed; however, of the putative R. hirsutum individuals examined, two were certainly and 11 possibly hybrid derivatives. Among all hybrid derivatives examined, about half were designated as F(1)s or a similar class, otherwise backcrosses to R. hirsutum appeared to be common whereas other hybrid classes were rare and backcrosses to R. ferrugineum possibly absent. Despite this, artificially generated seed of F-2 class and backcrosses in each direction showed greater viability than one parent (R. hirsutum). Introgression from R. ferrugineum was also detected in a population that from morphology appeared to contain only R. hirsutum. Hence, the direction of backcrossing might be highly asymmetric within hybrid zones, causing unidirectional gene flow from R. ferrugineum into R. hirsutum. Conversely, the rarity of backcrosses to R. ferrugineum, F(2)s and later hybrid generations, which might be due to phenology effects and habitat-mediated selection, could play a part in restricting gene flow towards R. ferrugineum.

AB It has been recently proposed that the blue-green coloration in eggs of many avian species may constitute a sexually selected female signal. Blue-green color intensity would reflect the physiological condition of females, and hence it might also affect the allocation of male parental care. In this study, we use three different experimental approaches to explore the importance of sexual selection on blue-green egg coloration of spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor) eggs. First, experimental deterioration of female body condition (by means of wing feather removal) negatively affected the intensity of blue-green egg coloration. Second, blue-green color intensity of artificial model eggs had a significant positive influence on paternal feeding effort. Finally, we found a negative relationship between the effect of experimental food supply on nestling immunocompetence and the intensity of blue-green coloration of eggs, suggesting that egg color predicts nutritional conditions that nestlings will experience during development. All these results taken together strongly support a role of sexual selection in the blue-green coloration of spotless starling eggs.

AB 1. In many vertebrates, reproductive performance increases with advancing age but mechanisms involved in such a pattern remain poorly studied. One potential mechanism may be the hormonal stress response, which shifts energy investment away from reproduction and redirects it towards survival. In birds, this stress response is achieved through a release of corticosterone and is also accompanied by a decrease in circulating prolactin, a hormone involved widely in regulating parental cares.
   2. It has been predicted that, when the value of the current reproduction is high relative to the value of future reproduction and survival, as it is expected to be in older adults, the stress response should be attenuated to ensure that reproduction is not inhibited.
   3. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the corticosterone and prolactin responses of known-age (8-36 years old) incubating snow petrels (Pagadroma nivea) to a standardized capture/handling stress protocol. We also investigated whether an attenuation of the stress responses will correlate with a lower occurrence of egg neglect, a frequently observed behaviour in snow petrels.
   4. The probability of successfully fledging a chick increased from 6 years to 12 years before stabilizing after 12 years of age. Corticosterone response to stress was unaffected by age. Prolactin response to stress, however, was influenced clearly by age: in both sexes older breeders had higher stress-induced prolactin levels than younger ones. This was due to an increasing attenuation of the prolactin response to stress with advancing age in females, and in males this was due to a probably higher intrinsic capacity of older males to secrete prolactin. Moreover, higher stress-induced prolactin levels were correlated with a lower probability of neglecting the egg.
   5. In young breeders, the combination of a robust corticosterone increase with a lower ability to maintain prolactin secretion during acute stress is probably one of the functional causes of their lower incubation commitment. We suggest that the ability to maintain a threshold level of prolactin during a stressful situation may be an important physiological mechanism involved in the improvement of reproductive performance with advancing age in long-lived birds.

AB Thanks to recent advances in molecular biology, one's knowledge of microbial co-occurrence patterns, microbial biogeography and microbial biodiversity is expanding rapidly. This MiniReview explores microbial diversity-productivity relationships in the light of what is known from the general ecology literature. Analyses of microbial diversity-productivity relationships from 70 natural, experimental, and engineered aquatic ecosystems reveal patterns that are strikingly similar to those that have long been documented for communities of macroorganisms. Microbial ecology and the general science of ecology are thus continuing to converge.

AB Functional characters have the potential to act as indicators of species turnover between local communities. Null models provide a powerful statistical approach to test for patterns using functional character information. A combined null model/functional character approach provides the ability to distinguish between the effect of competition and environmental filtering on species turnover. We measured 13 functional characters relating directly to resource use for the fish species found in French lakes. We combined this functional character data with a null model approach to test whether co-occurring species overlapped more or less than expected at random for four primary niche axes. We used an environmentally constrained null model approach to determine if the same mechanisms were responsible for species turnover at different sections of the altitudinal gradient. Functional diversity indices were used to examine the variation in functional character diversity with altitude, as a test of the hypothesis that competitive intensity decreases with increasing environmental adversity. The unconstrained null model showed that environmental filtering was the dominant influence on species turnover between lakes. In the constrained null model, there was much less evidence for environmental filtering, emphasising the strong effect of altitude on turnover in functional character values between local communities. Different results were obtained for low-altitude and high-altitude lake subsets, with more evidence for the effect of environmental filtering being found in the high-altitude lakes. This demonstrates that different processes may influence species turnover throughout an environmental gradient. Functional diversity values showed a slight decrease with altitude, indicating that there was only weak evidence that competitive intensity decreased with increasing altitude. Variation resource availability and environmental stress probably cause the observed turnover in functional characters along the altitudinal gradient, though the effects of dispersal limitation and species introductions in high-altitude lakes cannot be ruled out.

AB While there has been extensive interest in understanding the relationship between diversity and invasibility of communities, most studies have only focused on one component of diversity: species richness. Although the number of species can affect community invasibility, other aspects of diversity, including species identity and community evenness, may be equally important. While several field studies have examined how invasibility varies with diversity by manipulating species identity or evenness, the results are often confounded by resource heterogeneity, site history, or disturbance. We designed a mesocosm experiment to examine explicitly the role of dominant species identity and evenness on the invasibility of grassland plant communities. We found that the identity of the dominant plant species, but not community evenness, significantly impacted invasibility. Using path analysis, we found that community composition ( dominant species identity) reduced invasion by reducing early-season light availability and increasing late-season plant community biomass. Nitrogen availability was an important factor for the survival of invaders in the second year of the experiment. We also found significant direct effects of certain dominant species on invasion, although the mechanisms driving these effects remain unclear. The magnitude of dominant species effects on invasibility we observed are comparable to species richness effects observed in other studies, showing that species composition and dominant species can have strong effects on the invasibility of a community.

AB Aim We quantify the elevational patterns of species richness for all vascular plants and some functional and taxonomic groups on a regional scale on a tropical mountain and discuss some possible causes for the observed patterns.
   Location Mount Kinabalu, Sabah, Borneo.
   Methods A data base containing elevational information on more than 28,000 specimens was analysed for vascular plant distribution, taking into account sampling effort. The total species richness pattern was estimated per 300-m elevational interval by rarefaction analyses. The same methods were also applied to quantify species richness patterns of trees, epiphytes, and ferns.
   Results Total species richness has a humped relationship with elevation, and a maximum species richness in the interval between 900 and 1200 m. For ferns and epiphytes the maximum species richness is found at slightly higher elevations, whereas tree species did not have a statistically significant peak in richness above the lowest interval analysed.
   Main conclusions For the first time a rigorous estimate of an elevational pattern in species richness of the whole vascular plant flora of a tropical mountain has been quantified. The pattern observed depends on the group studied. We discuss the differences between the groups and compare the results with previous studies of elevational patterns of species richness from other tropical areas. We also discuss the methods used to quantify the richness pattern and conclude that rarefaction gives an appropriate estimate of the species richness pattern.

AB Testing for simultaneous vicariance across comparative phylogeographic data sets is a notoriously difficult problem hindered by mutational variance, the coalescent variance, and variability across pairs of sister taxa in parameters that affect genetic divergence. We simulate vicariance to characterize the behaviour of several commonly used summary statistics across a range of divergence times, and to characterize this behaviour in comparative phylogeographic datasets having multiple taxon-pairs. We found Tajima's D to be relatively uncorrelated with other summary statistics across divergence times, and using simple hypothesis testing of simultaneous vicariance given variable population sizes, we counter-intuitively found that the variance across taxon pairs in Nei and Li's net nucleotide divergence (pi(net)), a common measure of population divergence, is often inferior to using the variance in Tajima's D across taxon pairs as a test statistic to distinguish ancient simultaneous vicariance from variable vicariance histories. The opposite and more intuitive pattern is found for testing more recent simultaneous vicariance, and overall we found that depending on the timing of vicariance, one of these two test statistics can achieve high statistical power for rejecting simultaneous vicariance, given a reasonable number of intron loci (> 5 loci, 400 bp) and a range of conditions. These results suggest that components of these two composite summary statistics should be used in future simulation-based methods which can simultaneously use a pool of summary statistics to test comparative the phylogeographic hypotheses we consider here.

AB Broad-scale studies of genetic structure and diversity are indicative of the recent evolutionary history of a species and are relevant to conservation efforts. We have estimated current levels of genetic diversity and population structure for black walnut (Juglans nigra L.), a highly valuable timber species, in the central hardwood region of the United States. Black walnut trees from 43 populations across this region were genotyped at 12 highly polymorphic microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was high and populations only slightly deviated from Hardy-Weinberg proportions (F-ts = 0.017). Considering the scale of our sampling, the species was remarkably genetically homogenous: F-ST was quite low (0.017), and in a Bayesian analysis the optimal higher-order partition was into a single group comprised of all 43 populations. Although black walnut is predominantly a bottomland species, very little genetic variance was partitioned among broad-scale hydrologic regions (F-PT = 0.002). However, a weak, but statistically significant pattern of isolation by distance was detected. The results are consistent with a scenario in which black walnut recolonized its current range from a single glacial refugium, and where subsequent genetic effects associated with deforestation and habitat fragmentation have been mitigated by high levels of pollen flow. Nuclear microsatellites alone may be insufficient to identify hotspots for black walnut conservation.

AB To better understand changes in the distribution and diversity within plant functional types along an elevational gradient and the potential mechanisms driving such changes, we studied species richness of ferns at six elevations along a forested elevational gradient in Costa Rica, from La Selva Biological Station at 30 m a.s.l. up the slopes of Volcan Barva to 2960 m a.s.l. Among the samples from all the sites combined, we found 264 species from 60 genera. Sixty-nine species were terrestrial, 113 were canopy epiphytes, and 121 were low-trunk epiphytes. Only one species occupied both canopy and terrestrial habitats at any of the study sites. Overlap of canopy and low-trunk species composition was relatively low (18%), and lower still was the overlap of terrestrial and low-trunk species (12%). Total species richness peaked at the 1000-m site for canopy and low-trunk epiphytic species. In contrast, the richness of terrestrial species rose to a mid-elevation maximum and remained relatively constant at higher elevations. In an effort to explain elevational patterns of species richness, we examined mean annual rainfall and temperature, light intensities in the canopy and at ground level, and the mid-domain effect. Of the explanatory factors examined, the mid-domain effect accounted for most of the elevational pattern. We found little evidence that environmental gradients drive patterns of fern species richness on this spatial scale.

AB The aims of this study are to compare cross-shelf variation in diversity and community composition of four benthic taxa (sea urchins, sponges, corals and foraminifera) in the reefs of the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia, and relate this variation to cross-shelf environmental parameters, i.e. distance offshore, depth and exposure to oceanic currents. Rarefied species richness and Shannon's H' varied unimodally with the distance offshore and depth for all taxa (except sea urchins) and were highest at intermediate distances offshore and depths. There was no significant association between evenness and distance offshore. Evenness did, however, vary with depth and exposure. Overall, models using distance offshore, depth and exposure explained most of the variation in sponge and coral diversity but substantially less variation in foraminifera diversity. Variation in composition depended on distance offshore, depth and exposure although the relative importance of these variables differed among taxa. Depth was the most important parameter for sponges, corals and foraminifera but not for sea urchins. Sponge and coral assemblages differed markedly from in-to-off-shore but there was relatively little variation in foraminifera assemblages with most foraminifera species having broad cross-shelf distributions. Foraminifera assemblages on the contrary differed markedly between exposed and sheltered reef environments; species in exposed reef environments, for example, consisted of species with distinct strategies for coping with the increased hydrodynamic energy. In summary, this study shows that benthic taxa in the Spermonde are distributed along continuous gradients (in-to-off-shore and shallow-to-deep) in addition to occupying discrete habitats related to reef exposure.

AB Much of our knowledge concerning the functions of territorial behaviour and how territories are defended by individuals comes from research on birds. The vast majority of this work has focused on temperate zone breeding territoriality in which territories are defended most obviously by males. Our understanding of the female role in territory defence is limited because they are less conspicuous and much harder to observe. We studied sex roles in territory maintenance and defence in a duetting, resident neotropical passerine, the white-bellied antbird (Myrmeciza longipes). This species maintains territories and pair bonds year round and both sexes sing and actively participate in territory defence. We performed a series of playback experiments throughout the dry (non-breeding) and wet (breeding) seasons. We exposed territorial pairs to three types of stimuli including: (1) single sex, male only songs, (2) single sex, female only songs, and (3) both sex songs/duets. Contrary to findings for most other tropical species, individuals defended their territories with equal levels of aggression regardless of stimuli. Furthermore, sex roles were very different, with males responding more aggressively than females to all stimuli throughout both seasons. Both males and females consistently responded more aggressively to territorial intrusions during the dry season than during the wet season, likely because food abundance is low in the dry season and territory value is high. Our analysis of duetting behaviour suggests that duets do not serve a significant role in mate guarding, or territory defence.

AB The effects of restorative grazing on the abundance of butterfly and moth species were studied in mesic semi-natural grasslands of SW Finland differing in management history: (1) old continuously grazed, (2) restored (with ca 5 years of reinitiated grazing), and (3) abandoned former pastures.
   Generalized linear modelling of species abundances and indicator species analysis produced qualitatively similar results. Only three species (Polyommatus icarus, Lycaena hippothoe and Camptogramma bilineatum) were most abundant in old pastures, whereas 12 species (Polyommatus semiargus, Polyommatus amandus, Brenthis ino, Aphantopus hyperantus, Scopula immorata, Idaea serpentata, Scotopteryx chenopodiata, Epirrhoe alternata, Cybosia mesomella, Polypogon tentacularius, Hypena proboscidalis and Cryptocala chardinyi) were most abundant in abandoned pastures. None of the old-pasture species had become more abundant in restored pastures. Three species, Epirrhoe hastulata, Xanthorhoe montanata and Chiasmia clathrata. occurred equally abundantly in abandoned and in restored pastures indicating a slow progress of restoration.
   Species associated with old pastures differed from species associated with abandoned pastures in their recent distributional changes in Finland. The species of old pastures showed decreasing trends. whereas those of abandoned pastures showed mainly increasing trends in their distribution. In five out of I I species, the preferred successional stage differed markedly between this study and previous studies conducted in Central Europe.
   We conclude that (1) ca 5 years of restorative grazing in mesic grasslands has been insufficient for the colonisation of old-pasture species in the restored sites, (2) different management intensities are needed regionally for the maintenance of grassland insect diversity and (3) application of the knowledge on successional preferences of different species in conservation management. even in climatically similar regions, should be made with caution.

AB While local processes (e.g., competition, predation, and disturbance) presumably cause species exclusion and thus limit diversity in individual communities, regional processes (e.g., historical events, immigration, and speciation) are assumed to provide a source of species to colonize and thus enrich local communities. Ecologists have attempted to distinguish between these two sets of processes using graphical evidence for local assemblage saturation. However, such efforts have been controversial and are antithetical to the fact that local diversity bears an imprint of both. We examine the local-regional species richness relationship from the perspective of the theory of island biogeography and develop a model that can produce the full range of observed local-regional richness relationships from linear to curvilinear. Importantly, unlike previous models, we do not require species interactions to produce the curvilinear pattern. Curvilinear relationships arise if per-species stochastic extinction rates are substantially higher than colonization rates, while linear relationships result if colonization rates are higher than extinction rates. Because we also show that merely changing the sampling scale can make local-regional relationships appear either saturated or unsaturated, an inference of ecological processes, derived solely from local-regional relationships, is unwarranted.

AB Seed mass is considered to be an important attribute for the establishment success of plant species being linked with their seed production, establishment, and survival. This meta-analysis shows that seed mass is also closely correlated to growth-related species attributes of the established phase of rain forest tree species, and that the strength of this relationship varies with light conditions. Seed mass is an especially good predictor of species traits under high-light conditions, when the species attain their full growth potential. At high irradiance (>20% of full light) seed mass is negatively correlated with RGR, NAR, LAR, SLA and LMF. At low irradiance (<5% of full light), seed mass is only negatively correlated with LAR and SLA. Correlations between seed mass and morphological traits are therefore strongest at low irradiance where light interception is important. Conversely, correlations between seed mass and a physiological trait are strongest at high irradiance, where maximisation of photosynthetic rates is important. The strength of the correlation between growth parameters and seed mass declines over time, and disappears after 1-4 years. Seed mass appears to be a good proxy for the shade tolerance of tropical tree species, especially at the younger stages of the life cycle.

AB Purpose of this study was to investigate different morphological and physiological responses of two species of Sect. Tacamahaca Spach, Populus kangdingensis C. Wang et Tung (P. kangdingensis) and Populus cathayana Rehder (P cathayana), to exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) application under well-watered and water-stressed conditions and to further elucidate the role of ABA in drought tolerance. P. kangdingensis and P. cathayana possess different natural habitats in the eastern Himalaya; the first one occurs at high-altitude zone and the second one at low-altitude zone. Exogenous ABA was applied to the leaves by spraying, changes in plant growth and structure, gas exchange, endogenous ABA content and carbon isotope composition (delta(13)C) were measured. The results demonstrated that exogenous ABA application significantly decreased height growth (Ht), total biomass (Tb), total leaf area (La), specific leaf area (Sla), net photosynthesis (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (g) and significantly increased root/shoot ratio (Rs), fine root/total root ratio (Ft) and delta(13)C under well-watered and water-stressed conditions. However, distinct interspecific differences were found in ABA-induced growth reduction, gas exchange decrease and delta(13)C increase. P. kangdingensis was more responsive to applied ABA than P. cathayana, resulting in larger decreases in Ht, Tb, La, E and g, and larger increases in Rs and ABA. In addition, P. kangdingensis also exhibited higher Ft and delta(13)C than P. cathayana under all experimental treatments. Our results provide strong evidence for adaptive differentiation between two contrasting poplar species in the eastern Himalaya. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Genetic diversity and structure of 12 populations of Eryngium alpinum L. were investigated using 63 dominant amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and seven codominant microsatellite (48 alleles) markers. Within-population diversity estimates obtained with both markers were not correlated, but the microsatellite-based fixation index F-IS was correlated with both AFLP diversity indices ( number of polymorphic bands and Nei's expected heterozygosity). Only AFLP diversity indices increased with the size of populations, although they did not significantly differ among them (Kruskall-Wallis test). The discrepancy between AFLPs and microsatellites may be explained by a better coverage of the genome with numerous AFLPs, the higher mutation rates of microsatellites or the absence of significant difference among within-population diversity estimates. Genetic differentiation was higher with AFLPs (theta = 0.40) than with microsatellites (theta = 0.23), probably due to the higher polymorphism of microsatellites. Thus, we considered global qualitative patterns rather than absolute estimates to compare the performance of both types of markers. On a large geographic scale, the Mantel test and multivariate analysis showed that genetic patterns were more congruent with the spatial arrangement of populations when inferred from microsatellites than from AFLPs, suggesting higher homoplasy of AFLP markers. On a small spatial scale, AFLPs managed to discriminate individuals from neighboring populations whereas microsatellites did not ( multivariate analysis), and the percentage of individuals correctly assigned to their population of origin was higher with AFLPs than with microsatellites. However, dominant AFLPs cannot be used to study heterozygosity-related topics. Thus, distinct molecular markers should be used depending on the biological question and the geographical scale investigated.

AB Recruitment success of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus in the southern Benguela is thought to depend largely on the passive transport of eggs and larvae from their warm-water spawning area, located in the southern part of their distribution range (Agulhas Bank), to their cold-water nursery grounds located 500 km away on the west coast of South Africa. In order to test this hypothesis, the output of a 3D hydrodynamic model was coupled to a particle-tracking model, allowing the quantification of different factors such as the timing and precise location of spawning activity, the frequency of spawning activity within a month, the level of aggregation of the spawning stock, and the interannual variability of transport due to mesoscale processes. Results from the model indicate that spawning season and area have a major effect on transport success. The most favourable period for spawning was September to March, peaking in November, and the western Agulhas Bank was the most favourable spawning area. A low success rate of passive transport to the core inshore nursery area in the model suggests that additional processes such as swimming or advection are required for larvae to reach this area. In general, there was good agreement between observed spawning patterns and the optimal temporal and spatial strata where particle transport was most successful, suggesting that the spawning strategy of anchovy is mainly the result of an adaptation to the circulation patterns in the region. Nonetheless, some discrepancies were observed between the success of transport and actual spawning patterns, and temperature may also be an important factor to take into consideration to fully explain how this originally temperate species is able to survive in an area of highly contrasting temperatures.

AB In contrast to northern European areas where large-scale migrations occurred to recolonize territories after glacial periods, species in southern regions survived and diverged without large geographical displacements. As a result of the importance of orography in much of the southern areas, such displacements must have involved populations ascending or descending mountains. The present study provides support for glacial-induced altitudinal migrations from chloroplast phylogeographic patterns in Armeria (Plumbaginaceae) in southeast Spain. One hundred and five sequences of the trnL-F spacer were obtained from seven species. Fifteen different haplotypes were recognized, their genealogy was inferred, and associations with geography were explored using nested clade analysis. Seven instances were detected in which the same haplotype is shared by two or three species within a particular massif. In all the cases, at least one of the species involved displayed different haplotypes in other areas; in most, the haplotype shared is predominant either in one of the species involved or in the massif. These patterns of haplotype sharing strongly suggest horizontal transfer between species. In one of the massifs (Sierra Nevada) the three species involved in haplotype sharing (A. splendens , A. filicaulis ssp. nevadensis , A. villosa ssp. bernisii ) occur at markedly different altitudinal belts. It is argued that altitudinal migrations within the contraction-expansion model provide the best explanation for the current pattern, and that at least in one case it resulted in the formation of a new hybrid taxon, A. filicaulis ssp. nevadensis.

AB The effort of boreal forest conservation has emphasised the preservation of old-growth forests while the role of young successional stages in maintaining biodiversity has remained largely unstudied. We compared the richness of beetle species and composition of species assemblages between managed and seminatural forests in five stages of forest succession. The sites were in boreal sub-xeric pine-dominated forests in eastern Finland. Seminatural study sites, especially the recently burned sites, were important habitats for threatened and near-threatened species. We propose that young stages of natural succession should be included in the network of protected forest areas. On the other hand, the composition of saproxylic species assemblages in seminatural forests differed from the assemblages in managed forests, indicating also the need to improve the forest management guidelines so that they better address the requirements of species protection. Regeneration methods applied should resemble or mimic the natural disturbances more closely. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB When females are inseminated by more than one male (polyandry) sexual selection continues after insemination in the form of sperm competition and cryptic female choice. The sexually-selected sperm hypothesis proposes that, under the risk of sperm competition, additive variation in male traits determining fertilising efficiency will select for female propensity to be polyandrous in order to increase the probability of producing sons with superior fertilising efficiency. Two factors complicate this prediction: sex-biased transmission of male fertilising efficiency traits and sexual antagonism of sex-limited traits. fostered by sex-biased inheritance. Here. we (i) review the evidence that male traits contributing towards fertilising efficiency are heritable through sex-biased mechanisms, and (ii) explore the evolutionary implications for male and female reproductive strategies caused by both sex-biased transmission and sexual antagonism of fertilising efficiency traits. Many male fertilising efficiency traits are heritable through sex-biased mechanisms and may not necessarily increase female fitness. The predictions of the sexually-selected sperm hypothesis change dramatically under these different mechanisms of inheritance of fertilising efficiency traits, and different fitness pay-offs derived by females from the expression of such traits. Both sex-biased control of fertilising efficiency and sexual antagonism may also be important in explaining the maintenance of the genetic variance and selection potential of fertilising efficiency. We propose that a useful approach to test the sexually-selected sperm hypothesis is to combine studies which identify behavioural and physiological mechanisms explaining variation in reproductive success with artificial selection experiments to infer the underlying evolutionary patterns.

AB We tested the view that few generalizations are possible about the structure of subtidal algae assemblages and that the situation worsens or does not change as more sites are examined. We quantified the percentage cover of 4 morphological groups of benthic algae (encrusting and articulated coralline algae, and foliose and turfing algae) under canopies of kelp Ecklonia radiata and in areas without kelp (macroalgae >4 cm high). This was repeated over 4 spatial scales ranging from quadrats (separated by 10s of m), sites (separated by km), locations (separated by 100s of km) to regions (separated by 1000s of km) across the southern coastline of Australia: Western Australia (WA), Southern Australia (SA) and Eastern Australia (EA). The key result was that while comparison among sites revealed substantial and often inconsistent variation in abundance of benthic algae between habitats (kelp vs open), clear patterns emerged when locations and regions were compared. In EA, where grazers are effective in maintaining extensive areas of encrusting corallines, patterns of algal cover between habitats (kelp vs open) were generally reversed to WA and SA, where grazers are substantially less effective. These results indicate a large distinction in the ecology of these regions (WA = SA not equal EA) and how lack of understanding of this pattern at the regional scale tends to suggest overwhelming variation when single studies are compared among regions. These differences also highlight that comparisons of studies done at small scales, even if done at several sites in a locality, provide a difficult basis to understand the generality of pattern in algal assemblage structure due to large variation at this scale. While we acknowledge that these broad patterns were not possible to validate at the scale of sites, it was possible to increase the scale of observation to encompass broader patterns that might be organized around a relatively simple set of ecological predictions.

AB This paper is the first to describe the spatio-temporal changes of mesozooplankton in the Seine estuary. Monthly samples were collected along the estuary in 1996 in order to analyse the seasonal changes of the mesozooplankton community and to identify the major environmental parameters that may influence the spatial distribution of zooplankton in this megatidal estuary. Statistical analysis (canonical correspondence analysis) showed that salinity was the main factor correlated with the longitudinal distribution of zooplankton. Marine species (Temora longicornis, barnacle larvae...) were located in the outer part of the estuary, while more oligohaline species (Eurytemora affinis) were recorded in the inner part of the estuary. A mixed zone was characterised by the presence of the neritic copepods Acartia spp. and Eurytemora affinis. The marine species (e.g. T longicornis, Oikopleura dioica, Barnacle larvae) showed maximum abundance at the end of spring (June) while the most abundant estuarine species, E. affinis, peaked in late winter-spring and declined with the onset of summer. This copepod dominated the estuarine zooplankton throughout the year, and found in the Seine estuary very high favourable conditions to exhibit ultimate abundances (> 190 000 ind m(-3)) which is one order of magnitude higher than those found in other European estuaries. It represented the main prey for major planktonivorous species such as suprabenthic and fish species located living in the upstream zone of the Seine estuary.

TI Radiation use efficiency and biomass production in soybean at different
   plant population densities
SO CROP SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID YIELD
AB As population density (POP) increases in a soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] crop, maximum light interception (LI) occurs earlier in the season. Earlier canopy closure would be expected to increase the cumulative radiation intercepted. We hypothesized that if radiation use efficiency (RUE) was constant across a range of population densities in a nonstressful environment, then increasing POP would increase biomass at the end of the season. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the response of total biomass produced during the season to cumulative intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in field experiments at Fayetteville, AR, with soybean cultivars selected from Maturity Groups (MGs) 00 to IV. Additionally, from field experiments at Keiser, AR, with MG IV soybean cultivars, we assessed the response of RUE to POP. At both locations with MG IV cultivars, a late sowing date shortened the life cycle of the crop by 13 to 25 d compared with an early sowing date, resulting in less PAR accumulated. Similarly, early maturing cultivars had less time for PAR and biomass accumulation relative to later maturing cultivars. At Keiser, in three of the four environments, RUE decreased linearly by, 26 to 30% as the POP increased from 7 to 135 plants m(-2). Final biomass at the end of the season, as a function of PAR accumulated from emergence to the full-seed-size stage of development, responded linearly to intercepted PAR up to approximate to400 MJ m(-2). Above 400 MJ m(-2), the response was curvilinear with little increases in biomass >700 MJ m(-2). Our data clearly indicate that RUE decreased as POP increased and that maximum biomass production in these environments was not limited by intercepted PAR.

AB We examined the distribution and abundance patterns of 09 fish species that commonly occur in the rivers of Michigan's lower peninsula to develop a simple, empirically based model for describing fish assemblages. We used cluster analysis to group fishes that shared similar abundance patterns at 226 stream sites. The 17 clusters we identified explained about 39% of the variation in species abundances among the stream sites, providing a reasonable, albeit simplified, picture of general associations of fishes in lower Michigan streams. Known ecological differences among species and further analyses suggested that a measure of cluster abundance should not be used to predict the abundances of its constituent species. We selected catchment area (CA) and low-flow yield (LFY; 90% exceedence flow divided by catchment area) as axes for plotting fish distributions and rivers because these variables link, catchment-scale features of the landscape to multiple, site-scale characteristics of stream habitat (e.g., temperature, velocity, and depth) important to fishes. As a measure of groundwater loading to streams, LFY, which integrates the geological, landform, and soil characteristics of catchments, reached its highest values in basins predominated by highly permeable soils and relatively steep topography. Plots of fish cluster,., and species abundances on LFY-CA axes provided insight into the structure of fish assemblages in lower Michigan streams. When plotted on LFY-CA axes, the 17 fish clusters were distributed in a meaningful pattern that reflected stream size and temperature preferences of constituent species. The LFY-CA axes provided an empirically derived framework for comparing Michigan streams and for assessing the physical and biological potential of different river reaches. This has allowed fishery managers to better explain, justify, and build public support for river management plans and actions. Although the relationships among LFY, CA, and fish abundances we describe are specific to lower Michigan streams, our approach could be used to develop similar models specific to other regions.

AB Canonical correspondence analysis of diatoms from surface sediment samples and oceanographic environmental variables shows that summer and winter sea-surface temperatures, water depth and winter sea-surface salinity are the main environmental factors affecting diatom distribution around Iceland. Of these, summer sea-surface temperature is the most important. Five diatom assemblages are distinguished and the distribution of these assemblages is clearly correlated with oceanic current patterns in the region. The sea-ice diatom assemblage is limited to the area where the East Greenland Current (Polar Water) has its strongest influence, and the cold diatom assemblage is basically controlled by the less cold East Icelandic Current (Modified Polar Water). The mixing diatom assemblage results from the interaction between the cold East Greenland and East Icelandic Currents and the warm Irminger Current. The warm diatom assemblage is located in the area dominated by the Irminger Current and may be used as an indicator of warm-water masses (Atlantic Water). The coastal diatom assemblage is the only one strongly influenced by both water depth and summer water temperatures. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Twelve papers featured in a special issue on individual-based modelling in ecology are reviewed in an effort to identify common methodological and theoretical issues. The review focuses on issues related to the question of whether and how individual-based modelling is changing ecological theory. One major hindrance impeding the generation of theory from individual-based models (IBMs) is the fact that IBMs are more or less complex computer simulation models. They are thus hard to develop, hard to communicate, and hard to analyse. Solving this problem requires both software tools which help to implement and communicate IBMs and at least the same effort in analysing the models as is currently put into their development. A new field of application of IBMs is Virtual Ecology, i.e. the comparison of simulated data sets with those obtained by virtual (i.e. simulated) ecologists. This method allows field methods, empirical measures and sampling protocols to be optimised. As far as theoretical issues are concerned, individual variability was by far the most important issue discussed in the papers. Previously most studies concentrated on the mechanisms generating individual variability, but there is now also a growing number of models addressing the consequences of individual variability for population and community dynamics. In order to determine these consequences, a currency is required which allows the model populations to be evaluated. Persistence and other stability properties are proposed as such a unifying currency. The lesson contained in our review is that even with just twelve papers more or less explicitly oriented towards ecological theory, elements of a theory that might emerge form individual-based modelling in the future can already be identified.

AB Field experiments were established to assess possible allelopathic suppression by Lantana camara L. of two indigenous tree species. The design allowed comparison of allelopathic effects with density-dependent resource competition effects. Fire and its role in competitive interactions was included as an experimental treatment. Allelopathic responses were measured in L. camara thickets by germinating and growing Alectryon subcinereus (A. Gray) Radlk. in dry rainforest ecotones (Macleay River) or Cryptocarya rigida (Meissner) in warm temperate rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest (Lake Macquarie) at 10, 20 and 30 seedlings m(-2), where L. camara was either physically removed (LR), burnt (LB), or cut and left in place (LT). Germination for both species increased significantly by completely removing L. camara (LR) whereas burning (LB) was significant only for C. rigida. Seedling growth for both species was negatively related to increasing density when all L. camara was removed (LR) but was positively related in the other two treatments (LB and LT). C. rigida seedling biomass increased 47.4% (1.75-2.58 g) and 68.6% (1.98-2.95 g) with increasing seedling density for LT and LB respectively and decreased 23.2% (2.93-2.25 g) for LR. A. subcinereus seedling biomass increased 29.7% (1.95-2.53 g) and 34.7% (2.25-3.03 g) with increasing seedling density for LT and LB respectively and decreased 27.9% (3.30-2.38 g) for LR. Phytotoxin dilution effects were inferred in LT and LB rather than density-dependent intraspecific competition, whereas the reverse was true for LR. Seedling biomass for C. rigida resulting from potential phytotoxin dilution at high seedling density was not significantly different from the response of LR at low seedling density but, for A. subcinereus, the phytotoxin dilution response was significantly less than LR at low seedling density. Moderately intense fire (LB) was not significantly different from the LT treatment at both locations, emphasising that moderate to low intensity fires should not be used to control existing invasions of L. camara. Competitive strategies for invasive populations are identified that may modify succession following disturbance, thereby allowing thicket formation and long-term persistence to affect community dynamics. Such strategies need to be recognised in managing natural communities, particularly for biodiversity conservation.

AB It is hypothesized that plant diversity in field margins can be influenced by field margin structure and management, factors related to adjacent land use and factors related to landscape structure. To test this hypothesis, the plant species composition of field margins in three hedgerow network landscapes differing in grain size, hedgerow connectivity and land use patterns were compared. Variation partitioning by partial canonical correspondence analysis was used to assess the relative weight of local and landscape factors in total variation explained. Results showed that the three sets of local factors and the landscape factor were all significant. We conclude that the plant species composition of field margins is determined by landscape scale variation in environment attributes, and discuss implications for conservation.

AB The epiphytic vegetation on host trees along an altitudinal transect on the west slope of the Central Cordillera in Colombia was sampled. Bark-type restricted sampling comprised four full-grown forest trees, not necessarily four species, at altitudinal intervals of c. 200 meters from 1000 to 4130 m a.s.l. and included the canopy. Both vascular and non-vascular epiphytes, the latter often more abundant in the montane rain forest, were included in the analyses. Using a method of direct gradient analysis, canonical correspondence analysis, the variation explained by various environmental variables could be discriminated from a great amount of variation that seemed not related to any ecological factor. To a large extent, the randomness in propagule supply appears to determine the floristic composition on branch/trunk segments. The grouping of releves in a phytosociological analysis concurred with a clustering of samples in an ordination diagram of the first two extracted constrained axes. The sample scores on these two axes were strongly correlated with the complex variables 'altitude' and 'height within the host tree'. Specialists and generalists with respect to the two variables were defined based on tolerances provided by the canonical correspondence analysis as was the position of species on the gradients involved. Independently from any of the other variables entered, a relation between the epiphytic vegetation and host species was detected, particularly in the case of Brunellia occidentalis, a fast growing tree species of higher altitude. No relation between chemical characteristics of suspended soil in the Upper Montane Rain forest and its supporting species could be demonstrated.

AB 1. Farmland in Britain supports large populations of invertebrate-feeding birds in winter. However, little is known about the effects of agricultural practices on the birds' use of individual fields or their food resources. This study aimed to assess the effects of farming practices on field choice by wintering birds in an area of mixed farmland in the Vale of Aylesbury, England. For methodological reasons, birds smaller than redwing (Turdus iliacus) were not considered.
   2. Permanent grass fields supported the highest densities of most of the invertebrate-feeding birds and were preferred throughout the winder. Cereal stubble and ley fields supported moderate densities of some birds but were generally avoided. Bare till, winter cereal and oil-seed rape fields were little used.
   3. Soil macro-invertebrate densities were highest in permanent grass fields. The biomass of earthworms and other invertebrates was significantly higher in permanent grass than all other field types except ley. It is probable that the birds' preference for permanent grass fields is caused by the high density of food resources.
   4. For most species of birds, the likelihood that permanent grass fields would be used was consistently higher where farmyard manure was applied frequently and where the grass was long established. Densities of Lumbricidae and Coleoptera were positively correlated with the age of grass but not with the input of farmyard manure. The greater number of birds observed was possibly a result of increased surface activity of earthworms.
   5. The use of cultivated fields by birds was also associated with high frequencies of farmyard manure application. In these fields earthworm densities were positively correlated with input of farmyard manure.

AB An elementary question in porous media research is in regard to the relationship between structure and function. In most fields, the porosity and permeability of porous media are properties of key interest. There is, however, no universal relationship between porosity and permeability since not only does the fraction of void space matter for permeability but also the connectivity of the void fraction. With the evolution of modern day X-ray microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) and advanced computing, it is now possible to visualize porous media at an unprecedented level of detail. Approaches in analyzing micro-CT data of porous structures vary in the literature from phenomenological characterization to network analysis to geometrical and/or topological measurements. This leads to a question about how to consistently characterize porous media in a way that facilitates theoretical developments. In this effort, the Minkowski functionals (MF) emerge from the field of statistical physics where it is evident that many physical processes depend on the geometry and topology of bodies or multiple bodies in 3D space. Herein we review the theoretical basis of the MF, mathematical theorems and methods necessary for porous media characterization, common measurement errors when using micro-CT data and recent findings relating the MF to macroscale porous media properties. This paper is written to provide the basics necessary for porous media characterization and theoretical developments. With the wealth of information generated from 3D imaging of porous media, it is necessary to develop an understanding of the limitations and opportunities in this exciting area of research.

AB Little information is available about the occurrence of neonicotinoid insecticides in surface water and sediment of the metropolitan regions around the rivers in China. Here we investigate the residual level of neonicotinoids in the Guangzhou section of the Pearl River. At least one or two neonicotinoids was detected in each surface water and sediment, and the total amount of neonicotinoids (Sigma(5)neonics) in surface water ranged from 92.6 to 321 ng/L with a geometric mean (GM) of 174 ng/L. Imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and acetamiprid were three frequently detected neonicotinoids (100%2 from surface water. As for the sediment, total concentration was varied between 0.40 and 2.59 ng/g dw with a GM of 1.12 ng/g dw, and acetamiprid and thiacloprid were the common sediment neonicotinoids. Western and Front river-route of the Guangzhou section of the Pearl River suffered a higher neonicotinoids contamination than the Rear river-route, resulting from more effluents of WWTP5 receiving, and intensive commercial and human activities. Level of residual neonicotinoids in surface water was significantly correlated with the water quality (p < 0.01), especially items of pH, DO and ORP, and nitrogen and phosphorus contaminants. Compared with reports about residual neonicotinoids in water and sediment previously, the metropolitan regions of the Guangzhou could be confronted with a moderate contamination and showed serious ecological threats (even heavier than the Pearl Rivers). Our results will provide valuable data for understanding of neonicotinoids contamination in the Pearl River Delta and be helpful for further assessing environmental risk of neonicotinoids.

TI Change in dominance determines herbivore effects on plant biodiversity

AB Herbivores alter plant biodiversity (species richness) in many of the world's ecosystems, but the magnitude and the direction of herbivore effects on biodiversity vary widely within and among ecosystems. One current theory predicts that herbivores enhance plant biodiversity at high productivity but have the opposite effect at low productivity. Yet, empirical support for the importance of site productivity as a mediator of these herbivore impacts is equivocal. Here, we synthesize data from 252 large-herbivore exclusion studies, spanning a 20-fold range in site productivity, to test an alternative hypothesis-that herbivore-induced changes in the competitive environment determine the response of plant biodiversity to herbivory irrespective of productivity. Under this hypothesis, when herbivores reduce the abundance (biomass, cover) of dominant species (for example, because the dominant plant is palatable), additional resources become available to support new species, thereby increasing biodiversity. By contrast, if herbivores promote high dominance by increasing the abundance of herbivory-resistant, unpalatable species, then resource availability for other species decreases reducing biodiversity. We show that herbivore-induced change in dominance, independent of site productivity or precipitation (a proxy for productivity), is the best predictor of herbivore effects on biodiversity in grassland and savannah sites. Given that most herbaceous ecosystems are dominated by one or a few species, altering the competitive environment via herbivores or by other means may be an effective strategy for conserving biodiversity in grasslands and savannahs globally.

AB Agriculture directly contributes about 10%-12% of current global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, mostly from livestock. However, such percentage estimates are based on global warming potentials (GWPs), which do not measure the actual warming caused by emissions and ignore the fact that methane does not accumulate in the atmosphere in the same way as CO2. Here, we employ a simple carbon cycle-climate model, historical estimates and future projections of livestock emissions to infer the fraction of actual warming that is attributable to direct livestock non-CO2 emissions now and in future, and to CO2 from pasture conversions, without relying on GWPs. We find that direct livestock non-CO2 emissions caused about 19% of the total modelled warming of 0.81 degrees C from all anthropogenic sources in 2010. CO2 from pasture conversions contributed at least another 0.03 degrees C, bringing the warming directly attributable to livestock to 23% of the total warming in 2010. The significance of direct livestock emissions to future warming depends strongly on global actions to reduce emissions from other sectors. Direct non-CO2 livestock emissions would contribute only about 5% of the warming in 2100 if emissions from other sectors increase unabated, but could constitute as much as 18% (0.27 degrees C) of the warming in 2100 if global CO2 emissions from other sectors are reduced to near or below zero by 2100, consistent with the goal of limiting warming to well below 2 degrees C. These estimates constitute a lower bound since indirect emissions linked to livestock feed production and supply chains were not included. Our estimates demonstrate that expanding the mitigation potential and realizing substantial reductions of direct livestock non-CO2 emissions through demand and supply side measures can make an important contribution to achieve the stringent mitigation goals set out in the Paris Agreement, including by increasing the carbon budget consistent with the 1.5 degrees C goal.

AB Ecological studies are increasingly moving towards trait-based approaches, as the evidence mounts that functions, as opposed to taxonomy, drive ecosystem service delivery. Among ecosystem services, biological control has been somewhat overlooked in functional ecological studies. This is surprising given that, over recent decades, much of biological control research has been focused on identifying the multiple characteristics (traits) of species that influence trophic interactions. These traits are especially well developed for interactions between arthropods and flowers-important for biological control, as floral resources can provide natural enemies with nutritional supplements, which can dramatically increase biological control efficiency. Traits that underpin the biological control potential of a community and that drive the response of arthropods to environmental filters, from local to landscape-level conditions, are also emerging from recent empirical studies. We present an overview of the traits that have been identified to (i) drive trophic interactions, especially between plants and biological control agents through determining access to floral resources and enhancing longevity and fecundity of natural enemies, (ii) affect the biological control services provided by arthropods, and (iii) limit the response of arthropods to environmental filters, ranging from local management practices to landscape-level simplification. We use this review as a platform to outline opportunities and guidelines for future trait-based studies focused on the enhancement of biological control services.

AB Finding effective ways of conserving large carnivores is widely recognised as a priority in conservation. However, there is disagreement about the most effective way to do this, with some favouring top-down 'command and control' approaches and others favouring collaboration. Arguments for coercive top-down approaches have been presented elsewhere; here we present arguments for collaboration. In many parts of the developed world, flexibility of approach is built into the legislation, so that conservation objectives are balanced with other legitimate goals. In the developing world, limited resources, poverty and weak governance mean that collaborative approaches are likely to play a particularly important part in carnivore conservation. In general, coercive policies may lead to the deterioration of political legitimacy and potentially to non-compliance issues such as illegal killing, whereas collaborative approaches may lead to psychological ownership, enhanced trust, learning, and better social outcomes. Sustainable hunting/trapping plays a crucial part in the conservation and management of many large carnivores. There are many different models for how to conserve carnivores effectively across the world, research is now required to reduce uncertainty and examine the effectiveness of these approaches in different contexts.

AB Life cycle (LC) methodologies have attracted a great interest in agricultural sustainability assessments, even if, at the same time, they have sometimes been criticized for making unrealistic assumptions and subjective choices. To cope with these weaknesses, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and/or participatory methods can be used to balance and integrate different sustainability dimensions. The purpose of this study is to highlight how life cycle approaches were combined with MCDA and participatory methods to address agricultural sustainability in the published scientific literature. A systematic and critical review was developed, highlighting the following features: which multi-criterial and/or participatory methods have been associated with LC tools; how they have been integrated or complemented (methodological relationships); the intensity of the involvement of stake-holders (degree of participation); and which synergies have been achieved by combining the methods. The main typology of integration was represented by multi-criterial frameworks integrating LC evaluations. LC tools can provide MCDA studies with local and global information on how to reduce negative impacts and avoid burden shifts, while MCDA methods can help LC practitioners deal with subjective assumptions in an objective way, to take into consideration actors' values and to overcome trade-offs among the different dimensions of sustainability. Considerations concerning the further development of Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) have been identified as well. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ecosystem services (ES) approaches to biodiversity conservation are currently high on the ecological research and policy agendas. However, despite a wealth of studies into biodiversity's role inmaintaining ES (B-ES relationships) across landscapes, we still lack generalities in the nature and strengths of these linkages. Reasons for this are manifold, but can largely be attributed to (i) a lack of adherence to definitions and thus a confusion between final ES and the ecosystem functions (EFs) underpinning them, (ii) a focus on uninformative biodiversity indices and singular hypotheses and (iii) top-down analyses across large spatial scales and overlooking of context-dependency. The biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (B-EF) field provides an alternate context for examining biodiversity's mechanistic role in shaping ES, focusing on species' characteristics that may drive EFs via multiple mechanisms across contexts. Despite acknowledgements of a need for B-ES research to look towards underlying B-EF linkages, the connections between these areas of research remains weak. With this review, we pull together recent B-EF findings to identify key areas for future developments in B-ES research. We highlight a means by which B-ES research may begin to identify how and when multiple underlying B-EF relationships may scale to final ES delivery and trade-offs.

AB AimBeta diversity describes the variation in species composition between sites and can be used to infer why different species occupy different parts of the globe. It can be viewed in a number of ways. First, it can be partitioned into two distinct patterns: turnover and nestedness. Second, it can be investigated from either a species identity or a functional-trait point of view. We aim to document for the first time how these two aspects of beta diversity vary in response to a large environmental gradient.
   LocationMaloti-Drakensberg Mountains, southern Africa.
   MethodsWe sampled ant assemblages along an extensive elevational gradient (900-3000m a.s.l.) twice yearly for 7years, and collected functional-trait information related to the species' dietary and habitat-structure preferences. We used recently developed methods to partition species and functional beta diversity into their turnover and nestedness components. A series of null models were used to test whether the observed beta diversity patterns differed from random expectations.
   ResultsSpecies beta diversity was driven by turnover, but functional beta diversity was composed of both turnover and nestedness patterns at different parts of the gradient. Null models revealed that deterministic processes were likely to be responsible for the species patterns but that the functional changes were indistinguishable from stochasticity.
   Main conclusionsDifferent ant species are found with increasing elevation, but they tend to represent an increasingly nested subset of the available functional strategies. This finding is unique and narrows down the list of possible factors that control ant existence across elevation. We conclude that diet and habitat preferences have little role in structuring ant assemblages in montane environments and that some other factor must be driving the non-random patterns of species turnover. This finding also highlights the importance of distinguishing between different kinds of beta diversity.

AB Analyzing wildlife tracking data frequently involves the estimation of home ranges. However, home range studies frequently lack important analytical steps, or only insufficiently report results. This makes it difficult for other researchers to evaluate, compare, and reproduce results from published home-range studies. To facilitate more thorough home-range analyses and reporting of analytical details, we developed a package for the statistical software package R that offers a user-friendly platform for comprehensive home-range analyses. Importantly, the package automatically generates a summary report that contains all analytical parameters used during analyses, and lists the main findings. To improve usability of the package, we also provide a graphical user interface that can be called from R without any programming skills. We currently implemented the calculation of site fidelity, time to statistical independence, minimum convex polygon, kernel density estimation, Brownian Bridge Movement Model, Jennrich-Turner Ellipses, local convex hull, estimation of home range asymptote, and area-independent core-area estimation.

AB AimTo identify characteristics of a human-modified landscape that promote taxonomic (TD), functional (FD) and phylogenetic (PD) dimensions of bat biodiversity.
   LocationCaribbean lowlands of northeastern Costa Rica.
   MethodsDuring the dry and wet seasons, we quantified TD (Simpson's diversity), as well as FD and PD (Rao's quadratic entropy) of phyllostomid bat assemblages at 15 sites that represented a forest loss and fragmentation gradient. FD was estimated separately for each of seven functional components that reflect particular niche axes (e.g. diet, foraging strategy) and for all functional components combined (FDall). PD was based on relatedness of species derived from a supertree. We identified the best explanatory landscape characteristics of each dimension using hierarchical partitioning.
   ResultsLandscape effects were dimension and season specific. During the dry season, TD and PD increased with increasing proportions of pasture or size of forest patches, whereas FDall decreased with increasing size of forest patches. During the wet season, TD increased with increasing forest patch size, whereas FDall and PD increased with increasing compactness of forest patches and decreasing proximity. Decomposition of FD into separate functional components revealed different landscape effects on ecological aspects of assemblages.
   Main conclusionsOne dimension of biodiversity was not a good surrogate for another. Rather, decomposition of biodiversity into different dimensions and functional components facilitated identification of the aspects of assemblages that are most affected by forest conversion and fragmentation. Areas with intermediate amounts of forest and pasture during the dry season harboured highest diversity from taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic perspectives. During the wet season, areas with large, compact forest patches promoted the dimensions of biodiversity. Placement of areas with even amounts of forest and pasture adjacent to large, compact forest patches (e.g. reserves) may maintain high biodiversity of bats and the ecosystem functions that they provide throughout the year.

AB Individual heterogeneity in life history shapes eco-evolutionary processes, and unobserved heterogeneity can affect demographic outputs characterising life history and population dynamical properties. Demographic frameworks like matrix models or integral projection models represent powerful approaches to disentangle mechanisms linking individual life histories and population-level processes. Recent developments have provided important steps towards their application to study eco-evolutionary dynamics, but so far individual heterogeneity has largely been ignored. Here, we present a general demographic framework that incorporates individual heterogeneity in a flexible way, by separating static and dynamic traits (discrete or continuous). First, we apply the framework to derive the consequences of ignoring heterogeneity for a range of widely used demographic outputs. A general conclusion is that besides the long-term growth rate lambda, all parameters can be affected. Second, we discuss how the framework can help advance current demographic models of eco-evolutionary dynamics, by incorporating individual heterogeneity. For both applications numerical examples are provided, including an empirical example for pike. For instance, we demonstrate that predicted demographic responses to climate warming can be reversed by increased heritability. We discuss how applications of this demographic framework incorporating individual heterogeneity can help answer key biological questions that require a detailed understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics.

AB Pest and pathogen disturbances are ubiquitous across forest ecosystems, impacting their species composition, structure, and function. Whereas severe abiotic disturbances (e.g., clear-cutting and fire) largely reset successional trajectories, pest and pathogen disturbances cause diffuse mortality, driving forests into nonanalogous system states. Biotic perturbations that disrupt forest carbon dynamics either reduce or enhance net primary production (NPP) and carbon storage, depending on pathogen type. Relative to defoliators, wood borers and invasive pests have the largest negative impact on NPP and the longest recovery time. Forest diversity is an important contributing factor to productivity: NPP is neutral, marginally enhanced, or reduced in high-diversity stands in which a small portion of the canopy is affected (temperate deciduous or mixed forests) but very negative in low-diversity stands in which a large portion of the canopy is affected (western US forests). Pests and pathogens reduce forest structural and functional redundancy, affecting their resilience to future climate change or new outbreaks. Therefore, pests and pathogens can be considered biotic forcing agents capable of causing consequences of similar magnitude to climate forcing factors.

AB Aim In recent decades species ranges have shifted upwards in elevation and northwards in latitude. These shifts are commonly interpreted as a response to recent climate warming. However, several alternative hypotheses have been proposed to explain the elevational shifts, including increased deposition of atmospheric nitrogen, changes in precipitation and dispersal limitation. We evaluate these hypotheses and attempt to identify the dominant drivers for the observed shifts in the upper range limits of alpine plant species.
   Location European mountains from Svalbard to the southern Alps.
   Methods We assembled data on observed shifts in the upper range limit of alpine plants over 40 to 100 years on 114 mountains. We related the observed shifts to recent changes in temperature and precipitation and to recent deposition of atmospheric nitrogen. Changes in traits and habitat preferences of species in the summit assemblages were used to evaluate the potential role of different drivers.
   Results Seventy per cent of the species that showed a detectable change in their upper range limits between surveys shifted their range limits upwards. The same species tend to move up on different mountains. There are, however, large differences between mountains in the proportion of species shifting upwards. This proportion is not found to be statistically related to local changes in temperature. Correspondingly, warmth-demanding species did not move upward more frequently than expected by chance. Snow-bed species have become more common on summits.
   Main conclusions Our data do not support the idea that climate warming is the dominant factor causing the observed range shifts of alpine plant species on European mountains: first, the amount of change in species assemblages on the summits studied is not related statistically to the amount of climate warming; second, those species that have moved upwards are not particularly warmth demanding.

AB Gas exchange, growth, water transport and carbon (C) metabolism diminish during drought according to their respective sensitivities to declining water status. The timing of this sequence of declining physiological functions may determine how water and C relations compromise plant survival. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that the degree of asynchrony between declining C supply (photosynthesis) and C demand (growth and respiration) determines the rate and magnitude of changes in whole-plant non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) during drought. Two complementary experiments using two tree species (Eucalyptus globulus Labill. and Pinus radiata D. Don) with contrasting drought response strategies were performed to (i) assess changes in radial stem growth, transpiration, leaf water potential and gas exchange in response to chronic drought, and (ii) evaluate the concomitant impacts of these drought responses on the temporal patterns of NSC during terminal drought. The three distinct phases of water stress were delineated by thresholds of growth cessation and stomatal closure that defined the 'carbon safety margin' (i.e., the difference between leaf water potential when growth is zero and leaf water potential when net photosynthesis is zero). A wider C safety margin in E. globulus was defined by an earlier cessation of growth relative to photosynthesis that reduced the demand for NSC while maintaining C acquisition. By contrast, the narrower C safety margin in P. radiata was characterized by a synchronous decline in growth and photosynthesis, whereby growth continued under a declining supply of NSC from photosynthesis. The narrower C safety margin in P. radiata was associated with declines in starch concentrations after similar to 90 days of chronic drought and significant depletion of starch in all organs at mortality. The observed divergence in the sensitivity of drought responses is indicative of a potential trade-off between maintaining hydraulic safety and adequate C availability.

AB Tests of the genetic structure of empirical populations typically focus on the correlative relationships between population connectivity and geographic and/or environmental factors in landscape genetics. However, such tests may overlook or misidentify the impact of candidate factors on genetic structure, especially when connectivity patterns differ between past and present populations because of shifting environmental conditions over time. Here we account for the underlying demographic component of population connectivity associated with a temporarily dynamic landscape in tests of the factors structuring population genetic variation in an Australian lizard, Lerista lineopunctulata, from 24 nuclear loci. Correlative tests did not support significant effect from factors associated with a static contemporary landscape. However, spatially explicit demographic modeling of genetic differentiation shows that changes in environmental conditions (as estimated from paleoclimatic data) and corresponding distributional shifts from the past to present landscape significantly structures genetic variation. Results from model-based inference (i.e., from an integrative modeling approach that generates spatially explicit expectations that are tested with approximate Bayesian computation) contrasts with those from correlative analyses, highlighting the importance of expanding the landscape genetic perspective to tests the links between pattern and process, revealing how factors shape patterns of genetic variation within species.

AB Dispersal is a key process in metacommunity dynamics, allowing the maintenance of diversity in complex community networks. Geographic distance is usually used as a surrogate for connectivity implying that communities that are closely located are considered more prone to exchange individuals than distant communities. However, in some natural systems, organisms may be subjected to directional dispersal (air or water flows, particular landscape configuration), possibly leading close communities to be isolated from each other and distant communities to be connected. Using geographic distance as a proxy for realised connectivity may then yield misleading results regarding the role of dispersal in structuring communities in such systems. Here, we quantified the relative importance of flow connectivity, geographic distance, and environmental gradients to explain polychaete metacommunity structure along the coasts of the Gulf of Lions (northwest Mediterranean Sea). Flow connectivity was estimated by Lagrangian particle dispersal simulations. Our results revealed that this metacommunity is strongly structured by the environment at large spatial scales, and that both flow connectivity and geographic distance play an important role within homogeneous environments at smaller spatial scales. We thus strongly advocate for a wider use of connectivity measures, in addition to geographic distance, to study spatial patterns of biological diversity (e.g. distance decay) and to infer the processes behind these patterns at different spatial scales. Synthesis Everything is connected, but connections are seldom accurately quantified. Biological communities are often studied separately, using observations, experiments and models to unravel local dynamics of organisms interacting with each other. However, regional processes such as dispersal through ocean and air circulation, likely to connect distant communities and influence their local dynamics, are not always accounted for, or, at best, used as an homogeneous and distance-related factor. Ocean models have being extensively developed and validated during the past decades with the increasing availability of accurate meteorological data. Using such model outputs, precise quantifi cation of exchange rates of organisms between communities was performed in a marine Mediterranean coastal area. Jointly with local environmental and biological data, these results were used to quantify the effects of realistic connectivity on local and regional polychaete community structure, and revealed that the environmental gradient, geographic distance, and connectivity were responsible for community structure at different spatial scales.

AB Improving regional estimates of actual evapotranspiration (lambda E) in water-limited regions located at climatic transition zones is critical. This study assesses an lambda E model (PT-JPL model) based on downscaling potential evapotranspiration according to multiple stresses at daily time-scale in two of these regions using MSG-SEVIRI (surface temperature and albedo) and MODIS products (NDVI, LAI and f(PAR)). An open woody savanna in the Sahel (Mali) and a Mediterranean grassland (Spain) were selected as test sites with Eddy Covariance data used for evaluation. The PT-JPL model was modified to run at a daily time step and the outputs from eight algorithms differing in the input variables and also in the formulation of the biophysical constraints (stresses) were compared with the lambda E from the Eddy Covariance. Model outputs were also compared with other modeling studies at similar global chyland ecosystems.
   The novelty of this paper is the computation of a key model parameter, the soil moisture constraint, relying on the concept of apparent thermal inertia (f(SM-ATI)) computed with surface temperature and albedo observations. Our results showed that f(SM-ATI) from both in-situ and satellite data produced satisfactory results for lambda E at the Sahelian savanna, comparable to parameterizations using field-measured Soil Water Content (SWC) with r(2) greater than 0.80. In the Mediterranean grasslands however, with much lower daily lambda E values, model results were not as good as in the Sahel (r(2)= 0.57-0.31) but still better than reported values from more complex models applied at the site such as the Two Source Model (TSM) or the Penman-Monteith Leuning model (PML).
   PT-JPL-daily model with a soil moisture constraint based on apparent thermal inertia, f(SM-ATI) offers great potential for regionalization as no field-calibrations are required and water vapor deficit estimates, required in the original version, are not necessary, being air temperature and the available energy (Rn-G) the only input variables required, apart from routinely available satellite products.

AB Urbanisation is increasing and it is essential to integrate biodiversity into the spatial planning of urban areas. This requires deeper understanding of biodiversity patterns in cities. We investigated which habitat variables are major determinants of dragonfly diversity and species assemblage structure in the municipal area of Dortmund (Germany). We sampled dragonfly larvae in 33 ponds situated in city parks, commercial, residential and agricultural areas. We recorded 30 autochthonous dragonfly species with species richness ranging from zero to 17. Additionally, we surveyed a set of environmental variables including habitat size, water level, pond structures and vegetation as well as surrounding landscape and potential disturbances like waterfowl and fish. Multivariate methods were used to identify the major determinants of dragonfly diversity, abundance and assemblage structure. Analysis indicated that diversity of aquatic and terrestrial vegetation affected dragonfly diversity positively. City park ponds had low diversity, but Ischnura elegans was obviously promoted by the specific park pond conditions, including high waterfowl density. We found five assemblages mostly determined by generalistic species which were related to different pond types. Moderately disturbed ruderal and pioneer ponds in residential and agricultural areas also contained increased numbers of rare species. Our results indicate that urban ponds may have a great value for maintaining biodiversity, but various disturbances have negative impact. To promote urban biodiversity we suggest a natural design of well-vegetated ponds as well as a high diversity of different pond types and particularly a more-natural redesign of city park ponds.

AB Increasing evidence has accumulated within the last decade that individuals of different animal species show consistent behavior both across various contexts and through time, that is, they do have personality. However, little is known in how far the environment an individual is facing may influence the personality of insects, whereas it is well established that the environment can have profound influences on performance parameters. The development of personality may be closely linked to different expectations in future fitness leading to contrasting life-history strategies. We investigated in how far the environmental food conditions experienced during lifetime influence the life-history and shape the personality of the mustard leaf beetle, Phaedon cochleariae, a pest of crucifers. Beetles reared on low-quality food developed slower and gained lower body masses than insects reared on high-quality food. By performing behavioral tests analogous to vertebrate assays repeatedly during adult life, we identified 3 personality dimensions, boldness, activity, and nontargeted explorativeness. Comparing food-dependent differences of the personality dimensions with state-dependent differences of the expected future prospects, we found that beetles feeding low-quality food were bolder, thereby potentially increasing their capabilities to succeed in foraging. In contrast, animals feeding high-quality food were more active. Changes in boldness may be highly adaptive to increase future reproductive output, whereas activity is likely constrained by the energy uptake. Our results demonstrate that the environment does not only affect life-history traits but has also a consistent impact on an individual's behavior, which is likely highly adaptive.

AB Aim We test the prediction that beta diversity (species turnover) and the decay of community similarity with distance depend on spatial resolution (grain). We also study whether patterns of beta diversity are related to variability in climate, land cover or geographic distance and how the independent effects of these variables depend on the spatial grain of the data. Location Europe, Great Britain, Finland and Catalonia. Methods We used data on European birds, plants, butterflies, amphibians and reptiles, and data on British plants, Catalonian birds and Finnish butterflies. We fitted two or three nested grids of varying resolutions to each of these datasets. For each grid we calculated differences in climate, differences in land-cover composition (CORINE) and beta diversity (beta sim, beta Jaccard) between all pairs of grid cells. In a separate analysis we looked specifically at pairs of adjacent grid cells (the first distance class). We then used variation partitioning to identify the magnitude of independent statistical associations (i.e. independent effects in the statistical sense) of climate, land cover and geographic distance with spatial patterns of beta diversity. Results Beta diversity between grid cells at any given distance decreased with increasing grain. Geographic distance was always the most important predictor of beta diversity for all pairwise comparisons at the extent of Europe. Climate and land cover had weaker but distinct and grain-dependent effects. Climate was more important at relatively coarse grains, whereas land-cover effects were stronger at finer grains. In the country-wide analyses, climate and land cover were more important than geographic distance. Climatic and land-cover models performed poorly and showed no systematic grain dependence for beta diversity between adjacent grid cells. Main conclusions We found that relationships between geographic distance and beta diversity, as well as the environmental correlates of beta diversity, are systematically grain dependent. The strong independent effect of distance indicates that, contrary to the current belief, a substantial fraction of species are missing from areas with a suitable environment. Moreover, the effects of geographic distance (at continental extents) and land cover (at fine grains) indicate that any species distribution modelling should take both environment and dispersal limitation into account.

AB Barriers to gene flow between naturally hybridizing taxa reveal the initial stages of speciation. Reduced hybrid fertility is a common feature of reproductive barriers separating recently diverged species. In house mice (Mus musculus), hybrid male sterility has been studied extensively using experimental crosses between subspecies. Here, we present the first detailed picture of hybrid male fertility in the European M. m. domesticusM. m. musculus hybrid zone. Complete sterility appears rare or absent in natural hybrids but a large proportion of males (similar to 30%) have sperm count or relative testis weight below the range in pure subspecies, and likely suffer reduced fertility. Comparison of a suite of traits related to fertility among subfertile males indicates reduced hybrid fertility in the contact zone is highly variable among individuals and ancestry groups in the type, number, and severity of spermatogenesis defects present. Taken together, these results suggest multiple underlying genetic incompatibilities are segregating in the hybrid zone, which likely contribute to reproductive isolation between subspecies.

AB Animals in urban habitats face a number of unique stresses, including the necessity of dealing with high levels of human activity. Growing research suggests that: (1) inherent traits, as opposed to learned behavior, influence which species invade urban habitats, and (2) individuals exhibit behavioral syndromes that limit behavioral flexibility. As a result, perhaps only animals with inherently bold personalities successfully settle in areas of high human activity, and such animals may also exhibit correlated variation in other behavioral traits, such as territorial aggression. In this study, we examine boldness and aggression in several urban and rural populations of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). We found that urban birds were both bolder toward humans and also showed higher levels of aggression. We found a correlation between boldness and aggression in all populations combined, but no correlation within urban populations. Our results agree with other recent studies of song sparrow behavior, suggesting that greater boldness and aggression are general features of urban song sparrow populations, and a lack of a correlation between boldness and aggression in urban habitats is a general phenomenon as well. Urban habitats may select for bold and aggressive birds, and yet the traits can vary independently. These results add to a small number of studies which find that behavioral syndromes break down in potentially high quality habitats.

AB Aim This study explores the relationship between orchid species richness along elevational gradients in the central and eastern Himalaya. Specifically, we aimed to test predictions of maximum richness at different elevational levels for orchid species geographically restricted to central and eastern Himalaya (endemics), and total orchid richness, including different life forms. We then compared and assessed climatic factors together with area as causal explanations for the observed patterns.
   Location Nepal (100-5200 m a.s.l.), Bhutan (100-5200 m a.s.l.), and adjacent regions of India, i.e. Sikkim and Darjeeling.
   Methods We used published data on the distribution of orchids to interpolate presence between maximum and minimum recorded elevations in 100-m elevational zones. These patterns were compared with previously published patterns for other plant groups, which were derived in the same way. Descriptive regressions with metres above sea level (m a.s.l.) as the independent variable were performed using nonparametric generalized additive models (GAMs), whereas tests of the diversity models were carried out using parametric generalized linear models (GLMs).
   Results A hump-shaped relationship between orchid species richness and elevation was observed in Nepal and Bhutan, with maximum richness at 1600 m a.s.l. corresponding to c. 16 degrees C mean annual temperature. The richness of orchid species that are endemic to central and eastern Himalaya showed a bimodal pattern. Richness of endemic epiphytes peaked at elevation zones similar to those for total richness, but the peak in numbers of endemic terrestrial species occurred at a higher elevation.
   Main conclusions This study shows that climatic variables (temperature and precipitation) provide a good potential explanation for orchid species richness along the Himalayan elevational gradient, even when the effect of area is considered. The principal elevational peak in richness of central and eastern Himalayan endemics was consistent with the peak in total orchid richness, but maximum terrestrial endemic richness occurred at higher elevations.

AB The quality and amount of productivity plays a central role in determining community structure and biogeochemical dynamics in ecosystems. Humans have altered river ecosystems in multiple ways that are likely to influence annual rates of ecosystem productivity and metabolism, but the net affects of such modifications on these processes are poorly known, especially at annual scales. An analysis of annual, whole ecosystem productivity for over 200 streams and rivers shows that human activities shift the amount, quality, and spatial distribution of production in river networks via enrichment of resources that limit autotrophic production. Human actions increased primary production to a greater degree than heterotrophic respiration, shifting streams (i.e., sites <100 km(2) watershed area) toward greater autochthony. Whereas human activities change multiple aspects of environmental conditions in streams, and often result in habitat degradation, reduction in biodiversity, and elevated contaminants, these analyses show that primary and secondary productivity of strongly impacted streams increased by over 600% relative to reference (pristine/lightly modified) sites due to increased resource availability and quality. A human-driven increase in autotrophic-based production is thus likely a major factor in ongoing global shifts in biodiversity, trophic dynamics and element cycling in streams.

AB City governments are fundamental to implement international environmental agreements, such as the convention on biological diversity (CBD). Even though many of them are not directly involved in the negotiation of international agreements, which are signed by national governments, most of those agreements are in fact implemented at the city level. The importance of city governance to tackle the challenges of biodiversity loss has increased as urban population has grown enormously in the last decades, particularly in developing countries. The way cities are designed, planned and governed influences the magnitude of their direct and indirect impacts on biodiversity.
   This paper analyzes the relationship between cities, local governance and biodiversity. Initially, we examine the relationships between cities and biodiversity by looking at the major influences cities have on biodiversity loss or conservation within and outside the city boundaries, as well as the benefits of biodiversity conservation to cities, such as the provision of ecosystem services. The paper then moves to understand what are the main urban processes and governance mechanisms that can be improved to make cities effective to implement the directives of the CBD.
   Urbanization creates new challenges for biodiversity conservation. As a large part of the world's population moves from rural to urban areas, there are changes in the link between human activities and biodiversity, and consequently to the way we should think biodiversity conservation policies. However, scarce attention has been given to understand how to make cities more biodiversity friendly, both within the urban fabric, but particularly in faraway places. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB P>1. Competition theory predicts that community structure may be shaped by resource partitioning between co-occurring species. As such, quantifying the degree of resource partitioning (i.e., niche overlap) is a key component of studies examining community structure and species coexistence.
   2. For many organisms, multiple resource axes quantify niche space. Each axis may be described by a different type of data (e.g. categorical, continuous, count or binary data, as well as electivity scores), with different data types requiring different statistical treatments. Therefore, incorporating multiple axes into a single measure of niche space is problematic.
   3. Here, we propose general methods for combining multiple niche axes, each characterized by different data types, within a unified analysis of niche overlap. Using appropriate transformations and probability models, we show that each data type can give rise to directly comparable measures of niche overlap, with the overlap statistic between two species defined as the overlapping area between the distributions for each species.
   4. Measurements derived from different types of data can be combined into a single unified analysis of niche overlap by averaging over multiple axes.
   5. We then describe null model permutation tests that assess statistical differences in niche overlap, which can address questions commonly posed by population ecologists (e.g. do two species occupy different niche space?) and community ecologists (e.g. are multiple species evenly distributed across niche space?).
   6. To illustrate the use of these newly devised indices, we use an example from reef fishes that combines ratio, categorical and electivity data, and an example from alpine plants that combines continuous and ratio data.
   7. The methods described in this article are relevant to a wide variety of ecological projects, including the investigation of invasive species, relative abundance distributions, global change, species coexistence and evolutionary diversification.

AB P>The leaf carbon isotope ratio (delta 13C) of C-3 plants is inversely related to the drawdown of CO2 concentration during photosynthesis, which increases towards drier environments. We aimed to discriminate between the hypothesis of universal scaling, which predicts between-species responses of delta 13C to aridity similar to within-species responses, and biotic homoeostasis, which predicts offsets in the delta 13C of species occupying adjacent ranges.
   The Northeast China Transect spans 130-900 mm annual precipitation within a narrow latitude and temperature range. Leaves of 171 species were sampled at 33 sites along the transect (18 at >= 5 sites) for dry matter, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content, specific leaf area (SLA) and delta 13C.
   The delta 13C of species generally followed a common relationship with the climatic moisture index (MI). Offsets between adjacent species were not observed. Trees and forbs diverged slightly at high MI. In C-3 plants, delta 13C predicted N per unit leaf area (N-area) better than MI. The delta 13C of C-4 plants was invariant with MI. SLA declined and N-area increased towards low MI in both C-3 and C-4 plants.
   The data are consistent with optimal stomatal regulation with respect to atmospheric dryness. They provide evidence for universal scaling of CO2 drawdown with aridity in C-3 plants.

AB Stress regimes defined as the synchronous or sequential action of abiotic and biotic stresses determine the performance and distribution of species. The natural patterns of stress to which species are more or less well adapted have recently started to shift and alter under the influence of global change. This was the motivation to review our knowledge on the stress ecology of a benthic key player, the macroalgal genus Fucus. We first provide a comprehensive review of the genus as an ecological model including what is currently known about the major lineages of Fucus species with respect to hybridization, ecotypic differentiation and speciation; as well as life history, population structure and geographic distribution. We then review our current understanding of both extrinsic (abiotic/biotic) and intrinsic (genetic) stress(es) on Fucus species and how they interact with each other.
   It is concluded that (i) interactive stress effects appear to be equally distributed over additive, antagonistic and synergistic categories at the level of single experiments, but are predominantly additive when averaged over all studies in a meta-analysis of 41 experiments; (ii) juvenile and adult responses to stress frequently differ and (iii) several species or particular populations of Fucus may be relatively unaffected by climate change as a consequence of pre-adapted ecotypes that collectively express wide physiological tolerences.
   Future research on Fucus should (i) include additional species, (ii) include marginal populations as models for responses to environmental stress; (iii) assess a wider range of stress combinations, including their temporal fluctuations; (iv) better differentiate between stress sensitivity of juvenile versus adult stages; (v) include a functional genomic component in order to better integrate Fucus' ecological and evolutionary responses to stress regimes and (vi) utilize a multivariate modelling approach in order to develop and understand interaction networks.

AB Greater recognition of the seriousness of global environmental change has led to an increase in research that assesses the vulnerability of households, communities and regions to changing environmental or economic conditions. So far, however, there has been relatively little attention given to how assessments can be conducted in ways that help build capacity for local communities to understand and find their own solutions to their problems. This paper reports on an approach that was designed and used to work with a local grass roots organization in the Solomon Islands to promote inclusivity and participation in decision-making and to build the capacity of the organization to reduce the vulnerability of communities to drivers of change. The process involved working collaboratively with the organization and training its members to conduct vulnerability assessments with communities using participatory and deliberative methods. To make best use of the learning opportunities provided by the research process, specific periods for formal reflection were incorporated for the three key stakeholders involved: the primary researchers; research assistants; and community members. Overall, the approach: (1) promoted learning about the current situation in Kahua and encouraged deeper analysis of problems; (2) built capacity for communities to manage the challenges they were facing; and (3) fostered local ownership and responsibility for problems and set precedents for future participation in decision-making. While the local organization and the communities it serves still face significant challenges, the research approach set the scene for greater local participation and effort to maintain and enhance livelihoods and wellbeing. The outcomes highlight the need for greater emphasis on embedding participatory approaches in vulnerability assessments for communities to benefit fully from the process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The three-spined stickleback is a widespread Holarctic species complex that radiated from the sea into freshwaters after the retreat of the Pleistocene ice sheets. In Switzerland, sticklebacks were absent with the exception of the far northwest, but different introduced populations have expanded to occupy a wide range of habitats since the late 19th century. A well-studied adaptive phenotypic trait in sticklebacks is the number of lateral plates. With few exceptions, freshwater and marine populations in Europe are fixed for either the low plated phenotype or the fully plated phenotype, respectively. Switzerland, in contrast, harbours in close proximity the full range of phenotypic variation known from across the continent. We addressed the phylogeographic origins of Swiss sticklebacks using mitochondrial partial cytochrome b and control region sequences. We found only five different haplotypes but these originated from three distinct European regions, fixed for different plate phenotypes. These lineages occur largely in isolation at opposite ends of Switzerland, but co-occur in a large central part. Across the country, we found a strong correlation between a microsatellite linked to the high plate ectodysplasin allele and the mitochondrial haplotype from a region where the fully plated phenotype is fixed. Phylogenomic and population genomic analysis of 481 polymorphic amplified fragment length polymorphism loci indicate genetic admixture in the central part of the country. The same part of the country also carries elevated within-population phenotypic variation. We conclude that during the recent invasive range expansion of sticklebacks in Switzerland, adaptive and neutral between-population genetic variation was converted into within-population variation, raising the possibility that hybridization between colonizing lineages contributed to the ecological success of sticklebacks in Switzerland.

AB The process of speciation begins with genomically-localised barriers to gene exchange associated with loci for local adaptation, intrinsic incompatibility or assortative mating. The barrier then spreads until reproductive isolation influences the whole genome. The population genomics approach can be used to identify regions of reduced gene flow by detecting loci with greater differentiation than expected from the average across many loci. Recently, this approach has been used in several systems. I review these studies, concentrating on the robustness of the approach and the methods available to go beyond the simple identification of differentiated markers. Population genomics has already contributed significantly to understanding the balance between gene flow and selection during the evolution of reproductive isolation and has great future potential both in genome species and in non-model organisms.

AB Among the extraordinary adaptations driven by sperm competition is the cooperative behaviour of spermatozoa(1). By forming cooperative groups, sperm can increase their swimming velocity and thereby gain an advantage in intermale sperm competition(1,2). Accordingly, selection should favour cooperation of the most closely related sperm to maximize fitness(3). Here we show that sperm of deer mice (genus Peromyscus) form motile aggregations, then we use this system to test predictions of sperm cooperation. We find that sperm aggregate more often with conspecific than heterospecific sperm, suggesting that individual sperm can discriminate on the basis of genetic relatedness. Next, we provide evidence that the cooperative behaviour of closely related sperm is driven by sperm competition. In a monogamous species lacking sperm competition, Peromyscus polionotus, sperm indiscriminately group with unrelated conspecific sperm. In contrast, in the highly promiscuous deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, sperm are significantly more likely to aggregate with those obtained from the same male than with sperm from an unrelated conspecific donor. Even when we test sperm from sibling males, we continue to see preferential aggregations of related sperm in P. maniculatus. These results suggest that sperm from promiscuous deer mice discriminate among relatives and thereby cooperate with the most closely related sperm, an adaptation likely to have been driven by sperm competition.

AB Streams are highly heterogeneous ecosystems, in terms of both geomorphology and hydrodynamics. While flow is recognized to shape the physical architecture of benthic biofilms, we do not yet understand what drives community assembly and biodiversity of benthic biofilms in the heterogeneous flow landscapes of streams. Within a metacommunity ecology framework, we experimented with streambed landscapes constructed from bedforms in large-scale flumes to illuminate the role of spatial flow heterogeneity in biofilm community composition and biodiversity in streams. Our results show that the spatial variation of hydrodynamics explained a remarkable percentage (up to 47%) of the variation in community composition along bedforms. This suggests species sorting as a model of metacommunity dynamics in stream biofilms, though natural biofilm communities will clearly not conform to a single model offered by metacommunity ecology. The spatial variation induced by the hydrodynamics along the bedforms resulted in a gradient of bacterial beta diversity, measured by a range of diversity and similarity indices, that increased with bedform height and hence with spatial flow heterogeneity at the flume level. Our results underscore the necessity to maintain small-scale physical heterogeneity for community composition and biodiversity of biofilms in stream ecosystems.

AB There have been a few cross-national studies published that examine the determinants of threatened mammal species. However, these studies neglect insights from both ecologically unequal exchange theory and world polity theory. We seek to address this gap in the literature using cross-national data for a sample of 74 nations to construct negative binomial regression models with the number of threatened mammal species as the dependent variable. In doing so, we find substantial support for ecologically unequal exchange theory that flows of primary sector exports from poor to rich nations are associated with higher levels of threatened mammals in poor nations. We also find support for world polity theory that environmental non-governmental organizations are associated with lower levels of threatened mammals in poor nations. We conclude with a discussion of the findings, some policy implications, and possible directions for future research.

AB P>Simultaneously growing sinks are thought to compete for plant resources. Negative correlations, for example between grain number and stem mass in cereals, indeed resemble competition; but is the notion of intra-plant competition evolutionarily justified? Here we review intra-plant competition in light of two aspects of evolutionary biology: (a) major transitions that led to the reorganization of evolutionary individuals (e.g. isolated DNA molecules and independent cells) into new units of adaptation (e.g. chromosomes and multicellular organisms) with associated constraints to intra-individual conflict; and (b) genomic conflicts within individual plants with implications for resource allocation. Against this background, we look at apparent competition among genetically identical plant parts, and conclude that plants might use competition-like mechanisms to allocate resources, but only to the extent that these proximate mechanisms enhance overall plant fitness. In dealing with apparent competition among genetically different plant structures, we emphasize developing seeds attached to the same maternal plant, and the determination of yield components in annual crops. We propose that competition-like mechanisms among genetically different plant parts have been strongly shaped by the evolution of genomic conflict between parent and offspring, between female and male parents, and among siblings. By defining the number and potential size of grain simultaneously and before fertilization, a strong maternal control of resource allocation is exerted that favours uniform offspring size and partially counteracts genomic conflict.

AB No single hypothesis or theory has been widely accepted for explaining the functional mechanism of global alpine/arctic treeline formation. The present study tested whether the alpine treeline is determined by (1) the needle nitrogen content associated with photosynthesis (carbon gain); (2) a sufficient source-sink ratio of carbon; or (3) a sufficient C-N ratio. Nitrogen does not limit the growth and development of trees studied at the Himalayan treelines. Levels of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in trees were species-specific and site-dependent; therefore, the treeline cases studied did not show consistent evidence of source/carbon limitation or sink/growth limitation in treeline trees. However, results of the combined three treelines showed that the treeline trees may suffer from a winter carbon shortage. The source capacity and the sink capacity of a tree influence its tissue NSC concentrations and the carbon balance; therefore, we suggest that the persistence and development of treeline trees in a harsh alpine environment may require a minimum level of the total NSC concentration, a sufficiently high sugar:starch ratio, and a balanced carbon source-sink relationship.

TI Understanding Wordscores
SO POLITICAL ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
ID POLICY POSITIONS; POLITICAL TEXTS
AB Wordscores is a widely used procedure for inferring policy positions, or scores, for new documents on the basis of scores for words derived from documents with known scores. It is computationally straightforward, requires no distributional assumptions, but has unresolved practical and theoretical problems. In applications, estimated document scores are on the wrong scale and the theoretical development does not specify a statistical model, so it is unclear what assumptions the method makes about political text and how to tell whether they fit particular text analysis applications. The first part of the paper demonstrates that badly scaled document score estimates reflect deeper problems with the method. The second part shows how to understand Wordscores as an approximation to correspondence analysis which itself approximates a statistical ideal point model for words. Problems with the method are identified with the conditions under which these layers of approximation fail to ensure consistent and unbiased estimation of the parameters of the ideal point model.

In contrast, here we propose MaxREnt as a tool for applying statistical mechanics to ecology. We use MaxREnt to explain and predict species abundance patterns in ecological communities in terms of the most probable behaviour under given environmental constraints, in the same way that statistical mechanics explains and predicts the behaviour of thermodynamic systems. We show that MaxREnt unifies a number of different ecological patterns: (i) at relatively local scales a unimodal biodiversity-productivity relationship is predicted in good agreement with published data on grassland communities, (ii) the predicted relative frequency of rare vs. abundant species is very similar to the empirical lognormal distribution, (iii) both neutral and non-neutral species abundance patterns are explained, (iv) on larger scales a monotonic biodiversity-productivity relationship is predicted in agreement with the species-energy law, (v) energetic equivalence and power law self-thinning behaviour are predicted in resource-rich communities. We identify mathematical similarities between these ecological patterns and the behaviour of thermodynamic systems, and conclude that the explanation of ecological patterns is not unique to ecology but rather reflects the generic statistical behaviour of complex systems with many degrees of freedom under very general types of environmental constraints.

AB 1. Environmental conditions experienced early in life may have long-lasting effects on individual performance, thereby creating 'silver-spoon effects'.
   2. We used 15 years of data from a North American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus Erxleben) population to investigate influences of food availability, density and spring temperature experienced early in life on reproduction and survival of female squirrels during adulthood.
   3. We found that spring temperature and food availability did not affect female survival after 1 year of age, whereas higher squirrel densities led to lower survival, thereby affecting longevity and lifetime fitness.
   4. In addition, both food availability experienced between birth and weaning, and spring temperature in the year of birth, had long-lasting positive effects on female reproductive success. These results emphasize the critical effect environmental conditions during the early life stages can have on the lifetime performance of small mammals.
   5. These long-term effects of early food and temperature were apparent only once we controlled for conditions experienced during adulthood. This suggests that silver-spoon effects can be masked when conditions experienced early in life are correlated to some environmental conditions experienced later in life.
   6. The general importance of silver-spoon effects for adult demographic performance might therefore be underestimated, and taking adult environment into account appears to be necessary when studying long-term cohort effects.

AB The effects of anthropogenic disturbances on forest structure and plant diversity of secondary forest ecosystems were evaluated based on the classification by site factors in the montane regions of northeastern China. Forty-five sample plots containing 720 sub-plots of overstory species (8 m x 8 m), 1,440 quadrats of understory species (2 m x 2 m), and 1,440 quadrats of herbaceous layer species (1 m x 1 m) were clustered into five groups (G1, G2, G3, G4 and G5) by site variables with Hierarchical Cluster Analysis. Meanwhile, the disturbance levels corresponding to the five groups were determined according to the factors influencing human disturbances (D0-G2, D1-G1, D2-G3, D3-G5, and D4-G4). Species diversities of overstory, understory, herbaceous layer and overall species were evaluated using species number, Margalef index, Pielou index, Shannon-Wiener index, and Simpson index; and beta-diversities (Whittaker index, Cody index). Basal area of stands exhibited a decreasing trend along the disturbance level due to a gradual increase in the extraction of timber by the human disturbances. The indices of species diversity suggested that overstory and understory species were distributed evenly among the groups or disturbance levels. There were no absolutely dominant tree species in the secondary forest ecosystems. The differences in site factors and the current disturbance intensities were not intense enough to lead to loose changes in overstory and understory species. The species diversity indices exhibited the maximum values at D3 (G5) for herbaceous layer species; this may suggest that the current disturbance intensities were intense enough to lead the changes of herbaceous layer species. Three rare and endangered species (Juglans mandshurica, Fraxinus mandshurica and Acanthopanax senticosus) were found within the secondary forests. These rare and endangered species appeared in each clustered group or disturbance level, which suggested that the current disturbance intensity in the study area was not strong enough to influence the distribution of rare and endangered species. The current disturbances in the secondary forests may not lead to a decrease in stability and complexity of the overstory and understory species, but the higher disturbance level may be intense enough to change the habitat fitness for the herbaceous species.

AB Investigating the relationship of biodiversity and ecosystem function in natural forests allows incorporation of established feedbacks between long-lived plants and soil processes. We studied forested stands in northern Arizona that vary in dominant species richness across small areas. We examined the effects of natural variation in dominant tree biodiversity on ecosystem parameters, particularly litter decomposition. We determined not only whether plant species decompose in mixture as predicted by their individual decomposition rates but also: (1) how particular species affect the decomposition rate of each other in mixture; and (2) whether litter decomposes more rapidly at its site of origin; i.e. is there a "home field advantage" to decomposition? Over a 2-year period, litter mixtures of functionally similar tree species decomposed more rapidly than expected from rates of the individual species alone. Mixtures of conifer species litter decomposed up to 50% faster than expected, with individual conifer members of those mixtures decomposing up to 85% faster than expected. In contrast, more functionally diverse mixtures of litter, which included a deciduous species, did not show synergistic effects during decomposition. We found no significant "home-field advantage" to decomposition. Our study is the first to demonstrate that litter mixtures from more closely related plant species give rise to the most synergistic effects of biodiversity on litter dynamics, indicating that more taxonomically and functionally diverse plant assemblages do not always drive greater emergent effects on ecosystem function.

AB Anthropogenic activities have weakened biogeographical barriers to dispersal resulting in the global spread and establishment of an increasing number of non-native species. We examine the broad-scale consequences of this phenomenon based on an analysis of compositional similarity across urban floras in the northeastern United States and Europe. We test the prediction that homogenization of species composition is uniquely defined within vs. between continents based on the time and place of origin of non-native species. In this case, for archaeophytes and neophytes in Europe (introduced before and after AD 1500, respectively) and non-native species originating from within and outside the United States. More species in urban floras were shared within than between continents. Within Europe, archaeophytes shared more species across urban floras compared with neophytes; strong associations were not observed for non-native species across US urban floras. Between the two continents, non-native species in the United States that originated from outside the United States shared species primarily with archaeophytes but also with European natives and neophytes. These results suggest that the direction of biotic interchange was unidirectional with species moving primarily from Europe to the United States with archaeophytes playing a primary and non-native species originating from outside the two continents a secondary role as a homogenizing source. Archaeophytes, based on combination of biogeographical, evolutionary, and ecological factors in association with a long history of anthropogenic influence, appear to have played a prominent role in the continental and intercontinental homogenization of species composition. This suggests that the uniform homogenization of the Earth's biota is not imminent and is presently directed by a combination of biogeographically defined anthropogenic and historical factors.

AB Contrary to the conventional theory of optimal stomatal control, there is substantial transpiration at night in many tree species, but the functional significance of this phenomenon remains uncertain. To investigate the possible roles of nocturnal transpiration, we compared and contrasted the correlations of both nocturnal and diurnal sap flow with a range of traits in 21 temperate deciduous tree species. These traits included soil water affinity, shade tolerance, cold hardiness, nitrogen concentration of tissues, minimum transpiration rate of excised leaves, growth rate, photosynthetic capacity, stomatal length and density, and the water potential and relative water content of leaves at the wilting point. Nocturnal sap flow was higher in species with higher leaf nitrogen concentrations, higher rates of extension growth and lower shade tolerances. Diurnal sap flow was higher in species with higher leaf nitrogen concentrations and photosynthetic capacities on a leaf area basis. Because leaf metabolism and dark respiration, in particular, are strongly related to leaf nitrogen concentration, our findings suggest that nocturnal transpiration functions to sustain carbohydrate export and other processes driven by dark respiration, and that this function is most important in fast-growing shade-intolerant tree species.

AB In many tropical countries forest fragmentation caused by changes in human land use activities is of primary concern for sustainability. In Malaysia this relationship is usually described without any quantitative measurement to show the implications for land use planning and management. To understand this relationship, this study developed a single forest fragmentation index based on a combination of three landscape metrics, i.e., non-forest area, forest edge bordered by human land use and patch size coefficient of variation, using the state of Selangor, Malaysia as a case study. Two defined natural landscapes; wetland and forest landscapes were used as a basic unit of analyses of pattern change of forest fragmentation and its relationship to human land use in three temporal years of 1966, 1981 and 1995. Results showed that forest fragmentation in the state of Selangor generally increased during the time periods studied. Multiple regression analysis showed that human land use is an important determinant of forest fragmentation, but the significance of several land uses as explanatory variables to forest fragmentation changed temporally. Oil palm and rubber plantations were apparently the major contributors to forest fragmentation. Differences in fragmentation pattern occurred between the two natural landscapes. Forest fragmentation increased in the wetland landscape, whereas not much change was observed in the forest landscape. Oil palm plantation appeared to be the major contributor to forest fragmentation in the wetland landscape, whereas rubber plantation was the major factor in the forest landscape. This study also revealed that knowledge of forest fragmentation through a single index in different natural landscapes provides a pathway for identifying which forested areas are highly threatened and must be given priority in strategic planning of nature conservation. In conclusion, it is vital to understand the relationship between changes in human land use and degree of forest degradation measured by a single index in order to describe the implications for land use planning and management.

AB The mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae is a native species currently experiencing large-scale outbreaks in western North American pine forests. We sought to describe the pattern of genetic variation across the range of this species, to determine whether there were detectable genetic differences between D. ponderosae occupying different host trees in common localities, and to determine whether there was molecular evidence for a past demographic expansion. Using a combination of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and mitochondrial sequencing analyses, we found evidence of genetic structuring among populations that followed a broad isolation-by-distance pattern. Our results suggest that the geographical pattern of gene flow follows the core distribution of the principal D. ponderosae host species, around rather than across the Great Basin and Mojave Deserts. Patterns of haplotype diversity and divergence were consistent with a range-wide population expansion. This signal was particularly pronounced in the northern part of the species' range, where outbreak activity is currently increasing. Using AFLP markers, we were unable to detect significant differences among groups of insects sampled from different host trees in common locations. Incidentally, we found that a large proportion of the polymorphic AFLP markers were gender-specific, occurring only in males. While we did not include these markers in our analyses, this finding warrants further investigation.

AB Environmental factors play a key role in the expression of phenotypic traits and life-history decisions, specifically when they act during early development. In birds, brood size is a main environmental factor affecting development. Experimental manipulation of brood sizes can result in reduced offspring condition, indicating that developmental deficits in enlarged broods have consequences within the affected generation. Yet, it is unclear whether stress during early development can have fitness consequences projecting into the next generation. To study such trans-generational fitness effects, we bred female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, whose mothers had been raised in different experimental brood sizes. We found that adult females were increasingly smaller with increasing experimental brood size in which their mother had been raised. Furthermore, reproductive success at hatching and fledging covaried negatively with the experimental brood size in which their mothers were raised. These results illustrate that early developmental stress can have long-lasting effects affecting reproductive success of future generations. Such trans-generational effects can be life-history responses adapted to environmental conditions experienced early in life.

AB Although homoploid hybridization is increasingly recognized as an important phenomenon in plant evolution, its evolutionary genetic mechanisms are poorly documented and understood. Pinus densata, a pine native to the Tibetan Plateau, represents a good example of a homoploid hybrid speciation facilitated by adaptation to extreme environment and ecological isolation from the parents. Its ecologically and reproductively stabilized nature offers excellent opportunity for studying genetic processes associated with hybrid speciation. In this study, we investigated the levels and patterns of nucleotide variation in P. densata and its putative parents. Haplotype composition, gene genealogies, and the levels and patterns of nucleotide variation gave further support to the hybrid nature of P. densata. Allelic history, as revealed by our data, suggests the ancient nature of the hybrid preceding elevation of the Tibetan Plateau. We detected more deviations from neutrality in P. densata than in the parental species. Thus, at least some of the evolutionary forces that have shaped the genetic variation in P. densata are likely to be different from those acting upon parental species. We speculate that when populations of P. densata invaded new territories, they had elevated rates of response to selection in order to develop traits that help them to survive and adapt in the new environments.

AB Recent studies have demonstrated male mate choice for female ornaments in species without sex-role reversal. Despite these empirical findings, little is known about the adaptive dynamics of female signalling, in particular the evolution of male mating preferences. The evolution of traits that signal mate quality is more complex in females than in males because females usually provide the bulk of resources for the developing offspring. Here, we investigate the evolution of male mating preferences using a mathematical model which: (i) specifically accounts for the fact that females must trade-off resources invested in ornaments with reproduction; and (ii) allows male mating preferences to evolve a non-directional shape. The optimal adaptive strategy for males is to develop stabilizing mating preferences for female display traits to avoid females that either invests too many or too few resources in ornamentation. However, the evolutionary stability of this prediction is dependent upon the level of error made by females when allocating resources to either signal or fecundity.

AB Ecologists often consider how environmental factors limit a species' geographic range. However, recent models suggest that geographic distribution also may be determined by a species' ability to adapt to novel environmental conditions. In this study, we empirically tested whether further evolution would be necessary for northern expansion of the weedy annual cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium) in its native North American range. We transplanted seedlings beyond the northern border and photoperiodically manipulated reproductive timing, a trait important for adaptation to shorter growing seasons at higher latitudes within the range, to determine whether further evolution of this trait would result in a phenotype viable beyond the range. Earlier reproductive induction enabled plants to produce mature seeds beyond the range and to achieve a reproductive output similar to those grown within the range. Therefore, evolution of earlier reproduction in marginal populations would be necessary for northward range expansion. This study is the first to empirically show that evolution in an ecologically important trait would enable a species to survive and reproduce beyond its current range. These results suggest that relatively few traits may limit a species' range and that identifying evolutionary constraints on such traits could be important for predicting geographic distribution.

AB Suding et al. (2004) demonstrate how conceptual advances in alternative ecosystem states theory have led to a greater understanding of why degraded systems are often resilient to restoration management. In their review they pose one (of several) 'outstanding' questions (Box 3 in Suding et al. 2004): "Are there predictable characteristics that indicate when a system will follow a successional pathway and/or that indicate the presence or absence of alternative ecosystem states?" We suggest that the persistence of alternative stable states might be predicted from simple consideration of assembly rules for systems structured along a gradient of environmental adversity. We raise the hypothesis that strongly abiotically- or disturbance-structured assemblages, with nonrandom trait under-dispersion (Weiher and Keddy 1995), are more likely to exhibit catastrophic phase shifts in community structure than assemblages which are weakly structured by environmental adversity.

AB The apparent extravagance of begging displays is usually attributed to selection for features, such as loud calls, that make the signal costly and hence reliable. An alternative explanation, however, is that these design features are needed for effective signal transmission and reception. Here, we test the latter hypothesis by examining how the begging calls of tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) nestlings and the response to these calls by parents are affected by ambient noise. In a field study, we found that call length, amplitude and frequency range all increased with increasing noise levels at nests. In the laboratory, however, only call amplitude increased in response to the playback of noise to nestlings. In field playbacks to parents, similar levels of noise abolished parental preferences for higher call rates, but the preference was restored when call amplitude was increased to the level that nestlings had used in the laboratory study. Our results show that nestling birds, like other acoustic signallers, consistently increase call amplitude in response to ambient noise and this response appears to enhance discrimination by receivers. Thus, selection for signal efficacy may explain some of the seemingly extravagant features of begging displays.

AB Size-fractionated, carbon-specific photosynthesis by natural phytoplankton assemblages has been analysed during a full annual cycle in a coastal, productive ecosystem. We observed high variability in the carbon-specific photosynthetic rates by the different phytoplankton size fractions. In surface waters, under high irradiance levels, large-sized phytoplankton showed consistently higher carbon-specific photosynthetic rates than small-sized cells. We suggest the possibility that interspecific differences in acquisition and use of light and nutrients account for this pattern. Under light-limited conditions at the bottom of the euphotic layer, differences in the carbon-specific photosynthesis between size fractions were lower or disappeared, which was likely due to the package effect on larger cells. Our results show that when the whole phytoplankton community is analysed, the relationship between carbon-specific photosynthesis and cell size is variable. Moreover, a higher carbon-specific photosynthesis by larger phytoplankton might represent an ecophysiological basis to explain their dominance in resource-rich environments.

AB Protandry refers to the earlier appearance of males before females at sites of reproduction. Sexual selection has been hypothesized to give rise to sex differences in benefits and costs of early arrival, thereby selecting for earlier appearance by the sex subject to more intense sexual selection. If sexual selection is more intense, there is a greater premium on early arrival among individuals of the chosen sex because of direct selection for earlier arrival. This hypothesis leads to the prediction that changes in the costs and benefits of early arrival related to changes in environmental conditions should particularly affect the sex that arrives first and hence the degree of protandry. I tested this hypothesis using the Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica. During 1971-2003, the degree of protandry increased significantly in a Danish population because males advanced arrival date while females did not. This earlier arrival by males compared with females was correlated with a significant increase by over 1.2 standard deviations in the length of the outermost tail feathers of males, a secondary sexual character, suggesting direct selection on both protandry and the secondary sexual character. Environmental conditions during spring migration in Northern Africa, as reflected by the normalized difference vegetation index, have deteriorated since 1984, resulting in increased mortality among males during spring migration, but not among females, and this deterioration of climatic conditions was positively correlated with an increasing degree of protandry. Likewise, an increase in April temperatures at the breeding grounds during recent decades is positively correlated with increased protandry, apparently because males can arrive earlier without increasing the fitness cost of early arrival. Local population size did not predict changes in arrival date. These findings suggest that rapid changes in climate can cause a change in degree of protandry and secondary sexual characters.

AB Ecologists have long sought to understand the relationships among species diversity, community productivity and invasion by non-native species. Here, four long-term observational datasets were analyzed using repeated measures statistics to determine how plant species richness and community resource capture (i.e. productivity) influenced invasion. Multiple factors influenced the results, including the metric used to quantify invasion, interannual variation and spatial scale. Native richness was positively correlated with non-native richness, but was usually negatively correlated with non-native abundance, and these patterns were stronger at the larger spatial scale. Logistic regressions indicated that the probability of invasion was reduced both within and following years with high productivity, except at the desert grassland site where high productivity was associated with increased invasion. Our analysis suggests that while non-natives were most likely to establish in species rich communities, their success was diminished by high resource capture by the resident community.

AB 1. Understanding the ecological effects of processes operating at multiple spatial scales on multiple species is a key challenge in ecology. It underpins both basic research and the increasing recognition of scale-dependence in conservation biology.
   2. Organisms are affected by ecological processes operating at multiple spatial scales. Hence the study of multiple species and spatial scales is a key challenge in ecology.
   3. A spatially nested experimental design was used to investigate the habitat relationships of reptiles in a grazing landscape in southern New South Wales, Australia. Regression modelling was used to relate the presence of species and species richness to habitat variables.
   4. Different species were predicted by different habitat variables, and some species reflected habitat structure at one, but not all, spatial scales. The four-fingered skink Carlia tetradactyla was associated with box woodlands, areas with few rocks and many spiders, and areas with a northerly aspect and high tree cover. Boulenger's skink Morethia boulengeri was more likely to be found in areas with many ants and beetles, and also in areas with a northerly aspect and high tree cover. The striped skink Ctenotus robustus and olive legless lizard Delma inornata were significantly more likely to be detected in areas with a simple microhabitat structure. Species richness was highest in box woodlands (Eucalyptus albens and Eucalyptus melliodora) and at sites characterized by a high variability of habitat structure.
   5. Different habitat variables varied over different spatial scales. For example, invertebrate abundance varied mostly over tens of metres, while grass/forb cover varied mostly over hundreds to thousands of metres.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The multitude of species' responses and spatial habitat variability highlighted the potential limitations of the fragmentation paradigm because it may oversimplify ecological complexity. On this basis, conservation in variegated grazing landscapes may need to consider changes to livestock management across entire landscapes, rather than concentrate solely on the preservation of particular patches.

AB Selection experiments in the wild have greatly aided our understanding of how selection shapes phenotypic diversity in natural populations. However, these experiments have been hindered by the fact that the traits most important to adaptation and speciation may be fixed within populations. Experimental hybridization offers a means to circumvent this problem since crosses can be made between populations or species that differ for the trait of interest. Here, we discuss the advantages and limitations of this approach, review results from published studies, and suggest strategies for future experiments. Advantages associated with this approach include the ability to "generate" variation for traits of interest, as well as the increased sensitivity of selection assays because of the wider range of trait values characteristic of segregating hybrids. Moreover, experimental hybridization can be extended to crosses between near-isogenic lines, allowing the effects of major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) to be dissected in a well-defined genetic background. Limitations include widespread linkage disequilibrium created by hybridization, possible cosegregation of hybrid incompatibilities, and the large number of variable traits likely to affect hybrid fitnesses. Even with these limitations, this basic approach has been remarkably successful. We now know, for example, that many morphological differences between divergent populations or species are under selection and that the selection gradients may be surprisingly large. Also, small genetic changes in premating barriers may have large effects on assortative mating. With respect to discussions about the role of hybridization in evolution, experiments indicate that some hybrid trait combinations may be advantageous, particularly when the hybrid populations are placed in a new environment. Future studies seem likely to combine selection measurements with genetic mapping of the QTLs underlying the selected traits. Natural hybrid zones hold particular promise for these kinds of studies because the only experimental manipulation required is, the removal of small amounts of tissue for genotyping.

AB 1. Hypericum perforatum , St John's wort, is an invasive perennial herb that is especially problematic on waste ground, roadsides, pastures and open woodland in south-eastern Australia. We use detailed data from a long-term observational study to develop quantitative models of the factors affecting growth, survival and fecundity of H. perforatum individuals.
   2. Multi-level or hierarchical mixed-effects statistical models are used to analyse how environmental and intrinsic plant variables affect growth and reproduction within a complex nested spatial and temporal context. These techniques are relatively underused in ecology, despite the prevalence of multi-level and repeated-measures data generated from ecological studies.
   3. We found that plant size (rosette or flowering stems) was strongly correlated with all life stages studied (growth, probability of flowering, asexual reproduction, survival and fruit production). Environmental variables such as herbivory, ground cover and rainfall had significant effects on several life stages.
   4. Significant spatial variation at the quadrat level was found in the probability of flowering, flowering stem growth and fruit production models; variation at all other spatial levels in all models was non-significant. Yearly temporal variation was significant in all models where multi-year data were available.
   5. Plants in shaded habitats were smaller but had higher survival probabilities than plants in open habitats. They are therefore likely to have slightly different population dynamics.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Analysis of these models for H. perforatum has provided insights into which plant traits and environmental factors determine how populations increase and persist in exotic ecosystems, enabling population management strategies to be most effectively targeted. Spatially and temporally correlated data are often collected in long-term ecological studies and multi-level models are a way in which we can fully exploit the wealth of data available. Without these tools data are either underexploited or crucial assumptions of independence on which many statistics are based are contravened.

AB The introduction of species to areas beyond the limits of their natural distributions has a major homogenizing influence, making previously distinct biotas more similar. The scale of introductions has frequently been commented on, but their rate and spatial pervasiveness have been less well quantified. Here, we report the findings of a detailed study of pterygote insect introductions to Gough Island, one of the most remote and supposedly pristine temperate oceanic islands, and estimate the rate at which introduced species have successfully established. Out of 99 species recorded from Gough Island, 71 are established introductions, the highest proportion documented for any Southern Ocean island. Estimating a total of approximately 233 landings on Gough Island since first human landfall, this equates to one successful establishment for every three to four landings. Generalizations drawn from other areas suggest that this may be only one-tenth of the number of pterygote species that have arrived at the island, implying that most landings may lead to the arrival of at least one alien. These rates of introduction of new species are estimated to be two to three orders of magnitude greater than background levels for Gough Island, an increase comparable to that estimated for global species extinctions (many of which occur on islands) as a consequence of human activities.

ID AREA; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; STRATEGIES; GRADIENTS
AB Regularities in species richness are widely observed but controversy continues over its mechanistic explanation. Because richness patterns are usually a compound measure derived from taxonomically diverse species with different ecological requirements, these analyses may confound diverse causes of species numbers. Here we investigate species richness in the aquatic beetle fauna of Europe, separating major taxonomic groups and two major ecological types, species occurring in standing and running water bodies. We collated species distributions for 800 + species of water beetles in 15 regions across western Europe. Species number in any of these regions was related to three variables: total area size, geographic connectedness of the area, and latitude. Pooled species numbers were accurately predicted, but correlations were different for species associated with either running or standing water. The former were mostly correlated with latitude, while the latter were only correlated with the measure of connectedness or with area size. These differences were generally also observed in each of the four phylogenetically independent lineages of aquatic Coleoptera when analysed separately. We propose that effects of habitat, in this case possibly mediated by different long term persistence of running and standing water bodies, impose constraints at the population or local level which, if effective over larger temporal and spatial scales, determine global patterns of species richness.

AB Ecologists have long recognized that factors operating at both local and regional scales influence whether a given species occurs in an ecological community. The relative roles of variables manifested at local and regional scales on community structure, however, remain an unexplored issue for many faunas. To address this question, we compared the community composition and species diversity of forest Lepidoptera between (i) large forest tracts in historically glaciated and unglaciated regions of the eastern deciduous forest in North America, and (ii) large and small forest patches within a highly fragmented forest landscape. Specifically, we used seasonally stratified sampling to test whether regional and local differences in moth communities were related to variation in stand structure and floristic composition. At the local scale, we tested three alternative hypotheses describing the effects of patch size on moth species richness: species impoverishment, species replacement, or species supplementation. Cluster analysis revealed significant compositional differences in moth communities sampled between (i) early and late seasons, (ii) glaciated and unglaciated forest eco-regions, and (iii) large and small forest patches. Canonical correspondence analysis suggested that floristic variation at regional scales had a greater role in determining moth community composition than local vegetation or patch-size effects. Species richness was higher in the glaciated North Central Tillplain, and was attributable to a more diverse herbaceous feeding moth assemblage. Finally, we found evidence that both species impoverishment and species replacement processes structure the moth fauna of small woodlots; the richness of moths with larvae that feed on woody plants decreased with patch area, but herbaceous feeding species increased in diversity in smaller patches. Thus, our results suggest that local and regional differences in moth community structure are mediated by differences in host-plant resources attributable to regional biogeographic history and local differences in patch size. Because community composition appeared to be more sensitive to environmental variation than species richness, we suggest that monitoring lepidopteran species diversity in forests will not detect significant changes in species composition due to environmental change.

AB A well-defined macroecological pattern is the decline in biodiversity with altitude. However, this decline is taxa-specific. For example, amphibians are more diverse than squamates at extreme elevations in the tropical Andes, but this pattern is reversed at extreme elevations in the southern latitudes. Several ecophysiological and evolutionary factors may be related to this difference. At high-elevations in southern latitudes temperature differs dramatically among seasons and dry soils dominate, characteristics that appear to favor lizard physiological ecology. Tropical high altitudes, in contrast, are humid and offer abundant and diverse water resources. These characteristics allow for a richer anuran community but might complicate lizard egg development through temperature and oxygen constrains. Differences in strategies of thermal adaptation might also modulate diversity patterns. The thermal physiology of anurans is extremely labile so that behavioral and physiological performance is maintained despite an altitudinal decrease in field body temperature. Lizards, in contrast, exhibit a conservative thermal physiology and rely on behavioral thermoregulation to face cold and variable temperatures. Both, lizard behavioral strategies and anuran physiological adjustments seem equally efficient in allowing ecological success and diversification for both groups in the tropics up to approximately 3000 in. At higher elevations physiological thermal adaptation is required, and lizards are ecologically constrained, perhaps at various ontogenetic stages. Patterns of biodiversity along environmental clines can be better understood through a physiological approach, and can help to refine and propose hypotheses in evolutionary physiology.

AB Reedbeds have high conservation value in Europe. In southern France, they are the major breeding habitat of five passerine species. Yet, habitat management is done primarily by water control to serve socio-economic rather than conservation interests, because we lack information on the species' ecological requirements. Determinants of passerine abundance were assessed through a comparative analysis of water regime, plant structure, and arthropod (food) distribution at 12 sites consisting of at least 10 ha of marsh densely covered with common reed (Phragmites australis). Overall bird abundance estimated through standardised mist netting was positively correlated with food availability (sweep-netted arthropods weighted by their occurrence in birds' diet), which was in turn negatively correlated with duration of ground dryness between June and December. Abundance of four of the five bird species was associated with specific vegetation parameters (reed diameter, dry reed density, growing reed height, etc.), which could be associated with particular management practices, especially with regard to water levels and salinity. Potential impact of socioeconomic activities through their water management is addressed, as well as possible ways to minimise these impacts. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages, water chemistry variables and environmental degradation were investigated in an Atlantic Forest region in Brazil. Seven sites of the Guapimirim river basin were studied during three sampling periods based on the rain regime: end of wet season ( May 1998), dry season ( August 1998), and wet season ( January 1999). Four substrates were collected at each site: sand, stony substrates, litter in pool areas and litter in riffle areas. Relationships between macroinvertebrate assemblages, water chemistry variables and environmental degradation were examined using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). According to CCA, concentrations of dissolved oxygen and chloride, and the environmental degradation, measured by the Riparian Channel Environment index, exhibited the strongest relationship to macroinvertebrate assemblages. Overall, the loss of community diversity measured by the Shannon Index along the degradation gradient was observed. Some taxa were shown to be sensitive to water pollution, especially among Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Coleoptera and some Ephemeroptera, while others such as Simuliidae, Odonata and molluscs were tolerant to moderate levels of pollutants. The Chironomidae were the only group tolerant to a high level of pollutants and degradation.

AB Of all non-arable habitats, field margins are the most important ones for bumblebees in agricultural environment, especially as they are wide-spread and offer food resources, but they are also places for reproduction and overwintering. This study was made to investigate bumblebee abundance in the agricultural environment and to obtain information on the use of southern Finnish field margins by bumblebees. Bumblebees and cuckoo bumblebees were studied in a farmland area in Lammi, southern Finland, in 1996. Line-transect counts in field margins were made to compare habitat availability of patches of farmland and qualities of field margins within the patches. Landscape variables, dicotyledonous flower abundances and ecological and morphological characteristics of flowers were used as factors to explain variation in bumblebee assemblages and their frequencies of visits to the field margins. Bumblebee species richness and total density were higher in patches of farmland where field margins had more dicotyledonous flowers rather than being grassy. Abundance and flowering phenology of a limited number of flower species during the bumblebee breeding season were the most important factors explaining bumblebee visits in field margins. The most important flower species was zigzag clover (Trifolium medium). The width of field margins was significantly related to the total density of bumblebees and cuckoo bumblebees, but not species number or diversity. (C). 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB I have tried to summarize some lines of research on collembolan ecology from the last part of the 20th century which I think have general interest and I have given a few examples of the kind of research which in my opinion are promising to follow up in the coming years. This is not to claim that these themes are the only ones worth mentioning or even the most important. I have for instance not elaborated on the development of theoretical models in mutual interaction with advanced mathematics or on simulation modelling which takes advantage of the still accelerating power of computer techniques. These areas will without doubt be developed much further in the present century. However, it should not be forgotten that useful models depend entirely on good experimental - and field data, both as generators of new hypotheses and as representation of the real world against which the theories and models should be tested.

AB In pied flycatchers females seem to prefer male territory quality rather than male characteristics, and the results of female mate choice experiments are divergent. In this outdoor aviary study, we examined how altering the ultraviolet reflection of males affects female mate choice behaviour. We chose pairs of males with similar human-visible dorsal colour and morphological traits. We then reduced the proportional ultraviolet reflectance in one male with sunscreen chemicals. The other male was treated with a chemical that slightly increased the ultraviolet reflectance of the plumage. In the experiment females clearly preferred males with slightly increased ultraviolet reflection. Our results indicate that pied flycatcher females use ultraviolet cues for mate choice when the effect of territory quality is controlled for. The results give us new information about a possible mechanism of mate assessment in this species, and indicate the importance of colour cues in avian mate choice behaviour.

AB Multivariate analyses and correlations revealed strong relations between watershed and riparian-corridor land cover, and reach-scale habitat versus fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages in 38 warmwater streams in eastern Wisconsin. Watersheds were dominated by agricultural use, and ranged in size from 9 to 71 km(2). Watershed land cover was summarized from satellite-derived data for the area outside a 30-m buffer. Riparian land cover was interpreted from digital orthophotos within 10-, 10- to 20-, and 20- to 30-m buffers. Reach-scale habitat, fish, and macroinvertebrates were collected in 1998 and biotic indices calculated. Correlations between land cover, habitat, and stream-quality indicators revealed significant relations at the watershed, riparian-corridor, and reach scales. At the watershed scale, fish diversity, intolerant fish and EPT species increased, and Hilsenhoff biotic index (HBI) decreased as percent forest increased. At the riparian-corridor scale, EPT species decreased and HBI increased as riparian vegetation became more fragmented. For the reach, EPT species decreased with embeddedness. Multivariate analyses further indicated that riparian (percent agriculture, grassland, urban and forest, and fragmentation of vegetation), watershed (percent forest) and reach-scale characteristics (embeddedness) were the most important variables influencing fish (IBI, density, diversity, number, and percent tolerant and insectivorous species) and macroinvertebrate (HBI and EPT) communities.

AB Although it is widely recognised that spatial subdivision of populations is common in nature, there is no consensus as to how metapopulation dynamics affect genetic diversity. We investigated the genetic differentiation of natterjack toads, Bufo calamita, in three regions of Britain where habitat continuity indicated the likely occurrence of extensive metapopulations. Our intention was to determine whether genetic analysis supported the existence of metapopulation structures, if so of what type, and to identify barriers to migration between subpopulations. Allele frequencies were determined across eight polymorphic microsatellite loci for a total of 24 toad subpopulations at three separate sites. Genetic differentiation was assessed using five measures of genetic distance, notably F-ST, R-ST, Nei's standard distance D-s, delta mu(2) and the Cavalli-Sforza chord distance D-c. B. calamita exhibited small but significant levels of genetic differentiation between subpopulations in all three study areas, and genetic and geographic distance correlations indicated isolation-by-distance effects in all three cases. The effects on correlation strengths of compensation for positive (sea, rivers, urban development) and negative (pond clusters) barriers to toad migration between the subpopulations in each area were also determined. D-c, a measure which assumes that differentiation is caused by drift with negligible mutation effect, yielded the most plausible interpretation of metapopulation structures. Overall the patterns of genetic variation suggested the existence of a mixed metapopulation model for this species, with high levels of gene flow compatible with one version of the classical model but often supported by particularly stable subpopulations as in the mainland-island model.

AB End-member modelling is applied to a data set of relative abundances of 67 Upper Miocene rodent associations (11-6 Ma) from Spain, France, Austria and Greece. The analysis results in the robust estimation of relative levels of four climatic parameters: humidity, temperature, seasonality type and predictability. in the preparatory stage, species are aggregated into nine groups on the basis of ecological criteria. Humidity preferences and adaptations are based on actualistic and functional morphological interpretations of dentition and locomotion. Temperature preferences are inferred from palaeobiogeographic distributions. Levels of adaptation to seasonality type (wet-dry or cool-warm seasonality) are assigned on the basis of diversities in present-day climate/vegetation zones, and the ability of extant relatives to hibernate. Demographic data are used to formulate adaptations to climatic (un)predictability. In the modelling stage, the compositions are unmixed into the contributions of four end members. These four extreme, theoretical rodent compositions are interpreted in climatic terms, and their contributions to the samples are used for the estimation of climatic parameters. The subset of 44 well-dated rodent compositions from the Calatayud-Daroca and Teruel basins (NE Spain) is used to construct detailed climatic curves for the Late Miocene, while the geographical dimension in the data set is used to calculate inter-basinal differences. The model results for Spain indicate more humid and cooler conditions between 10.5 and 8.5 Ma, around 7, and around 6 Ma, and more arid and warmer conditions before 10.5, between 8.6 and 7.5 Ma and around 6.5 Ma. Superimposed on this pattern is a shift from a more predictable, cool-warm seasonal climate towards a more unpredictable, wet-dry seasonal climate between 9.4 and 8.2 Ma. Inter-basinal comparisons per time slice show that the climate in southern Europe was dryer, wanner, more wet-dry seasonal and more unpredictable than in central Europe, and that the climatic and vegetational boundaries between the two regions were sharp. The occurrences of more humid and cooler episodes in Spain during the Late Miocene might be explained by southward migrations of the boundary between a temperate and subtropical-dry climatic belt and their associated vegetation types. Various positive correlations are observed between the rodent-based climatic curves for Spain, and other palaeoclimatic records from the Mediterranean and NE Atlantic region (clay minerals, marine fauna, stable isotopes). The two cooling maxima at 9.4 and 7 Ma closely correspond to clusters of marine events which are generally considered to reflect maxima of global ice volume. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The characteristics of microhabitats of established Pinus sylvestris and Betula seedlings were studied in a small windthrow gap in a mature P. sylvestris-dominated forest in the Petkeljarvi National Park in eastern Finland. Seedlings were strongly clustered in disturbed microhabitats, particularly uprooting pits and mounds, formed by tree falls. They covered 3 % of the 0.3.ha study area consisting of the gap and some of the forest edge. Although Betula occurred only as scattered individuals in the dominant canopy layer of the forest, it accounted for 30 % of the seedlings found in the study area. Betula regeneration was almost completely restricted to pits and mounds, where 91 % of the seedlings were found. Uprooting spots were also the most important regeneration microhabitats for Pinus, where 60 % of the seedlings grew, even though the seedlings were found in other substrates as well, particularly on sufficiently decomposed coarse wood. Undisturbed field- and bottom-layer vegetation had effectively hindered tree seedling establishment, which emphasises the role of soil disturbance for regeneration. While the establishment of seedlings was found to be clearly determined by the availability of favourable regeneration microhabitats, the early growth of seedlings was affected by a complex interaction of environmental variables, including the type of microhabitat, radiation environment and interferences caused by competing seedlings and adjacent trees. In the most important regeneration microhabitats, i.e. in uprooting pits and on mounds, the distributions of the local elevations of Pinus and Betula seedlings were different. Pinus seedlings occurred closer to ground level, i.e. on the fringes of pits and lower on mounds, while Betula seedlings grew deeper in pits and higher on mounds. The position of the Betula seedlings indicate hat they may have a competitive advantage over Pinus seedlings in the dense seedling groups occurring in uprooting spots. We suggest that this initial difference in Pinus and Betula establishment may affect the subsequent within-gap tree species succession and can, in part, explain the general occurrence of Betula in conifer-dominated boreal forests.

AB Although benthic stream macroinvertebrates have been widely used in biomonitoring, further developments towards more general biomonitoring tools are timely. Therefore, we compared traditional ways of biomonitoring such as diversity, biotic indices and community structure with a new approach using biological traits such as reproduction, life duration, and feeding habits. These approaches were applied to a typical biomonitoring scenario, i.e. for two sites being upstream and downstream of the effluent from a waste water treatment plant. Physico-chemical variables did not discriminate between upstream and downstream site. Among eight tested biological indices, only Margalef's and Shannon's index and the French Biotic Index "indice biologique global normalise" (IBGN) significantly separated the upstream from the downstream site. However, biomonitoring through these three indices depended significantly on the sampling effort, which was not the case for the community structure or biological traits. Community structure in terms of taxa abundances separated the upstream from the downstream site (17.9% of discrimination). Biological traits weighted by taxa abundances better separated the upstream from the downstream site (23.1% of discrimination). The biological traits showed that the functional structure at the upstream site was characteristic for organisms using the strategy of resilience in more variable but less adverse environments. In contrast, the functional structure observed at the downstream site was characteristic for organisms using the strategy of resistance in less variable but more adverse environments. Thus, the functional approach to indicate pollution effects in streams through biological traits may provide a tool for future stream management which is robust, general and based on current concepts of ecological theory.

AB The North American mid-continent population of lesser snow geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) breeds in coastal areas of the Hudson Bay region. Breeding success is highly variable, particularly during recent decades. The availability of long-term data sets of weather and the breeding success of geese allowed us to determine whether climatic variables in spring and early summer (May-June) are reliable predictors of different attributes of the reproductive biology of snow geese. A large region of strong anomalous cooling in north-eastern North America has been the dominant anomalous climatic feature since the mid-1970s. The cooling which becomes established during winter persists into spring and early summer when migration, nesting and hatching of geese are occurring. Redundancy analysis (RDA) of the data sets was made to identify dominant correlations and regression relationships between climatic and goose variables. Individual goose response variables were further explored with stepwise multiple regression and bipartial regression.
   96.7% of year-to-year variance in the goose data was explained by the selected climatic data. The first four orthogonal axes out of seven possible axes explained 92.2% of the total variance. Date of last snow on the ground and mean daily temperature from 6 to 20 May formed the lowest and highest predictor scores, respectively. Initiation date and hatching date at the low end and total clutch size and clutch size at hatch at the high end were associated with these extremes, particularly in certain years. Days of freezing rain in May and total rainfall were correlated with nest failure. Bivariate correlation! regression showed that the most parsimonious model for nest initiation day was based on four climatic predictors, for hatching day four predictors, and for clutch size at hatch, nine predictors.
   Both the multiple regression analyses and the redundancy analyses confirm the high degree of predictability of goose reproductive variables from selected climatic variables. As discussed, the correlations reflect both direct and indirect effects of climate on the reproductive biology of geese. The correlations are strongest in the early season and weaken by early summer.

AB The relationship between the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and leaf area index (LAI) was modelled for mangroves growing on the Caicos Bank, Turks and Caicos Islands. NDVI values were used to predict LAI with this model and a thematic map of LAI produced from satellite data for the whole Bank. Mangrove LAI ranged between 0.8 and 7.0, with a mean of 3.96, LAI data, estimated from in situ measurements of canopy transmittance for a set of sites independent of those used to derive the LAI/NDVI model, were used to test the accuracy of this image. Accuracy was defined as the proportion of accuracy sites at which the LAI value (as estimated from field measurements) lay within the 95% confidence interval for the predicted value of LAI. The accuracy of this map was high (88%) and the mean difference between predicted and measured LAI was low (13%). Remote sensing is thus demonstrated as a powerful tool for estimating the spatial distribution of LAI for whole mangrove ecosystems. This information can be obtained rapidly compared to alternative methods of measuring LAI and can minimise the logistical and practical difficulties of fieldwork in inaccessible mangrove areas.

AB To examine functional questions of arboreal locomotor ecology, the selection of canopy elements by Bornean agile gibbons (Hylobates agilis) and long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) was contrasted, and related to locomotor behaviors. The two species, and in some cases, the macaque sexes, varied in their use of most structural elements. Although both species traveled most frequently in the main canopy layer (macaques: 56%, gibbons: 48%), the gibbons strongly preferred the emergent canopy layer and traveled higher than the macaques (31 vs. 23 m above ground) in larger trees (48 vs. 26 cm dbh). Macaques preferred to cross narrower gaps (50% were in the class 0.1-0.5 m wide) than gibbons (42% were 1.6-3.0 m wide), consistent with the maximum gap width each crossed (3.5 m for macaques, 9 m for gibbons). Macaques could cross only 12% of the gaps encountered in the main canopy, and < 5% of the gaps in each of the other four layers. In contrast, all layers appear relatively continuous for gibbons. Specialized locomotor modes were used disproportionately at the beginning and end of travel segments, further indicating that behavior was organized around gap crossings. A model is defined, the Perceived Continuity Index (PCI), which predicts the relative use of canopy strata for each species, based on the percentage of gaps a species can cross, the frequency of gaps, and median length of continuous canopy structure in each canopy layer. The results support the hypothesis that locomotor behaviors, and strategies of selecting canopy strata for travel, are strongly constrained by wide gaps between trees and are ultimately based on selection for efficient direct line travel between distant points.

AB Forests dominated by Pinus elliottii var densa have undergone a reduction in area in the Florida Keys (USA). A previous investigation interpreted the presence of halophytic species in a former pine forest in Key Large as evidence of sea-level rise. We therefore examined aerial photos and field evidence to learn how the 15-cm rise in local sea level over the last 70 yr had affected the distribution of pines on a second island, where intact pine forests still remained in 1991. The distribution of in situ dead pine stems showed that the area occupied by pines on Sugarloaf Key was 88 ha at some time prior to the earliest available aerial photographs, in 1935. The area of pine forest was reduced to 46 ha by 1935, and continued to decrease through 1991, when it covered 30 ha. The pattern of pine mortality was related to topographic position, with the areas where pines died earliest occupying the lowest elevations. Our analysis of current vegetation patterns showed that the areas of earliest pine mortality are now populated by a higher proportion of halophytic plant assemblages than areas of more recent pine mortality. We also compared the physiological responses of pines in two portions of the island: one where pine forest reduction had been most pronounced, and a second where the extent of the forest had changed little over the past 50 yr. Both groundwater and soil water salinity were higher in the area of rapid pine forest reduction, and the pines sampled there exhibited higher physiological stress, as indicated by pre-dawn water potential and stemwood carbon isotope ratios. These results suggest that the salinization of ground- and soil water that occurs as sea level rises is a major factor in the reduction of pine forests of Sugarloaf Key. If sea level continues to increase, the Florida Keys will experience a decline in both landscape and species diversity, as species-rich upland communities are replaced by simpler mangrove communities. This pattern may also occur in other low-lying island ecosystems with limited freshwater resources.

AB With a view to the possible use of transposable elements (TEs) as a mechanism to drive genes into insect vector populations, we used a three-parameter density dependent growth equation to examine the critical parameter values that determine whether or not a mobile element will spread and become fixed in a finite diploid vector population. Populations were simulated with parameter values affecting size, reproductive rate, density-dependence, and transposition efficiency of the mobile element. Simulations indicated that an equilibrium was reached quickly, typically in <50 generations. Even when initially present at less-than-or-equal-to 1% of a large population, the mobile element spread quickly and became fixed if transposition efficiency was equal to unity and infertility caused by the element decreased reproductive capacity by as much as 45%. These results were insensitive to the values of basic wild type reproductive rates and density dependence, but population size, transposition efficiency of the element, reproductive mte individuals bearing TEs and initial ratio of TE-bearing to wild individuals modified the outcome. As population size and transposition efficiency decreased in value, TEs became fixed less easily. However, even in populations as small as n = 100, an element with a transposition efficiency >0.75 that reduces fertility <25% will become fixed when introduced at a frequency as low as 1% of the total population. These results are consistent with previously reported population genetics models. They suggest that engineered transposons with a wide range of properties may be used to drive genes, such as those for parasite resistance, into wild vector populations.

AB The plankton biomass size distribution and its seasonal changes were used to estimate seasonal fluctuations of the metabolic activity of the community and of the efficiency to transfer biomass to larger sized organisms in a large and deep prealpine lake (Bodensee: Lake Constance). The efficiency of transfer of biomass from small (e.g. autotrophic) to larger (e.g. herbivorous) organisms increased considerably during the first half of the year and reached maximum values when daphnid densities were high. This trend was attributed to the different generation times of the organisms involved in the food web. The trophic transfer efficiency may depend on the predator-prey weight ratios, and the efficiency of growth and exploitation of the constituent organisms. The contribution of these factors to the overall change of the transfer efficiency was estimated from additional information on the food-web structure. The results derived from the size spectra agreed reasonably well with previous studies of single populations, suggesting that biomass size distributions may substantially contribute to ecosystem analysis. The seasonal trend in slopes of the size spectrum was related to predictions derived from conceptual models. Empirical results from Lake Constance could be reconciled with those models accounting for seasonal changes of exploitation efficiency. Inference from the size spectra supported the hypothesis that natural assemblages of pelagic bacteria are unlikely to attain the potential productivity implied by allometric relationships.

AB A methodology for simulating the three-dimensional radiation regime in laterally heterogeneous vegetation canopies is presented.  The method is based on the radiative transfer equation which is a formal statement of radiative energy balance in the configuration space.  The transfer equation can be parameterized with models of the leaf area density function, the probability density of leaf normal orientation and the leaf scattering phase function.  The transfer equation is numerically solved by the discrete ordinates method - by discretizing the angular variable into a finite number of directions and by introducing finite difference schemes for the spatial derivatives.  The method was validated with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) collected in a poplar stand.  A formalism for coupling the predictions of the radiation model with the leaf photosynthetic response function is also presented.  The utility of the coupled radiation/photosynthesis model is shown through an investigation of the optimal tree density problem for a given set of canopy architecture data.

AB This paper organizes and synthesizes different extant research streams through a systematic literature review to identify connections and major assumptions on the influence of stakeholders in major Public Infrastructure and Construction projects (PIC), at the local community level. Findings suggest that research on stakeholder management has focused strongly on those stakeholders able to control project resources, whilst the effect on the legitimate 'secondary stakeholders', such as the local community, remains widely unexplored. Due to the unavoidable impact of major PIC on both people and places, it is suggested that seeking local community opinions in the initiation phase of the project and monitoring the megaproject impact at the local level can help to improve project performance. The output provides scholars and practitioners with future research directions and practical implications for an inclusive stakeholder management approach in construction megaprojects.

AB Aichi Target 11 (AT11), adopted by 193 Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 2010, states that protected areas (PAs) must be equitably managed by 2020. However, significant challenges remain in terms of actual implementation of equitable management in PAs. These challenges include, among others, the lack of a standardized approach to assess and monitor social equity and the difficulty of reducing social equity to a series of metrics. This perspective addresses these challenges and it proposes a minimum set of ten indicators for assessing and monitoring the three dimensions of social equity in protected areas: recognition, procedure and distribution. The indicators target information on social equity regarding cultural identity, statutory and customary rights, knowledge diversity; free, prior and informed consent mechanisms, full participation and transparency in decision-making, access to justice, accountability over decisions, distribution of conservation burdens, and sharing of conservation benefits. The proposed indicator system is a first step in advancing an approach to facilitate our understanding of how the different dimensions of social equity are denied or recognized in PAs globally. The proposed system would be used by practitioners to mainstream social equity indicators in PM assessments at the site level and to report to the CBD on the 'equitably managed' element of AT11.

AB Even during the current biodiversity crisis, reports on population collapses of highly abundant, non-harvested marine species were rare until very recently. This is starting to change, especially at the warm edge of species' distributions where populations are more vulnerable to stress. The Levant basin is the southeastern edge of distribution of most Mediterranean species. Coastal water conditions are naturally extreme, and are fast warming, making it a potential hotspot for species collapses. Using multiple data sources, I found strong evidence for major, sustained, population collapses of two urchins, one large predatory gastropod and a reef-building gastropod. Furthermore, of 59 molluscan species once-described in the taxonomic literature as common on Levant reefs, 38 were not found in the present-day surveys, and there was a total domination of non-indigenous species in molluscan assemblages. Temperature trends indicate an exceptional warming of the coastal waters in the past three decades. Though speculative at this stage, the fast rise in SST may have helped pushing these invertebrates beyond their physiological tolerance limits leading to population collapses and possible extirpations. If so, these collapses may indicate the initiation of a multi-species range contraction at the Mediterranean southeastern edge that may spread westward with additional warming.

AB Monetary valuation quantifies exchange values, but broader approaches are needed to understand the meaning of those monetary values and the shared, plural and cultural values that underpin them. In this study, we integrated deliberative monetary valuation, storytelling, subjective well-being and psychometric approaches to comprehensively elicit cultural ecosystem service values for proposed UK marine protected areas. We elicit and compare five valuation stages: individual values from an online survey; individual and group values following deliberation on information in workshops; and individual and group values following storytelling and a 'transcendental values compass' deliberation. Deliberated group values significantly differed from non-deliberated individual values, with reduced willingness to pay and increased convergence with subjective wellbeing; deliberated individual values fell between the two. Storytelling played an important role in revealing values that were previously implicit. Participants were more confident about values elicited in the workshops than the online survey and felt that deliberated values should be used in decision-making. The results of this study (albeit with a limited sample size) suggest that shared values may be a better reflection of welfare implications than non-deliberated individual values, while at the same time more reflective of participants' transcendental values: their broader life goals and principles.

AB Injury and death from wildlife attacks often result in people feeling violent resentment and hostility against the wildlife involved and, therefore, may undermine public support for conservation. Although Nepal, with rich biodiversity, is doing well in its conservation efforts, human-wildlife conflicts have been a major challenge in recent years. The lack of detailed information on the spatial and temporal patterns of human-wildlife conflicts at the national level impedes the development of effective conflict mitigation plans. We examined patterns of human injury and death caused by large mammals using data from attack events and their spatiotemporal dimensions collected from a national survey of data available in Nepal over five years (2010-2014). Data were analyzed using logistic regression and chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. The results show that Asiatic elephants and common leopards are most commonly involved in attacks on people in terms of attack frequency and fatalities. Although one-horned rhinoceros and bears had a higher frequency of attacks than Bengal tigers, tigers caused more fatalities than each of these two species. Attacks by elephants peaked in winter and most frequently occurred outside protected areas in human settlements. Leopard attacks occurred almost entirely outside protected areas, and a significantly greater number of attacks occurred in human settlements. Attacks by one-horned rhinoceros and tigers were higher in the winter, mainly in forests inside protected areas; similarly, attacks by bears occurred mostly within protected areas. We found that human settlements are increasingly becoming conflict hotspots, with burgeoning incidents involving elephants and leopards. We conclude that species-specific conservation strategies are urgently needed, particularly for leopards and elephants. The implications of our findings for minimizing conflicts and conserving these imperiled species are discussed.

AB Humans are altering the distribution of species by changing the climate and disrupting biotic interactions and dispersal. A fundamental hypothesis in spatial ecology suggests that these effects are scale dependent; biotic interactions should shape distributions at local scales, whereas climate should dominate at regional scales. If so, common single-scale analyses might misestimate the impacts of anthropogenic modifications on biodiversity and the environment. However, large-scale datasets necessary to test these hypotheses have not been available until recently. Here we conduct a cross-continental, cross-scale (almost five orders of magnitude) analysis of the influence of biotic and abiotic processes and human population density on the distribution of three emerging pathogens: the amphibian chytrid fungus implicated in worldwide amphibian declines and West Nile virus and the bacterium that causes Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi), which are responsible for ongoing human health crises. In all three systems, we show that biotic factors were significant predictors of pathogen distributions in multiple regression models only at local scales (similar to 10(2)-10(3) km(2)), whereas climate and human population density always were significant only at relatively larger, regional scales (usually > 10(4) km(2)). Spatial autocorrelation analyses revealed that biotic factors were more variable at smaller scales, whereas climatic factors were more variable at larger scales, as is consistent with the prediction that factors should be important at the scales at which they vary the most. Finally, no single scale could detect the importance of all three categories of processes. These results highlight that common single-scale analyses can misrepresent the true impact of anthropogenic modifications on biodiversity and the environment.

AB AimSpecies distribution modelling typically relies completely or partially on climatic variables as predictors, overlooking the fact that these are themselves predictions with associated uncertainties. This is particularly critical when such predictors are interpolated between sparse station data, such as in the tropics. The goal of this study is to provide a new set of satellite-based climatic predictor data and to evaluate its potential to improve modelled species-climate associations and transferability to novel geographical regions.
   LocationRain forests areas of Central Africa, the Western Ghats of India and South America.
   MethodsWe compared models calibrated on the widely used WorldClim station-interpolated climatic data with models where either temperature or precipitation data from WorldClim were replaced by data from CRU, MODIS, TRMM and CHIRPS. Each predictor set was used to model 451 plant species distributions. To test for chance associations, we devised a null model with which to compare the accuracy metric obtained for every species.
   ResultsFewer than half of the studied rain forest species distributions matched the climatic pattern better than did random distributions. The inclusion of MODIS temperature and CHIRPS precipitation estimates derived from remote sensing each allowed for a better than random fit for respectively 40% and 22% more species than models calibrated on WorldClim. Furthermore, their inclusion was positively related to a better transferability of models to novel regions.
   Main conclusionsWe provide a newly assembled dataset of ecologically meaningful variables derived from MODIS and CHIRPS for download, and provide a basis for choosing among the plethora of available climate datasets. We emphasize the need to consider the method used in the production of climate data when working on a region with sparse meteorological station data. In this context, remote sensing data should be the preferred choice, particularly when model transferability to novel climates or inferences on causality are invoked.

AB The success of a biological invasion is context dependent, and yet two key concepts-the invasiveness of species and the invasibility of recipient ecosystems-are often defined and considered separately. We propose a framework that can elucidate the complex relationship between invasibility and invasiveness. It is based on trait-mediated interactions between species and depicts the response of an ecological network to the intrusion of an alien species, drawing on the concept of community saturation. Here, invasiveness of an introduced species with a particular trait is measured by its per capita population growth rate when the initial propagule pressure of the introduced species is very low. The invasibility of the recipient habitat or ecosystem is dependent on the structure of the resident ecological network and is defined as the total width of an opportunity niche in the trait space susceptible to invasion. Invasibility is thus a measure of network instability. We also correlate invasibility with the asymptotic stability of resident ecological network, measured by the leading eigenvalue of the interaction matrix that depicts trait-based interaction intensity multiplied by encounter rate (a pairwise product of propagule pressure of all members in a community). We further examine the relationship between invasibility and network architecture, including network connectance, nestedness and modularity. We exemplify this framework with a trait-based assembly model under perturbations in ways to emulate fluctuating resources and random trait composition in ecological networks. The maximum invasiveness of a potential invader (greatest intrinsic population growth rate) was found to be positively correlated with invasibility of the recipient ecological network. Additionally, ecosystems with high network modularity and high ecological stability tend to exhibit high invasibility. Where quantitative data are lacking we propose using a qualitative interaction matrix of the ecological network perceived by a potential invader so that the structural network stability and invasibility can be estimated from the literature or from expert opinion. This approach links network structure, invasiveness and invasibility in the context of trait-mediated interactions, such as the invasion of insects into mutualistic and antagonistic networks.

AB Wild bees provide a free and potentially diverse ecosystem service to farmers growing pollination-dependent crops. While many crops benefit from insect pollination, soft fruit crops, including strawberries are highly dependent on this ecosystem service to produce viable fruit. However, as a result of intensive farming practices and declining pollinator populations, farmers are increasingly turning to commercially reared bees to ensure that crops are adequately pollinated throughout the season. Wildflower strips are a commonly used measure aimed at the conservation of wild pollinators. It has been suggested that commercial crops may also benefit from the presence of noncrop flowers; however, the efficacy and economic benefits of sowing flower strips for crops remain relatively unstudied. In a study system that utilizes both wild and commercial pollinators, we test whether wildflower strips increase the number of visits to adjacent commercial strawberry crops by pollinating insects. We quantified this by experimentally sowing wildflower strips approximately 20 meters away from the crop and recording the number of pollinator visits to crops with, and without, flower strips. Between June and August 2013, we walked 292 crop transects at six farms in Scotland, recording a total of 2826 pollinators. On average, the frequency of pollinator visits was 25% higher for crops with adjacent flower strips compared to those without, with a combination of wild and commercial bumblebees (Bombus spp.) accounting for 67% of all pollinators observed. This effect was independent of other confounding effects, such as the number of flowers on the crop, date, and temperature. Synthesis and applications. This study provides evidence that soft fruit farmers can increase the number of pollinators that visit their crops by sowing inexpensive flower seed mixes nearby. By investing in this management option, farmers have the potential to increase and sustain pollinator populations over time.

AB Micro-organisms associated with plants and animals affect host fitness, shape community structure and influence ecosystem properties. Climate change is expected to influence microbial communities, but their reactions are not well understood. Host-associated micro-organisms are influenced by the climate reactions of their hosts, which may undergo range shifts due to climatic niche tracking, or may be actively relocated to mitigate the effects of climate change. We used a common-garden experiment and rDNA metabarcoding to examine the effect of host relocation and high-latitude warming on the complex fungal endophytic microbiome associated with leaves of an ecologically dominant boreal forest tree (Populus balsamifera L.). We also considered the potential effects of poplar genetic identity in defining the reactions of the microbiome to the treatments. The relocation of hosts to the north increased the diversity of the microbiome and influenced its structure, with results indicating enemy release from plausible pathogens. High-latitude warming decreased microbiome diversity in comparison with natural northern conditions. The warming also caused structural changes, which made the fungal communities distinct in comparison with both low-latitude and high-latitude natural communities, and increased the abundance of plausible pathogens. The reactions of the microbiome to relocation and warming were strongly dependent on host genetic identity. This suggests that climate change effects on host-microbiome systems may be mediated by the interaction of environmental factors and the population genetic processes of the hosts.

AB In recent years, populations of honey bees and other pollinators have been reported to be in decline worldwide. A number of stressors have been identified as potential contributing factors, including the extensive prophylactic use of neonicotinoid insecticides, which are highly toxic to bees, in agriculture. While multiple routes of exposure to these systemic insecticides have been documented for honey bees, contamination from puddle water has not been investigated. In this study, we used a multi-residue method based on LC-MS/MS to analyze samples of puddle water taken in the field during the planting of treated corn and one month later. If honey bees were to collect and drink water from these puddles, our results showed that they would be exposed to various agricultural pesticides. All water samples collected from corn fields were contaminated with at least one neonicotinoid compound, although most contained more than one systemic insecticide. Concentrations of neonicotinoids were higher in early spring, indicating that emission and drifting of contaminated dust during sowing raises contamination levels of puddles. Although the overall average acute risk of drinking water from puddles was relatively low, concentrations of neonicotinoids ranged from 0.01 to 63 mg/L and were sufficient to potentially elicit a wide array of sublethal effects in individuals and colony alike. Our results also suggest that risk assessment of honey bee water resources underestimates the foragers' exposure and consequently miscalculates the risk. In fact, our data shows that honey bees and native pollinators are facing unprecedented cumulative exposure to these insecticides from combined residues in pollen, nectar and water. These findings not only document the impact of this route of exposure for honey bees, they also have implications for the cultivation of a wide variety of crops for which the extensive use of neonicotinoids is currently promoted.

AB Uncertainty of cost items is an important aspect of complex projects. Cost uncertainty analysis aims to help decision makers to understand and model different factors affecting funding exposure and ultimately estimate the cost of project. The common practice in cost uncertainty analysis includes breaking the project into cost items and probabilistically capturing the uncertainty of each item. Dependencies between these items are important and if not considered properly may influence the accuracy of cost estimation. However these dependencies are seldom examined and there are theoretical and practical obstacles in modeling them.
   This paper proposes a quantitative assessment framework integrating the inference process of Bayesian networks (BN) to the traditional probabilistic risk analysis. BNs provide a framework for presenting causal relationships and enable probabilistic inference among a set of variables. The new approach explicitly quantifies uncertainty in project cost and also provides an appropriate method for modeling complex relationships in a project, such as common causal factors, formal use of experts' judgments, and learning from data to update previous beliefs and probabilities. The capabilities of the proposed approach are explained by a simple example. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

TI Role of centrality for the identification of influential spreaders in
   complex networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID SCALE-FREE; PHYSICS
AB The identification of the most influential spreaders in networks is important to control and understand the spreading capabilities of the system as well as to ensure an efficient information diffusion such as in rumorlike dynamics. Recent works have suggested that the identification of influential spreaders is not independent of the dynamics being studied. For instance, the key disease spreaders might not necessarily be so important when it comes to analyzing social contagion or rumor propagation. Additionally, it has been shown that different metrics (degree, coreness, etc.) might identify different influential nodes even for the same dynamical processes with diverse degrees of accuracy. In this paper, we investigate how nine centrality measures correlate with the disease and rumor spreading capabilities of the nodes in different synthetic and real-world (both spatial and nonspatial) networks. We also propose a generalization of the random walk accessibility as a new centrality measure and derive analytical expressions for the latter measure for simple network configurations. Our results show that for nonspatial networks, the k-core and degree centralities are the most correlated to epidemic spreading, whereas the average neighborhood degree, the closeness centrality, and accessibility are the most related to rumor dynamics. On the contrary, for spatial networks, the accessibility measure outperforms the rest of the centrality metrics in almost all cases regardless of the kind of dynamics considered. Therefore, an important consequence of our analysis is that previous studies performed in synthetic random networks cannot be generalized to the case of spatial networks.

   responses to habitat loss and fragmentation

AB Theoretical models predict strong influences of habitat loss and fragmentation on species distributions and demography, but empirical studies have shown relatively inconsistent support across species and systems. We argue that species' responses to landscape-scale habitat loss and fragmentation are likely to appear less idiosyncratic if it is recognized that species perceive the same landscapes in different ways. We present a new quantitative approach that uses species distribution models (SDMs) to measure landscapes (e. g. patch size, isolation, matrix amount) from the perspective of individual species. First, we briefly summarize the few efforts to date demonstrating that once differences in habitat distributions are controlled, consistencies in species' responses to landscape structure emerge. Second, we present a detailed example providing step-by-step methods for application of a species-centered approach using freely available land-cover data and recent statistical modeling approaches. Third, we discuss pitfalls in current applications of the approach and recommend avenues for future developments. We conclude that the species-centered approach offers considerable promise as a means to test whether sensitivity to habitat loss and fragmentation is mediated by phylogenetic, ecological, and life-history traits. Cross-species generalities in responses to habitat loss and fragmentation will be challenging to uncover unless landscape mosaics are defined using models that reflect differing species-specific distributions, functional connectivity, and domains of scale. The emergence of such generalities would not only enhance scientific understanding of biotic processes driving fragmentation effects, but would allow managers to estimate species sensitivities in new regions.

AB AimThe aim of this study was to test, based on biological theory, which facet of temperature is most closely associated with the elevational and latitudinal low-temperature limits of seven European broad-leaved tree species. We compared three temperature-related potential constraints across three study regions: (1) absolute minimum temperature within 100years; (2) lowest temperatures during the period of bud-break; and (3) length and temperature of the growing season.
   LocationWestern and Eastern Swiss Alps (1165-2160m a.s.l.) and southern Sweden (57 degrees N-59 degrees N).
   MethodsIn situ temperature was recorded at the high-elevation and high-latitude limits of seven broad-leaved tree species and correlated with temperatures at the nearest weather stations, in order to reconstruct the temperature regime for the past 50years. By applying generalized extreme value distribution theory, we estimated the lowest temperatures recurring during the life span of a tree.
   ResultsAt their high-elevation limits, five out of the seven tree species experienced winter minimum temperatures considerably warmer than their known maximum freezing resistance in winter. For the bud-break period, potentially damaging temperatures occurred at both the elevational and the latitudinal limits and for all four species for which phenological data were available. Three out of five species for which a latitudinal replicate was available showed a similar length of growing season at their respective elevational and latitudinal limits. The mean temperature during the growing season was always warmer at a species' latitudinal limit than at its elevational limit, and hence this variable does not bear general explanatory power for the range limit.
   Main conclusionsLow-temperature extremes during bud-break are the most likely candidates for controlling the elevational and latitudinal limits of broad-leaved tree species. The absolute minimum temperature in winter and the mean temperature during the growing season are unlikely to constrain the cold limits of these species. Thus, the results call for the use of temperature data (extremes) during key stages of spring phenology when attempting to explain the low-temperature range limits and to predict the potential range shifts of deciduous tree species.

AB Species hybridization can lead to fitness costs, species collapse, and novel evolutionary trajectories in changing environments. Hybridization is predicted to be more common when environmental conditions change rapidly. Here, we test patterns of hybridization in three sympatric tree finch species (small tree finch Camarhynchus parvulus, medium tree finch Camarhynchus pauper, and large tree finch: Camarhynchus psittacula) that are currently recognized on Floreana Island, Galaapagos Archipelago. Genetic analysis of microsatellite data from contemporary samples showed two genetic populations and one hybrid cluster in both 2005 and 2010; hybrid individuals were derived from genetic population 1 (small morph) and genetic population 2 (large morph). Females of the large and rare species were more likely to pair with males of the small common species. Finch populations differed in morphology in 1852--1906 compared with 2005/2010. An unsupervised clustering method showed (a) support for three morphological clusters in the historical tree finch sample (1852--1906), which is consistent with current species recognition; (b) support for two or three morphological clusters in 2005 with some (19%) hybridization; and (c) support for just two morphological clusters in 2010 with frequent (41%) hybridization. We discuss these findings in relation to species demarcations of Camarhynchus tree finches on Floreana Island.

AB Land-use intensification leads to species loss and shifts in community composition, but only few studies examine how these dynamics affect ecological and life-history traits. We thus investigated whether ecological and life-history traits differ between butterfly communities of grasslands with different land-use intensity. We conducted butterfly transect surveys in 137 grassland sites in three regions of Germany and compiled 10 species-specific ecological and life-history traits from the literature. These traits are associated with food plant specialisation, dispersal, distribution, reproduction and development. We calculated a land-use intensity gradient based on the amount of fertilise mowing frequency and grazing intensity. We analysed differences of traits characteristics between butterfly communities along the land-use intensity gradient in a fourth-corner analysis, thus considering correlations between traits. Six ecological and life-history traits changed from characteristics associated with specialists to such associated with generalists with increasing land-use intensity. These traits characteristics in intensified grasslands were: high dispersal propensity, large distribution range, low population density, more than one generation per year, hibernation in a more advanced developmental stage and a long flight period. The functional homogenisation of the butterfly communities with changes from specialist to generalist trait characteristics with increasing land-use intensity may have severe consequences for ecosystem functioning and services.

AB Although issues related to the management of invasive alien species are receiving increasing attention, little is known about which factors affect the likelihood of success of management measures. We applied two data mining techniques, classification trees and boosted trees, to identify factors that relate to the success of management campaigns aimed at eradicating invasive alien invertebrates, plants and plant pathogens. We assembled a dataset of 173 different eradication campaigns against 94 species worldwide, about a half of which (50.9%) were successful. Eradications in man-made habitats, greenhouses in particular, were more likely to succeed than those in (semi-) natural habitats. In man-made habitats the probability of success was generally high in Australasia, while in Europe and the Americas it was higher for local infestations that are easier to deal with, and for international campaigns that are likely to profit from cross-border cooperation. In (semi-) natural habitats, eradication campaigns were more likely to succeed for plants introduced as an ornamental and escaped from cultivation prior to invasion. Averaging out all other factors in boosted trees, pathogens, bacteria and viruses were most, and fungi the least likely to be eradicated; for plants and invertebrates the probability was intermediate. Our analysis indicates that initiating the campaign before the extent of infestation reaches the critical threshold, starting to eradicate within the first four years since the problem has been noticed, paying special attention to species introduced by the cultivation pathway, and applying sanitary measures can substantially increase the probability of eradication success. Our investigations also revealed that information on socioeconomic factors, which are often considered to be crucial for eradication success, is rarely available, and thus their relative importance cannot be evaluated. Future campaigns should carefully document socioeconomic factors to enable tests of their importance.

AB A large body of the literature has assessed the complicated process of landscape fragmentation, while few studies have tackled urban green space (UGS) systems in the urban context, especially in compact cities like Hong Kong. The fragmentation index was modeled using landscape metrics to assess green space fragmentation in Hong Kong. Our results indicate that the set of parameters that can be used to analyze the fragmentation of UGS includes: AREA_MN, PD, SHAPE_MN, ENND_MN, CONNECT, DIVISION, MESH and SPLIT. According to the fragmentation index, five fragmentation levels were identified in the study area. The built-up areas in Kowloon and along the coast of Hong Kong Island exhibited the highest fragmentation level of green spaces, while the countryside of the New Territories had the lowest. The uneven distribution of green cover results in an uneven distribution of UGS fragmentation levels. The eight metrics and the PCA technique employed were validated with respect to their applicability to analyzing green space fragmentation in this study. The results of this study could contribute to our understanding of fragmentation from a landscape ecological perspective. They will also be useful in the appropriate, future planning of urban green spaces to increase connectivity, form green networks and realize sustainability in compact cities.

AB Alien plants form important interactions with flower visitors across many systems and are especially likely to dominate these interactions in disturbed habitats where native plants are rare. Most studies of alien plant-pollinator interactions have focused on the effects of alien plants on native plant reproduction; however, these alien plants may also be important food resources for native bees especially if they dominate the "floral market". Dominance of alien species in the diet of bees could occur due to high relative density and abundance of alien plants and flowers, and/or to bee preference for alien plants when they are present. We investigated bees' use of and preference for alien plants using two data sets from distinct regions of North America, central California and southern New Jersey. In each system, we sampled bees and flowering plants in multiple habitat types that differ in level of disturbance and in the relative abundance of alien plant species. Alien plants as a group dominated interactions with bee communities in more disturbed habitats. Importance, however, varied among plant species such that a subset of highly used plant species drove the overall pattern of use within the community. Despite higher use of alien plants in more disturbed sites, alien plants as a group were not more preferred. Rather, bees' use of individual alien plants correlated with plant abundance in the community. Consistent with the interpretation that bees use, but do not prefer, alien plants, we found no effect of alien plant abundance or richness on bee abundance or richness.

AB Invasive alien species cause considerable economic and environmental damage. Nevertheless which species should be targeted first and exact control strategies are controversial matters. As no categorization of the impact of alien bird species is available so far, we adopted an impact scoring system for mammals to birds and scored the impact of the alien birds established in Europe. We investigated 26 established alien birds in Europe and compiled all known impact data for these species. The species with highest environmental impact were the Canada goose (Branta canadensis), sacred ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus) and ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis). The most severe impact on economy was exerted again by the Canada goose. Also the ring-necked parakeet (Psittacula krameri) and monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) had high impact in this category. Combining these potential impact data with the current distribution generates a list of alien birds with highest actual impact. These two values can be used to prioritise preventive and control measures. In comparison to birds, mammals in general have higher potential and actual impact in Europe, but some bird species reach impact values as high as some of the worst mammal species. Still, these bird species - in contrast to mammals with high impact - are hardly targeted by control programmes. This study shows that there is no scientific reason for this. With the here presented scoring system we offer a decision tool to practitioners which supports them in finding an appropriate reaction to invasive birds. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many species use acoustic signals to attract mates, and such signals can be degraded by anthropogenic noise. Anuran abundance has been shown to be negatively correlated with road traffic which could be due in part to the interruption of mate attraction by traffic noise. However, this impact could be small if anurans can alter their vocalization characteristics to avoid masking of their calls by traffic noise. We predicted that: (i) anuran vocalization characteristics (dominant frequency, mean amplitude and call rate) should be different in areas with different traffic noise levels; (ii) increases in traffic noise can cause immediate changes in amphibian vocalization characteristics; (iii) these altered vocalizations are similar to those at high traffic sites. To test the first prediction we compared vocalizations of four species of anuran at breeding sites in locations with low traffic noise vs. sites with high traffic noise. For the second prediction we broadcast traffic noise at low traffic (quiet) sites, and compared the anuran vocalizations before vs. during the broadcast traffic noise. For the third prediction we compared vocalizations at high traffic sites to those produced at low traffic sites while broadcasting traffic noise. Three species of anurans found at locations with low traffic noise produced vocalizations with different characteristics than individuals of the same species found in locations with high traffic noise. Broadcast traffic noise immediately altered amphibian vocalization characteristics such that they became similar to those of the same species found in locations with high traffic noise. We conclude that plasticity in the vocalizations of anurans allows for the maintenance of acoustic communication in the presence of traffic noise. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Aim
   We perform a phylogeographical study of an endemic Patagonian herbaceous plant to assess whether geographical patterns of genetic variation correspond to in situ Pleistocene survival or to glacial retreat and post-glacial expansion. We also seek to determine the locations of potential glacial refugia and post-glacial colonization routes.
   Location
   Southern Andes and Patagonian steppe.
   Methods
   We used Calceolaria polyrhiza, a widely distributed Patagonian herbaceous plant that occurs mainly in the understorey of Nothofagus rain forests and in the arid Patagonian steppe, as our model system. The chloroplast intergenic spacer trnH-psbA was sequenced for 590 individuals from 68 populations. Sequence data were analysed using phylogenetic (maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference) and population genetic (spatial analyses of molecular variance, mismatch distributions and neutrality tests) methods. Nested clade phylogeographic analyses, and divergence time estimates using a calibrated molecular clock, were also conducted.
   Results
   A total of 27 haplotypes identified in the present study clustered into four primary genealogical lineages, revealing three significant latitudinal phylogeographical breaks. The two high Andean lineages probably split first, during the late Miocene, and the Patagonian lineage split around 4 Ma, coincident with the establishment of the Patagonian steppe. Within each haplogroup, major diversification occurred in the Pleistocene. The Patagonian groups show a pattern consistent with a rapid post-glacial expansion and colonization of the Andean flanks, achieved independently by four lineages. The highest haplotype diversity was found along a longitudinal transect that is remarkably congruent with the limit of the ice-sheet extension during the Greatest Patagonian Glaciation. A north-east expansion is evident, which is probably associated with the 'Arid Diagonal' fluctuations.
   Main conclusions
   Glacial climate fluctuations had a substantial impact on the diversification, distribution and demography of the study species. A scenario of multiple periglacial Pleistocene refugia and subsequent multiple recolonization routes, from eastern Patagonia to the Andean flanks, may explain the phylogeographical patterns observed. However, current genetic structure also preserves the imprints of older events that probably occurred in the Miocene and Pliocene, providing evidence that multiple processes, operating at different spatial and temporal scales, have moulded biodiversity in Patagonia.

AB Many organisms show polymorphism in dispersal distance strategies. This variation is particularly ecological relevant if it encompasses a functional separation of short- (SDD) and long-distance dispersal (LDD). It remains, however, an open question whether both parts of the dispersal kernel are similarly affected by landscape related selection pressures.
   We implemented an individual-based model to analyze the evolution of dispersal traits in firactal landscapes that vary in the proportion of habitat and its spatial configuration. Individuals are parthenogenetic with dispersal distance determined by two alleles oil each individual's genome: one allele coding for the probability of global dispersal and one allele coding for the variance sigma of a Gaussian local dispersal with mean value zero.
   Simulations show that mean distances of local dispersal and the probability of global dispersal, increase with increasing habitat availability, but that changes in the habitats spatial autocorrelation impose opposing selective pressure: local dispersal distances decrease and global dispersal probabilities increase with decreasing spatial autocorrelation of the available habitat. Local adaptation of local dispersal distance emerges in landscapes with less than 70% of clumped habitat.
   These results demonstrate that long and short distance dispersal evolve separately according to different properties of the landscape. The landscape structure may consequently largely affect the evolution of dispersal distance strategies and the level of dispersal polymorphism.

AB Survival of desert riparian vegetation along the middle and lower reaches of the Tarim River in China depends almost entirely on groundwater. The aim of this project was to study the effect of various water table levels on desert riparian forest vegetation and to determine the groundwater threshold under which desert riparian forest vegetation can grow normally. Using data collected from 2 years (2006-2007) of monitoring (groundwater, vegetation plots, and soil profiles) of the middle and lower reaches of the Tarim River, the relationship between vegetation and environmental factors was analysed using detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA). The average depth of the groundwater table at the study sites was divided into six ranges (0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10, and > 10 m) to compare the influence of groundwater level on species diversity. Using the ecological suitability theory and data from previous studies of several major plant species in the study area, a logarithm normal distribution relation model was built between the growth of plants and the depth of groundwater. The results of DCCA ordination indicated that groundwater depth (GWD) and soil moisture are the crucial environmental factors affecting the distribution of plants. Species diversity was the highest at the 2-4 m level, followed by the 4-6 m level, and then the 0-2 m level. When the groundwater level dropped to below 6 m, species diversity decreased greatly, and the slope of Hill's index (diversity ordering) tended to level off. Thus, the optimum groundwater level for major plant growth is 2-4 m and the threshold GWD is about 6 m. To restore the vegetation and ecosystem of the lower reaches of the Tarim River, the water table must be kept at a minimum of 6 m in depth. It should also be maintained at 2-4 m in the vicinity of the water way and at 4-6 m for the rest of this arid area. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Exotic plants provide a unique opportunity to explore the evolution of defense allocation in plants. Many studies have focused on whether enemy release leads to a change in defense allocation. Little research has focused on induced defenses and on how resource availability in the nonindigenous range might cause evolutionary shifts in defense trait allocation. We examine (a) the major evolutionary hypotheses predicting defense expression in plants, (b) the hypotheses explaining defense evolution of exotic species, and (c) the importance of geographic variation in ecological interactions to defense evolution (geographic mosaics). In addition, we review the strengths and weaknesses of experimental approaches, present case studies, and suggest areas that deserve further attention.

AB Our understanding of broad taxonomic patterns of plant naturalizations is based entirely on observations of successful naturalizations. Omission of the failures, however, can introduce bias by conflating the probabilities of introduction and naturalization. Here, we use two comprehensive datasets of successful and failed plant naturalizations in New Zealand and Australia for a unique, flora-wide comparative test of several major invasion hypotheses. First, we show that some taxa are consistently more successful at naturalizing in these two countries, despite their environmental differences. Broad climatic origins helped to explain some of the differences in success rates in the two countries. We further show that species with native relatives were generally more successful in both countries, contrary to Darwin's naturalization hypothesis, but this effect was inconsistent among families across the two countries. Finally, we show that contrary to studies based on successful naturalizations only, islands need not be inherently more invasible than continents.

AB In this study the high-frequency loss of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and water vapor (H(2)O) fluxes, measured by a closed-path eddy covariance system, were studied, and the related correction factors through the cospectral transfer function method were calculated. As already reported by other studies, it was found that the age of the sampling tube is a relevant factor to consider when estimating the spectral correction of water vapor fluxes. Moreover, a time-dependent relationship between the characteristic time constant (or response time) for water vapor and the ambient relative humidity was disclosed. Such dependence is negligible when the sampling tube is new, but it becomes important already when the tube is only 1 yr old and increases with the age of the tube. With a new sampling tube, the correction of water vapor flux measurements over a Scots pine forest in Hyytiala, Finland, amounted on average to 7%. After 4 yr the correction increased strongly, ranging from 10%-15% during the summer to 30%-40% in wintertime, when the relative humidity is typically high. For this site the effective correction improved the long-term energy and water balance.
   Results suggest that the relative humidity effect on high-frequency loss of water vapor flux should be taken into account and that the effective transfer function should be estimated experimentally at least once per year. On the other hand, this high correction can be avoided by a correct choice and periodic maintenance of the eddy covariance system tube, for example, by cleaning or changing it at least once per year.

AB The hypothesis of convergence takes the deterministic view that community (or assemblage) structure can be predicted from the environment, and that the environment is expected to drive evolution in a predictable direction. Here we present results of a comparative study of freshwater fish assemblages from headwater streams in four continents (Europe, North America, Africa and South America), with the general objective of testing whether these assemblages display convergent structures under comparable environmental conditions (i.e. assemblage position in the stream longitudinal continuum). We tested this hypothesis by comparing species richness and trophic guilds of those stream fish assemblages represented in available data from multiple sites on each continent. Independent of phylogenetic and historical constraints, fish assemblage richness and trophic structure in the four continents converged along the stream continua to a substantial degree. For the four continents, assemblage richness increased, the proportion of invertivorous species decreased, and the proportion of omnivorous species increased from upstream to downstream, supporting theoretical predictions of the river continuum concept. However, the herbivore/detritivore and piscivore guilds were virtually absent from our small European and North American stream sites, unlike our African and South American stream sites. This divergence can be linked to differences in energy availability between temperate and tropical systems.

AB We explored the net effects of grazing on soil C and N pools in a Patagonian shrub-grass steppe (temperate South America). Net effects result from the combination of direct impacts of grazing on biogeochemical characteristics of microsites with indirect effects on relative cover of vegetated and unvegetated microsites. Within five independent areas, we sampled surface soils in sites subjected to three grazing intensities: (1) ungrazed sites inside grazing exclosures, (2) moderately grazed sites adjacent to them, and (3) intensely grazed sites within the same paddock. Grazing significantly reduced soil C and N pools, although this pattern was clearest in intensely grazed sites. This net effect was due to the combination of a direct reduction of soil N content in bare soil patches, and indirect effects mediated by the increase of the cover of bare soil microsites, with lower C and N content than either grass or shrub microsites. This increase in bare soil cover was accompanied by a reduction in cover of preferred grass species and standing dead material. Finally, stable isotope signatures varied significantly among grazed and ungrazed sites, with delta N-15 and delta C-13 significantly depleted in intensely grazed sites, suggesting reduced mineralization with increased grazing intensity. In the Patagonian steppe, grazing appears to exert a negative effect on soil C and N cycles; sound management practices must incorporate the importance of species shifts within life form, and the critical role of standing dead material in maintaining soil C and N stocks and biogeochemical processes.

AB Trapline foraging (repeated sequential visits to a series of feeding locations) has been often observed in pollinators collecting nectar or pollen from flowers. Although field studies on bumble-bees and hummingbirds have clarified fundamental aspects of this behaviour, trapline foraging still poses several difficult questions from the perspectives of both animals and plants. These questions include whether and how traplining improves foraging performance, how animals develop traplines with accumulating foraging experience, and how traplining affects pollen flow or plant reproduction.
   First, we review our previous work performed by using computer simulations and indoor flight-cage experiments with bumble-bees foraging from arrays of automated feeders. Our findings include the following: (1) traplining benefits foragers that are competing for resources that replenish in a decelerating way, (2) traplining is a learned behaviour that develops over a period of hours and (3) the establishment of traplines could be hampered by spatial configuration of plants such as zigzags. Second, using a simulation model linking pollinator movement and pollen transfer, we consider how service by pollinators with different foraging patterns (searchers or trapliners) would affect pollen flow. Traplining increases mating distance and mate diversity, and reduces 'iterogamy' (self-pollination caused by return visits) at the population level. Furthermore, increased visitation rates can have opposite effects on the reproductive success of a plant, depending on whether the visitors are traplining or searching. Finally, we discuss possible consequences of traplining for plants in the light of new experimental work and modelling.
   We suggest that trapline foraging by pollinators increases variation among plant populations in genetic diversity, inbreeding depression and contributions of floral traits to plant fitness, which should in turn affect the rates and directions of floral evolution.

AB By the end of the century, climate change projections under a "business-as-usual" emissions scenario suggest a globally averaged warming of 2.4-6.4 degrees C. If these forecasts are realized, cropping systems are likely to experience significant geographic range transformations among damaging endemic weed species and new vulnerabilities to exotic weed invasions. To anticipate these changes and to devise management strategies for proactively addressing them, it is necessary to characterize the environmental conditions that make specific weed species abundant, competitive, and therefore damaging the production of particular crops (i.e. defining the damage niche). In this study, U.S. maize is used as a model system to explore the implications of climate change on the distribution of damaging agricultural weeds. To accomplish this, we couple ensemble climate change projections of annual temperature and precipitation with survey data of troublesome weed species in maize. At the state scale, space-for-time substitution techniques are used to suggest the potential magnitude of change among damaging weed communities. To explore how the geography of damage for specific species may evolve over the next century, bioclimatic range rules were derived for two weed species that are pervasive in the Northern (Abutilon theophrasti Medicus, ABUTH) and Southern (Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers., SORHA) U.S. Results from both analyses suggest that the composition of damaging weed communities may be fundamentally altered by climate change. In some states, potential changes in the coming decades are commensurate to those possible by the end of the century. Regions such as the Northeastern U.S. may prove particularly vulnerable with emerging climate conditions favoring few weed species of present-day significance. In contrast, regions like the mid-South are likely to experience fewer shifts even with a similar magnitude in climate change. By the end of the century in the U.S. Corn Belt, cold-tolerant species likeA. theophrasti may be of minor importance whereas S. halepense, a predominantly Southern U.S. weed species at present, may become common and damaging to maize production with its damage niche advancing 200-600 km north of its present-day distribution.

TI Early Fasting Is Long Lasting: Differences in Early Nutritional
   Conditions Reappear under Stressful Conditions in Adult Female Zebra
   Finches
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Conditions experienced during early life can have profound effects on individual development and condition in adulthood. Differences in nutritional provisioning in birds during the first month of life can lead to differences in growth, reproductive success and survival. Yet, under natural conditions shorter periods of nutritional stress will be more prevalent. Individuals may respond differently, depending on the period of development during which nutritional stress was experienced. Such differences may surface specifically when poor environmental conditions challenge individuals again as adults. Here, we investigated long term consequences of differences in nutritional conditions experienced during different periods of early development by female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) on measures of management and acquisition of body reserves. As nestlings or fledglings, subjects were raised under different nutritional conditions, a low or high quality diet. After subjects reached sexual maturity, we measured their sensitivity to periods of food restriction, their exploration and foraging behaviour as well as adult resting metabolic rate (RMR). During a short period of food restriction, subjects from the poor nutritional conditions had a higher body mass loss than those raised under qualitatively superior nutritional conditions. Moreover, subjects that were raised under poor nutritional conditions were faster to engage in exploratory and foraging behaviour. But RMR did not differ among treatments. These results reveal that early nutritional conditions affect adult exploratory behaviour, a representative personality trait, foraging and adult's physiological condition. As early nutritional conditions are reflected in adult phenotypic plasticity specifically when stressful situations reappear, the results suggest that costs for poor developmental conditions are paid when environmental conditions deteriorate.

AB To understand mechanisms structuring diversity in young adaptive radiations, quantitative and unbiased information about genetic and phenotypic diversity is much needed. Here, we present the first in-depth investigation of whitefish diversity in a Swiss lake, with continuous spawning habitat sampling in both time and space. Our results show a clear cline like pattern in genetics and morphology of populations sampled along an ecological depth gradient in Lake Neuchatel. Divergent natural selection appears to be involved in shaping this cline given that trait specific P-ST-values are significantly higher than F-ST-values when comparing populations caught at different depths. These differences also tend to increase with increasing differences in depth, indicating adaptive divergence along a depth gradient, which persists despite considerable gene flow between adjacent demes. It however remains unclear, whether the observed pattern is a result of currently stable selection-gene flow balance, incipient speciation, or reverse speciation due to anthropogenic habitat alteration causing two formerly divergent species to collapse into a single gene pool.

AB Theoretical work exploring dispersal evolution focuses on the emigration rate of individuals and typically assumes that movement occurs either at random to any other patch or to one of the nearest-neighbour patches. There is a lack of work exploring the process by which individuals move between patches, and how this process evolves. This is of concern because any organism that can exert control over dispersal direction can potentially evolve efficiencies in locating patches, and the process by which individuals find new patches will potentially have major effects on metapopulation dynamics and gene flow. Here, we take an initial step towards filling this knowledge gap. To do this we constructed a continuous space population model, in which individuals each carry heritable trait values that specify the characteristics of the biased correlated random walk they use to disperse from their natal patch. We explore how the evolution of the random walk depends upon the cost of dispersal, the density of patches in the landscape, and the emigration rate. The clearest result is that highly correlated walks always evolved (individuals tended to disperse in relatively straight lines from their natal patch), reflecting the efficiency of straight-line movement. In our models, more costly dispersal resulted in walks with higher correlation between successive steps. However, the exact walk that evolved also depended upon the density of suitable habitat patches, with low density habitat evolving more biased walks (individuals which orient towards suitable habitat at quite large distances from that habitat). Thus, low density habitat will tend to develop individuals which disperse efficiently between adjacent habitat patches but which only rarely disperse to more distant patches; a result that has clear implications for metapopulation theory. Hence, an understanding of the movement behaviour of dispersing individuals is critical for robust long-term predictions of population dynamics in fragmented landscapes.

AB Sperm morphology varies considerably across taxa, and postcopulatory sexual selection is thought to be one of the main forces responsible for this diversity. Several studies have investigated the effects of the variation in sperm design on sperm function, but the consequences of variation in sperm design on testis morphology have been overlooked. Testes size or architecture may determine the size of the sperm they produce, and selection for longer sperm may require concomitant adaptations in the testes. Relative testes size differs greatly between species and is often used as an index of sperm competition, but little is known about whether larger testes have more sperm-producing tissue or produce sperm at a faster rate. Using a comparative approach in New World Blackbirds (Icteridae), we found (1) a strong link between testis histology and sperm length, suggesting selection on testis architecture through selection on sperm size, and (2) that species under intense sperm competition had a greater proportion of sperm-producing tissue within their testes. These results support the prediction that sperm competition fosters adaptations in reproductive organs that extend beyond testes size, and raise questions about the trade-offs influencing reproductive investment.

AB 1. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of different nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) loading ratios on phytoplankton community composition and primary production in a naturally eutrophic lake. Furthermore, the sources of N fuelling primary production were estimated using N-15 stable isotope tracers.
   2. A mesocosm experiment was performed with the same amount of P added to all mesocosms (similar to internal loading rates) but with a range of N additions (0-86 mu m N), resulting in a gradient of N : P supply ratios.
   3. Low N : P supply ratios resulted in a significant shift in the phytoplankton assemblage to a community dominated by N-fixing cyanobacteria and a supply of atmospheric N-2 estimated to be up to 60% of total supply.
   4. The N : P loading ratio had no significant effect on primary production, total nitrogen (TN) concentration or particulate N concentration.
   5. Our results imply that a reduced N : P ratio of the nutrient load does not necessarily result in a lower TN concentration and downstream N export due to compensation by N-fixing cyanobacteria.

In this review we describe the range of interactions observed between these impacts of ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 280-400 nm) with other environmental factors such as the availability of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), nutrient status and levels of dissolved CO2, all of which can, in turn, be influenced by global climate change. Thus, increases in CO2 levels can affect the sensitivity of some species to UV-B radiation (UV-B), while others show no such impact on UV-B susceptibility. Both nitrogen-and phosphorus-limitation can have direct interactive effects on the susceptibility of algal cells and communities to UVR, though such effects are somewhat variable. Nutrient depletion can also potentially lead to a dominance of smaller celled species, which may be less able to screen out and are thus likely to be more susceptible to UVR-induced damage. The variability of responses to such interactions can lead to alterations in the species composition of algal assemblages.

AB Climate change and overfishing are increasingly causing unanticipated changes in marine ecosystems (e.g. shifts in species dominance). In order to understand and anticipate these changes, there is a crucial need for indicators that summarise large quantities of information into a few relevant and accessible signals. Seabirds have been suggested as good candidates for ecological indicators of the marine environment; however, few studies have critically evaluated their value as such. We review the role of seabirds as ecological indicators, and discuss their limitations and drawbacks, as compared to other types of indicators. In addition, we highlight the statistical consequences of inverse inference when using seabird data as indicators. We discuss the use of integrated indices and the use of seabirds as autonomous samplers of the marine environment. Finally, we highlight the necessary steps preceding the use of seabirds as indicators. We conclude that, in order to use seabird time series properly, the use of recent advances both in statistics and in remote sensing is a way to move forward. This, along with the assessment of their usefulness, should enable us to use seabird indicators appropriately for managing urgent conservation problems.

AB Smooth-shelled mussels, Mytilus spp., have an antitropical distribution. In the Northern Hemisphere, the M. edulis complex of species is composed of three genetically well delineated taxa: M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus. In the Southern Hemisphere, morphological characters, allozymes and intron length polymorphisms suggest that Mytilus spp. populations from South America and Kerguelen Islands are related to M. edulis and those from Australasia to M. galloprovincialis. On the other hand, a phylogeny of the 16S rDNA mitochondrial locus demonstrates a clear distinctiveness of southern mussels and suggests that they are related to Mediterranean M. galloprovincialis. Here, we analysed the faster-evolving cytochrome oxidase subunit I locus. The divergence between haplotypes of populations from the two hemispheres was confirmed and was found to predate the divergence between haplotypes of northern M. edulis and M. galloprovincialis. In addition, strong genetic structure was detected among the southern samples. revealing three genetic entities that correspond to (1) South America and Kerguelen Island, (2) Tasmania, (3) New Zealand. Using the trans-Arctic interchange as a molecular clock calibration, we estimated the time since divergence of populations from the two hemispheres to be between 0.5 million years (MY) and 1.3 MY (average 0.84 MY). The contrasting patterns observed for the nuclear and the organelle genomes suggested two alternative, complex scenarios: two trans-equatorial migrations and the existence of differential barriers to mitochondrial and nuclear gene flow, or a single trans-equatorial migration and a view of the composition of the nuclear genome biased by taxonomic preconception.

AB Climatic oscillations during the glaciations forced dramatic changes in species distributions, such that some presently temperate regions were alternately occupied by temperate and arctic species. These species could have met and hybridized during climatic transitions. This phenomenon happened for three hare species present in Iberia ( Lepus granatensis, Lepus europaeus and Lepus castroviejoi), which display high frequencies of mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) from Lepus timidus, an arctic/ boreal species presently extinct in Iberia. Here, we extend our previous geographical survey to determine whether the distribution of this mtDNA lineage extends beyond the northern half of the Iberian Peninsula, where it is found at high frequencies. We also review the taxonomy, distribution and molecular phylogeny of the genus Lepus. The phylogenetic inference reveals the presence of L. timidus- like mtDNA in several other hare species in Asia and North America, suggesting that the mitochondrial introgression observed in Iberia might be generalized. Comparison with the available nuclear gene phylogenies suggests that introgression could have happened repeatedly, possibly during different climatic transitions. We discuss demographic and adaptive scenarios that could account for the repetition in time and space of this spectacular phenomenon and suggest ways to improve our understanding of its determinants and consequences. Such high levels of introgressive hybridization should discourage attempts to revise hare taxonomy based solely on mtDNA.

AB We examined the influence of temperature and management practices on the nitrogen (N) cycling of turfgrass, the largest irrigated crop in the United States. We measured nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, and plant and soil N content and isotopic composition with a manipulative experiment of temperature and fertilizer application. Infrared lamps were used to increase surface temperature by 3.5 +/- 1.3 degrees C on average and control and heated plots were split into high and low fertilizer treatments. The N2O fluxes increased following fertilizer application and were also directly related to soil moisture. There was a positive effect of warming on N2O fluxes. Soils in the heated plots were enriched in nitrogen isotope ratio (delta N-15) relative to control plots, consistent with greater gaseous losses of N. For all treatments, C-4 plant C/N ratio was negatively correlated with plant delta N-15, suggesting that low leaf N was associated with the use of isotopically depleted N sources such as mineralized organic matter. A significant and unexpected result was a large, rapid increase in the proportion of C-4 plants in the heated plots relative to control plots, as measured by the carbon isotope ratio (delta C-13) of total harvested aboveground biomass. The C-4 plant biomass was dominated by crabgrass, a common weed in C-3 fescue lawns. Our results suggest that an increase in temperature caused by climate change as well as the urban heat island effect may result in increases in N2O emissions from fertilized urban lawns. In addition, warming may exacerbate weed invasions, which may require more intensive management, e.g. herbicide application, to manage species composition.

AB Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) predation on army ants (Dorylus, subgenus Anomma) is an impressive example of skillful use of elementary technology, and it has been suggested to reflect Cultural differences among chimpanzee communities. Alternatively, the observed geographic diversity in army-ant-eating may represent local behavioral responses of the chimpanzees to the anti-predator traits of the army ant species present at the different sites. We examined assemblages of available prey species, their behavior and morphology, consumption by chimpanzees, techniques employed, and tool lengths at 14 sites in eastern. central, and western Africa. Where army ants are eaten, tool length and concomitant technique are a function of prey type. Epigaeically foraging species with aggressive workers that inflict painful bites are harvested with longer tools and usually by the "pull-through" technique; species foraging in leaf-litter with less aggressive workers that inflict less painful bites are harvested with short tools and by the "direct-mouthing" technique. However, prey species characteristics do not explain several differences in army-ant-eating between Bossou (Guinea) and Tai (Ivory Coast), where the same suite of prey species is available and is consumed. Moreover, the absence of army-ant-eating at five sites cannot be explained by the identity of available prey species, as all the species found at these sites are eaten elsewhere. We conclude that some of the observed variation in the predator-prey relationship of chimpanzees and army ants reflects environmental influences driven by the prey, while other variation is not linked to prey characteristics and may be solely sociocultural.

AB The theory of species coexistence predicts avoidance between species that compete for similar resources. Recent studies, however, have suggested that facilitation is also possible if competitor density provides information about resources. Optimal solution to trade-off between competition and facilitation is predicted to occur at intermediate competitor densities. We tested this hypothesis by experimentally creating a density range of resident tit species (Parus spp.), and measured the response of a competitively subordinate migratory bird, the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis) in terms of habitat preference (settlement order and density), offspring investment (clutch size and primary sex ratio of offspring), and reproductive success (number and condition of nestlings). We show that most habitat choice and investment decisions of flycatchers were unimodally related to tit density, whereas reproductive success decreased linearly with increasing density. Flycatchers thus made mismatched investment decisions at the artificial tit densities because manipulation disassociated the natural correlation between habitat quality and population density. Apparently low and high tit densities were perceived as indication of poor quality habitat in terms of low amount or quality of resources/high mortality risk and high costs of competition, respectively. This demonstrates that competitor density can be used in assessing overall habitat quality in habitat selection and offspring investment decisions, integrating information on resources and competition.

AB In autologistic regression models employed in the analysis of species' spatial distributions, an additional explanatory variable, the autocovariate, is used to correct the effect of spatial autocorrelation. The values of the autocovariate depend on the values of the response variable in the neighbourhood. While this approach has been widely used over the last ten years in biogeographical analyses, it has not been assessed for its validity and performance against artificial simulation data with known properties. I here present such. an assessment, varying the range and strength of spatial autocorrelation in the data as well as the prevalence of the focal species. Autologistic regression models consistently underestimate the effect of the environmental variable in the model and give biased estimates compared to a non-spatial logistic regression. A comparison with other methods available for the correction of spatial autocorrelation shows that autologistic regression is more biased and less reliable and hence should be used only in concert with other reference methods.

AB Plant mortality and birth rates are critical components of plant life history affecting the stability of plant populations and the ecosystems they form. Although allometric theory predicts that both plant birth and mortality rates should be size-dependent, this prediction has not yet been tested across plants ranging the full size spectrum. Here we show that both population mortality and population birth rates scale as the -1/4 power and plant lifespan as the 1/4 power of plant mass across plant species spanning from the tiniest phototrophs to the largest trees. Whereas the controls on plant lifespans are as yet poorly understood, our findings suggest that plant mortality rates have evolved to match population birth rates, thereby helping to maintain plant communities in equilibrium and optimizing plant life histories.

AB I studied anatomy, gut content, and the relationship among these traits in a set of anuran tadpoles. Larval stages (mainly Gosner stages 31-36) of nineteen species from various lentic environments were selected. Morphological characters from the skeleton, musculature, oral apparatus and buccopharyngeal cavity were recorded, and a gut content analysis was performed, with emphasis on food size distribution. Ordination techniques were applied in order to find patterns of similarity in morphology and gut content. Canonical ordination methods were used to investigate the relationship among gut content, morphology, and phylogeny in the species considered. The results show that several skeletal, muscular, and buccal characters are relatively maintained within genera. Other features, which have appeared independently in different lineages, reflect convergence phenomena in some cases related to ecological aspects. The configuration of the hyobranchial skeleton, the development of the buccal floor depressor and levator muscles, and mouth gape width correlate with prey size. In some species, morphology is clearly related with feeding. Tadpoles that ingest large food particles relative to their body length present morphological traits attributable to macrophagy. Taxonomically unrelated tadpoles of Dendropsophus nanus, D. microcephalus and Ceratophrys cranwelli possess hyobranchial skeletons with robust, rostrocaudally long ceratohyals and reduced branchial baskets with short ceratobranchials devoid of lateral projections and spicules. Lepidobatrachus llanensis tadpoles have laterally extended ceratohyals which, along with the lateral extension of the jaws, result in a very wide oral apparatus and an ample buccopharyngeal cavity that allows the tadpole to ingest large and whole prey; the branchial basket, although its ceratobranchials lack lateral projections and spicules, is slightly reduced in area. The four species mentioned have a noticeable development of the buccal floor depressor muscles, and buccal cavities with scarce filtering and entrapping structures. In Elachistocleis bicolor, Dermatonotus muelleri, Chiasmocleis panamensis, and Xenopus laevis tadpoles, the branchial basket occupies >70% of the total hyobranchial skeleton area, and the hypobranchial plates are highly reduced; the buccal floor levator muscles are well-developed, with an increased site of attachment on the ventral expansion of the lateral process of the ceratohyal; the scarcity of the filtering structures in the buccopharyngeal cavity are balanced with the great development of the branchial filters and secretory zones; all these features relate to a diet based on small particles not significantly different from those of most other species; however, experimental studies show that species with similar hyobranchial apparatus and muscles are the most efficient when retaining minute particles. Finally, a large group of species present generalized morphological characters, such as a branchial basket occupying about 50% of the total hyobranchial apparatus, intermediate values of mouth gape width and buccal floor levator / depressor muscles ratio, and abundant filtering structures in the buccopharyngeal cavity; these species feed frequently on food particles between 1-30% of the tadpole body length; however, in some of the species, macrophagous diets are also reported in the literature, indicating that this morphology is flexible in more ample prey size ranges.

AB We studied the impact of two exotic salmonid species (brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis and rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss) on native brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) habitat, growth and survival. Habitat selection and vertical distribution between young-of-the-year of the three species were examined in a stream aquarium under different sympatric and allopatric combinations. In addition, similar species combinations were introduced in a Pyrenean mountain stream (southwest France) in order to extend laboratory results to growth and apparent survival. Both laboratory and field results indicated that rainbow trout significantly affected native brown trout habitat selection and apparent survival. On the contrary, brown trout habitat, growth and apparent survival were hardly affected by brook trout. These results support the idea that rainbow trout negatively influence native brown trout, and that competition could influence the outcome of fish biological invasions in freshwater ecosystems.

AB Biodiversity provides insurance against the uncertain provision of ecosystem services which are being used by risk-averse economic agents. I present a conceptual ecological-economic model that combines (i) current results from ecology about the relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and the provision of ecosystem services with (ii) economic methods to study decision-making under uncertainty. In this framework I (1) determine the insurance value of biodiversity, (2) study the optimal allocation of funds in the trade-off between investing into biodiversity protection and the purchase of financial insurance, and (3) analyze the effect of different institutional regimes in the market for financial insurance on biodiversity protection. I conclude that biodiversity acts as a form of natural insurance for risk-averse ecosystem managers against the over- or under-provision with ecosystem services. Therefore, biodiversity has an insurance value, which is a value component in addition to the usual value arguments, such as direct or indirect use or non-use values. In this respect, biodiversity and financial insurance are substitutes. Hence, the availability, and exact institutional design; of financial insurance influence the level of biodiversity protection.

AB The seasonal dynamics of non-structural carbohydrates in the woody organs of two co-existing mediterranean sub-shrubs were analyzed. The two species show different leaf phenology during summer: Linum suffruticosum, maintains many of its green leaves, while Lepidium subulatum sheds most of its leaves. These different leaf phenologies are related to different strategies with regard to summer stress. The maintenance of leaves in Linum is related to its stress tolerance while Lepidium avoids stress by shedding its leaves. The main objectives were to: (1) determine the differences in the seasonal dynamics of non-structural carbohydrates among the main woody organs of both species; (2) verify if differences in the leaf phenology, and hence in the strategy with regard to summer drought, lead to different seasonal patterns of carbohydrate storage and use between the two species; (3) compare the seasonal dynamics of carbohydrates of the two studied sub-shrubs with those of mediterranean trees and shrubs previously reported in the literature. The concentration of soluble sugars (SS), starch and total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) were assessed monthly, over 17 months, in the main roots, stems and the transition zone between root and shoot systems of both species. Starch storage capacity and SS, starch and TNC pools were calculated. The seasonal pattern of carbohydrate accumulation was similar among the woody organs analyzed, but it differed with those reported for mediterranean trees and shrubs. The two species showed different pools and seasonal patterns of non-structural carbohydrate concentrations in its woody organ, which corresponded to their different extent of leaf shedding. The stress-avoider Lepidium accumulated starch during spring shoot growth as a carbon store for summer respiration and had low pools of SS, whereas the stress-tolerant Linum increased SS during summer drought to maintain photosynthetic activity during summer and had low starch pools and storage capacity. However, irrespective of their different leaf shedding patterns, both species had a similar relative variation of their TNC concentration, which contrasts with previous results on deciduous and everigreen woody species.

AB center dot Background and Aims Nouelia insignis Franch., a monotypic genus of the Asteraceae, is an endangered species endemic in Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces of China. Most of the populations are seriously threatened. Some of them are even at the brink of extinction. In this study, the genetic diversity and differentiation between populations of this species were examined in two drainage areas.
   center dot Methods DNA fingerprinting based on inter-simple sequence repeat polymorphisms was employed to detect the genetic variation and population structure in the species.
   center dot Key Results Genetic diversity at species level was high with P = 65.05 % (percentage of polymorphic loci) and H-t = 0.2248 (total genetic diversity). The coefficient of genetic differentiation among populations, G(st), which was estimated by partitioning the total gene diversity, was 0.2529; whereas, the genetic differentiation between populations in the Jinsha and Nanpan drainage areas was unexpectedly low (G(st) = 0.0702).
   center dot Conclusions Based on the genetic analyses of the DNA fingerprinting, recent habitat fragmentation may not have led to genetic differentiation or the loss of genetic diversity in the rare species. Spatial apportionment of fingerprinting polymorphisms provides a footprint of historical migration across geographical barriers. The high diversity detected in this study holds promise for conservation and restoration efforts to save the endangered species from extinction.

AB Social context has been shown to encourage, or to delay object exploration and learning. This ambiguity might be due to factors such as social relationships and personality of the individuals involved. Here, we investigated in ravens (Corvus corax) individuals' consistency in response to novel objects over development and across contexts: alone versus social. In the social setting we focussed on the effects of social relationships on social facilitation during the approach to novel objects. We tested 11 hand-raised ravens. with novel objects individually at three and six months of age and in dyadic combinations at-six months of age. Individuals were consistent over development and contexts in their response to different novel objects. Birds joined siblings faster to approach novel objects than non-siblings. They also spent more time sitting close to siblings than to non-siblings. In male-male dyads but not in female-female dyads, subordinates approached the novel objects significantly faster than dominant birds. In contrast, dominant males were the first to approach the novel objects in mixed-sex combinations. Hence, the effect of social context seems to depend on the social relationships towards the companions and on the combination of the sexes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The objectives of this study were (a) to evaluate at a seasonal scale the relationship between ANPP and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), (b) to estimate seasonal variations in the coefficient of conversion of absorbed radiation into aboveground biomass (epsilon(a)), and (c) to identify the environmental controls on such temporal changes. We used biomass-based field determinations of ANPP for two grassland sites in the Flooding Pampa, Argentina, and related them with NDVI data derived from the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellites using three different models. Results were compared with data obtained from the new Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor at an additional site. The first model was based solely on NDVI; the second was based on the amount of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the green vegetation (APAR(g)), which was derived from NDVI and incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR); the third was based on APAR(g) and epsilon(a), which was in turn estimated from climatic variables. NDVI explained between 63 and 93% of ANPP variation, depending on the site considered. Estimates of ANPP were not improved by considering the variation in incoming PAR. At both sites, epsilon(a) varied seasonally (from 0.2 to 1.2 g DM/MJ) and was significantly associated with combinations of precipitation and temperature. Combining epsilon(a) variations with APAR(g) increased our ability to account for seasonal ANPP variations at both sites. Our results indicate that NDVI produces good, direct estimates of ANPP only if NDVI, PAR, and epsilon(a) are correlated throughout the seasons. Thus, in most cases, seasonal variations of epsilon(a) associated with temperature and precipitation must be taken into account to generate seasonal ANPP estimates with acceptable accuracy.

AB Human population and urbanization is unprecedented in its rate of growth and geographic scope. With the help of humans, exotic species have piggybacked their way to distant lands, which in combination with the loss of endemic native species, has led to the convergence of biological communities toward common and ubiquitous forms. However, the extent to which this "biotic homogenization" varies along gradients of human population size and urbanization remains mostly unexplored, especially at broad spatial scales. The present paper combines a recent conceptual model of homogenization with estimates of species invasions and extinctions to provide the first estimates of homogenization for five major taxonomic groups - land birds, freshwater fish, terrestrial mammals, plants, and freshwater reptiles and amphibians - at the continental-scale of North America (exclusive of Mexico). On average, the greatest levels of biotic homogenization were predicted for plants (22%) and fishes (14%), followed by reptiles/amphibians (12%), mammals (9%) and birds (8%). Substantial spatial variation in predictions of community similarity exists and emphasize that the outcome of species invasions and extinctions may not only increase community similarity, but may also decrease it (i.e., differentiation). Homogenization is predicted to be greatest for fish in southwestern and northeastern US, highest in eastern North America for plants, greatest for birds and mammals along the west coast of North America, and peak in southern US for reptiles and amphibians. We show that predicted change in community similarity for all taxonomic groups is positively related to human population size and urbanization, thus providing the first quantitative linkage between human population geography and homogenization for a number of major taxonomic groups at the continental-scale of North America. Our study helps identify regional hotspots of biotic homogenization across North America, thus setting the stage for future studies where more directed investigations of biotic homogenization along urban gradients can be conducted.

AB Postcopulatory processes might play an important role in sexual selection. In theory, fertilization success could be controlled by females via selection of particular sperm within their reproductive tract, or it could be determined by sperm competition per se. In practice, these two mechanisms are difficult to disentangle. To assess the relative importance of both mechanisms we used artificial insemination in combination with measurements of sperm quality (swimming speed and motility) in mallards. In this species, females often lack behavioral control over copulations and hence may use postcopulatory mechanisms to optimize their reproductive output. One important factor affecting female fitness may be selection of genetically compatible males. To investigate the influence of sperm quality and parental relatedness on paternity we inseminated 12 groups of related females with a sperm mixture containing equal numbers of sperm from a brother and from an unrelated male. Paternity was independent of the relatedness of the siting male to the female but was significantly affected by long-term sperm swimming speed and motility. No interaction between relatedness and sperm quality on paternity was observed. These results suggest that female mallards are not able to select sperm on a purely genetic basis and emphasize the importance of sperm quality in gaining paternity.

AB Human social organization can deeply affect levels of genetic diversity. This fact implies that genetic information can be used to study social structures, which is the basis of ethnogenetics. Recently, methods have been developed to extract this information from genetic data gathered from subdivided populations that have gone through recent spatial expansions, which is typical of most human populations. Here, we perform a Bayesian analysis of mitochondrial and Y chromosome diversity in three matrilocal and three patrilocal groups from northern Thailand to infer the number of males and females arriving in these populations each generation and to estimate the age of their range expansion. We find that the number of male immigrants is 8 times smaller in patrilocal populations than in matrilocal populations, whereas women move 2.5 times more in patrilocal populations than in matrilocal populations. In addition to providing genetic quantification of sex-specific dispersal rates in human populations, we show that although men and women are exchanged at a similar rate between matrilocal populations, there are far fewer men than women moving into patrilocal populations. This finding is compatible with the hypothesis that men are strictly controlling male immigration and promoting female immigration in patrilocal populations and that immigration is much less regulated in matrilocal populations.

AB The nutritional and social conditions that individuals experience during early development can have profound effects on their morphology, physiology, behaviour and life history. Experimental increases in brood size in birds can result in reduced offspring condition and survival, indicating that developmental deficits in enlarged broods have negative fitness consequences within the affected generation. To study long-term effects (i.e. transgenerational effects of developmental stress), we conducted a two-step breeding experiment in which we manipulated early developmental conditions in zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata. We raised zebra finches by manipulating brood sizes and controlled for maternal and genetic effects by cross-fostering. In a previous study, we showed that offspring condition and body size decreased with increasing brood size. Here we show that this effect was carried over to the next generation. Body size in nestlings and at nutritional independence was affected by the brood size in which the mothers were raised. Female offspring did significantly worse than male offspring when the mother had been raised in large broods, suggesting a sex-specific influence of maternal effects. These findings link early developmental stress in females with the phenotype of the next generation via maternal effects.

AB By comparing the population frequency distributions for specific somatic energy between samplings using quantile-quantile (QQ) plots, we tested for energy-related mortality of juvenile (2- and 3-year-old) Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) sampled at monthly intervals throughout three consecutive winters in a Norwegian river located at 70degreesN. Between several of the sampling periods, changes in the distributions of specific energy were observed corresponding to removal of low-energy individuals. By using energetic modelling we demonstrated that metabolic processes or feeding could not be responsible for the shifts in the shape of the energy distributions and that negative-energy-dependent mortality was the most likely explanation for the observations. No changes in mean size of the fish or in the shape of the size distributions were observed between successive sampling periods, indicating that mortality was linked to levels of storage energy rather than to body size per se. Our study indicated a critical body energy level for survival of juvenile salmon at approximately 4400-4800 J(.)g(-1), corresponding to a depletion of storage lipids.

AB Temporal variability of the biomass of individual populations and total community biomass were studied in a species rich meadow (35-40 species 0.25 m(-2) plot). Communities were experimentally subjected to fertilization and removal of the dominant Molinia caerulea in a factorial design. The typical dominance structure, with few dominants and many subordinate species, developed in all the treatments. Variability was measured by the coefficient of variation between years, from the fifth to the eighth year of the experiment (to avoid the initial response to the manipulations). Dominant removal increased the diversity measured by the reciprocal of the Simpson index, while fertilization decreased both species number and diversity and also caused a shift in community composition. The variability of both the total community and of individual species was higher in the fertilized plots. The coefficient of variation decreased with species mean biomass in all the plots. In non-fertilized plots, the dominant species had lower variability than total biomass. The biomass values of individual species fluctuated in a concordant manner over the years (i.e. were positively correlated). All of these factors will decrease the strength of the expected portfolio effect. It is argued that the effect of environmental productivity on variability is more pronounced than the effect of diversity.

AB To examine the relations between fish community function and stream size, we classified 429 lotic freshwater fish species based on multiple categories within six species traits: (1) substrate preference, (2) geomorphic preference, (3) trophic ecology, (4) locomotion morphology, (5) reproductive strategy, and (6) stream size preference. Stream size categories included small streams, small, medium, and large rivers, and no size preference. The frequencies of each species trait category were determined for each stream size category based on life history information from the literature. Cluster analysis revealed the presence of covarying groups of species trait categories. One cluster (RUN) included the traits of planktivore and herbivore feeding ecology, migratory reproductive behavior and broadcast spawning, preferences for main-channel habitats, and a lack of preferences for substrate type. The frequencies of classifications for the RUN cluster varied significantly across stream size categories (P = 0.009), being greater for large rivers than for small streams and rivers. Another cluster (RIFFLE) included the traits of invertivore feeding ecology, simple nester reproductive behavior, a preference for riffles, and a preference for bedrock, boulder, and cobble-rubble substrate. No significant differences in the frequency of classifications among stream size categories were detected for the RIFFLE cluster (P = 0.328). Our results suggest that fish community function is structured by large-scale differences in habitat and is different for large rivers than for small streams and rivers. Our findings support theoretical predictions of variation in species traits among stream reaches based on ecological frameworks such as landscape filters, habitat templates, and the river continuum concept. We believe that the species trait classifications presented here provide an opportunity for further examination of fish species' relations to physical, chemical, and biological factors in lotic habitats ranging from small streams to large rivers.

AB Phylogeographic analyses of the fauna of the Australian wet tropics rainforest have provided strong evidence for long-term isolation of populations among allopatric refugia, yet typically there is no corresponding divergence in morphology. This system provides an opportunity to examine the consequences of geographic isolation, independent of morphological divergence, and thus to assess the broader significance of historical subdivisions revealed through mitochondrial DNA phylogeography. We have located and characterized a zone of secondary contact between two long isolated (mtDNA divergence > 15%) lineages of the skink Carlia rubrigularis using one mitochondrial and eight nuclear (two intron, six microsatellite) markers. This revealed a remarkably narrow (width < 3 km) hybrid zone with substantial linkage disequilibrium and strong deficits of heterozygotes at two of three nuclear loci with diagnostic alleles. Cline centers were coincident across loci. Using a novel form of likelihood analysis, we were unable to distinguish between sigmoidal and stepped cline shapes except at one nuclear locus for which the latter was inferred. Given estimated dispersal rates of 90-133 m x gen(-1/2) and assuming equilibrium, the observed cline widths suggest effective selection against heterozygotes of at least 22-49% and possibly as high as 70%. These observations reveal substantial postmating isolation, although the absence of consistent deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at diagnostic loci suggests that there is little accompanying premating isolation. The tight geographic correspondence between transitions in mtDNA and those for nuclear genes and corresponding evidence for selection against hybrids indicates that these morphologically cryptic phylogroups could be considered as incipient species. Nonetheless, we caution against the use of mtDNA phylogeography as a sole criterion for defining species boundaries.

AB A major challenge in studies of habitat fragmentation is to determine the influence of patch quality and landscape context on patch use by animals. Few studies have simultaneously examined effects of patch (area, shape, and vegetation structure) and landscape (e.g., amount of arboreal vegetation in close proximity) on abundance patterns of animals. In this study, we examined how these characteristics influence bird species distribution and abundance in a pasture-dominated landscape in the Los Tuxtlas region of Veracruz, Mexico. We focused on three types of landscape elements: forest edge sites (n = 8), forest remnants (n = 8), and riparian forest remnants (n = 9). We quantified habitat use and community composition of birds by conducting seven counts of birds in each site between October 1996 and April 1997. Species typically restricted to forest were influenced by two patch-level factors, whereas species not so restricted were influenced by both patch- and landscape-level factors. At a community level, bird assemblages were more similar among sites within a given habitat type than among types, when all three landscape elements were analyzed simultaneously. Stepwise redundancy analyses showed that the amount of continuous forest within 500 m of the site edge and the amount of arboreal vegetation cover within 100 m and between 100 and 500 m of the edge were most influential in separating bird assemblages found in forest edge sites from those found in remnants. In a second redundancy analysis based only on remnants, two patch-level variables (shape and area) and one landscape variable (amount of continuous forest within 500 m) largely separated forest remnants from riparian remnants. To manage birds in the fragmented Los Tuxtlas landscape, large forest blocks should be conserved because certain birds rely on this habitat. Remnants of various shapes and sizes should be conserved because they may provide habitat for species that are somewhat tolerant of forest disturbance as well as generalist species.

AB While exotic plant invasions are thought to lead to declines in native species, the long-term impacts of such invasions on community structure are poorly known. Furthermore, it is unknown how exotic plant invasions compare to invasions by native species, We present data from 40 yr of continuous vegetation sampling of 10 fields released from agriculture to examine the effects of invasions on species richness. The effects of both exotic and native species invasions on species richness were largely driven by variations among fields with most species not significantly affecting species richness. However, invasion and dominance by the exotics Agropyron repens, Lonicera japonica, Rosa multiflora, Trifolium pratense and the native Solidago canadensis were associated with declines in richness. Invasions by exotic and native species during old field succession have similar effects on species richness with dominance by species of either group being associated with loss of species richness. Exotic species invasions tended to have stronger effects on richness than native invasions. No evidence was found of residual effects of invasions because the impacts of the invasion disappeared with the decline of the invading population. When pooled across species, heavy invasion by exotic species resulted in greater loss of species richness than invasion by native species. Studies of invasion that utilize multiple sites must account for variability among sites. In our study, had we not included field as a factor we would have incorrectly concluded that invasion consistently resulted in changes in species richness.

AB Little is known about the changes in microbial diversity associated with ecosystem development. We measured microbial heterotrophic evenness (a component of diversity) and other soil/humus properties (including basal respiration, substrate-induced respiration. pH. total C. N and P) at different stages in the development of five different ecosystems, with plant assemblages being used to define the phase in the successional sequence. Our objectives were to determine whether there were common patterns in establishment of microbial heterotrophic evenness with ecosystem development and whether changes in evenness were correlated to soil properties. Samples were collected from five sequences: Gisborne land slips (a chronosequence of re-vegetating landslip scars); Mount Tarawera (primary succession on aerially-deposited ash from a volcanic eruption); Rangitoto island (primary succession on a lava flow from a volcanic eruption); Franz Josef (primary succession initiated on gravels after the retreat of a glacier); and Swedish islands (a series of islands of differing size supporting different stages of plant succession). Heterotrophic diversity was measured using the catabolic response profile technique where CO2 efflux is measured during a 4-h incubation of samples amended with 25 different carbon substrates. Heterotrophic evenness was calculated from the CO2 responses using the Simpson-Yule index (maximum possible is 25). For Tarawera and Gisborne sequences. heterotrophic evenness was significantly lower at the first stage of succession (11.5 and 19.9, respectively), but subsequently plateaued, ranging between 21 and 23. Heterotrophic evenness declined significantly with succession at Rangitoto and Franz Josef sequences, but there was no trend along the Swedish island sequence. Despite the lack of a common pattern of heterotrophic evenness along all the sequences, there were significant linear correlations between heterotrophic evenness and basal respiration for Rangitoto (r = 0.52, P < 0.01), Gisbome (r = 0.88, P < 0.01) and the Swedish islands sequences (r = 0.52. P < 0.01), while the relationship was marginal at Franz Josef (r = 0.69. P < 0.06), but not significant at the Tarawera sequence. Plant evenness along two sequences (Rangitoto and Swedish islands) was not correlated with heterotrophic evenness. These data suggest that heterotrophic evenness re-establishes rapidly following major disturbance once organic matter inputs occur then subsequently declines. Patterns of change in heterotrophic evenness may, in part, be dependent on changes in the availability of organic carbon or resources to heterotrophs. <(c)> 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Swedish foresters are placing increasing reliance in burning of forestland and green tree retention, in order to enhance biodiversity in the Swedish boreal forests. However, much remains to be learned about how to optimise nature conservation goals by different logging and burning procedures. We monitored the survival of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi as mycorrhizas, at a clear-cut, a seed tree stand and an uncut stand of Scots pine in central Sweden, with and without burning at two levels of fire severity. The abundance of mycorrhizas and the EM fungal diversity declined with increased logging intensity and with increased depth of burn. Deep burning fires in combination with logging or fire-caused tree mortality can kill much of the existing EM community. Logging intensity, fire intensity and fire severity are all factors that can be manipulated, thus changing the effects on EM fungi and other soil biota. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Models of habitat associations for species often are developed with an implicit assumption that habitats are static, even though recent disturbance may have altered the landscape. We tested our hypothesis that trajectory and magnitude of habitat change influenced observed distribution and abundance of passerine birds breeding in shrubsteppe habitats of southwestern Idaho. Birds in this region live in dynamic landscapes undergoing predominantly large-scale, radical, and unidirectional habitat change because wildfires are converting shrublands into expanses of exotic annual grasslands. We used data from field surveys and satellite image analyses in a series of redundancy analyses to partition variances and to determine the relative contribution of habitat change and current landscapes. Although current habitats explained a greater proportion of total variation, changes in habitat and measures of habitat richness and texture also contributed to variation in abundance of Horned Larks (Eremophila alpestris), Brewer's Sparrows (Spizella breweri), and Sage Sparrows (Amphispiza belli). Abundance of birds was insensitive to scale for nonspatial habitat variables. In contrast, spatial measures of habitat richness and texture in the landscape were significant only at large spatial scales. Abundance of Horned Larks, Western Meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta), and Brewer's Sparrows, but not Sage Thrashers (Oreoscoptes montanus) or Sage Sparrows, was positively correlated with changes toward stable habitats. Because dominant habitat changes were toward less stable conditions, regional declines of those birds in shrubsteppe habitats reflect current landscapes as well as the history, magnitude, and trajectory of habitat change.

AB This research analyses the diatom asssemblages recorded from six UK coastal sites and relates these diatom assemblages to tidal levels. The relationship between diatom assemblages and tidal levels is examined statistically in order to develop a diatom-based tidal-level transfer function. The results suggest that there is highly significant correlation between the diatom assemblages and water levels from mean high water of neap tides to highest astronomical tide (p = 0.01, 99 random permutations). A weighted average (WA) transfer function is thus established, and the predictive ability of this transfer function is highly satisfactory. Finally, this transfer function is applied successfully to estimate palaeotidal-levels from fossil diatom data recorded in late Holocene coastal sequences. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa and is found in most major vegetation types, wherever permanent sources of water are available, making it physically able to disperse through a wide range of habitats. Despite this, the buffalo has been assumed to be strongly philopatric and to form large aggregations that remain within separate home ranges with little interchange between units, but the level of differentiation within the species is unknown. Genetic differences between populations were assessed using mitochondrial DNA (control region) sequence data and analysis of variation at six microsatellite loci among 11 localities in eastern and southern Africa. High levels of genetic variability were found, suggesting that reported severe population bottlenecks due to outbreak of rinderpest during the last century did not strongly reduce the genetic variability within the species. The high level of genetic variation within the species was found to be evenly distributed among populations and only at the continental level were we able to consistently detect significant differentiation, contrasting with the assumed philopatric behaviour of the buffalo. Results of mtDNA and microsatellite data were found to be congruent, disagreeing with the alleged male-biased dispersal. We propose that the observed pattern od: the distribution bf genetic variation between buffalo populations at the regional level can be caused by fragmentation of a previous panmictic population due to human activity, and at the continental level, reflects an effect of geographical distance between populations.

AB This paper questions whether bumblebees really forage as close to their nests as has commonly been assumed in the bumblebee literature. Three experiments are described that involved marking and reobservation bumblebees. None of these experiments showed any tendency for bumblebees to concentrate their foraging close to (e.g., within 50 m from) the nest. Rather, the results suggested that bumblebees may prefer to forage at some distance from their nest. Further, a closer review of the bumblebee literature showed that similar findings were quite common. Some possible explanations to the observed behavior patterns are given as outlines for further research.

AB Epiphytic, epilithic, and surface sediment diatom assemblages were identified and enumerated from 35 study ponds on Cape Herschel (78 degrees 37'N, 74 degrees 42'W), east-central Ellesmere Island, Canada. All the sites are shallow (maximum depth < 2 m), clear, oligotrophic, and freshwater. The ponds freeze completely for 10 months of the gear. Major ion concentrations are relatively similar among the 35 sites, although environmental gradients exist. Over 130 diatom taxa from 28 genera were identified in the periphyton samples. Marked differences in species composition were evident among the ponds. Moreover, many of the diatoms exhibited varying degrees of microhabitat specificity. Variance partitioning by canonical correspondence analysis showed that 26% of the total variance exhibited by diatom species composition could be accounted for by the measured environmental variables( i.e. 10.2% by habitat and 15.8% by water chemistry). Pondwater alkalinity best explained the distribution of taxa, and weighted averaging regression and calibration were used to develop a transfer function to infer pondwater alkalinity from the diatom assemblages. Other important environmental variables included [Na+] for the epilithic and [SiO2] for the epiphytic assemblages.

AB In three Mediterranean old fields, one, seven, and fifteen years after the last ploughing, small scale disturbances (0.25 m(2)) by contact herbicide associated or not with litter removal and scratching of the top 3 cm of the soil were generated in October 1988, December 1988, and March 1989. Subsequent changes in cover, species richness and composition were observed over the two following vegetation cycles (until May 1990), and compared to the dynamics in undisturbed samples. The identity of the colonizers for each disturbance date were compared to the soil readily-germinable seed content, sampled simultaneously to the disturbances.
   The species richness of the samples within the fields increased the first year after disturbance. Within-field heterogeneity for taxonomic composition was unchanged, but species turnover was increased by disturbances. The dynamics of richness and composition followed consistent patterns in the three fields. These patterns were strongly related to the seasonal rainfall distribution and clearly linked to the germination timings of the species and to seed bank composition. The identity of species depending on season and treatment were independent between fields. The effects of small scale disturbances on patterns of species establishments and replacements depended on their timings. Disrupting the dominance by autumn established gasses and legumes, they opened windows for germinations of annual forbs and for spring establishment of perennials. These species were otherwise present as understory species or in the seed bank.
   Results of these experiments provide insights into the mechanisms of maintenance of species diversity in this Mediterranean old field system. Asynchronous small-scale disturbances appear to be effective in maintaining diversity as a result from the interplay of differences in regeneration niches, lottery for establishment, and the incidence of different conditions in time and space.

AB The relative impacts of nutrient availability, disturbance intensity, and interspecific competition on species distribution and growth were studied by applying five levels of nutrients and five intensities of clipping to simple artificial communities (of Dactylis glomerata, Holcus lanatus, Lolium perenne, and Trifolium repens) in a factorial design for 16 mo. This was done to test the hypothesis that the effects of interspecific competition would decline along gradients as the amount of nutrients decreased and the degree of disturbance increased. Nutrients and disturbance, alone and in interaction, produced significant effects on percent cover of all species, and all species achieved maximum percent cover in the undisturbed regime. The experimental design permitted us to distinguish between percent cover reductions caused directly by nutrients and disturbance from those caused by interspecific competition. When grown in mixture, interspecific competition produced marked changes in the distribution patterns of percent cover that were in addition to the direct impacts of nutrients and disturbance. The absolute reduction in percent cover due to interspecific competition was greatest in the undisturbed regime, and for many mixtures this competitive effect was significantly reduced or even eliminated in the highly disturbed areas. Along the nutrient gradient the responses were variable and neighbor dependent, but for all species, the absolute reduction in percent cover due to interspecific competition was generally most severe where percent cover in pure stands was highest.
   When the data were standardized for differences in percent cover in pure stands and competition was assessed as the percent reduction in percent cover between pure and mixed stands, then the effect of interspecific competition on Trifolium declined along both gradients. The three grasses had a reasonably constant competitive effect across the disturbance gradient, but along the nutrient gradient the highest competitive effects were generally achieved where percent cover in pure stands was highest. We argue that this standardized index is less appropriate because it obscures the obvious differences in interspecific competition effects that are clearly operating within these communities.

AB Keywords
   Economic complexity involves the use of machine learning and network techniques to predict and explain the economic trajectories of countries, cities and regions. Measures of relatedness - which estimate the affinity between economies and activities - anticipate changes in specialization patterns and explain labour market outcomes, such as income loss and unemployment. Economic complexity measures are reduced-dimensionality representations of specialization matrices that explain the geography of hundreds of economic activities. Measures of economic complexity explain and predict international and regional variations in income, economic growth, income inequality, gender inequality and greenhouse emissions. Economic complexity methods have been validated by studies at multiple geographic scales (from countries to cities) and a variety of economic activities (products, industries, occupations, patents, research papers). Relatedness metrics can be unpacked into multiple channels (such as industry, occupation and location-specific knowledge) to understand the drivers of regional diversification.
   Economic complexity methods predict changes in the geography of economic activities and explain differences in economic growth, inequality, greenhouse emissions and labour market outcomes. This Review summarizes a decade of research on economic complexity and its applications.
   Economic complexity methods have become popular tools in economic geography, international development and innovation studies. Here, I review economic complexity theory and applications, with a particular focus on two streams of literature: the literature on relatedness, which focuses on the evolution of specialization patterns, and the literature on metrics of economic complexity, which uses dimensionality reduction techniques to create metrics of economic sophistication that are predictive of variations in income, economic growth, emissions and income inequality.

AB Aim The EUNIS Habitat Classification is a widely used reference framework for European habitat types (habitats), but it lacks formal definitions of individual habitats that would enable their unequivocal identification. Our goal was to develop a tool for assigning vegetation-plot records to the habitats of the EUNIS system, use it to classify a European vegetation-plot database, and compile statistically-derived characteristic species combinations and distribution maps for these habitats. Location Europe. Methods We developed the classification expert system EUNIS-ESy, which contains definitions of individual EUNIS habitats based on their species composition and geographic location. Each habitat was formally defined as a formula in a computer language combining algebraic and set-theoretic concepts with formal logical operators. We applied this expert system to classify 1,261,373 vegetation plots from the European Vegetation Archive (EVA) and other databases. Then we determined diagnostic, constant and dominant species for each habitat by calculating species-to-habitat fidelity and constancy (occurrence frequency) in the classified data set. Finally, we mapped the plot locations for each habitat. Results Formal definitions were developed for 199 habitats at Level 3 of the EUNIS hierarchy, including 25 coastal, 18 wetland, 55 grassland, 43 shrubland, 46 forest and 12 man-made habitats. The expert system classified 1,125,121 vegetation plots to these habitat groups and 73,188 to other habitats, while 63,064 plots remained unclassified or were classified to more than one habitat. Data on each habitat were summarized in factsheets containing habitat description, distribution map, corresponding syntaxa and characteristic species combination. Conclusions EUNIS habitats were characterized for the first time in terms of their species composition and distribution, based on a classification of a European database of vegetation plots using the newly developed electronic expert system EUNIS-ESy. The data provided and the expert system have considerable potential for future use in European nature conservation planning, monitoring and assessment.

AB Transitioning agriculture toward greater sustainability is vital. This Perspective argues for more-holistic consideration of organic agriculture in life cycle assessments, widely used to analyse environmental impacts.
   The environmental effects of agriculture and food are much discussed, with competing claims concerning the impacts of conventional and organic farming. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is the method most widely used to assess environmental impacts of agricultural products. Current LCA methodology and studies tend to favour high-input intensive agricultural systems and misrepresent less intensive agroecological systems such as organic agriculture. LCA assesses agroecological systems inadequately for three reasons: (1) a lack of operational indicators for three key environmental issues; (2) a narrow perspective on functions of agricultural systems; and (3) inconsistent modelling of indirect effects.

AB Hybridization between naturally co-occurring species that normally do not interbreed is being documented following anthropogenic habitat modifications for an increasing number of taxa. Here, we evaluate the mechanisms by which disturbance promotes hybridization and highlight the utility of human-caused hybridization for understanding evolution. Monitoring hybridization dynamics before, and following, disturbance over multiple timescales offers a unique opportunity to understand how disturbances alter species interactions and to pinpoint the mechanisms that cause species barriers to fail. Identifying the conditions promoting hybridization in disturbed habitats, the generality of these conditions across taxa, and the taxa most affected by human-mediated change is critical for furthering our understanding of human impacts on evolution and for informing management.

AB Reticulate species evolution, such as hybridization or introgression, is relatively common in nature. In the presence of reticulation, species relationships can be captured by a rooted phylogenetic network, and orthologous gene evolution can be modeled as bifurcating gene trees embedded in the species network. We present a Bayesian approach to jointly infer species networks and gene trees from multilocus sequence data. A novel birth-hybridization process is used as the prior for the species network, and we assume a multispecies network coalescent prior for the embedded gene trees. We verify the ability of our method to correctly sample from the posterior distribution, and thus to infer a species network, through simulations. To quantify the power of our method, we reanalyze two large data sets of genes from spruces and yeasts. For the three closely related spruces, we verify the previously suggested homoploid hybridization event in this clade; for the yeast data, we find extensive hybridization events. Our method is available within the BEAST 2 add-on SpeciesNetwork, and thus provides an extensible framework for Bayesian inference of reticulate evolution.

AB Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) opens a new perspective on the monitoring of vegetation photosynthesis from space, and has been recently used to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP). However, previous studies on SIF were mainly based on satellite observations from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2), and the evaluation of these coarse-resolution SIF measurements using GPP derived from eddy covariance (EC) flux towers has been hindered by the scale mismatch between satellite and tower footprints. We use new far-red SIF observations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) with much finer spatial resolution and GPP data from EC flux towers from 2014 to 2016 to examine the relationship between GPP and SIF for temperate forests. The OCO-2 SIF tracked tower GPP well, and had strong correlation with tower GPP at both retrieval bands (757 nm and 771 nm) and both instantaneous (mid-day) and daily timescales, with the strongest relationship for the 757 nm band (SIF757) at the daily timescale. Daily SIF757 exhibited much stronger correlation with tower GPP compared to the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based on the surface reflectance product derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard either Terra or Aqua satellite and had a similarly strong relationship as EVI based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) corrected reflectance product (MCD43A4) based on data from both Terra and Aqua. Absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) explained 85% of the variance in SIF757, while the product of APAR and two environmental scalars - fT(min) and fVPD (representing minimum temperature stress and water stress) explained higher variance (92%) in SIF757. This suggests that SIF mainly depends on APAR and is also affected by environmental stresses that determine photosynthetic light use efficiency. The BRDF-corrected EVI also has advantages over SIF in that EVI has spatially and temporally continuous coverage and has a much longer record (2000-present). The OCO-2 SIF757 estimated GPP well (R-2 = 0.81, p < 0.0001; RMSE = 1.11 gC m(-2) d(-1)), and its performance was comparable to or slightly better than that of the MODIS GPP algorithm, a GPP model based on the light use efficiency logic. With intensive OCO-2 observations acquired in the Target mode around Park Falls, a calibration/validation site for OCO-2, we also generated gridded SIF and then estimated GPP on a per-pixel basis at the landscape scale. Our findings demonstrate the strong ability of chlorophyll fluorescence observed by OCO-2 in estimating GPP for temperate forests and reveal its potential and limitations in future ecosystem functioning and carbon cycling studies.

AB Invasive alien species are a major problem for managers of protected areas (PAs) worldwide. Until the 1980s biological invasions were widely considered to be largely confined to anthropogenically disturbed sites and the widespread disruption of ecosystems in PAs by invasive species was not globally perceived as a major threat. A working group of the SCOPE program on biological invasions in the 1980s showed that PAs are not spared from major disruptive effects of invasions. Early research focused on descriptive studies of the extent to which PAs were invaded. More recent research explored drivers of invasion, and in the last decade much work has focused on understanding the impacts of invasions. We review the current understanding of alien plant invasions in PAs, focusing on four themes: (1) the status and macroecological patterns of alien plant invasions; (2) the threats that invasive alien plants (IAPs) pose and the impacts detected to date; (3) the current focus of invasion science in PAs; and (4) research priorities for advancing science-based management and policy. Of a sample of 59 widespread IAP species from a representative sample of 135 PAs globally, trees make up the largest proportion (32%), followed by perennial herbs (17%) and shrubs (15%). About 1857 papers have been published on alien species in PAs; 45% have focused on alien plants. Some textbook examples of impacts by IAPs originate from PAs, illustrating the severe threat to the core function of PAs. Impacts have been quantified at the species and community levels through the displacement and alteration of habitats. In some cases, native species abundance, diversity and estimated species richness have been altered, but reversed following control. At an ecosystem level, invasive plants have radically altered fire regimes in several PAs, in some cases causing regime shifts and transforming woodlands or savannas to grasslands. Invasions have also had a major impact on nutrient cycles. Protected areas are performing an increasingly important part of the global response to stem the rate of environmental change. Despite this, integrated efforts involving science, management and policy that are sufficiently resourced to generate insights on the status and dynamics of IAPs in PAs are insufficient or even lacking. Such efforts are needed to pave the way for monitoring trends, revising legislation and policies, and improving management interventions to reduce the extent and magnitude of impacts of invasive plants in PAs. While policy instruments to support management of non-native species date back to the 1930s, there has been a substantial increase in legislative support and general awareness since the early 2000s. Still, opportunities to improve research for PAs need to be created. Towards this goal, the establishment of a global PA research network could provide a unique vehicle to explore questions across species or functional groups and systems, at a scale currently beyond existing abilities. Developing an integrated global database with standardized, quantitative information could form part of such a networks function.

AB Macroecology and biogeography are concerned with understanding biodiversity patterns across space and time. In the past, the two disciplines have addressed this question mainly with correlative approaches, despite frequent calls for more mechanistic explanations. Recent advances in computational power, theoretical understanding, and statistical tools are, however, currently facilitating the development of more system-oriented, mechanistic models. We review these models, identify different model types and theoretical frameworks, compare their processes and properties, and summarize emergent findings. We show that ecological (physiology, demographics, dispersal, biotic interactions) and evolutionary processes, as well as environmental and human-induced drivers, are increasingly modelled mechanistically; and that new insights into biodiversity dynamics emerge from these models. Yet, substantial challenges still lie ahead for this young research field. Among these, we identify scaling, calibration, validation, and balancing complexity as pressing issues. Moreover, particular process combinations are still understudied, and so far models tend to be developed for specific applications. Future work should aim at developing more flexible and modular models that not only allow different ecological theories to be expressed and contrasted, but which are also built for tight integration with all macroecological data sources. Moving the field towards such a systems macroecology' will test and improve our understanding of the causal pathways through which eco-evolutionary processes create diversity patterns across spatial and temporal scales.

AB Species diversity promotes the delivery of multiple ecosystem functions (multifunctionality). However, the relative functional importance of rare and common species in driving the biodiversity multifunctionality relationship remains unknown. We studied the relationship between the diversity of rare and common species (according to their local abundances and across nine different trophic groups), and multifunctionality indices derived from 14 ecosystem functions on 150 grasslands across a land use intensity (LUI) gradient. The diversity of above- and below-ground rare species had opposite effects, with rare above-ground species being associated with high levels of multifunctionality, probably because their effects on different functions did not trade off against each other. Conversely, common species were only related to average, not high, levels of multifunctionality, and their functional effects declined with LUI. Apart from the community level effects of diversity, we found significant positive associations between the abundance of individual species and multifunctionality in 6% of the species tested. Species specific functional effects were best predicted by their response to LUI: species that declined in abundance with land use intensification were those associated with higher levels of multifunctionality. Our results highlight the importance of rare species for ecosystem multifunctionality and help guiding future conservation priorities.

AB Natural disturbances such as wildfires cause significant alterations to the structure and functioning of semi-arid ecosystems. After such disturbances, the recovery of the soil ecosystem as a whole, and more specifically the belowground microbial communities, is poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to (a) assess the short, medium and long term changes in soil physicochemical and microbiological indicators and indices after a wildfire in a semi-arid environment, (b) analyse the key relationships of multiple soil parameters and indices, and (c) identify the most suitable indicators of post-fire recovery. The study was conducted across a wildfire chronosequence spanning sites recently burnt (three months) through to 14 years after fire in a semi-arid hummock grassland ecosystem of northern Western Australia. Immediate effects of the fire on the soil system were evident with increases in pH, electrical conductivity, and available nutrients. These chemical indicators showed a strong correlation with fire age and were consistent in the direction of change. Variations in the microbial composition were apparent one year after the fire, with a higher proportional abundance of bacterial communities. The fungi to bacteria ratio and the microbial quotient (proportion of microbial C to total organic C) proved to be significant indices to reflect the recovery of soils in these semi-arid environments. Overall, this study highlights the importance of understanding the post-fire response of belowground ecosystems, and particularly changes and recovery of soil microbial communities, at different time periods. The approach and methods followed in this research can be effectively extrapolated to other areas. This study can be used to inform better soil management of degraded systems in a rapidly changing climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In humans and other animals, harsh circumstances in early life predict morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Multiple adverse conditions are thought to be especially toxic, but this hypothesis has rarely been tested in a prospective, longitudinal framework, especially in long-lived mammals. Here we use prospective data on 196 wild female baboons to show that cumulative early adversity predicts natural adult lifespan. Females who experience >= 3 sources of early adversity die a median of 10 years earlier than females who experience <= 1 adverse circumstances (median lifespan is 18.5 years). Females who experience the most adversity are also socially isolated in adulthood, suggesting that social processes partially explain the link between early adversity and adult survival. Our results provide powerful evidence for the developmental origins of health and disease and indicate that close ties between early adversity and survival arise even in the absence of health habit and health care-related explanations.

AB The rhizosphere microbiome offers a range of ecosystem services to the plant, including nutrient acquisition and tolerance to (a)biotic stress. Here, analysing the data by Mendes etal. (2011), we show that short heat disturbances (50 or 80 degrees C, 1h) of a soil suppressive to the root pathogenic fungus Rhizoctonia solani caused significant increase in alpha diversity of the rhizobacterial community and led to partial or complete loss of disease protection. A reassembly model is proposed where bacterial families that are heat tolerant and have high growth rates significantly increase in relative abundance after heat disturbance, while temperature-sensitive and slow-growing bacteria have a disadvantage. The results also pointed to a potential role of slow-growing, heat-tolerant bacterial families from Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria phyla in plant disease protection. In conclusion, short heat disturbance of soil results in rearrangement of rhizobacterial communities and this is correlated with changes in the ecosystem service disease suppression.

AB AimTo assess the effects of climate change, past land uses and physiography on the current position of the tree line in the Catalan Pyrenees and its dynamics between 1956 and 2006.
   LocationMore than 1000 linear kilometres of sub-alpine tree line in the Catalan Pyrenees (north-east Spain)
   MethodsUsing aerial photographs and supervised classification, we reclassified the images into a binary raster with tree' and non-tree' values, and determined canopy cover in 1956 and 2006. We then determined the change in position of the tree line between 1956 and 2006 based on changes in forest cover. We used the distance from the position of the tree line in 1956 to the theoretical potential tree line - determined from interpretation of aerial photographs, identifying the highest old remnants of forest for homogeneous areas of the landscape in terms of bioclimatic conditions, bedrock, landform and exposure - as a surrogate of intensity of past land uses.
   ResultsOur analyses showed that the Pyrenean tree line has moved upwards on average almost 40m (mean advanceSE: 35.3 +/- 0.5m, P<0.001), although in most cases it has remained unchanged (61.8%) or advanced moderately, i.e. between 25 and 100m (23.7%); only 9.2% of the locations have advanced more than 100m. Upward shifts of the tree line were significantly larger in locations heavily modified in the past by anthropogenic disturbance (mean advance 50.8 +/- 1.1m) compared with near natural tree line locations (19.7 +/- 0.8m, P<0.001), where the mean displacement was much lower than expected and was not related to changes in temperature along the study period.
   Main conclusionsOur results stress the impact of the cessation of human activity in driving forest dynamics at the tree line in the Catalan Pyrenees, and reveal a very low or even negligible signal of climate change in the study area.

AB Manufacturing affects all three dimensions of sustainability: economy, environment, and society. This paper addresses the last of these dimensions. It explores social impacts identified by national level social indicators, frameworks, and principles. The effects of manufacturing on social performance are framed for different stakeholder groups with associated social needs. Methodology development as well as various challenges for social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) are further examined. Efforts to integrate social and another dimension of sustainability are considered, with attention to globalization challenges, including offshoring and reshoring.

AB Understanding whether tree growth is limited by carbon gain (source limitation) or by the direct effect of environmental factors such as water deficit or temperature (sink limitation) is crucial for improving projections of the effects of climate change on forest productivity. We studied the relationships between tree basal area (BA) variations, eddy covariance carbon fluxes, predawn water potential ((pd)) and temperature at different timescales using an 8-yr dataset and a rainfall exclusion experiment in a Quercus ilex Mediterranean coppice. At the daily timescale, during periods of low temperature (<5 degrees C) and high water deficit (<-1.1MPa), gross primary productivity and net ecosystem productivity remained positive whereas the stem increment was nil. Thus, stem increment appeared limited by drought and temperature rather than by carbon input. Annual growth was accurately predicted by the duration of BA increment during spring (t(t0-t1)). The onset of growth (t(0)) was related to winter temperatures and the summer interruption of growth (t(1)) to a threshold (pd) value of -1.1MPa. We suggest that using environmental drivers (i.e. drought and temperature) to predict stem growth phenology can contribute to an improvement in vegetation models and may change the current projections of Mediterranean forest productivity under climate change scenarios.

AB Diverse microbial consortia profoundly influence animal biology, necessitating an understanding of microbiome variation in studies of animal adaptation. Yet, little is known about such variability among fish, in spite of their importance in aquatic ecosystems. The Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata, is an intriguing candidate to test microbiome-related hypotheses on the drivers and consequences of animal adaptation, given the recent parallel origins of a similar ecotype across streams. To assess the relationships between the microbiome and host adaptation, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize gut bacteria of two guppy ecotypes with known divergence in diet, life history, physiology and morphology collected from low-predation (LP) and high-predation (HP) habitats in four Trinidadian streams. Guts were populated by several recurring, core bacteria that are related to other fish associates and rarely detected in the environment. Although gut communities of lab-reared guppies differed from those in the wild, microbiome divergence between ecotypes from the same stream was evident under identical rearing conditions, suggesting host genetic divergence can affect associations with gut bacteria. In the field, gut communities varied over time, across streams and between ecotypes in a stream-specific manner. This latter finding, along with PICRUSt predictions of metagenome function, argues against strong parallelism of the gut microbiome in association with LP ecotype evolution. Thus, bacteria cannot be invoked in facilitating the heightened reliance of LP guppies on lower-quality diets. We argue that the macroevolutionary microbiome convergence seen across animals with similar diets may be a signature of secondary microbial shifts arising some time after host-driven adaptation.

AB Metabolic rates can vary as much as threefold among individuals of the same size and age in a population, but why such variation persists is unclear given that they determine the energetic cost of living. Relationships between standard metabolic rate (SMR), growth and survival can vary with environmental conditions, suggesting that the fitness consequences of a given metabolic phenotype may be context-dependent. Less attention has focused on the link between absolute aerobic scope (AS, the difference between standard and maximum metabolic rate) and fitness under different environmental conditions, despite the importance of aerobic scope to an organism's total energetic capacity. We examined the links between individual variation in both SMR and AS and somatic growth rates of brown trout (Salmo trutta) under different levels of food availability. Standard metabolic rate and AS were uncorrelated across individuals. However, SMR and AS not only had interactive effects on growth, but these interactions depended on food level: at ad libitum food levels, AS had a positive effect on growth whose magnitude depended on SMR; at intermediate food levels, AS and SMR had interactive effects on growth, but at the low food level, there was no effect of either AS or SMR on growth. As a result, there was no metabolic phenotype that performed best or worst across all food levels. These results demonstrate the importance of aerobic scope in explaining somatic growth rates and support the hypothesis that links between individual variation in metabolism and fitness are context-dependent. The larger metabolic phenotype and the environmental context in which performance is evaluated both need to be considered in order to better understand the link between metabolic rates and fitness and thereby the persistence of individual variation in metabolic rates.

AB Theory predicts that native plant species should exhibit latitudinal gradients in the strength of their interactions with herbivores. We hypothesize that if an invasive plant species exhibits a different latitudinal gradient in response to herbivores (e.g., a nonparallel gradient), it can create large-scale heterogeneities in community resistance/susceptibility to the invasive species. We conducted a study of latitudinal variation in the strength of herbivory and defenses of native genotypes of Phragmites australis in North America (NA) and Europe (EU) and European invasive genotypes in NA. Within NA, we tested whether (1) invasive genotypes are better defended and suffer less herbivory than co-occurring native genotypes, (2) herbivory and defenses of native P. australis decreases with increasing latitude; and (3) invasive genotypes exhibit either no latitudinal gradient, or a nonparallel latitudinal gradient in herbivory and defenses compared to native genotypes. For the European genotypes, we tested two additional hypotheses: (4) defenses, nutritional condition, and herbivory would differ between the native (EU) and invasive ranges (NA) and (5) latitudinal gradients in defenses and herbivory would be similar between ranges. Within NA, chewing damage, internal stem-feeding incidence, and aphid abundance were 650%, 300%, and 70% lower, respectively, on invasive than native P. australis genotypes. Genotypes in NA also differed in nutritional condition (percent N, C:N ratio), but there was little support for invasive genotypes being better defended than native genotypes. For the European genotypes, herbivory was significantly lower in the invaded than native range, supporting the enemy-release hypothesis. Defense levels (leaf toughness and total phenolics) and tissue percent C and percent N were higher in the invaded than native range for European genotypes. Overall, latitudinal gradients in P. australis nutritional condition, defenses, and herbivory were common. Interestingly, chewing damage and stem-feeder incidence decreased with latitude for native P. australis genotypes in NA and EU, but no latitudinal gradients in response to herbivores were evident for invasive genotypes in NA. Nonparallel latitudinal gradients in herbivory between invasive and native P. australis suggest that the community may be more susceptible to invasion at lower than at higher latitudes. Our study points to the need for invasion biology to include a biogeographic perspective.

AB Mate choice is an important evolutionary process influencing a vast array of traits and ecological processes. Although the study of mate choice has proved to be hugely popular, the number of ways in which mate choice can be described is complex and a bewildering array of terminology has developed. The author begins by summarizing some examples of the range of terms used to describe choice that expose this complexity. The author then shows how the information conveyed by different mate choice descriptors can be better understood by comparison to null expectations, that is, the expected variation in a trait when mate choice is not expressed. This comparison is important because many traits that might be affected by mate choice, such as mating rate, mate search effort, and responsiveness, also vary in non-choosy individuals. This is in contrast to other traits, such as the slope of a preference function and mate assessment effort, for which null expectations are predictable. By understanding the null expectation for a trait, its utility as a descriptor of mate choice can be gauged. From this basis, the author suggests an alternative approach to the description of mate choice based upon a principle of describing variation in both "what" is preferred and "by how much" it is preferred. Crucially, the author describes how this approach might apply to a wide range of preference function shapes, thus aiding comparisons across taxa. Finally, the author considers how an improved appreciation of the way mate choice is described can inform future research.

AB Over 2000 surface, ground and raw drinking water samples have been analyzed in the frame of different monitoring projects in Hungary and watercourses in neighboring countries between 1990 and 2015. Effects of pesticide contamination on ecological farming and drinking water supply have been assessed. Main water pollutant ingredients of agricultural origin in Hungary are herbicides related to maize production. After EU pesticide re-registration, diazinon, atrazine, and trifluralin gradually disappeared as contaminants. High levels of water soluble pollutants (e.g., acetochlor) in surface water result in temporarily enhanced levels in raw drinking water as well. Extreme levels observed for herbicide residues were of agrochemical industrial origin.

AB Climate change has been shown to cause poleward range shifts of species. These shifts are typically demonstrated using presence-absence data, which can mask the potential changes in the abundance of species. Moreover, changes in the mean centre of weighted density of species are seldom examined, and comparisons between these two methods are even rarer. Here, we studied the change in the mean weighted latitude of density (MWLD) of 94 bird species in Finland, northern Europe, using data covering a north-south gradient of over 1000km from the 1970s to the 2010s. The MWLD shifted northward on average 1.26kmyr(-1), and this shift was significantly stronger in northern species compared to southern species. These shifts can be related to climate warming during the study period, because the annual temperature had increased more in northern Finland (by 1.7 degrees C) than in southern Finland (by 1.4 degrees C), although direct causal links cannot be shown. Density shifts of species distributed over the whole country did not differ from shifts in species situated on the edge of the species range in southern and northern species. This means that density shifts occur both in the core and on the edge of species distribution. The species-specific comparison of MWLD values with corresponding changes in the mean weighted latitude using presence-absence atlas data (MWL) revealed that the MWLD moved more slowly than the MWL in the atlas data in the southern species examined, but more rapidly in the northern species. Our findings highlight that population densities are also moving rapidly towards the poles and the use of presence-absence data can mask the shift of population densities. We encourage use of abundance data in studies considering the effects of climate change on biodiversity.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) and heterotrophic bacteria are highly diverse components of the ocean system, and their interactions are key in regulating the biogeochemical cycles of major elements. How chemical and phylogenetic diversity are linked remains largely unexplored to date. To investigate interactions between bacterial diversity and DOM, we followed the response of natural bacterial communities to two sources of phytoplankton-derived DOM over six bacterial generation times in continuous cultures. Analyses of total hydrolysable neutral sugars and amino acids, and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry revealed large differences in the chemical composition of the two DOM sources. According to 454 pyrosequences of 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid genes, diatom-derived DOM sustained higher levels of bacterial richness, evenness and phylogenetic diversity than cyanobacteria-derived DOM. These distinct community structures were, however, not associated with specific taxa. Grazing pressure affected bacterial community composition without changing the overall pattern of bacterial diversity levels set by DOM. Our results demonstrate that resource composition can shape several facets of bacterial diversity without influencing the phylogenetic composition of bacterial communities, suggesting functional redundancy at different taxonomic levels for the degradation of phytoplankton-derived DOM.

AB Elevational trends in the ecology of macroorganisms have been studied extensively; by contrast very little is known of such trends in microbial diversity. Previous studies on soil bacteria have found either a diversity decline, a 'peak' in mid altitudes, or no trend with increasing elevation. Here we studied bacterial diversity and community composition in relation to elevation on Mt. Halla, Jeju Island, South Korea, a massive shield volcano. Samples were taken along two transects, from 100 m.a.s.l. to the summit at 1950 m.a.s.l., at elevational intervals of 200 m. PCR-amplified soil DNA for the bacterial 16S rRNA gene targeting V1 to V3 region was 454-pyrosequenced, and taxonomically classified against EzTaxon-e database.
   Elevation was the best predictor of variation in bacterial community composition along the two transects, even when considering other soil parameters. Elevation was itself highly correlated with mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP), suggesting that soil bacterial community composition On Mt. Haifa is more strongly affected by climate than by geochemical or soil textural factors. The two transects showed certain consistent differences in bacterial phyla composition, with one transect having significantly higher abundance of Planctomycetes and Gemmatimonadetes than the other. Certain other phyla (e.g. Acidobacteria) also showed striking trends in abundance with elevation, but the trends differed between the two transects.
   Bacterial diversity and richness were also most strongly correlated with elevation, MAT and MAP, although soil pH explained a part of the variation. Moreover, vegetation cover type, irrespective of elevation, had an effect on soil bacterial diversity and richness. We found a 'dip' in diversity at lower mid elevations (700-1300 m) in both transects; a trend which has not been found before. Our results, when compared with other studies, emphasize that no simple rule can be applied to mountain systems in general, but that climate itself is a major influence on community composition.

AB Smartphones and their apps (application software) are now used by millions of people worldwide and represent a powerful combination of sensors, information transfer, and computing power that deserves better exploitation by ecological and evolutionary researchers. We outline the development process for research apps, provide contrasting case studies for two new research apps, and scan the research horizon to suggest how apps can contribute to the rapid collection, interpretation, and dissemination of data in ecology and evolutionary biology. We emphasize that the usefulness of an app relies heavily on the development process, recommend that app developers are engaged with the process at the earliest possible stage, and commend efforts to create open-source software scaffolds on which customized apps can be built by nonexperts. We conclude that smartphones and their apps could replace many traditional handheld sensors, calculators, and data storage devices in ecological and evolutionary research. We identify their potential use in the high-throughput collection, analysis, and storage of complex ecological information.

AB Local adaptation and plasticity pose significant obstacles to predicting plant responses to future climates. Although local adaptation and plasticity in plant functional traits have been documented for many species, less is known about population-level variation in plasticity and whether such variation is driven by adaptation to environmental variation. We examined clinal variation in traits and performance - and plastic responses to environmental change - for the shrub Artemisia californica along a 700km gradient characterized (from south to north) by a fourfold increase in precipitation and a 61% decrease in interannual precipitation variation. Plants cloned from five populations along this gradient were grown for 3years in treatments approximating the precipitation regimes of the north and south range margins. Most traits varying among populations did so clinally; northern populations (vs. southern) had higher water-use efficiencies and lower growth rates, C:N ratios and terpene concentrations. Notably, there was variation in plasticity for plant performance that was strongly correlated with source site interannual precipitation variability. The high-precipitation treatment (vs. low) increased growth and flower production more for plants from southern populations (181% and 279%, respectively) than northern populations (47% and 20%, respectively). Overall, precipitation variability at population source sites predicted 86% and 99% of variation in plasticity in growth and flowering, respectively. These striking, clinal patterns in plant traits and plasticity are indicative of adaptation to both the mean and variability of environmental conditions. Furthermore, our analysis of long-term coastal climate data in turn indicates an increase in interannual precipitation variation consistent with most global change models and, unexpectedly, this increased variation is especially pronounced at historically stable, northern sites. Our findings demonstrate the critical need to integrate fundamental evolutionary processes into global change models, as contemporary patterns of adaptation to environmental clines will mediate future plant responses to projected climate change.

AB The predominant view is that the thermal physiology of tropical ectotherms, including lizards, is not labile over ecological timescales. We used the recent introduction (similar to 35 years ago) of the Puerto Rican lizard Anolis cristatellus to Miami, Florida, to test this thermal rigidity hypothesis. We measured lower (critical thermal minimum [CTmin]) and upper (critical thermal maximum [CTmax]) thermal tolerances and found that the introduced population tolerates significantly colder temperatures (by similar to 3 degrees C) than does the Puerto Rican source population; however, CTmax did not differ. These results mirror the thermal regimes experienced by each population: Miami reaches colder ambient temperatures than Puerto Rico, but maximum ambient temperatures are similar. The differences in CTmin were observed even though lizards from both sites experienced nearly identical conditions for 49 days before CTmin measurement. Our results demonstrate that changes in thermal tolerance occurred relatively rapidly (similar to 35 generations), which strongly suggests that the thermal physiology of tropical lizards is more labile than previously proposed.

AB In recent years considerable progress has been made in the understanding of urban land-use change and its dynamic interrelationships with economic, social, and environmental systems. From a quantitative perspective, advancements in GIS technologies, the increased availability of high-resolution remote sensing data, and new GIS-based spatial metrics of urban form and urban growth have helped to establish methods for comparative spatial analysis. However, due to the lack of homogeneous data, very few empirical studies have systematically addressed urbanisation and urban growth at a cross-national level. With this background, this paper presents a comparative assessment of urban land-use change across twenty-six European countries. On two scales of analysis, country and 20 km cells, we found a surprising variability in terms of urban growth and its territorial shape. We argue that these differences cannot be explained by varying demographic or economic growth pressures alone. Indicators on the composition, pattern, and density of urban growth illustrate that country-specific drivers of urban land-use change play an important role for the shaping of Europe's settlement structure.

AB In the face of unprecedented loss of biodiversity, cross-taxon correlates have been proposed as a means of obtaining quantitative estimates of biodiversity for identifying habitats of important conservation value. Habitat type, animal trophic level, and the spatial extent of studies would be expected to influence the strength of such correlations. We investigated these effects by carrying out a meta-analysis of 320 case studies of correlations between plant and animal species richnesses. The diversity of arthropods, herps, birds, and mammals significantly increased with plant diversity regardless of species habitat. However, correlations were stronger when plant and animal species richnesses were compared between habitats (gamma diversity) than within single habitats (alpha diversity). For arthropods, both the coefficient of correlation and the slope of the regression line were also greater for primary than for secondary consumers. These findings substantiate the use of plant species richness as an indicator of the diversity of animal taxa over space.

AB Natural systems are increasingly being modified by the addition of artificial habitats which may facilitate invasion. Where invaders are able to disperse from artificial habitats, their impact may spread to surrounding natural communities and therefore it is important to investigate potential factors that reduce or enhance invasibility. We surveyed the distribution of non-indigenous and native invertebrates and algae between artificial habitats and natural reefs in a marine subtidal system. We also deployed sandstone plates as experimental 'reefs' and manipulated the orientation, starting assemblage and degree of shading. Invertebrates (non-indigenous and native) appeared to be responding to similar environmental factors (e. g. orientation) and occupied most space on artificial structures and to a lesser extent reef walls. Non-indigenous invertebrates are less successful than native invertebrates on horizontal reefs despite functional similarities. Manipulative experiments revealed that even when non-indigenous invertebrates invade vertical "reefs", they are unlikely to gain a foothold and never exceed covers of native invertebrates (regardless of space availability). Community ecology suggests that invertebrates will dominate reef walls and algae horizontal reefs due to functional differences, however our surveys revealed that native algae dominate both vertical and horizontal reefs in shallow estuarine systems. Few non-indigenous algae were sampled in the study, however where invasive algal species are present in a system, they may present a threat to reef communities. Our findings suggest that non-indigenous species are less successful at occupying space on reef compared to artificial structures, and manipulations of biotic and abiotic conditions (primarily orientation and to a lesser extent biotic resistance) on experimental "reefs" explained a large portion of this variation, however they could not fully explain the magnitude of differences.

AB Our understanding of the genetic basis of local adaptation has recently benefited from the increased power to identify functional variants associated with environmental variables at the genome scale. However, it often remains challenging to determine whether locally adaptive alleles are actively maintained at intermediate frequencies by spatially varying selection. Here, we evaluate the extent to which this particular type of balancing selection explains the retention of adaptive genetic variation in the extreme situation of perfect panmixia, using the American eel (Anguilla rostrata) as a model. We first conducted a genome scan between two samples from opposite ends of a latitudinal environmental gradient using 454 sequencing of individually tagged cDNA libraries. Candidate SNPs were then genotyped in 992 individuals from 16 sampling sites at different life stages of the same cohort (including larvae from the Sargasso Sea, glass eels, and 1-year-old individuals) as well as in glass eels of the following cohort. Evidence for spatially varying selection was found at 13 loci showing correlations between allele frequencies and environmental variables across the entire species range. Simulations under a multiple-niche Levene's model using estimated relative fitness values among genotypes rarely predicted a stable polymorphic equilibrium at these loci. Our results suggest that some genetic-by-environment interactions detected in our study arise during the progress toward fixation of a globally advantageous allele with spatially variable effects on fitness.

AB Interdependent human and biophysical systems are highly complex and behave in unpredictable and uncontrollable ways. Social and ecological challenges that emerge from this complexity often defy straightforward solutions, and efforts to address these problems will require not only scientific and technological capabilities but also learning and adaptation.
   Scenarios are a useful tool for grappling with the uncertainty and complexity of social-ecological challenges because they enable participants to build adaptive capacity through the contemplation of multiple future possibilities. Furthermore, scenarios provide a platform for social learning, which is critical to acting in the face of uncertain, complex, and conflict-laden problems. We studied the Minnesota 2050 project, a collaborative project through which citizens collectively imagined future scenarios and contemplated the implications of these possibilities for the adaptability of their social and environmental communities.
   Survey and interview data indicate that these participatory scenario workshops built and strengthened relationships, enhanced participants' understanding of other perspectives, and triggered systemic thinking, all of which is relevant to collective efforts to respond to social-ecological challenges through sustainable development activities. Our analysis shows that participatory scenarios can stimulate social learning by enabling participants to engage and to discuss options for coping with uncertainty through collaborative actions. Such learning can be of value to participants and to the organizations and decisions in which they are engaged, and scenario processes can be effective tools for supporting collaborative sustainable development efforts.

AB Background: The primary objective of this study is to reconstruct the phylogeny of the hentzi species group and sister species in the North American tarantula genus, Aphonopelma, using a set of mitochondrial DNA markers that include the animal "barcoding gene". An mtDNA genealogy is used to consider questions regarding species boundary delimitation and to evaluate timing of divergence to infer historical biogeographic events that played a role in shaping the present-day diversity and distribution. We aimed to identify potential refugial locations, directionality of range expansion, and test whether A. hentzi post-glacial expansion fit a predicted time frame.
   Methods and Findings: A Bayesian phylogenetic approach was used to analyze a 2051 base pair (bp) mtDNA data matrix comprising aligned fragments of the gene regions CO1 (1165 bp) and ND1-16S (886 bp). Multiple species delimitation techniques (DNA tree-based methods, a "barcode gap" using percent of pairwise sequence divergence (uncorrected p-distances), and the GMYC method) consistently recognized a number of divergent and genealogically exclusive groups.
   Conclusions: The use of numerous species delimitation methods, in concert, provide an effective approach to dissecting species boundaries in this spider group; as well they seem to provide strong evidence for a number of nominal, previously undiscovered, and cryptic species. Our data also indicate that Pleistocene habitat fragmentation and subsequent range expansion events may have shaped contemporary phylogeographic patterns of Aphonopelma diversity in the southwestern United States, particularly for the A. hentzi species group. These findings indicate that future species delimitation approaches need to be analyzed in context of a number of factors, such as the sampling distribution, loci used, biogeographic history, breadth of morphological variation, ecological factors, and behavioral data, to make truly integrative decisions about what constitutes an evolutionary lineage recognized as a "species".

AB Large fire years in which >1% of the landscape burns are becoming more frequent in the Alaskan (USA) interior, with four large fire years in the past 10 years, and 79 000 km 2 (17% of the region) burned since 2000. We modeled fire severity conditions for the entire area burned in large fires during a large fire year (2004) to determine the factors that are most important in estimating severity and to identify areas affected by deep-burning fires. In addition to standard methods of assessing severity using spectral information, we incorporated information regarding topography, spatial pattern of burning, and instantaneous characteristics such as fire weather and fire radiative power. Ensemble techniques using regression trees as a base learner were able to determine fire severity successfully using spectral data in concert with other relevant geospatial data. This method was successful in estimating average conditions, but it underestimated the range of severity.
   This new approach was used to identify black spruce stands that experienced intermediate-to high-severity fires in 2004 and are therefore susceptible to a shift in regrowth toward deciduous dominance or mixed dominance. Based on the output of the severity model, we estimate that 39% (similar to 4000 km(2)) of all burned black spruce stands in 2004 had <10 cm of residual organic layer and may be susceptible a postfire shift in plant functional type dominance, as well as permafrost loss. If the fraction of area susceptible to deciduous regeneration is constant for large fire years, the effect of such years in the most recent decade has been to reduce black spruce stands by 4.2% and to increase areas dominated or co-dominated by deciduous forest stands by 20%. Such disturbance-driven modifications have the potential to affect the carbon cycle and climate system at regional to global scales.

AB Anthropogenic noise is prevalent across the globe and can exclude birds from otherwise suitable habitat and negatively influence fitness; however, the mechanisms responsible for species' responses to noise are not always clear. One effect of noise is a reduction in effective acoustic communication through acoustic masking, yet some urban songbirds may compensate for masking by noise through altering their songs. Whether this vocal flexibility accounts for species persistence in noisy areas is unknown. Here, we investigated the influence of noise on habitat use and vocal frequency in two suboscine flycatchers using a natural experiment that isolated effects of noise from confounding stimuli common to urban habitats. With increased noise exposure, grey flycatcher (Empidonax wrightii) occupancy declined, but vocal frequency did not change. By contrast, ash-throated flycatcher (Myiarchus cinerascens) occupancy was uninfluenced by noise, but individuals in areas with greater noise amplitudes vocalized at a higher frequency, although the increase (approximate to 200 kHz) may only marginally improve communication and may represent a secondary effect from increased vocal amplitude. Even so, the different flycatcher behavioural responses suggest that signal change may help some species persist in noisy areas and prompt important questions regarding which species will cope with an increasingly noisy world.

AB The objective of the study was to validate and apply DNA-based approaches to describe fish diets. Laboratory experiments were performed to determine the number of hours after ingestion that DNA could be reliably isolated from stomach content residues, particularly with small prey fishes (c. 1 cm, < 0 center dot 75 g). Additionally, experiments were conducted at different temperatures to resolve temperature effects on digestion rate and DNA viability. The molecular protocol of cloning and sequencing was then applied to the analysis of stomach contents of wild fishes collected from the western basin of Lake Erie, Canada-U.S.A. The results showed that molecular techniques were more precise than traditional visual inspection and could provide insight into diet preferences for even highly digested prey that have lost all physical characteristics.

AB Biological traits that are advantageous under specific ecological conditions should be present in a large proportion of the species within an ecosystem, where those specific conditions prevail. As climatic conditions change, the frequency of certain traits in plant communities is expected to change with increasing altitude. We examined patterns of change for 13 traits in 120 exhaustive inventories of plants along five altitudinal transects (520-3,100 m a.s.l.) in grasslands and in forests in western Switzerland. The traits selected for study represented the occupation of space, photosynthesis, reproduction and dispersal. For each plot, the mean trait values or the proportions of the trait states were weighted by species cover and examined in relation to the first axis of a PCA based on local climatic conditions. With increasing altitude in grasslands, we observed a decrease in anemophily and an increase in entomophily complemented by possible selfing; a decrease in diaspores with appendages adapted to ectozoochory, linked to a decrease in achenes and an increase in capsules. In lowlands, pollination and dispersal are ensured by wind and animals. However, with increasing altitude, insects are mostly responsible for pollination, and wind becomes the main natural dispersal vector. Some traits showed a particularly marked change in the alpine belt (e.g. the increase of capsules and the decrease of achenes), confirming that this belt concentrates particularly stressful conditions to plant growth and reproduction (e.g. cold, short growing season) that constrain plants to a limited number of strategies. One adaptation to this stress is to limit investment in dispersal by producing capsules with numerous, tiny seeds that have appendages limited to narrow wings. Forests displayed many of the trends observed in grasslands but with a reduced variability that is likely due to a shorter altitudinal gradient.

AB Drought-induced forest decline, like the Scots pine mortality in inner-Alpine valleys, will gain in importance as the frequency and severity of drought events are expected to increase. To understand how chronic drought affects tree growth and tree-ring delta 13C values, we studied mature Scots pine in an irrigation experiment in an inner-Alpine valley. Tree growth and isotope analyses were carried out at the annual and seasonal scale. At the seasonal scale, maximum delta 13C values were measured after the hottest and driest period of the year, and were associated with decreasing growth rates. Inter-annual delta 13C values in early- and latewood showed a strong correlation with annual climatic conditions and an immediate decrease as a response to irrigation. This indicates a tight coupling between wood formation and the freshly produced assimilates for trees exposed to chronic drought. This rapid appearance of the isotopic signal is a strong indication for an immediate and direct transfer of newly synthesized assimilates for biomass production. The fast appearance and the distinct isotopic signal suggest a low availability of old stored carbohydrates. If this was a sign for C-storage depletion, an increasing mortality could be expected when stressors increase the need for carbohydrate for defence, repair or regeneration.

AB Evolutionary relationships of the tree frogs from the Middle East and the demographic histories of their populations were studied using a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Hyla savignyi and neighboring populations of H. orientalis (former eastern populations of H. arborea) were the main focus taxa. Within H. savignyi, a deep phylogenetic divergence dated about 8.4 Ma was discovered. Southern populations from Yemen, Jordan, southern Syria and extreme north-eastern Israel are hereby described as a new species, H. felixarabica sp. nov. Our study points to a biogeographic connection of the south-western Arabian Peninsula and southern Levant and to the importance of the Dead Sea Rift as a historical barrier geographically separating the new species from H. savignyi. Major genetic breaks revealed within species (H. felixarabica: Yemen vs. Jordan-Syria; H. savignyi sensu stricto: Levant vs. Turkey-Iran) are probably connected to climate changes during the Plio-Pleistocene boundary, while the finer phylogeographic structuring probably resulted from the Quaternary climate oscillations. The Cypriote population of H. savignyi originated from southern Anatolia relatively recently. Hyla orientalis from the southern Black Sea region seems to be genetically quite uniform, although two phylogeographic units with western Turkish and Caucasus-Caspian affinities might be detected. Hyla savignyi and H. orientalis carry signals of population expansions dated to the middle to late Pleistocene, while populations of H. felixarabica seem to have rather been constant in size, which might indicate more stable climatic conditions in the southern regions during the Quaternary.

AB Sperm morphometry (i.e., size and shape) and function are important determinants of male reproductive success and are thought to be under stabilizing selection. However, recent studies suggest that sperm morphometry can be a phenotypically plastic trait, which can be adjusted to varying conditions. We tested whether different behavioral strategies in aggression between aggressive red and nonaggressive black males of the color polymorphic Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae) can influence sperm morphometry. We show pronounced within-individual phenotypic plasticity in sperm morphometry of male Gouldian finches in three different social environments. Both red and black males placed in intermediate to high competitive environments (high frequency of red males) increased the relative length of their sperm midpiece. By contrast, red males placed in low to intermediate competitive environments (higher frequency of black males) increased the length of the sperm flagellum. Significant changes in stress and sex steroid hormone levels (in response to the competitive environment) appear to influence sperm traits in red but not in black males, suggesting that changes in hormonal levels are not solely responsible for the observed changes in sperm morphometry. These findings imply that males can adjust sperm morphometry across social environments.

AB Nest predation is a natural component of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) reproduction, but changes in nesting habitat and predator communities may adversely affect grouse populations. We used a 2-part approach to investigate sage-grouse nest predation. First, we used information criteria to compare nest survival models that included indices of common raven (Corvus corax) abundance with other survival models that consisted of day of incubation, grouse age, and nest microhabitat covariates using measurements from 77 of 87 sage-grouse nests. Second, we used video monitoring at a subsample of 55 of 87 nests to identify predators of depredated nests (n = 16) and evaluated the influence of microhabitat factors on the probability of predation by each predator species. The most parsimonious model for nest survival consisted of an interaction between day of incubation and abundance of common ravens (w(ravenXincubation) (day) = 0.67). An estimated increase in one raven per 10-km transect survey was associated with a 7.4% increase in the odds of nest failure. Nest survival was relatively lower in early stages of incubation, and this effect was strengthened with increased raven numbers. Using video monitoring, we found the probability of raven predation increased with reduced shrub canopy cover. Also, we found differences in shrub canopy cover and understory visual obstruction between nests depredated by ravens and nests depredated by American badgers (Taxidea taxus). Increased raven numbers have negative effects on sage-grouse nest survival, especially in areas with relatively low shrub canopy cover. We encourage wildlife managers to reduce interactions between ravens and nesting sage-grouse by managing raven populations and restoring and maintaining shrub canopy cover in sage-grouse nesting areas.

AB Tree species are thought to be relatively resistant to habitat fragmentation because of their longevity and their aptitude for extensive gene flow, although recent empirical studies have reported negative genetic consequences, in particular after long-term habitat fragmentation in European temperate regions. Yet the response of each species to habitat loss may differ greatly depending on their biological attributes, in particular seed dispersal ability. In this study, we used demographic and molecular data to investigate the genetic consequences of chronic habitat fragmentation in remnant populations of Taxus baccata in the Montseny Mountains, northeast Spain. The age structure of populations revealed demographic bottlenecks and recruitment events associated with exploitation and management practices. We found a strong genetic structure, both at the landscape and within-population levels. We also detected high levels of inbreeding for a strictly outcrossing species. Chronic forest fragmentation resulting from long-term exploitation in the Montseny Mountains seems the most plausible explanation for the strong genetic structure observed. Our results support the view that, contrary to some predictions, tree species are not buffered from the adverse effects of habitat fragmentation, even in the case of species with a high dispersal potential.

AB To anticipate the rapidly changing world resulting from global climate change, the projections of climatemodels must be incorporated into conservation. This requires that the scales of conservation be aligned with the scales of climate-change projections. We considered how conservation has incorporated spatial scale into protecting biodiversity, how the projections of climate-change models vary with scale, and how the two do or do not align. Conservation planners use information about past and current ecological conditions at multiple scales to identify conservation targets and threats and guide conservation actions. Projections of climate change are also made at multiple scales, from global and regional circulation models to projections downscaled to local scales. These downscaled projections carry with them the uncertainties associated with the broad-scale models from which they are derived; thus, their high resolution may be more apparent than real. Conservation at regional or global scales is about establishing priorities and influencing policy. At these scales, the coarseness and uncertainties of global and regional climate models may be less important than what they reveal about possible futures. At the ecoregional scale, the uncertainties associated with downscaling climate models become more critical because the distributions of conservation targets on which plans are founded may shift under future climates. At a local scale, variations in topography and land cover influence local climate, often overriding the projections of broad-scale climate models and increasing uncertainty. Despite the uncertainties, ecologists and conservationists must work with climate-change modelers to focus on the most likely projections. The future will be different from the past and full of surprises; judicious use of model projections at appropriate scales may help us prepare.

AB Channel reconfiguration is a popular but controversial approach to river restoration, and ecological responses to channel reconfiguration have not been rigorously assessed. We compared physical-habitat variables, taxonomic and functional-trait diversities, taxonomic composition, and functional-trait abundances between 24 pairs of upstream (control) and downstream reconfigured (restored) reaches in 3 catchment land uses (urban, agricultural, rural) across the North Carolina Piedmont. We asked how environmental filters and functional species traits might provide insight to biological responses to restoration. Taxonomic and functional-trait differences between control and restored reaches suggest that restoration affected aquatic assemblages only in agricultural and rural catchments. Our results highlight 2 important aspects of channel reconfiguration as a restoration practice. First, responses to restoration differ between agricultural/rural and urban catchments, possibly because of modified hydrological regimes caused by urbanization. Second, we find evidence that channel reconfiguration disturbs food and habitat resources in stream ecosystems. Taxa sensitive to disturbance were characteristic of control reaches, whereas insensitive taxa were characteristic of restored reaches. Abundances of traits related to reproduction (voltinism, development, synchronization of emergence, adult life span), mobility (occurrence in drift, maximum crawling rate, swimming ability), and use of resources (trophic and habitat preferences) differed significantly between control and recently restored reaches. Our results suggest that taxa in restored habitats are environmentally selected for traits favored in disturbed environments. Our work suggests how functional-trait approaches could benefit the practice of river restoration when used to target restoration activities and to develop informed expectations regarding recovery following restoration activities.

AB We examined causes of mortality and survival rates for Amur tigers on and near the Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Zapovednik. Our objectives were to estimate and compare survival rates among sex and age classes, estimate cause-specific mortality, identify conservation issues related to tiger mortality and provide recommendations for reducing human-caused mortality. We used two separate datasets; one based on radio-tracking tigers from 1992 to 2005 and one based on reports of dead tigers from 1976 to 2000. We examined causes of mortality for both datasets and used a Cox proportional hazards models to estimate survival rates using data from 42 radio-collared tigers. Mortality was predominantly human-caused for both datasets (83% for the telemetry dataset and 78% for the other, n=24 and 53 mortalities, respectively), and 75% of collared animals were poached. All collared subadult tigers that dispersed were poached (n=6). Annual survival of adult females (0.81 +/- 0.10) was greater than that of adult males (0.63 +/- 0.20) (z=1.52, P=0.13) and subadult males (0.41 +/- 0.46) (z=2.07, P=0.04). Survival rates were precariously low on our study area, which included the largest protected area within Amur tiger range. Efforts to reduce human-caused mortality should focus on poaching and reducing deaths from tiger-human conflicts.

AB Pyrethroids and fipronil insecticides partition to sediment and organic matter in aquatic systems and may pose a risk to organisms that use these matrices. It has been suggested that bioavailability of sediment-sorbed pesticides is reduced, but data on toxicity of sediment-associated pesticides for pyrethroids and fipronil are limited. In the current study, 10-d sediment exposures were conducted with larval Chironomus tentans for bifenthrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, permethrin, fipronil, fipronil-sulfide, and fipronil-sulfone, the last two being common fipronil metabolites. Sublethal endpoints included immobilization, instantaneous growth rate (IGR), body condition index, and growth estimated by ash-free dry mass (AFDM). Pyrethroid lethal concentrations to 50% of the population (LC50s) were 6.2, 2.8, and 24.5 mu g/g of organic carbon (OC) for bifenthrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, and permethrin, respectively; with the former two lower than previously published estimates. Fipronil, fipronil-sulfide, and fipronil-sulfone LC50 values were 0.13, 0.16, and 0.12 mu g/g of OC, respectively. Ratios of LC50s to sublethal endpoints ( immobilization, IGR, and AFDM) ranged from 0.90 to 9.03. The effects on growth observed in the present study are important because of the unique dipteran life cycle involving pupation and emergence events. Growth inhibition would likely lead to ecological impacts similar to mortality ( no emergence and thus not reproductively viable) but at concentrations up to 4.3 times lower than the LC50 for some compounds. In addition, C. tentans was highly sensitive to fipronil and metabolites, suggesting that dipterans may be important for estimating risk and understanding effects of phenylpyrazole-class insecticides on benthic macroinvertebrate communities.

AB To mitigate erosion on abandoned fields in semi-arid ecosystems, it is important to understand how vegetation and soil properties and patterns develop after land abandonment. Our objective was to investigate the development of spatial heterogeneity in vegetation and soil properties after land abandonment. We described the vegetation composition, collected soil samples and made detailed aerial photographs for two series of abandoned fields on marl and calcrete in Southeast Spain. The images were classified into bare and vegetated patches, and spatial metrics were calculated for each site. Our results showed that recovery of vegetation and change in soil properties after land abandonment are slow and take at least 40 years in such a semi-arid enviromnent. Succession on calcrete appeared to be faster than on mad, probably because more water is available due to the higher rock fragment cover. Organic matter, aggregate stability and electrical conductivity were all significantly higher under vegetated patches, We found a clear linear relationship between vegetation cover and most spatial metrics, which offers the possibility of upscaling spotted vegetation patterns. The results of our integrated approach to study spatial heterogeneity in vegetation and soil properties can be used to improve predictions of runoff and erosion. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Spatial structure has been shown to promote altruistic behavior, however, it also increases the intensity of competition among relatives. Our purpose here is to develop a model in which this competition is minimized, more precisely a local increase in fecundity has a minimal competitive effect on the fitness of nearby individuals. We work with an island model in which sites are allowed to be empty, choosing our demographic rules so that in patches with higher fecundity, empty sites are filled at a higher rate. We also allow dispersal rates to evolve in response to the proportion of empty sites in the patch. Patches with different numbers of empty sites differ in frequency, in within-patch consanguinity, and in reproductive value. Using an inclusive fitness argument, we show that our model does promote altruism; indeed Hamilton's Rule is shown to hold. The only negative effect on an actor of a gift of fecundity to a patchmate turns out to be a slight decrease in reproductive value due to an increased probability of an empty site being occupied. We show that altruists are most favored in islands with an intermediate number of empty sites.

AB Recruitment variation can be a major source of fluctuation in populations and communities, making it difficult to generalize results. Determining the scales of variation and whether spatial patterns in the supply of individuals are persistent over time can provide insight into spatial generality and the application of conservation and metacommunity models. We examined these issues using eight-year-long data sets of monthly recruitment of intertidal mussels (Mytilus spp., Perumytilus purpuratus, Semimytilus algosus, Brachidontes granulata) and barnacles (Balanus glandula, Chthamalus dalli, Jehlius cirratus, Notochthamalus scabrosus) at sites spanning >900 km along the coasts of Oregon northern California (OR-NCA, 45.47-39.43 degrees N) and central Chile (CC, 29.5-34.65 degrees S). We evaluated four general "null" hypotheses: that despite different phylogenies and great spatial separation of these taxa, their similar life history strategies and environmental settings lead to similar patterns of recruitment (1) between hemispheres, (2) in time, (3) in space, and (4) at larger and smaller spatial scales. Hypothesis I was rejected: along the OR NCA coast, rates of recruitment were between two and three orders of magnitude higher, and patterns of seasonality were generally stronger and more coherent across space and time than along CC. Surprisingly, however, further analysis revealed regularities in both time and space for all species, supporting hypotheses 2 and 3. Temporal decorrelation scales were 1-3 months, and characteristic spatial scales of recruitment were similar to 250 km. Contrary to hypothesis 4, for the ecologically dominant species in both hemispheres, recruitment was remarkably persistent at larger mesoscales (kilometers) but was highly stochastic at smaller microscales (meters). Across species, increased recruitment variation at large scales was positively associated with increased persistence. Our results have several implications. Although the two regions span distinct latitudinal ranges, potential forcing processes behind these patterns include similar large-scale climates and topographically locked hydrographic features, such as upwelling. Further, spatial persistence of the recruitment patterns of most species at the mesoscale supports the view that marine protected areas can be powerful conservation and management tools. Finally, persistent and yet contrasting spatial patterns of recruitment among competing species suggest that recent metacommunity models might provide useful representations of the mechanisms involved in species coexistence.

AB Interspecies transfer of mitochondrial (mt) DNA is a common phenomenon in plants, invertebrates and vertebrates, normally linked with hybridization of closely related species in zones of sympatry or parapatry. In central Europe, in an area north of 48 degrees N latitude and between 8 degrees and 22 degrees E longitude, western Palaearctic water frogs show massive unidirectional introgression of mtDNA: 33.7% of 407 Rana ridibunda possessed mtDNA specific for Rana lessonae. By contrast, no R. lessonae with R. ridibunda mtDNA was observed. That R. ridibunda with introgressed mitochondrial genomes were found exclusively within the range of the hybrid Rana esculenta and that most hybrids had lessonae mtDNA (90.4% of 335 individuals investigated) is evidence that R. esculenta serves as a vehicle for transfer of lessonae mtDNA into R. ridibunda. Such introgression has occurred several times independently. The abundance and wide distribution of individuals with introgressed mitochondrial genomes show that R. lessonae mt genomes work successfully in a R. ridibunda chromosomal background despite their high sequence divergence from R. ridibunda mtDNAs (14.2-15.2% in the ND2/ND3 genes). Greater effectiveness of enzymes encoded by R. lessonae mtDNA may be advantageous to individuals of R. ridibunda and probably R. esculenta in the northern parts of their ranges.

AB We analyzed 13 microsatellite loci to estimate gene flow among westslope cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi, populations and determine the invasion pattern of hybrids between native O. c. lewisi and introduced rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, in streams of the upper Flathead River system, Montana (USA) and British Columbia (Canada). Fourteen of 31 sites lacked evidence of O. mykiss introgression, and gene flow among these nonhybridized O. c. lewisi populations was low, as indicated by significant allele frequency divergence among populations (theta(ST) = 0.076, rho(ST) = 0.094, P < 0.001). Among hybridized sites, O. mykiss admixture declined with upstream distance from a site containing a hybrid swarm with a predominant (92%) O. mykiss genetic contribution. The spatial distribution of hybrid genotypes at seven diagnostic microsatellite loci revealed that O. mykiss invasion is facilitated by both long distance dispersal from this hybrid swarm and stepping-stone dispersal between hybridized populations. This study provides an example of how increased straying rates in the invasive taxon can contribute to the spread of extinction by hybridization and suggests that eradicating sources of introgression may be a useful conservation strategy for protecting species threatened with genomic extinction.

TI A general theory of ecology
SO THEORETICAL ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Conceptual framework; law; model; theory
AB Ecologists bemoan the dearth of theory in ecology, in particular, the lack of an overarching, general theory. These complaints largely are unjustified. The components of a general theory of ecology have existed for the past half century; ecologists simply have failed to explicitly recognize them. We present a general theory of ecology and show how it relates to ecology's numerous constituent theories and models. The general theory consists of a description of the domain of ecology and a set of fundamental principles. The domain of ecology is the spatial and temporal patterns of the distribution and abundance of organisms, including causes and consequences. Fundamental principles are broad statements about the patterns that exist and the processes that operate within a domain. The seven fundamental principles of the theory of ecology are: the heterogeneous distribution of organisms, interactions of organisms, contingency, environmental heterogeneity, finite and heterogeneous resources, the mortality of organisms, and the evolutionary cause of ecological properties. These principles are the necessary and sufficient elements for a general theory of ecology. The propositions of any constituent theory of ecology can be shown to be a consequence of these fundamental principles along with principles from other science domains. The general theory establishes relationships among constituent theories through shared fundamental principles. The next challenge is to develop and integrate unified, constituent theories and to establish the relationships among them within the framework established by the general theory.

AB Background: Cichlid fish from East Africa are remarkable for phenotypic and behavioral diversity on a backdrop of genomic similarity. In 2006, the Joint Genome Institute completed low coverage survey sequencing of the genomes of five phenotypically and ecologically diverse Lake Malawi species. We report a computational and comparative analysis of these data that provides insight into the mechanisms that make closely related species different from one another.
   Results: We produced assemblies for the five species ranging in aggregate length from 68 to 79 megabase pairs, identified putative orthologs for more than 12,000 human genes, and predicted more than 32,000 cross-species single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Nucleotide diversity was lower than that found among laboratory strains of the zebrafish. We collected around 36,000 genotypes to validate a subset of SNPs within and among populations and across multiple individuals of about 75 Lake Malawi species. Notably, there were no fixed differences observed between focal species nor between major lineages. Roughly 3% to 5% of loci surveyed are statistical outliers for genetic differentiation (F-ST) within species, between species, and between major lineages. Outliers for FST are candidate genes that may have experienced a history of natural selection in the Malawi lineage.
   Conclusion: We present a novel genome sequencing strategy, which is useful when evolutionary diversity is the question of interest. Lake Malawi cichlids are phenotypically and behaviorally diverse, but they appear genetically like a subdivided population. The unique structure of Lake Malawl cichlid genomes should facilitate conceptually new experiments, employing SNPs to identity genotype-phenotype association, using the entire species flock as a mapping panel.

AB Elevational patterns of species richness and their underlying mechanisms have long been a controversial issue in biodiversity and biogeographical research, and several hypotheses have been proposed in the past decades. Local and regional studies have suggested that area and geometric constraint are two of major factors affecting the elevational pattern of species richness. In this study, using data of seed plants and their distribution ranges and a Digital Elevation Model data set, we explored altitu-dinal patterns of seed plant richness and quantified the effects of area and the mid-domain effect (MDE) on the richness patterns in a high mountain area, Gaoligong Mountains (ranging from 215 m to 5791 m a.s.l.) located in south-eastern Tibet, China. The results showed that richness and density (richness/ log-transformed area) of seed plants at species, genus, and family levels all showed hump-shaped patterns along the altitudinal gradient. The altitudinal changes in richness of species with three different range sizes (< 500 m, 500 - 1500 m, and > 1500 m), species of different plant life-forms (trees, shrubs, and herbs), and endemic species further confirmed this finding. Analysis of Generalized Linear Model depicted that although the area of each elevational band was always in high correlation with the species richness, the MDE could explain 84.9%, 33.8%, 83.8%, and 84.5% of the total variation in richness for all species and the three species groups with different range sizes, respectively. This suggests that the MDE significantly influences the patterns of species richness and is likely be stronger for broad-ranged species than for narrow-ranged ones in the Gaoligong Mountains.

AB Diversity has two basic components: richness, or number of species in a given area, and evenness, or how relative abundance or biomass is distributed among species. Previously, we found that richness and evenness can be negatively related across plant communities and that evenness can account for more variation in Shannon's diversity index (H') than richness, which suggests that relationships among diversity components can be complex. Non-positive relationships between evenness and richness could arise due to the effects of migration rate or local species interactions, and relationships could vary depending on how these two processes structure local communities. Here we test whether diversity components are equally or differentially affected over time by changes in seed density (and associated effects on established plant density and competition) in greenhouse communities during the very early stages of community establishment. In our greenhouse experiment, we seeded prairie microcosms filled with bare field soil at three densities with draws from a mix of 22 grass and forb species to test if increased competition intensity or seedling density would affect the relationships among diversity components during early community establishment. Increased seed density treatments caused diversity components to respond in a different manner and to have different relationships with time. Richness increased linearly with seed density early in the experiment when seedling emergence was high, but was unrelated to density later in the experiment. Evenness decreased log-linearly with seed densities on all sampling dates due to a greater dominance by Rudbeckia hirta with higher densities. Early in the experiment, diversity indices weakly reflected differences in richness, but later, after the competitive effects of Rudbeckia hirta became more intense, diversity indices more strongly reflected differences in evenness. This suggests that species evenness and diversity indices do not always positively covary with richness. Based on these results, we suggest that evenness and richness can be influenced by different processes, with richness being more influenced by the number of emerging seedlings and evenness more by species interactions like competition. These results suggest that both diversity components should be measured in plant diversity studies whenever it is possible.

AB 1. Focusing on the current environmental characteristics, the 'habitat template' theory proposes that life-history strategies summarise how evolution has shaped species to cope with the temporal and spatial variability of their present environment. The hierarchical 'landscape filters' concept predicts that the distribution of species reflects their specific traits that allow them to pass through multiple habitat filters. Together, these theories showed the importance of identifying the functional relationships of species to selective habitat forces in order to predict the organisation and response of communities to the environment.
   2. We test the relationships between life-history traits of European freshwater fish species' and their habitat preferences, to detect the strategies adopted by fish to cope with their current habitat. For this purpose, we use published data on species traits and habitat preferences (microhabitat hydraulics, temperature and oxygen level). We use multivariate analyses to classify fish species' strategies and test the relationships between strategies and habitat preferences.
   3. We identified a continuum of life-history patterns between two extremes, with opportunistic and periodic species. Our study supports the idea that microhabitat hydraulics plays a more important role as a template for these species ecological strategies than temperature and oxygen level. Indeed, riffle habitats may select opportunistic species whereas weak relationships are found between species strategies and both their temperature and oxygen level preferences. In addition, the ratio between mortality and growth rate (dimensionless trait), reflecting a trade-off between growth and survival, varied among species according to the use of their hydraulic habitat, with species using deep habitats exhibiting the highest values.
   4. These general relationships between hydraulics and traits may be of importance in community ecology to develop predictive models to understand how fish communities change with the hydraulic environment.

AB Prevention is the best way to slow the escalation of problems associated with biological invasions. Screening of potential introductions is widely applied for assessing the risk of species becoming invasive. Despite advances in the understanding of the determinants of invasiveness, screening still relies heavily on assessments of the potential of species to 'fit in' to the broad environmental conditions of a target region. Most screening systems ask whether species are native to, or are known to be naturalized or invasive in, regions with 'similar' climatic/environmental conditions to the target region. The level of similarity required to make the species a high-risk introduction is generally not specified. This paper describes a protocol for making such assessments more objective, using South Africa as a test case.
   Using nonparametric niche-based modelling (generalized additive model; GAM) calibrated on the current distribution of each South African biome, we mapped regions of the world that are climatically similar to South African biomes. Lists were produced of countries with the largest areas climatically similar to South Africa overall, and to each biome separately. Validation of the usefulness of the approach was sought by evaluating whether the main invasive plant species in South African biomes occur naturally, or have adventive ranges, in regions mapped as analogous to South African biomes.
   A very large part of the world is climatically similar to South Africa, with eight countries having larger areas of land classified as climatically similar to South African biomes than the total area of South Africa. Almost all the most prominent invasive species in South African biomes occur naturally or are invasive outside their natural range in areas with similar climates to those that occur in parts of South Africa. This confirms the value of objective climate matching in screening protocols.
   We examined climatic conditions for a representative sample of major invasive plants from other parts of the world. The analysis identified several species that are already invasive in regions that have matched climates in South Africa but that are not yet introduced or, if already present, have not yet invaded large areas. For example, the following known invasive species should be considered high-risk species in South African grasslands: Alliaria petiolata, Cytisus scoparius, Gleditsia triacanthos, Heracleum mantegazzianum, Hieracium pilosella, Juniperus communis, Pinus contorta, P. monticola, P. ponderosa, P. sylvestris, Prunus laurcerasus, and P. serotina. Objectively matched climatic regions are also useful as a first-cut assessment when evaluating species with no invasive history.

AB Spermatozoa exhibit taxonomically widespread patterns of divergent morphological evolution. However, the adaptive significance of variation in sperm morphology remains unclear. In this study we examine the role of natural variation in sperm length on fertilization success in the dung beetle Onthophagus taurus. We conducted sperm competition trials between males that differed in the length of their sperm and determined the paternity of resulting offspring using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. We also quantified variation in the size and shape of the female's sperm storage organ to determine whether female morphology influenced the competitiveness of different sperm morphologies. We found that fertilization success was biased toward males with relatively shorter sperm, but that selection on sperm length was dependent on female tract morphology; selection was directional for reduced sperm length across most of the spermathecal size range, but stabilizing in females with the smallest spermathecae. Our data provide empirical support for the theory that sperm competition should favor the evolution of numerous tiny sperm. Moreover, because sperm length is both heritable and genetically correlated with condition, our results are consistent with a process by which females can accrue genetic benefits for their offspring from the incitement of sperm competition and/or cryptic female choice, as proposed by the "sexy sperm" and "good sperm" models for the evolution of polyandry.

AB The evolutionary history of Plasmodium vivax has recently been addressed in terms of its origin as a parasite of humans and the age of extant populations. The consensus is that P. vivax originated as a result of a host switch from a non-human primate to hominids and that the extant populations did not originate as recently as previously proposed. Here, we show that, in a comparison of parasite isolates from across the world, Asian populations of P. vivax are the oldest. We discuss how this result, together with the phylogenetic evidence that P. vivax derived from Plasmodium found in Southeast Asian macaques, is most simply explained by assuming an Asian origin of this parasite. Nevertheless, the available data show only the tip of the iceberg. We discuss how sampling might affect time estimates to the most recent common ancestor for P. vivax populations and suggest that spatially explicit estimates are needed to understand the demographic history of this parasite better.

AB Light use efficiency (LUE) is used widely in scaling and modeling contexts. However, the variation and biophysical controls on LUE remain poorly documented. Networks of eddy covariance (EC) towers offer an opportunity to quantify epsilon(g) the ratio of P, gross primary productivity, to Q(a), absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), across climate zones and vegetation types. Using data from the Fluxnet Canada Research Network (n = 24 sites) in 2004, we examined the relationship between daily and yearly epsilon(g) driving variables, and site characteristics on a site-specific and plant functional type (PFT) basis using tree regression and linear regression. Data were available for three biomes: grassland, forest, and wetland. Yearly epsilon(g) values ranged from 0.1 to 3.6 g C MJ(-1) Q(a,) overall. Daily eg was highest in the grassland (daily median +/- interquartile range: 3.68 +/- 1.98 g C MJ(-1) Q(a)) intermediate in the forested biome (0.84 +/- 0.82 g C MJ(-1) Q(a)), and lowest for the wetlands (0.65 +/- 0.54 g C MJ(-1) Q(a)). The most important biophysical controls were light and temperature, to the exclusion of water-related variables: a homogeneity of slopes model explained C. 75% of the variation in daily epsilon(g). For a subset of sites with diffuse PAR data, the ratio of diffuse to total PAR, a proxy for cloudiness, was a key predictor. On the yearly time scale, epsilon(g). was related to leaf area index and mean annual temperature. Aggregating to PFTs did not show functional convergence within any PFT except for the three wetland sites and the Picea mariana toposequence at the daily time step, and when using the Koppen climate classification on a yearly time step. The general lack of conservative daily epsilon(g) behavior within PFTs suggests that PFT-based parameterizations are inappropriate, especially when applied on shorter temporal scales.

AB The prominently right-skewed distribution of species sizes has been the subject of a large literature in animal ecology, but has received comparatively little attention from plant ecologists. It is evident that not all explanations that have been offered for animals are directly applicable to plants.
   We suggest three hypotheses that require further study in the interpretation of size-dependent species richness in plants.
   These hypotheses are all based on mechanisms that have generated, for smaller plants, a greater historical opportunity for speciation: (i) large adult plant size confers significant adaptation primarily in habitat types that have been relatively uncommon in space, across evolutionary time; (ii) relatively small species are more widely differentiated from each other in the environmental qualities defining their niches, many of which are made possible by the mere presence of larger species residing in the same habitat; and (iii) compared with large species, smaller species generally have higher fecundity allocation, i.e. they can produce a greater number of offspring per unit plant size per unit time, which generally confers a higher premium under most circumstances of natural selection, thus generating a potentially greater number of descendant individuals, and derived species.
   We discuss the implications of these hypotheses in addressing an underlying paradox in plant competition/coexistence theory, i.e. that large adult size is assumed to be the principal trait that confers competitive ability yet, even in those habitat types where competition is assumed to reach the highest levels of intensity within vegetation, the vast majority of the resident species are, nevertheless, relatively small.

AB A number of studies have been performed to understand the characteristics of biomass (size) spectra in aquatic plankton communities around the world. Although the area below a biomass spectrum curve represents the abundance or biomass of a plankton community, it has been hypothesized that the slope and shape of a biomass spectrum are determined by rates of growth, respiration, mortality and trophic dynamics. Observations of biomass spectra indicate that the slope of a biomass spectrum is around -1 on the logarithmic coordinates. Empirical hypotheses of growth-survival and the theoretical framework on biomass conservation based on the rates of individual body growth and abundance change have been developed for interpreting the slope and domes of a biomass spectrum. Here, a mathematical method is developed for estimating specific rates of body growth and abundance change from observations of biomass spectra, and a mathematical model is constructed for the relationship between a biomass spectrum slope, community assimilation efficiency and trophic levels.

AB 1. The UK population of yellowhammers has declined since the mid-1980s. Concurrent increases in the use of pesticides are believed to have reduced the availability of food resources for farmland birds, including yellowhammers. To mitigate the consequences of insecticide applications on yellowhammer productivity, the relationships between insecticide application, arthropod food abundance and breeding success require quantification.
   2. We studied nesting yellowhammers on a lowland arable farm in North Yorkshire between 2001 and 2003, to examine the effects of food abundance on breeding success and the effects of insecticide on food abundance. Arthropod abundances around individual nests were sampled and the timing and location of insecticide applications were recorded.
   3. Nestling condition and mass on day 6 after hatching were positively correlated with the abundance of arthropods important in the diet of nestling yellowhammers. Greater mean body mass and condition corresponded with a lower incidence of brood reduction.
   4. The abundance of arthropods important in the diet of nestling yellowhammers increased between mid-May and the end of July. However, arthropod samples collected within 20 days of an insecticide application did not show this seasonal increase in abundance and were depressed at levels likely to affect yellowhammer breeding performance adversely.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We have demonstrated how insecticide applications can depress yellowhammer breeding productivity. We provide the requisite data for a framework that enables predictions to be made about the probable population effects of particular pesticide products. If the risk of indirect effects can be predicted accurately then appropriate mitigation and compensation measures could be incorporated into pesticide regulatory procedures and/or agri-environment schemes.

AB Many models have investigated how the process of speciation may occur in sympatry. In these models, individuals are either asexual or mate choice is determined by very simple rules. Females, for example, may be assumed either to compare their phenotype to that of a potential mate, preferring to mate with similar males (phenotype matching), or to possess preference genes that determine which male phenotype they prefer. These rules often do not reflect the mate-choice rules found in empirical studies. In this paper, we compare these two modes of female choice with various types of sexual imprinting. We examine the efficacy of different mate-choice behavior in causing divergence in male traits under simple deterministic one-locus population genetic models as well as under polygenic, individual-based simulations based on the models of Dieckmann and Doebeli (1999). We find that the inheritance mechanism of mate choice can have a large effect on the ease of sympatric speciation. When females imprint on their mothers, the result of the model is similar to phenotype matching, where speciation can occur fairly easily. When females imprint on their fathers or imprint obliquely, speciation becomes considerably less likely. Finally, when females rely on preference genes, male trait evolution occurs easily, but the correlation between trait and preference can be weak, and interpreting these results as speciation may be suspect.

AB The glacial refugia hypothesis indicates that during the height of the Pleistocene glaciations the temperate species that are today widespread in western Europe must have survived in small and climatically favourable areas located in the southern peninsulas of Iberia, Italy and Balkans. One such species is the tawny owl, a relatively sedentary, nonmigratory bird presently distributed throughout Europe. It is a tree-nesting species closely associated with deciduous and mixed coniferous woodlands. In this study I used control region mtDNA sequences from 187 individuals distributed among 14 populations to determine whether current genetic patterns in tawny owl populations were consistent with postglacial expansion from peninsular refugia. European, North African and Asian tawny owls were found to represent three distinct lineages, where North Africa is the sister clade to all European owls. Within Europe, I found three well-supported clades that correspond to each of the three allopatric refugia. Expansion patterns indicate that owls from the Balkan refugium repopulated most of northern Europe, while expansion out of Iberia and Italy had only regional effects leading to admixture in France. Estimates of population divergence times between refugia populations are roughly similar, but one order of magnitude smaller between Greece and northern Europe. Based on a wide range of mutation rates and generation times, divergence between refugia appears to date to the Pleistocene.

AB Shallow lake ecosystems can shift between clear-water, macrophyte-rich conditions and turbid states with abundant phytoplankton. However, little is known about the controls of algal community composition and primary production before, during, and after ecosystem state change, because long time series that monitor biological change through the transition are scarce. Using proxy data sets derived from sediment cores from two shallow hypertrophic lakes in Denmark, variance-partitioning analysis (VPA) was used to determine the relative importance of changes in total phosphorus (diatom inferred), planktivorous fish density (zooplankton inferred), and submerged macrophyte communities (as macrofossil abundance) as determinants of algal abundance and community composition (as sedimentary pigments) over ecosystem state transitions since 1750 (CE) for Lake Lading and 1900 for Lake Sobygaard. Past variation in densities of planktivorous fish explained 12.3% and 18.2% of historical algal community change in lakes Lading and Sobygaard, respectively, while a further 22.3% and 6% of algal variability was explained by variation in macrophyte abundance. Total phosphorus (TP) alone explained nonsignificant amounts of variance (1.5%, 3.6%) but had a significant effect in combination with macrophytes and fish (27%, 13.4%). State transitions occurred ca. 1940 but were preceded by increases in benthic diatoms and macrophytes, suggesting that transitions were gradual rather than instantaneous. In contrast, green, colonial blue-green, and cryptophyte algae were abundant only during turbid states after ca. 1960 and were correlated to changes in planktivorous fish or fish-TP interactions. Contrary to expectations, the shift from predominantly benthic to pelagic algal production represented only a change in habitat and did not result in an increase in total abundance of primary producers.

AB Presence of higher plant species was recorded in 1455 permanently marked quadrats located across Britain in 1978, 1990 and 1998 in a stratified, random sample of 259 1 km squares. Significant increases and decreases in frequency of each species were summarised as changes in the representation of simple traits, each of which had an established relationship with varying levels of fertility or disturbance. By testing the null hypothesis that the trait values represented among increasing or decreasing species were a random draw from the 1978 species pool, we determined the consistency of botanical change with changes in land-use in different vegetation types and landscape locations across Britain.
   Overall, 63% of significant changes in species occupancy were decreases and 37% increases. Trait changes were largely consistent with the impact of increased nutrient availability across vegetation types associated with inherently low fertility, such as infertile grassland, heath, bog and moorland. Linear habitats in lowland Britain saw trait changes consistent with secondary succession. Although trait changes were highly consistent with eutrophication in upland vegetation, the identity of the changing species left open the possibility that increased N deposition, sheep grazing intensity and local improvement could all have played a part.
   Recent changes in common plant species across Britain suggest that objectives for large-scale restoration and maintenance of plant communities must address four problems: (a) the increasing scarcity of stress-tolerant species in lowland species pools, (b) exploitation and maintenance of species populations on habitat fragments and linear features in the lowlands, (c) the spread and persistence of generalist species in upland Britain, (d) systemic nutrient enrichment in both lowland and upland environments.

AB Analysis of adaptive radiation has had a central role in the development of evolutionary theory, but it is not clear why some groups radiate and others do not. Two recent papers by Albertson and colleagues on the genetic architecture of East African cichlid fishes implicate hybridization, transgressive segregation and genetic covariation in the early stages of adaptive radiation. Transgressive segregation and genetic covariation might be key innovations in genetic architecture that favor adaptive radiation.

AB Ornamental traits expressed in both sexes are widespread among birds. Many studies have indicated that male ornaments develop through sexual selection. Female ornaments may be correlated effects of selection on males or have signaling functions in their own right. In the facultatively polygynous starling Sturnus vulgaris, both sexes possess iridescent throat feathers, which are actively displayed during Courtship by males. This paper investigates the reproductive correlates of throat feather ornaments in both sexes. Bird-perceived hue and components of feather length covaried strongly, and a summary variable (the first principal component [PCI]) was extracted using Principal component analysis. Sex and age-related differences were found for PCI. Positive assortative mating was found with respect to age and PCI. However, the relative influences of ornamentation and age on breeding variables were hard to separate, so effects may be related to other age-related variables. This provides a cautionary note for studies of ornamentation where age is unknown. However, we argue that throat feathers in starlings may signal age and age-related quality measures in both sexes. Older females with higher PCI scores bred earlier and laid larger clutches with higher hatching, success, older males with higher PCI scores had higher chances of becoming polygynous and attracting high reproductive quality females. PCI showed no relationship with parental care in either sex. Direct reproductive benefits for males and indirect genetic benefits for either sex may drive mate choice based on these age-related characters. However, only experimental manipulation can determine whether ornamentation signals quality variation within age classes.

AB Plant invasions have been attracting increasing attention from ecologists because of their worldwide environmental impacts and huge economic costs. Research on the characteristics of the recipient regions is essential for understanding the process of plant invasion. However, few previous studies on invasibility of habitats include social factors, although human activities are critical in the process of plant invasion. China is a vast country with high plant species diversity and a long history of introduction of exotic plant species and is particularly vulnerable to invasive plant species. Alien plant species are widespread in the country. Therefore, the study of invasive plants in China is urgent in practice and theoretically important for developing invasion ecology. For the present study, 126 species were selected to represent the major invasive plant species in China. We then collected data on their species richness in 31 provincial administrative units of China and performed Spearman rank correlations between species richness and possible natural and socio-economic factors. We found that socio-economic factors, such as human density and GDP, correlated positively with the species richness of invasive plants in China. In conjunction with the natural and socio-economic correlations in the study of regional distribution pattern of the major invasive plants, we discussed the factors influencing the regional distribution pattern of the major invasive plants in China. We suggest that native plant species richness was mainly determined by the natural conditions of the regions, while invasive species richness was influenced by natural conditions and human disturbance together.

AB Isolated shrub patches are a key element for community structure and dynamics in semi-arid ecosystems, and may act as "hot spots" of understorey species diversity. Despite its importance, the relationships between shrub patch characteristics and understorey species richness, and the relative importance of these characteristics against other factors driving understorey species richness, are still poorly understood. We studied perennial species richness under the canopy of late-successional shrubs in semi-arid Stipa tenacissima steppes of SE Spain. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between shrub size and understorey richness, and to test if this relationship is modified by species identity. We also aimed to know the relative importance of shrub patch characteristics and abiotic factors as predictors of the distribution of understorey species under shrub canopies. Altitude and geographical co-ordinates were able to significantly explain the patterns of shrub occurrence and abundance in the study area. Understorey species richness was significantly related to the size of individual shrubs according to a simple power relationship for all evaluated species. Slope values of linear regressions with log-transformed data, ranging between 0.22 and 0.37, did not differ between species. Site characteristics, patch characteristics and patch species identity significantly explained the occurrence of species on patches. However, the relative importance of site characteristics was higher than that of patch characteristics and species identity in explaining these patterns. Our results agree with the general expectations of the theory of island biogeography and complement previous studies that emphasise the importance of late-successional shrubs in semi-arid Stipa steppes. Environmental management activities within these steppes should promote the conservation of remnant shrubs, as well as its introduction with restoration activities. (C) 2005 Elsevier SAS.

AB Unprecedented deforestation is currently underway in Southeast Asia. Since this trend is likely to continue, it is critical to determine the value of human-modified habitats (e.g., mixed-rural habitat) for conserving the regional native forest avifauna. The impacts of ongoing deforestation on the highly endemic avifauna (33%) of Sulawesi (Indonesia) are poorly understood. We sampled birds in primary and secondary forests in the Lore Lindu National Park in central Sulawesi, as well as the surrounding plantation and mixed-rural habitats. Species richness, species density and population density of forest birds showed a consistent decreasing trend in the following order: primary forests > secondary forests > mixed-rural habitat > plantations. Although primary forests contained the highest proportion (85%) of a total of 34 forest species recorded from our point count surveys, 40-yr old secondary forests and the mixed-rural habitat showed high conservation potential, containing 82% and 76% of the forest species, respectively. Plantations recorded only 32% of the forest bird species. Fifteen forest species had the highest abundance in primary forests, while two species had higher abundance outside primary forests. Our simulations revealed that all forest birds that were sensitive to native tree cover could be found in areas with at least 20% continuous native tree cover. Our study shows that although primary forests have the highest conservation value for forest avifauna, the potential of degraded habitats, such as secondary forests and the mixed-rural habitat, for conserving forest species can be enhanced with appropriate land use and management decisions.

AB 1. We present an empirical, analytical model that estimates both temperature and seasonal response functions for the growth of wild juvenile fish without the need for costly tank experiments in less realistic conditions.
   2. Analysis of monthly recapture data on the lengths and weights of individual wild juvenile fish demonstrates that simple temperature-driven models of growth can be less informative than more realistic, empirical, models.
   3. A case study of wild Atlantic salmon parr (Salmo salar) showed that: most growth took place in a 10-week period in spring, at temperatures below those that previous published models report as necessary for rapid growth and at faster rates than the maximum that previous models predicted.
   4. Temperature and fish size allometry explained 45% of growth variation, but the effects of temperature were significantly and markedly different at different seasons.
   5. Seasonal effects explained an additional 18% of the variation and were strongly associated with the abundance of potential 'drift' food.
   6.The seasonal patterns for growth in length and weight were different, implying differential allocation of resources to structural and reserve tissues.
   7.The growth patterns of sexually maturing male parr and emigrants also differed in comparison to other parr.
   8.Condition factor, length at first capture and seasonal interactions with both early maturity and smolting explained another 7% of the variation.
   9. However, individual fish did not grow consistently better, or worse, than the 'average' fish.
   10. This study emphasizes the necessity to test the adequacy of laboratory-based physiological models with suitably detailed field data and to focus model refinement by identifying processes which otherwise confound interpretation.

AB Many factors influence the spread dynamics and distribution of invasive alien organisms. Despite progress in unravelling the determinants of invasiveness and invasibility, robust, spatially-explicit predictive models for explaining real-world invasion dynamics remain illusive. Reconstructing invasion episodes is a useful way of determining the roles of different factors in mediating spread and proliferation. In many cases, however, human-aided dispersal and other anthropogenic factors blur the roles of natural controlling factors.
   We describe the reconstruction of an isolated invasion event from a known source: the 50-year invasion history of Opuntia stricta in the Kruger National Park. Our aim was to explore the relative roles of environment and propagule supply in shaping the invasion pattern.
   Environmental variables (landscape heterogeneity and distance from water sources) were moderately useful for explaining the presence/absence of O. stricta in 1-ha cells across the 660 km(2) (53% of cells correctly classified). Adding fire frequency increased the accuracy of the model (68%). However, when we considered the role of propagule pressure (measured as the distance of sites from the known primary invasion focus and putative secondary invasion foci), model accuracy was greatly improved (77%). No environmental variables or propagule pressure correctly explained spatial variation in abundance (expressed as cladode density in 1-ha cells). We discuss implications of the importance of propagule supply for modelling and managing invasions.

AB The response of species numbers and density of Collembola to manipulation of plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 32 species) and number of plant functional groups (grasses, legumes and non-legume herbs) was studied in an experimental grassland at the Swiss BIODEPTH site (Lupsingen, Switzerland) in October 1997. Plant species richness or number of plant functional groups did not affect total diversity of Collembola, however, the number of Collembola species increased in the presence of legumes and the grass Trisetum flavescens. The abundance of Protaphorura armata increased but that of Hypogastruridae/Neanuridae significantly decreased with increasing number of plant functional groups. Other groups including the herbivorous Symphypleona did not respond to plant species richness and plant functional groups. Possibly, Hypogastruridae/Neanuridae species are weak competitors declining in density if the density of other Collembola groups increase. In general, the effect of the number of plant functional groups on the densities of collembolan taxa was stronger than that of plant species richness. Changes in Collembola density and diversity in part was likely caused by increased soil microbial and fine root biomass in treatments with higher plant functional group diversity. The presence of legumes resulted in an increase in the densities of total Collembola, Symphypleona/Neelipleona and Isotomidae indicating that they benefited from the high litter quality and the increased microbial biomass in the rhizosphere of legumes. The results suggest that microbivorous soil invertebrates are controlled by food quality rather than quantity. Furthermore, they indicate that presence of certain plant species and functional groups may be more important for collembolan community structure than the diversity of plant species and functional groups per se.

AB Changes in leaf mass per area (LMA), nitrogen content on a mass-basis (N-m) and on an area basis (N-a) with relative irradiance were assessed in leaves of eight temperate species harvested at different depths in a canopy. Relative irradiance (GSF) at the points of leaf sampling was estimated by hemispheric photographs. There was a strong species-dependent positive relationship between LMA and GSF for all species. Shade-tolerant species such as Fagus sylvatica showed lower LMA for the same GSF than less tolerant species as Quercus pyrenaica or Quercus petraea. The only evergreen species in the study, Ilex aquifollium, had the highest LMA, independent of light environment, with minimum values much higher than the rest of the broad-leaved species studied. There was no relation between N and GSF for most species studied and only a very weak relation for the relative shade-intolerant species Q. pyrenaica. Within each species, the pattern of Na investment with regard to GSF was linked mainly to LMA. At the same relative irradiance, differences in N. among species were conditioned both by the LMA-GSF relationship and by the species N value. The lowest N-m value was measured in I. aquifollium (14.3 +/- 0.6 mg g(-1)); intermediate values in Crataegus monogyna (16.9 +/- 0.6 mg g(-1)) and Prunus avium (19.1 +/- 0.6 mg g(-1)) and higher values, all in a narrow range (21.3 +/- 0.6 to 23 +/- 0.6 mg g(-1)), were measured for the other five species. Changes in LMA with the relative irradiance were linked both to lamina thickness (LT) and to palisade/spongy parenchyma ratio (PP/SP). In the second case, the LMA changes may be related to an increase in lamina density as palisade parenchyma involves higher cell packing than spongy parenchyma. However, since PP/SP ratio showed a weak species-specific relationship with LMA, the increase in LT should be the main cause of LMA variation. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB We studied the reproductive strategy of a population of fat dormice (Myoxus glis) breeding in nest boxes in a beech forest on the southern Alps, Italy. In eight years of data collection (1991-1998), we observed births only in 1991, 1992, and 1995. We did not observe young during the autumn dispersal in the remaining five years. Reproduction was not correlated with high rainfall, low temperature in summer, or with population density. Reproduction was only observed in years of beech mast seeding. Body condition of adults when they emerged from hibernation did not differ between years with and without reproduction, suggesting that the adults may avoid breeding when the young have a low probability of surviving their first winter. A capture-recapture analysis on individually marked adult fat dormice identified a very high yearly survival rate (0.86-0.92), close to that of large herbivorous mammals and much higher than that typical of other rodent species with similar body size. No influence of sex on survival or recapture probability was detected. The long life span expectancy of an adult dormouse (averaging nine years) is the prerequisite for the infrequent breeding strategy adopted by this rodent species to cope with an unpredictable food source. A high survival rate despite the small body size may have been possible because of the long hibernation time (>6 months). Long life span and intermittent breeding make the life history of fat dormice unique among rodents.

AB The influence of freshwater environment on muscle growth in seawater was investigated in an inbred population of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). The offspring from a minimum of 64 families per group were incubated at either ambient temperature (ambient treatment) or in heated water (heated treatment). Growth was investigated using a mixed-effect statistical model with repeated measures, which included terms for treatment effect and random fish effects for individual growth rate (alpha) and the instantaneous growth rate per unit change in temperature (gamma). Prior to seawater transfer, fish were heavier in the heated (61.6+/-1.0 g; N=298) than in the ambient (34.1+/-0.4 g; N=206) treatments, reflecting their greater growth opportunity: 4872 degree-days and 4281 degree-days, respectively. However, the subsequent growth rate of the heated group was lower, such that treatments had a similar body mass (3.7-3.9 kg) after approximately 450 days in seawater. The total cross-sectional area of fast muscle and the number (FN) and size distribution of the fibres was determined in a subset of the fish. We tested the hypothesis that freshwater temperature regime affected the rate of recruitment and hypertrophy of muscle fibres. There were differences in FN between treatments and a significant age x treatment interaction but no significant cage effect (ANOVA). Cessation of fibre recruitment was identified by the absence of fibres of <10 mum diameter. The maximum fibre number was 22.4% more in the ambient (9.3x10(5)+/-2.0x10(4)) than in the heated (7.6x10(5)+/-1.5x10(4)) treatments (N=44 and 40 fish, respectively; P<0.001). For fish that had completed fibre recruitment, there was a significant correlation between FN and individual growth rate, explaining 35% of the total variation. The density of myogenic progenitor cells was quantified using an antibody to c-met and was approximately 2-fold higher in the ambient than in the heated group, equivalent to 2-3% of the total muscle nuclei. The number of myonuclei in isolated fibre segments showed a linear relationship with fibre diameter. On average, there were 20.6% more myonuclei in 200- mum-diameter fibres isolated from the ambient (3734 myonuclei cm(-1)) than from the heated (3097 myonuclei cm(-1)) treatments. The maximum fibre diameter was greater in heated than in ambient groups, whereas the age x treatment interaction was not significantly different (ANCOVA). There were also no consistent differences in the rate of hypertrophy of muscle fibres between treatments. It was concluded that freshwater temperature regime affected fibre number and the nuclear content of fast muscle in seawater but not the rate of fibre hypertrophy. The mechanisms and life history consequences of developmental plasticity in fibre number are discussed.

AB Eelgrass Zostera marina provides refuge to numerous fish species but is vulnerable to fragmentation through natural and anthropogenic disturbance. In Bonavista. Bay, Newfoundland, eelgrass patch size was altered to measure changes in predation risk in Age-0 juvenile cod, Gadus morhua. Artificial eelgrass mats of 5 sizes (0.32, 1.1, 5.5, 11 and 22 m(2)) were deployed in duplicate at each of 2 sites in Newman Sound in Terra Nova National Park during summer/autumn in 1999 and 2000. Predator distribution was determined using a combination of weekly underwater transect surveys and biweekly seining. Relative predation rates were measured by tethering Age-0 cod at the center of each patch and recording the incidence of predation (n = 1116 tether sets). Predation rates were negatively correlated with patch size during both years, suggesting that larger patches reduce predator foraging ability. However, high predator densities in the largest eelgrass patch resulted in higher than expected rates of predation. Therefore, habitat dimension affected predation risk in juvenile cod via 2 opposing mechanisms. Our results stress the importance of considering both habitat areal extent and predator distribution when estimating the effects of habitat fragmentation on predation rates.

AB A short-term field experiment was designed to identify layers of Mediterranean macroalgal assemblage conducive to successful spread of two introduced Caulerpa species (Bryopsidales, Chlorophyta). By manipulation of species presence, three experimental assemblages were obtained: (1) encrusting algae, having removed the turf and erect species; (2) encrusting and turfing algae, having removed erect species; (3) encrusting, turfing and erect algae, that is, unmanipulated assemblages, which served as a control. Fragments of the two introduced species Caulerpa tax folia (Vahl) C. Agardh and Caulerpa racemosa (Forsskal) J. Agardh were transplanted in each of the three assemblages. Width of the colony, blade density and percentage of the substratum covered by the two species were measured.
   The susceptibility of the indigenous community to the spread of Caulerpa species was related to type of assemblage. Blade density and amount of substratum covered by the two Caulerpa species were different between species and generally greater for C taxifiolia than for C racemosa. Overall, the spread of these species was strongly dependent on the type but not directly on the complexity of the assemblage. Turf was more favourable than encrusting species alone, while the least advantageous habitat was where the macroalgal assemblage is composed of encrusting, turf and erect species. In other words, increased number of species in the assemblage reduces invasion of the Caulerpa species but the type of algae in the assemblage is likely to be more important than number of species. The presence of turf promotes the spread of Caulerpa species. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Selection of prey in poor body condition allegedly is a widespread phenomenon in predator-prey systems. Yet, it remains unclear to what extent such selection reflects impeded prey escape ability due to severe malnutrition and/or state-dependent risk taking following lesser changes in prey body condition. In systems where prey food availability is adequate, few individuals should be severely malnourished and thus condition-sensitive predation should be related principally to changes in nutritional status that occur irrespective of an individual's absolute body condition.
   2. I studied predation in snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus , Erxleben) when food was abundant, to test the prediction that change in body condition would contribute, more than would absolute body condition, to vulnerability to predation. Hares (n = 618) were radio-marked and monitored for survival while body condition was indexed during bimonthly livecaptures. A subsample of animals (n = 36) was equipped with motion-sensitive transmitters and activity patterns were examined in relation to the body condition index and vulnerability to predation.
   3. Manipulation of hare nutritional status via food supplementation improved hare body condition but did not affect vulnerability to predation; reduction of nematode parasite numbers did not improve hare condition but reduced predation among female hares. Reproductive status affected predation in both sexes, with recently pregnant females and non-scrotal males being less vulnerable to predation. Heavier males also tended to experience lower predation rates.
   4. Predation rates for both female and male hares were higher among individuals having recently experienced condition deterioration but not among animals considered to be in poor absolute condition. Yet, the parameter representing change in condition was the last to enter survival models, indicating a relatively modest effect of this factor on hare vulnerability to predation. Mammalian but not avian predators tended to kill hares in declining condition, and hare activity patterns were not correlated either to change in condition or to survival.
   5. These findings indicate that nutritional status may influence vulnerability to predation even when food is abundant, but that such effects occur indirectly through changing body condition. This implies that hares are likely to forage in a risk-prone manner when subject to worsening condition.

AB Fire, the primary natural disturbance factor in Fennoscandian boreal forests, is considered to have exerted major selection pressure on most boreal forest organisms. However, recent studies show that few ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi appear to have evolved post-fire adaptations, no succession of EM fungi following fire is apparent after low intensity fires, and only two EM fungal taxa exclusively fruit at post-fire conditions. In this paper I review the present knowledge of effects of forest fire on EM fungal communities in Fennscandian boreal forests, put into perspective by a comparison from other parts of the world. Characteristically, these boreal forests consist of less than a handful of tree species, e.g. Scots pine and Norway spruce, while the below ground communities of EM fungi is impressively species rich with presently more than 700 known taxa. Commonly, forest fires in Fennoscandia have been of low intensity, with a considerable portion of the trees surviving and the organic humus layer partly escaping combustion. Hence, EM fungi appear to largely have evolved under conditions characterised by a more or less continuous presence of their hosts. In fact, the composition of EM fungi within a forest appear be more variable due to spatial variation than due to wildfire. However, in areas with high intensity bums and high tree mortality, most EM fungi may locally be killed. Thus, the legacy of EM fungi following wildfire depends on the survival of trees, which determine the potential for mycorrhizal growth, and the combustion and heating of the organic soil, which directly correlate to mortality of mycorrhizas. The questions if and to what degree fires may be of significance for yet unidentified spatiotemporal dynamics of EM fungal populations and communities are discussed. Recent experiments indicate a few EM fungi are favoured by high intensity burn conditions whereas others disappear. The consequences of wildfires in temperate conifer forests differ considerably from those in boreal forests. Wildfires in temperate conifer forests are typically high intensity stand-replacing fires that cause a total combustion of organic layers. Subsequently, pre-fire EM fungal communities are largely eradicated and a succession of post-fire EM fungi is initiated.

AB The literature is reviewed to summarize the major indices of interspecific competition used in De Wit replacement experiments. Of the many indices that have been defined, some are less than clear as to their meaning, so interpretations are often difficult to make. In an effort to explore the performance of individual indices and to permit cross-correlation among indices, a series of hypothetical results in different competition scenarios is created. A standardized notation for all indices is also provided, along with equations and proofs. Nine indices are reviewed and analyzed for their behavior under the hypothetical scenarios and a new index that provides increased clarification and interpretability over other indices is proposed. Relative Yield Total, Aggressivity, and Relative Replacement Rate were shown to be poor measures of competition. Relative Crowding Coefficient has many restrictions to its use. The dearest index that includes two or more species is Relative Yield of Mixture. Indices that describe single species accurately were found to be Relative Yield (RY) and Relative Competition Intensity (RCI), both of which are mathematically convertible. An index introduced here, Change in Contribution (CC), is a single species index that differs from RY and RCI because it takes into account the overall biomass each species contributes.

AB Information concerning the occurrence of very young (1- to 10-year-old) tree seedlings in the alpine treeline ecotone is rare. Seedling occurrence of the dominant conifers Picea engelmannii and Abies lasiocarpa was measured in the treeline ecotone of the Medicine Bow Mountains, Wyoming (central Rocky Mountains, USA), an area composed of elongated toe islands separated by open meadows (ribbon forest) that grade into the closed forest. No seedlings were found on the windward sides of tree islands, while a mean of 0.6 seedlings.m(-2) occurred on the leeward (downward) sides. These values compared to the 4.2 seedlings.m(-2) in the closed forest. In addition, a strong correspondence was found between snowpack depth and seedling abundance, with depths that were either too shallow (< 0.5 m) or too deep (> 1.5 m) associated with fewer or no seedlings. A. lasicarpa seedlings made up much less of the overall seedling population in the ribbon forest (6%) than in the closed forest (22%). Seedling establishment in this portion of the alpine treeline ecotone appears to be occurring at a low rate that differs between the two dominant species and may be strongly influenced by wind-driven snow accumulation patterns.

AB In this study we characterized the distribution of herb and shrub species relative to landform and forest canopy attributes of streamside forests in the moist, conifer-dominated mountains of coastal Oregon. Species cover and environmental data were collected along transects at 94 sites. Species with relatively similar distributions were classified into 10 species groups to identify major patterns in the vegetation. Although these patterns were highly variable, ordination and gradient analyses indicated that vegetation composition is ordered along a complex environmental gradient running from streamside to hillslope. Similarly, species diversity followed a decreasing trend from active fluvial surfaces to lower hillslopes. Vegetation patterns were related to specific landforms, topographic positions, microsites, and coniferous tree cover within the trans-riparian gradient. We hypothesize that the environmental features correlated with these patterns are surrogates for the underlying mechanisms responsible for them. These are (i) hillslope processes and associated moisture gradients; (ii) hydrological disturbance; (iii) tolerance of saturated, valley-floor soils; (iv) shade tolerance; and (v) mineral soil disturbance. This study indicates that valley-floor and lower-slope plant communities are distinct elements in these forest landscapes, supporting the assumption that riparian zones require a different management and conservation strategy than upland forest communities.

AB Successional changes in the potential for fire propagation were analyzed in Vaccinium myrtillus type forests in northern Sweden through fuel sampling and fire simulations in stands with different time since the last fire, and ignition tests in early successional and mature vegetation. Within three decades, fine fuel on the ground reached 0.6 to 0.9 kg.m(-2) and was thereafter fairly constant at this level. In the youngest stands this fuel consisted mainly of litter from the tree canopy, whereas in the oldest stands, pleurocarpous mosses made up the majority of the load. The expansion of pleurocarpous mosses from around year 20 resulted in a shift towards a deeper and less compact fuel bed. Simulations using the Rothermel fire spread model predicted no or minimal fire spread in stands younger than 25 years, and this was corroborated by a number of unsuccessful ignitions on recently burnt sites. We suggest three phases in postfire succession with respect to fire propagation and surface fire intensity: (1) up to about 20 years after fire, no or marginal fire spread; (2) between years 20 and 50 a progressive rise in potential fire intensity; (3) from around year 50 a steady state in potential fire intensity. By setting a limit for the shortest possible fire intervals, this pattern of fuel accumulation might have a significant effect on fire frequencies in the landscape.

AB We studied to what extent changes in the breeding performance of two insectivorous passerines, the Pied Flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) and the Great Tit (Parus major) were associated with pollution-induced variation in the biomass of invertebrate prey (spiders and insects on the ground, lepidoptera and sawfly larvae in tree canopies) in an air pollution (copper smelter) gradient. At the nestling time of both species, larvae were scarce in Scotch pine (the dominant tree species) close to the factory complex, peaked in the moderately polluted zone 2-4 km from the factory, and tended to decrease farther away. Both bird species preferred pine, particularly in the moderately polluted zone, where the proportion of larvae in the diet of P. major was high. Ground-living arthropods were scarce near the factory, but among-site variation was high even in the cleanest area. Breeding success of both bird species correlated positively with prey biomass, but only in P. major was food abundance correlated with nestling growth. Also, the productivity of different-sized clutches was affected in P. major, but not in F. hypoleuca. Large F. hypoleuca clutches produced more fledglings than did smaller clutches in all parts of the pollution gradient. For P. major this was true only in the moderately or slightly polluted parts of the gradient; in the most polluted areas, clutches of 6-11 eggs invariably produced 3-4 fledglings. The stronger impact of food on P. major than on F. hypoleuca probably resulted from a different diet. F. hypoleuca, which forages much from the ground layer, was susceptible to direct effects of pollutants at the egg stage, whereas P. major; a caterpillar specialist, suffered from the shortage of larvae in the late nestling period. Our results indicate that the reduced breeding performance of birds in the polluted area may be due to various reasons; one species may respond directly to toxicity, and the other species to reduced food supply.

AB Realistic models for ecological character displacement should incorporate population genetics. In Slatkin's pioneering model (Slatkin 1980), the genetics of the quantitative character determining the competitive interactions are modeled by assuming that the character is normally distributed in each generation. Only the mean and the variance of the character distributions change over time. With symmetric ecological assumptions for the two competing species, and with normally distributed resources that are equally used by both species, this model did not yield significant displacement. This has led to the belief that ecological asymmetries or constraints on resource use, e.g., by constraining the phenotypic variances, are necessary for character displacement. I argue that the reason for the negative result in Slatkin's original model is that the genetics are modeled too rigidly. With a more flexible genetic model, obtained by explicitly modeling many loci with additive effects, character displacement occurs as a rule even for symmetric ecological assumptions and without constraints on the phenotype distributions. The model can also be used in other contexts than competition for resources. For example, character displacement in a host-parasite system can lead to parasite specialization. The results suggest that more detailed genetic models yield a finer resolution of the interaction between population genetics and ecological dynamics. Explicit genetics lead to more insights than the usual quantitative genetic assumption of normal character distribution.

AB We studied density and mean body size in populations of stream-living resident brown trout Salmo trutta, anadromous populations of S. trutta, and Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in southern Sweden using annual quantitative electric fishing during time periods ranging from 2 to 16 yr in 54 sites in nine streams. With a total of 236 observations, ANCOVA of log(population density) versus log(mean body size) showed a negative dependence with an estimated slope of -0.984 +/- 0.148 (95% confidence interval) and intercepts significantly varying among stream sites. As previously published data indicate the metabolic rate of fishes proportional to (body weight)0.9, the result supports the hypothesis of energetic equivalence; that is, the total energy flow through a population tends to be constant within but varying among sites and populations. In a review of the theory of self-thinning in food-regulated animals, we emphasize the effects of a negatively size-dependent growth and mortality; each will modify the thinning fine, but combined they will tend to compensate for each other.

AB Riverine fish assemblages in the temperate zone generally show strong longitudinal patterns of faunal turnover and increases in species richness with increasing stream order. We examined the composition and structure of tropical fish assemblages across a complex freshwater/marine ecotone in Tortuguero National Park on the Caribbean coast of Central America. Species turnover was high between four characteristic habitats that largely corresponded with a longitudinal gradient of stream order over distances of less than 30 km. Suites of common fish species characterized each habitat: creeks, rivers, lagoons, and the sea. In addition to the habitat endemics, several species spanned two habitat types, but only three species were collected in more than two habitats. Multivariate gradient analysis of fish assemblages reflected a gradient of habitats that to some extent corresponded to fluvial distances. Due to the unusual configuration of coastal lagoons lying parallel to the coast, the ordination gradient showed little correlation with linear distance to the coast. Environmental variables related to habitat size and salinity showed greatest correspondence with the fish assemblage ordination gradient. Invertebrate-feeding fishes were the predominant trophic group in 15 of 16 fish assemblages, and inland creek sites contained a greater proportion of herbivores and omnivores than other sites. The relative fraction of herbivorous and detritivorous fishes showed a monotonic decline along the longitudinal habitat gradient from inland to coast. Patterns of species composition and richness at Tortuguero Park appeared to agree well with earlier models of factors influencing temperate zone stream fishes. Headwaters have low aquatic primary productivity and contain small colonizing fish species subject to large fluctuations in local densities and intermittent competition. Lagoons contain both large and small species, the latter being restricted largely to shallow edge habitats by predation. Lagoons exhibit more lentic environmental conditions, experience relatively fewer periodic disturbances than headwaters, and their assemblages are inferred to be under relatively greater influence of biotic factors. Fish assemblages of rivers and canos (swampy side channels and braids) appear to be under less abiotic control than headwaters and influenced less by biotic factors than lagoons.

AB Much ecological research aims to explain how climate impacts biodiversity and ecosystem-level processes through functional traits that link environment with individual performance. However, the specific climatic drivers of functional diversity across space and time remain unclear due largely to limitations in the availability of paired trait and climate data. We compile and analyze a global forest dataset using a method based on abundance-weighted trait moments to assess how climate influences the shapes of whole-community trait distributions. Our approach combines abundance-weighted metrics with diverse climate factors to produce a comprehensive catalog of trait-climate relationships that differ dramatically-27% of significant results change in sign and 71% disagree on sign, significance, or both-from traditional species-weighted methods. We find that (i) functional diversity generally declines with increasing latitude and elevation, (ii) temperature variability and vapor pressure are the strongest drivers of geographic shifts in functional composition and ecological strategies, and (iii) functional composition may currently be shifting over time due to rapid climate warming. Our analysis demonstrates that climate strongly governs functional diversity and provides essential information needed to predict how biodiversity and ecosystem function will respond to climate change.

AB Tropical woody plants store similar to 230 petagrams of carbon (PgC) in their above-ground living biomass. This review suggests that these stocks are currently growing in primary forests at rates that have decreased in recent decades. Droughts are an important mechanism in reducing forest C uptake and stocks by decreasing photosynthesis, elevating tree mortality, increasing autotrophic respiration, and promoting wildfires. Tropical forests were a C source to the atmosphere during the 2015-2016 El Nino-related drought, with some estimates suggesting that up to 2.3 PgC were released. With continued climate change, the intensity and frequency of droughts and fires will likely increase. It is unclear at what point the impacts of severe, repeated disturbances by drought and fires could exceed tropical forests' capacity to recover. Although specific threshold conditions beyond which ecosystem properties could lead to alternative stable states are largely unknown, the growing body of scientific evidence points to such threshold conditions becoming more likely as climate and land use change across the tropics.
   Droughts have reduced forest carbon uptake and stocks by elevating tree mortality, increasing autotrophic respiration, and promoting wildfires.
   Threshold conditions beyond which tropical forests are pushed into alternative stable states are becoming more likely as effects of droughts intensify.

AB Developments in high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) technology have rapidly advanced the understanding of overall microbial ecology as well as occurrence and diversity of specific genes within diverse environments. In the present study, we compared the ability of varying sequencing depths to generate meaningful information about the taxonomic structure and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the bovine fecal microbial community. Metagenomic sequencing was conducted on eight composite fecal samples originating from four beef cattle feedlots. Metagenomic DNA was sequenced to various depths, D1, D0.5 and D0.25, with average sample read counts of 117, 59 and 26 million, respectively. A comparative analysis of the relative abundance of reads aligning to different phyla and antimicrobial classes indicated that the relative proportions of read assignments remained fairly constant regardless of depth. However, the number of reads being assigned to ARGs as well as to microbial taxa increased significantly with increasing depth. We found a depth of D0.5 was suitable to describe the microbiome and resistome of cattle fecal samples. This study helps define a balance between cost and required sequencing depth to acquire meaningful results.

AB The ability to quantify the (dis)similarity between detrital age distributions is an essential aspect of sedimentary provenance studies. This paper reviews three different ways to do this. A first class of dissimilarity measures is based on parametric hypothesis tests such as the t- or chi-square test. These are designed to objectively decide whether two samples were derived from a common population. Appealing though such tests may appear in theory, in practice they offer limited value to sedimentary geologists because their outcome depends on sample size. In contrast, the effect size of said tests is independent of sample size and can be used as an objective point of comparison between detrital age distributions. The main limitation of this approach is that it requires binning or averaging, which discards valuable information. A second class of dissimilarity measures is based on non parametric hypothesis tests such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. These do not require pre-treatment of the data and are able to capture more subtle differences between age distributions. Unfortunately, non-parametric tests do not have well defined sample effect sizes and so it is not possible to use them as an absolute point of comparison that is independent of sample size. Nevertheless, non-parametric dissimilarity measures can be used to quantify the relative differences between samples. A third class of dissimilarity measures aims to account for the analytical uncertainties of the age determinations. The likeness and cross-correlation coefficients are ad-hoc dissimilarity measures that are based on Probability Density Plots (PDPs). These apply a narrow smoothing kernel to precise data, and a wide smoothing kernel to imprecise data. In contrast, the Sircombe-Hazelton L2 norm uses Kernel Functional Estimates (KFE5), which use exactly the opposite strategy as PDPs. They apply a wide smoothing kernel to precise data, and a narrow smoothing kernel to imprecise data. This paper shows that the KFE-based approach produces sensible results, whereas the likeness and cross-correlation methods do not. The added complexity of the KFE approach is only worth the effort in studies that combine data acquired on equipment with hugely variable analytical precision. In most cases, there is no need to account for the analytical uncertainty of detrital age distributions. The sample effect size, non-parametric statistics, or L2-norm can be used to graphically compare samples by Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). In contrast with previous claims, there is no need for these measures to be independent of sample size for this purpose.

AB Pleistocene extinctions affected mainly large-bodied animals, determining the loss or changes in numerous ecological functions. Evidence points to a central role of many extinct megafauna herbivores as seed dispersers. An important step in understanding the legacy of extinct mutualistic interactions is to evaluate the roles and effectiveness of megafauna herbivores in seed dispersal. Here we use morphological and ecophysiological allometries to estimate both quantitative and qualitative aspects of seed-dispersal services likely provided by extinct megafauna. We developed a mechanistic model that encompasses four stages of seed dispersal - seed ingestion, gut retention, animal movement, and seed deposition. We estimate seed-dispersal kernels through simulations to infer the role of Pleistocene megafauna in promoting long-distance dispersal and examine how seed dispersal was affected by extinctions. Simulations suggest extinct large-bodied frugivores would frequently disperse large seeds over a thousand meters, whereas smaller-bodied frugivores are more likely to deposit the seeds over a few hundred meters. Moreover, events of long-distance seed dispersal by the extinct megafauna would be up to ten times longer than long-distance dispersal by smaller-sized extant mammals. By estimating the combined distribution of seed dispersal distances considering all large-bodied mammalian frugivores in specific South American Pleistocene assemblages we found that long-distance dispersal contracted by at least two thirds after the megafauna died out. The disruption of long-distance dispersal is expected to have consequences for recruitment, spatial and genetic structure of plant populations, population persistence and community composition. Promoting long-distance seed dispersal was one among other salient features of extinct Pleistocene megafauna that reveal their influence on natural ecosystems. Modeling the consequences of megafaunal extinctions can offer quantitative predictions on the consequences of ongoing defaunation to plant populations and ecological communities.

AB Protected areas (PAs) are intended to provide native biodiversity and habitats with a refuge against the impacts of global change, particularly acting as natural filters against biological invasions. In practice, however, it is unknown how effective PAs will be in shielding native species from invasions under projected climate change. Here, we investigate the current and future potential distributions of 100 of the most invasive terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species in Europe. We use this information to evaluate the combined threat posed by climate change and invasions to existing PAs and the most susceptible species they shelter. We found that only a quarter of Europe's marine and terrestrial areas protected over the last 100years have been colonized by any of the invaders investigated, despite offering climatically suitable conditions for invasion. In addition, hotspots of invasive species and the most susceptible native species to their establishment do not match at large continental scales. Furthermore, the predicted richness of invaders is 11%-18% significantly lower inside PAs than outside them. Invasive species are rare in long-established national parks and nature reserves, which are actively protected and often located in remote and pristine regions with very low human density. In contrast, the richness of invasive species is high in the more recently designated Natura 2000 sites, which are subject to high human accessibility. This situation may change in the future, since our models anticipate important shifts in species ranges toward the north and east of Europe at unprecedented rates of 14-55km/decade, depending on taxonomic group and scenario. This may seriously compromise the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. This study is the first comprehensive assessment of the resistance that PAs provide against biological invasions and climate change on a continental scale and illustrates their strategic value in safeguarding native biodiversity.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has one of the poorest survival rates among cancers. Using multi-regional sampling of nine resected HCC with different aetiologies, here we construct phylogenetic relationships of these sectors, showing diverse levels of genetic sharing, spanning early to late diversification. Unlike the variegated pattern found in colorectal cancers, a large proportion of HCC display a clear isolation-by-distance pattern where spatially closer sectors are genetically more similar. Two resected intra-hepatic metastases showed genetic divergence occurring before and after primary tumour diversification, respectively. Metastatic tumours had much higher variability than their primary tumours, suggesting that intra-hepatic metastasis is accompanied by rapid diversification at the distant location. The presence of co-existing mutations offers the possibility of drug repositioning for HCC treatment. Taken together, these insights into intra-tumour heterogeneity allow for a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary trajectories of HCC and suggest novel avenues for personalized therapy.

AB Metacommunity ecology has rapidly become a dominant framework through which ecologists understand the natural world. Unfortunately, persistent misunderstandings regarding metacommunity theory and the methods for evaluating hypotheses based on the theory are common in the ecological literature. Since its beginnings, four major paradigms-species sorting, mass effects, neutrality, and patch dynamics-have been associated with metacommunity ecology. The Big 4 have been misconstrued to represent the complete set of metacommunity dynamics. As a result, many investigators attempt to evaluate community assembly processes as strictly belonging to one of the Big 4 types, rather than embracing the full scope of metacommunity theory. The Big 4 were never intended to represent the entire spectrum of metacommunity dynamics and were rather examples of historical paradigms that fit within the new framework. We argue that perpetuation of the Big 4 typology hurts community ecology and we encourage researchers to embrace the full inference space of metacommunity theory. A related, but distinct issue is that the technique of variation partitioning is often used to evaluate the dynamics of metacommunities. This methodology has produced its own set of misunderstandings, some of which are directly a product of the Big 4 typology and others which are simply the product of poor study design or statistical artefacts. However, variation partitioning is a potentially powerful technique when used appropriately and we identify several strategies for successful utilization of variation partitioning.

AB Heritable microbes represent an important component of the biology, ecology and evolution of many plants, animals and fungi, acting as both parasites and partners. In this review, we examine how heritable symbiont-host interactions may alter host thermal tolerance, and how the dynamics of these interactions may more generally be altered by thermal environment. Obligate symbionts, those required by their host, are considered to represent a thermally sensitive weak point for their host, associated with accumulation of deleterious mutations. As such, these symbionts may represent an important determinant of host thermal envelope and spatial distribution. We then examine the varied relationship between thermal environment and the frequency of facultative symbionts that provide ecologically contingent benefits or act as parasites. We note that some facultative symbionts directly alter host thermotolerance. We outline how thermal environment will alter the benefits/costs of infection more widely, and additionally modulate vertical transmission efficiency. Multiple patterns are observed, with symbionts being cold sensitive in some species and heat sensitive in others, with varying and non-coincident thresholds at which phenotype and transmission are ablated. Nevertheless, it is clear that studies aiming to predict ecological and evolutionary dynamics of symbiont-host interactions need to examine the interaction across a range of thermal environments. Finally, we discuss the importance of thermal sensitivity in predicting the success/failure of symbionts to spread into novel species following natural/engineered introduction.

AB Poor communication between academic researchers and wildlife managers limits conservation progress and innovation. As a result, input from overlapping fields, such as animal behaviour, is underused in conservation management despite its demonstrated utility as a conservation tool and countless papers advocating its use. Communication and collaboration across these two disciplines are unlikely to improve without clearly identified management needs and demonstrable impacts of behavioural-based conservation management. To facilitate this process, a team of wildlife managers and animal behaviour researchers conducted a research prioritisation exercise, identifying 50 key questions that have great potential to resolve critical conservation and management problems. The resulting agenda highlights the diversity and extent of advances that both fields could achieve through collaboration.

TI Large-scale benchmarking reveals false discoveries and count

ID DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS; PACKAGE
AB Background: There is an immense scientific interest in the human microbiome and its effects on human physiology, health, and disease. A common approach for examining bacterial communities is high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene hypervariable regions, aggregating sequence-similar amplicons into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Strategies for detecting differential relative abundance of OTUs between sample conditions include classical statistical approaches as well as a plethora of newer methods, many borrowing from the related field of RNA-seq analysis. This effort is complicated by unique data characteristics, including sparsity, sequencing depth variation, and nonconformity of read counts to theoretical distributions, which is often exacerbated by exploratory and/or unbalanced study designs. Here, we assess the robustness of available methods for (1) inference in differential relative abundance analysis and (2) beta-diversity-based sample separation, using a rigorous benchmarking framework based on large clinical 16S microbiome datasets from different sources.
   Results: Running more than 380,000 full differential relative abundance tests on real datasets with permuted case/control assignments and in silico-spiked OTUs, we identify large differences in method performance on a range of parameters, including false positive rates, sensitivity to sparsity and case/control balances, and spike-in retrieval rate. In large datasets, methods with the highest false positive rates also tend to have the best detection power. For beta-diversity-based sample separation, we show that library size normalization has very little effect and that the distance metric is the most important factor in terms of separation power.
   Conclusions: Our results, generalizable to datasets from different sequencing platforms, demonstrate how the choice of method considerably affects analysis outcome. Here, we give recommendations for tools that exhibit low false positive rates, have good retrieval power across effect sizes and case/control proportions, and have low sparsity bias. Result output from some commonly used methods should be interpreted with caution. We provide an easily extensible framework for benchmarking of new methods and future microbiome datasets.

AB Context Anthropogenic landscape simplification and natural habitat loss can negatively affect wild bees. Alternatively, anthropogenic land-use change may diversify landscapes, creating complementary habitats that maintain overall resource continuity and diversity.
   Objectives We examined the effects of landscape composition, including land-cover diversity and percent semi-natural habitat, on wild bee abundance and species richness within apples, a pollinator-dependent crop. We also explored whether different habitats within diverse landscapes can provide complementary floral resources for bees across space and time.
   Methods We sampled bees during apple bloom over 2 years within 35 orchards varying in surrounding landscape diversity and percent woodland (the dominant semi-natural habitat) at 1 km radii. To assess habitat complementarity in resource diversity and temporal continuity, we sampled flowers and bees within four unique habitats, including orchards, woodlands, semi-natural grasslands, and annual croplands, over three periods from April-June.
   Results Surrounding landscape diversity positively affected both wild bee abundance and richness within orchards during bloom. Habitats in diverse landscapes had different flower communities with varying phenologies; flowers were most abundant within orchards and woodlands in mid-spring, but then declined over time, while flowers within grasslands marginally increased throughout spring. Furthermore, bee communities were significantly different between the closed-canopy habitats, orchards and woodlands, and the open habitats, grasslands and annual croplands.
   Conclusions Our results suggest that diverse landscapes, such as ones with both open (grassland) and closed (woodland) semi-natural habitats, support spring wild bees by providing flowers throughout the entire foraging period and diverse niches to meet different species' requirements.

AB Occurrence and removal of six high-production high-volume neonicotinoids was investigated in 13 conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and one engineered wetland. Flow-weighted daily composites were analyzed by isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, revealing the occurrence of imidacloprid, acetamiprid, and clothianidin at ng/L concentrations in WWTP influent (60.5 +/- 40.0; 2.9 +/- 1.9; 149.7 +/- 289.5, respectively) and effluent (58.5 +/- 29.1; 2.3 +/- 1.4; 70.2 +/- 121.8, respectively). A mass balance showed insignificant removal of imidacloprid (p = 0.09, CI = 95%) and limited removal of the sum of acetamiprid and its de gradate, acetamiprid-N-desmethyl (18 +/- 4%, p = 0.01, CI = 95%). Clothianidin was found only intermittently, whereas thiamethoxam, thiacloprid, and dinotefuran were never detected. In the wetland, no removal of imidacloprid or acetamiprid was observed. Extrapolation of data from 13 WWTPs to the nation as a whole suggests annual discharges on the order of 1000-3400 kg/y of imidacloprid contained in treated effluent to surface waters nationwide. This first mass balance and first United States nationwide wastewater reconnaissance identified imidacloprid, acetamiprid, and Clothianidin as recalcitrant sewage constituents that persist through wastewater treatment to enter water bodies at significant loadings, potentially harmful to sensitive aquatic invertebrates.

AB The quantification of landscape structures from remote-sensing products is an important part of many analyses in landscape ecology studies. This paper introduces a new free and open-source tool for conducting landscape ecology analysis. LecoS is able to compute a variety of basic and advanced landscape metrics in an automatized way. The calculation can furthermore be partitioned by iterating through an optional provided polygon layer. The new tool is integrated into the QGIS processing framework and can thus be used as a stand-alone tool or within bigger complex models. For illustration a potential case-study is presented, which tries to quantify pollinator responses on landscape derived metrics at various scales. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ursine bears are a mammalian subfamily that comprises six morphologically and ecologically distinct extant species. Previous phylogenetic analyses of concatenated nuclear genes could not resolve all relationships among bears, and appeared to conflict with the mitochondrial phylogeny. Evolutionary processes such as incomplete lineage sorting and introgression can cause gene tree discordance and complicate phylogenetic inferences, but are not accounted for in phylogenetic analyses of concatenated data. We generated a high-resolution data set of autosomal introns from several individuals per species and of Y-chromosomal markers. Incorporating intraspecific variability in coalescence-based phylogenetic and gene flow estimation approaches, we traced the genealogical history of individual alleles. Considerable heterogeneity among nuclear loci and discordance between nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies were found. A species tree with divergence time estimates indicated that ursine bears diversified within less than 2 My. Consistent with a complex branching order within a clade of Asian bear species, we identified unidirectional gene flow from Asian black into sloth bears. Moreover, gene flow detected from brown into American black bears can explain the conflicting placement of the American black bear in mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies. These results highlight that both incomplete lineage sorting and introgression are prominent evolutionary forces even on time scales up to several million years. Complex evolutionary patterns are not adequately captured by strictly bifurcating models, and can only be fully understood when analyzing multiple independently inherited loci in a coalescence framework. Phylogenetic incongruence among gene trees hence needs to be recognized as a biologically meaningful signal.

AB Background: Renewable lignocellulosic biomass is an advantageous resource for the production of second generation biofuels and other biorefinery products. In Middle Europe, wheat straw is one of the most abundant low-cost sources of lignocellulosic biomass. For its efficient use, an efficient mix of cellulases and hemicellulases is required. In this paper, we investigated how cellulase production by T. reesei on wheat straw compares to that on lactose, the only soluble and also cheap inducing carbon source for enzyme production.
   Results: We have examined and compared the transcriptome of T. reesei growing on wheat straw and lactose as carbon sources under otherwise similar conditions. Gene expression on wheat straw exceeded that on lactose, and 1619 genes were found to be only induced on wheat straw but not on lactose. They comprised 30% of the CAZome, but were also enriched in genes associated with phospholipid metabolism, DNA synthesis and repair, iron homeostatis and autophagy. Two thirds of the CAZome was expressed both on wheat straw as well as on lactose, but 60% of it at least >2-fold higher on the former. Major wheat straw specific genes comprised xylanases, chitinases and mannosidases. Interestingly, the latter two CAZyme families were significantly higher expressed in a strain in which xyr1 encoding the major regulator of cellulase and hemicellulase biosynthesis is non-functional.
   Conclusions: Our data reveal several major differences in the transcriptome between wheat straw and lactose which may be related to the higher enzyme formation on the former and their further investigation could lead to the development of methods for increasing enzyme production on lactose.

AB The perceived popularity of animals plays a crucial role in their support by the general public and consequently in the success of conservation efforts. We experimentally investigated with Slovak schoolchildren the role of animal coloration and basic human emotions in the willingness to protect animals. Both unaltered and experimentally manipulated pictures of aposematic animals increased perceived danger. Spiders and snakes were perceived as more dangerous/disgusting than other taxa, particularly birds and mammals. Children showed significantly a stronger willingness to protect aposematic animals over inconspicuous, cryptic animals. Perceived disgust and danger of animals negatively correlated with a willingness to protect them with females showing greater fear of animals than males. Our results suggest that the use of aposematic animals in conservation programs may increase their popularity and public support.

AB Latitudinal patterns of nonnative species richness suggest fewer successful invasions in the tropics, relative to temperate regions. One main hypothesis for this pattern is that biotic resistance to invasion is stronger in the tropics than at higher latitudes. Biotic resistance can limit the distribution and abundance of nonnative species and, in extreme cases, can prevent establishment. We provide the first experimental test of this hypothesis, comparing the strength of biotic resistance in a tropical and a temperate marine ecosystem. Predation is one mechanism of biotic resistance, and since predation can be stronger at lower latitudes, we predicted that predation will serve to increase biotic resistance more in the tropics than at higher latitude. We conducted predator-exclusion experiments on marine epifaunal communities, a heavily invaded system, focusing on nonnative tunicates as a model fauna. The effect of predation on species richness of nonnative tunicates was more than three times greater at sites in tropical Panama than in temperate Connecticut, consistent with the prediction of stronger biotic resistance in the tropics. In Connecticut, predation reduced the abundance of one nonnative tunicate but did not affect the abundances of any other nonnative tunicate species, and no species were excluded from communities. In contrast, predation resulted in striking reductions in abundance and often exclusion of nonnative tunicates from experimental communities in Panama. If proved to be general, latitudinal differences in the biotic resistance of communities to nonnative species establishment may help explain emerging patterns of global invasions.

AB Fine sediment is one of the major sources of stream physical and ecological impairment worldwide. We assessed the ecological effects of fine sediment in an otherwise undisturbed catchment (the Isabena, NE Spain). Using data from sites across the catchment we describe the spatial variability and nestedness of invertebrate assemblages and evaluate the effectiveness of compositional (taxon-based) and functional (trait-based) metrics for detecting sediment impacts on these assemblages.
   Invertebrate assemblages were relatively taxon poor and had low densities in those locations with high fine sediment content. Assemblages showed significantly nested patterns, with those in sediment-rich locations consisting of a subset of those in locations with little fine sediment. A number of biological traits appeared to promote this nestedness, particularly those conferring resistance and resilience to fine sediment (polivoltinism, short live cycles and small body sizes).
   Generalised Additive Models indicated that most metrics were able to detect ecological responses to sedimentation. Some taxon-based metrics (%EPT and evenness) performed less well, with values showing only a weak relationship with fine sediment. Results are consistent with previous studies which have highlighted the limitations of taxon-based metrics and suggest that indices of functional diversity are capable of detecting sediment related impairment.
   Overall, the study suggests that fine sediment in the Isabena was selecting for specific life-history traits, and that this selection resulted in clear differences in assemblage structure across the catchment. The use of biological traits in studies of sediment related disturbance may help identify extinction-prone species (e.g. those with univoltine and/or long life-cycles), while trait-based monitoring and assessment metrics, because they reflect the ecological mechanisms underlying observed patterns, should prove useful to help guide management in catchments subjected to excessive fine sediment. More broadly, the study indicates that nestedness in assemblage structure can be driven by local habitat changes, and not only by large scale biogeographical processes. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Male reproductive success is influenced by competitive interactions during precopulatory and postcopulatory selective episodes. Consequently, males can gain reproductive advantages during precopulatory contest competition by investing in weaponry and during postcopulatory sperm competition by investing in ejaculates. However, recent theory predicts male expenditure on weaponry and ejaculates should be subject to a trade-off, and should vary under increasing risk and intensity of sperm competition. Here, we provide the first comparative analysis of the prediction that expenditure on weaponry should be negatively associated with expenditure on testes mass. Specifically, we assess how sexual selection influences the evolution of primary and secondary sexual traits among pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses). Using recently developed comparative methods, we demonstrate that sexual selection promotes rapid divergence in body mass, sexual size dimorphism (SSD), and genital morphology. We then show that genital length appears to be positively associated with the strength of postcopulatory sexual selection. However, subsequent analyses reveal that both genital length and testes mass are negatively associated with investment in precopulatory weaponry. Thus, our results are congruent with recent theoretical predictions of contest-based sperm competition models. We discuss the possible role of trade-offs and allometry in influencing patterns of reproductive trait evolution in pinnipeds.

AB Tropical forests play a major role in regulating global carbon (C) fluxes and stocks, and even small changes to C cycling in this productive biome could dramatically affect atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. Temperature is expected to increase over all land surfaces in the future, yet we have a surprisingly poor understanding of how tropical forests will respond to this significant climatic change. Here we present a contemporary synthesis of the existing data and what they suggest about how tropical forests will respond to increasing temperatures. Our goals were to: (i) determine whether there is enough evidence to support the conclusion that increased temperature will affect tropical forest C balance; (ii) if there is sufficient evidence, determine what direction this effect will take; and, (iii) establish what steps should to be taken to resolve the uncertainties surrounding tropical forest responses to increasing temperatures. We approach these questions from a mass-balance perspective and therefore focus primarily on the effects of temperature on inputs and outputs of C, spanning microbial- to ecosystem-scale responses. We found that, while there is the strong potential for temperature to affect processes related to C cycling and storage in tropical forests, a notable lack of data combined with the physical, biological and chemical diversity of the forests themselves make it difficult to resolve this issue with certainty. We suggest a variety of experimental approaches that could help elucidate how tropical forests will respond to warming, including large-scale in situ manipulation experiments, longer term field experiments, the incorporation of a range of scales in the investigation of warming effects (both spatial and temporal), as well as the inclusion of a diversity of tropical forest sites. Finally, we highlight areas of tropical forest research where notably few data are available, including temperature effects on: nutrient cycling, heterotrophic versus autotrophic respiration, thermal acclimation versus substrate limitation of plant and microbial communities, below-ground C allocation, species composition (plant and microbial), and the hydraulic architecture of roots. Whether or not tropical forests will become a source or a sink of C in a warmer world remains highly uncertain. Given the importance of these ecosystems to the global C budget, resolving this uncertainty is a primary research priority.

AB The thermal limits of individual animals were originally proposed as a link between animal physiology and thermal ecology. Although this link is valid in theory, the evaluation of physiological tolerances involves some problems that are the focus of this study. One rationale was that heating rates shall influence upper critical limits, so that ecological thermal limits need to consider experimental heating rates. In addition, if thermal limits are not surpassed in experiments, subsequent tests of the same individual should yield similar results or produce evidence of hardening. Finally, several non-controlled variables such as time under experimental conditions and procedures may affect results. To analyze these issues we conducted an integrative study of upper critical temperatures in a single species, the ant Atta sexdens rubropiosa, an animal model providing large numbers of individuals of diverse sizes but similar genetic makeup. Our specific aims were to test the 1) influence of heating rates in the experimental evaluation of upper critical temperature, 2) assumptions of absence of physical damage and reproducibility, and 3) sources of variance often overlooked in the thermal-limits literature; and 4) to introduce some experimental approaches that may help researchers to separate physiological and methodological issues. The upper thermal limits were influenced by both heating rates and body mass. In the latter case, the effect was physiological rather than methodological. The critical temperature decreased during subsequent tests performed on the same individual ants, even one week after the initial test. Accordingly, upper thermal limits may have been overestimated by our (and typical) protocols. Heating rates, body mass, procedures independent of temperature and other variables may affect the estimation of upper critical temperatures. Therefore, based on our data, we offer suggestions to enhance the quality of measurements, and offer recommendations to authors aiming to compile and analyze databases from the literature.

AB In a variety of taxa, male reproductive success is positively related to the expression of costly traits such as large body size, ornaments, armaments, and aggression. These traits are thought to improve male competitive ability and, thus, access to limited reproductive resources. Females of many species also express competitive traits. However, we know very little about the consequences of individual variation in competitive traits and the mechanisms that regulate their expression in females. Consequently, it is currently unclear whether females express competitive traits owing to direct selection or as an indirect result of selection on males. Here, we examine females of a mildly dimorphic songbird (Junco hyemalis) to determine whether females show positive covariance in traits (morphology and behavior) that may be important in a competition. We also examine whether trait expression relates either to testosterone (T) in terms of mechanism or to reproductive success in terms of function. We found that larger females were more aggressive and that greater ability to produce T in response to a physiological challenge consisting of a standardized injection of gonadotropin-releasing hormone predicted some measures of female body size and aggression. Finally, we found that aggressive females had greater reproductive success. We conclude that T may influence female phenotype and that females may benefit from expressing a competitive phenotype. We also suggest that the mild dimorphism observed in many species may be due in part to direct selection on females rather than simply a correlated response to selection in males.

ID MANAGEMENT; POLICY
AB This paper explores issues of theoretical design and application arising from ecosystem service based approaches to natural resource management. Conserving ecosystem services is now a key normative goal of environmental decision making, but the implications of embracing this concept are still little understood. In this paper I highlight two recurring and cross-cutting aspects of an ecosystems approach around which credible treatments of ecosystem services can be realized, not only in theory, but also in practice: first, the need to think 'holistically' about how any given project, proposal or plan would impact on service provision and human well-being; and, second, the need to manage ecosystem services in relation to wider stake-holder values, needs and priorities. While thinking about decision making from the perspective of ecosystem services is no panacea for sustainability, the paper points to a number of social science issues that interdisciplinary researchers could usefully address in these two contexts if they are to harness this concept in creative and critically engaged ways.

AB Introduction of new technologies is necessarily a social and cultural transformation that implies adaptation to a new context, co-created by the interaction between those intervened and interveners. Sustainable technologies should be aimed to preserve basic functions of socio-ecological systems while limiting evolution of unsustainable practices, as it is the case of non-conventional renewable energy sources.
   In this research we propose a methodology of intervention for the introduction of smart microgrid system in a rural community. The introduction of new energy technologies in a rural setting is a challenge, since it generates changes in patters of energy use that affect the demand of the system. Smart microgrid systems have the advantage of being more resilient than conventional approaches to renewable energy, as they can adapt to changes in the demand and through time.
   The proposed methodology is based on the concept of a community as a socio-ecological system approach affected by a technological intervention, aimed to move towards a stage of more sustainable use of resources. The method is divided in three stages, each one focused on enhancing elements of the socio-ecological systems and integration among stakeholders: trust, diversity, boundaries of the system, territoriality, adaptability and reflexivity.
   This methodology is validated in a case study on smart microgrids development in a rural community in the north of Chile. The application of this methodology highlights the importance of learning processes among stakeholders, specially the development of reflexivity within developers. Adoption and adaptation to new technologies depends on the characteristics of each community, but it can be enhanced when participation shapes the evolution of the technological intervention, opening up to a diversity of expectations associated to the complexity of the system.

AB The Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae), (medfly) is a polyphagous and cosmopolitan agricultural pest, targeted in many areas for control by the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT). Our objective in the present study was to test the hypothesis that a bacterially enriched diet provided to sterile males will improve their sexual performance in competitive settings that emulate natural conditions. Specifically we determined how feeding on diets enriched with Klebsiella oxytoca affected the ability of sterile males to compete for wild females against wild males, their ability to inhibit female receptivity, and their survival. We found that enriching the sterile male diet with K. oxytoca significantly improved mating competitiveness in the laboratory and in field cages. In addition, bacterially enriched sterile males inhibited female receptivity more efficiently than sugar fed males and survived longer duration of starvation. We conclude that inoculating mass reared sterile flies with bacteria prior to their release is a valid approach to improve the efficacy of SIT.

AB Our understanding of the spatial organization of root diversity in plant communities and of the mechanisms of community assembly has been limited by our ability to identify plants based on root tissue, especially in diverse communities. Here, we test the effectiveness of the plastid gene rbcL, a core plant DNA barcoding marker, for investigating spatial patterns of root diversity, and relate observed patterns to above-ground community structure. We collected 3800 root fragments from four randomly positioned, 1-m-deep soil profiles (two vertical transects per plot), located in an old-field community in southern Ontario, Canada, and extracted and sequenced DNA from 1531 subsampled fragments. We identified species by comparing sequences with a DNA barcode reference library developed previously for the local flora. Nearly 85% of sampled root fragments were successfully sequenced and identified as belonging to 29 plant species or species groups. Root abundance and species richness varied in horizontal space and were negatively correlated with soil depth. The relative abundance of taxa below-ground was correlated with their frequency above-ground (r = 0.73, P = 0.0001), but several species detected in root tissue were not observed in above-ground quadrats. Multivariate analyses indicated that diversity was highly structured below-ground, and associated with depth, root morphology, soil chemistry and soil texture, whereas little structure was evident above-ground. Furthermore, analyses of species co-occurrence indicates strong species segregation overall but random co-occurrence among confamilials. Our results provide insights into the role of environmental filtering and competitive interactions in the organization of plant diversity below-ground, and also demonstrate the utility of barcoding for the identification of plant roots.

AB The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) is used as an indicator of leaf and plant canopy photosynthetic efficiency. However, the photosynthetic efficiency-PRI relationship has been shown to be inconsistent over time, likely due to changes in foliar pigment content.
   We measured reflectance spectra and biochemical properties from 24 leaves of two deciduous tree species and acquired pigment and reflectance data from the Leaf Optical Properties EXperiment database for an additional nine species. These data were used as inputs for the PROSPECT-5 leaf optical model. We found measurements of PRI to be significantly (p<0.05) correlated with chlorophyll content, carotenoid content, and the carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio. However, only the PRI-carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio relationship was consistent across all analyses. Two predictive equations were derived from PROSPECT-5 simulations: a curvilinear PRI model (PRI(clm)) predicted the carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio (r(2) = 0.99), and a linear model using the chlorophyll index (CI(lm)) predicted chlorophyll content (r(2) = 0.98). Multiplying PRI(clm) with Cl (lm) canceled the influence of chlorophyll content on PRI(clm) and thus allowed for prediction of carotenoid content from 11 deciduous tree species (r(2) = 0.83). Our results confirm that the PRI is significantly influenced by chlorophyll and carotenoid pools and demonstrate a new approach for non-destructive estimation of leaf carotenoid content using the PRI. Because variation in foliar physiological status is known to relate to leaf carotenoid content and the carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio, convolving the PRI with a chlorophyll index is likely to be useful for understanding the photosynthetic performance of deciduous vegetation across a wide range of temporal periods, ranging from daily to seasonal time scales.

AB Invasion biology is a growing discipline with clear ecological, social and economic implications. A wide range of research effort is thus required to address the invasion problem, and literature on the topic is extensive. However, the extent to which the invasion biology research is addressing the challenges associated with management and mitigation of the impacts of invasions has been questioned. Using bibliometric analysis, we investigated the extent to which the literature on the subject contributes to implementation of knowledge generated, by addressing aspects of management, policy, and/or implementation; the impact of these papers as indicated by the number of citations they attract; and the geopolitical scale of focus of invasion ecology papers, particularly those that attempt to bridge the knowing-doing gap. We then compared these findings with the information needs of conservation practitioners. We first looked globally at popular search engines and then narrowed our focus to South Africa-one of three regions outside USA where researchers producing highly cited papers in invasion ecology are well represented. At this level, we conducted a content analysis of invasion ecology-related papers, of which at least one author was affiliated to a South African institution. The knowledge base in the field of invasion biology is comprised largely of research oriented towards "knowing", while research aimed at strategically applying or implementing that knowledge is poorly represented in the scientific literature, and the scale of its emphasis is not local. Conservation practitioners clearly indicate a need for basic knowledge. However, invasion science must develop channels for effective engagement to ensure that the research is contextualised, and will deal with the complex ecological, social and economic challenges posed by invasions.

AB In this paper, we provide an overview of the distribution and invasive status of non-native species in the Italian flora across its administrative regions, biogeographic regions and main land use types, and a synthesis of current knowledge on the threats they pose within the country. The information on non-native plant species collected during the project oA survey of the non-native Italian florao was used to compile comprehensive regional and national databases. The number of non-native species within a given administrative region increases in proportion to its size, resident population density and latitude, reaching the highest values in the intensively cultivated, heavily industrialized and urbanized Po Plain in northern Italy. The number of casual species is positively correlated with the number of yearly visitors in each region and negatively correlated with the proportion of mountainous terrain within the region. If compared with the Continental and Mediterranean biogeographic regions, the Alpine region yields the lowest number of non-native species and lowest proportion of casual species. The number and density of introduced species is highest in artificial land use types, particularly in urban areas. A negative impact is reported to be exerted by 203 species, most of which are agricultural weeds.

AB P>1. Plant genotypic diversity has important consequences for a variety of ecosystem processes, yet empirical evidence for its effects on productivity, one of the most fundamental of these processes, is lacking. In addition, the performance of insect herbivores in response to high genotypic diversity is unknown, despite previous work demonstrating differential herbivore performance among plant genotypes.
   2. We manipulated genotypic diversity of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana in both the presence and absence of the generalist herbivore Trichoplusia ni under semi-natural growth conditions. We used nine genotypes (eight ecotypes and one mutant) of A. thaliana known to differ widely in functional traits. Productivity and insect biomass were measured in monocultures and mixtures of all nine genotypes grown at multiple fertilization levels and planting densities.
   3. In both the absence and presence of herbivores, genotypic diversity increased plant productivity and survival. This effect was, for the most part, independent of fertility or density. Sampling or selection effects did not appear to be wholly responsible for these results as all genotypes were maintained in equal proportion and no single genotype became dominant for the duration of the experiment.
   4. High diversity increased T. ni biomass and survival in all treatments. Insect biomass was positively, but not tightly, correlated to plant biomass, indicating that the higher herbivore performance observed in genotypic mixtures was only partially due to higher productivity.
   5.Synthesis. Our data support the idea that even within a single plant species, genotypic diversity can exert strong influences on both the producer and herbivore communities. The exact mechanisms responsible for these effects and the relative importance of genotypic diversity in natural communities warrant further investigation.
