AB A major challenge for advancing our understanding of the functional role of soil microbial communities is to link changes in their structure and function under climate change. To address this challenge requires new understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the capacity of soil microbial communities to resist and recover from climate extremes. Here, we synthesize emerging understanding of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence the resistance and resilience of soil microbial communities to climate extremes, with a focus on drought, and identify drivers that might trigger abrupt changes to alternative states. We highlight research challenges and propose a path for advancing our understanding of the resistance and resilience of soil microbial communities to climate extremes, and of their vulnerability to transitions to alternative states, including the use of trait-based approaches. We identify a need for new approaches to quantify resistance and resilience of soil microbial communities, and to identify thresholds for transitions to alternative states. We show how high-resolution time series coupled with gradient designs will enable detecting response patterns to interacting drivers. Finally, to account for extrinsic factors, we suggest that future studies should use environmental gradients to track soil microbial community responses to climate extremes in space and time.

AB Land surface models (LSMs) typically use empirical functions to represent vegetation responses to soil drought. These functions largely neglect recent advances in plant ecophysiology that link xylem hydraulic functioning with stomatal responses to climate.
   We developed an analytical stomatal optimization model based on xylem hydraulics (SOX) to predict plant responses to drought. Coupling SOX to the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) LSM, we conducted a global evaluation of SOX against leaf- and ecosystem-level observations.
   SOX simulates leaf stomatal conductance responses to climate for woody plants more accurately and parsimoniously than the existing JULES stomatal conductance model. An ecosystem-level evaluation at 70 eddy flux sites shows that SOX decreases the sensitivity of gross primary productivity (GPP) to soil moisture, which improves the model agreement with observations and increases the predicted annual GPP by 30% in relation to JULES. SOX decreases JULES root-mean-square error in GPP by up to 45% in evergreen tropical forests, and can simulate realistic patterns of canopy water potential and soil water dynamics at the studied sites.
   SOX provides a parsimonious way to incorporate recent advances in plant hydraulics and optimality theory into LSMs, and an alternative to empirical stress factors.

AB Satellite remote sensing has been widely used in the last decades for agricultural applications, both for assessing vegetation condition and for subsequent yield prediction. Existing remote sensing-based methods to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP), which is an important variable to indicate crop photosynthetic function and stress, typically rely on empirical or semi-empirical approaches, which tend to over-simplify photosynthetic mechanisms. In this work, we take advantage of all parallel developments in mechanistic photosynthesis modeling and satellite data availability for an advanced monitoring of crop productivity. In particular, we combine process-based modeling with the soil-canopy energy balance radiative transfer model (SCOPE) with Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 optical remote sensing data and machine learning methods in order to estimate crop GPP. With this approach, we by-pass the need for an intermediate step to retrieve the set of vegetation biophysical parameters needed to accurately model photosynthesis, while still accounting for the complex processes of the original physically-based model. Several implementations of the machine learning models are tested and validated using simulated and flux tower-based GPP data. Our final neural network model is able to estimate GPP at the tested flux tower sites with r(2) of 0.92 and RMSE of 1.38 gC d(-1) m(-2), which outperforms empirical models based on vegetation indices. The first test of applicability of this model to Landsat 8 data showed good results (r(2) of 0.82 and RMSE of 1.97 gC d(-1) m(-2)), which suggests that our approach can be further applied to other sensors. Modeling and testing is restricted to C3 crops in this study, but can be extended to C4 crops by producing a new training dataset with SCOPE that accounts for the different photosynthetic pathways. Our model successfully estimates GPP across a variety of C3 crop types and environmental conditions even though it does not use any local information from the corresponding sites. This highlights its potential to map crop productivity from new satellite sensors at a global scale with the help of current Earth observation cloud computing platforms.

AB Phenology is a key biological trait that can determine an organism's survival and provides one of the clearest indicators of the effects of recent climatic change. Long time-series observations of plant phenology collected at continental scales could clarify latitudinal and regional patterns of plant responses and illuminate drivers of that variation, but few such datasets exist. Here, we use the web tool CrowdCurio to crowdsource phenological data from over 7000 herbarium specimens representing 30 diverse flowering plant species distributed across the eastern United States. Our results, spanning 120 years and generated from over 2000 crowdsourcers, illustrate numerous aspects of continental-scale plant reproductive phenology. First, they support prior studies that found plant reproductive phenology significantly advances in response to warming, especially for early-flowering species. Second, they reveal that fruiting in populations from warmer, lower latitudes is significantly more phenologically sensitive to temperature than that for populations from colder, higher-latitude regions. Last, we found that variation in phenological sensitivities to climate within species between regions was of similar magnitude to variation between species. Overall, our results suggest that phenological responses to anthropogenic climate change will be heterogeneous within communities and across regions, with large amounts of regional variability driven by local adaptation, phenotypic plasticity and differences in species assemblages. As millions of imaged herbarium specimens become available online, they will play an increasingly critical role in revealing large-scale patterns within assemblages and across continents that ultimately can improve forecasts of the impacts of climatic change on the structure and function of ecosystems.

AB Microorganisms play vital roles in Earth's biogeochemical cycles. Identifying disturbances in microbial communities due to anthropogenic contamination can provide insights into the health of ecosystems. Picher, Oklahoma, was the site of large-scale mining operations for Pb, Zn, and other heavy metals until the mid-1950s, operating within the Tri-State Mining District (TSMD) of Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma. Although mining ceased decades ago, high concentrations of heavy metals (> 1000 ppm) remain in area soil and water systems. Previously, we mapped metal concentrations on samples collected from mine tailings in Picher and along cardinal-direction transects within an 8.05-km radius of the town. To elucidate changes in microbial community structure due to regional metal contamination, 16S rRNA gene sequences and qPCR calculations of total Bacteria and Archaea were analyzed against these metal concentrations. Bacteria were negatively and significantly correlated with Pb, Cd, Zn, and Mg; however, Archaea was only significantly and positively correlated with pH. Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed significant differences in microbial communities of chat and west transect samples. Comparison of soil chemistry with community structure indicated that Al, Pb, Cd, and Zn significantly impacted community composition and distribution of individual OTUs. Mapping the distribution of heavy-metal contamination and microbial communities in these soils represents the first step in understanding effects of long-term, heavy-metal contamination at a basic trophic level.

AB Dispersal is a central process in ecology and evolution. At the individual level, the three stages of the dispersal process (i.e., emigration, transience and immigration) are affected by complex interactions between phenotypes and environmental factors. Condition- and context-dependent dispersal have far-reaching consequences, both for the demography and the genetic structuring of natural populations and for adaptive processes. From an applied point of view, dispersal also deeply affects the spatial dynamics of populations and their ability to respond to land-use changes, habitat degradation and climate change. For these reasons, dispersal has received considerable attention from ecologists and evolutionary biologists. Demographic and genetic methods allow quantifying non-effective (i.e., followed or not by a successful reproduction) and effective (i.e., with a successful reproduction) dispersal and to investigate how individual and environmental factors affect the different stages of the dispersal process. Over the past decade, demographic and genetic methods designed to quantify dispersal have rapidly evolved but interactions between researchers from the two fields are limited. We here review recent developments in both demographic and genetic methods to study dispersal in wild animal populations. We present their strengths and limits, as well as their applicability depending on study objectives and population characteristics. We propose a unified framework allowing researchers to combine methods and select the more suitable tools to address a broad range of important topics about the ecology and evolution of dispersal and its consequences on animal population dynamics and genetics.

AB Revegetation of degraded lands has a profound impact on the maintenance and stability of ecosystemprocesses. However, the impacts of this land use change on functional diversity of soil microbial communities are poorly understood. Here, using 16S rRNA gene amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we compared the taxonomic and functional communities of soil microbiome, and analyzed the effects of plant diversity and soil chemical properties, in a chronosequence of restored ex-farmland that had been naturally revegetated to grassland over periods of 5, 15 and 30 years with adjacent farmland, on the Loess Plateau, China. We found that microbial taxonomic diversity was positively correlated with plant diversity and was higher in the revegetated sites. Functional diversity increased significantly in the oldest grassland. Actinobacteria, commonly considered a copiotrophic phylum, was more abundant in the revegetated sites, while Acidobacteria, an oligotrophic phylum, was more abundant in farmland. Furthermore, the structure of taxonomic and functional communities was significantly different between revegetated sites and farmland, and organic matter was the best environmental predictor in determining these microbial communities. Compared with the farmland, revegetation increased the proportion of genes associated with energy metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism. Notably, the higher proportion of carbohydrate degradation gene subfamilies in the revegetated sites indicated higher levels of soil nutrient cycling. These results elucidate the significant shifts in below ground microbial taxonomic and functional diversity following vegetation restoration and have implications for ecological restoration programs in arid and semi-arid ecosystems.

AB Studies of the coral microbiome predominantly characterize the microbial community of the host species as a collective, rather than that of the individual. This ecological perspective on the coral microbiome has led to the conclusion that the coral holobiont is the most diverse microbial biosphere studied thus far. However, investigating the microbiome of the individual, rather than that of the species, highlights common and conserved community attributes which can provide insights into the significance of microbial associations to the host. Here, we show there are consistent characteristics between individuals in the proposed three components of the coral microbiome (i.e., "environmentally responsive community," "resident or individual microbiome," and "core microbiome"). We found that the resident microbiome of a photoendosymbiotic coral harbored <3% (similar to 605 phylotypes) of the 16S rRNA phylotypes associated with all investigated individuals of that species ("species-specific microbiome") (similar to 21,654 phylotypes; individuals from Pachyseris speciosa [n = 123], Mycedium elephantotus [n = 95], and Acropora aculeus [n = 91] from 10 reef locations). The remaining bacterial phylotypes (>96%) (environmentally responsive community) of the species-specific microbiome were in fact not found in association with the majority of individuals of the species. Only 0.1% (similar to 21 phylotypes) of the species-specific microbiome of each species was shared among all individuals of the species (core microbiome), equating to similar to 3.4% of the resident microbiome. We found taxonomic redundancy and consistent patterns of composition, structure, and taxonomic breadth across individual microbiomes from the three coral species. Our results demonstrate that the coral microbiome is structured at the individual level.
   IMPORTANCE We propose that the coral holobiont should be conceptualized as a diverse transient microbial community that is responsive to the surrounding environment and encompasses a simple, redundant, resident microbiome and a small conserved core microbiome. Most importantly, we show that the coral microbiome is comparable to the microbiomes of other organisms studied thus far. Accurately characterizing the coral-microbe interactions provides an important baseline from which the functional roles and the functional niches within which microbes reside can be deciphered.

AB IgE is an ancient and conserved immunoglobulin isotype with potent immunological function. Nevertheless, the regulation of IgE responses remains an enigma, and evidence of a role for IgE in host defense is limited. Here we report that topical exposure to a common environmental DNA-damaging xenobiotic initiated stress surveillance by gamma d TCR+ intraepithelial lymphocytes that resulted in class switching to IgE in B cells and the accumulation of autoreactive IgE. High-throughput antibody sequencing revealed that gamma d T cells shaped the IgE repertoire by supporting specific variable-diversity-joining ( VDJ) rearrangements with unique characteristics of the complementarity-determining region CDRH3. This endogenous IgE response, via the IgE receptor Fce RI, provided protection against epithelial carcinogenesis, and expression of the gene encoding Fce RI in human squamouscell carcinoma correlated with good disease prognosis. These data indicate a joint role for immunosurveillance by T cells and by B cells in epithelial tissues and suggest that IgE is part of the host defense against epithelial damage and tumor development.

AB Crop disease outbreaks are often associated with clonal expansions of single pathogenic lineages. To determine whether similar boom-and-bust scenarios hold for wild pathosystems, we carried out a multi-year, multi-site survey of Pseudomonas in its natural host Arabidopsis thaliana. The most common Pseudomonas lineage corresponded to a ubiquitous pathogenic clade. Sequencing of 1,524 genomes revealed this lineage to have diversified approximately 300,000 years ago, containing dozens of genetically identifiable pathogenic sublineages. There is differentiation at the level of both gene content and disease phenotype, although the differentiation may not provide fitness advantages to specific sublineages. The coexistence of sublineages indicates that in contrast to crop systems, no single strain has been able to overtake the studied A. thaliana populations in the recent past. Our results suggest that selective pressures acting on a plant pathogen in wild hosts are likely to be much more complex than those in agricultural systems.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) balance is an important component of the terrestrial carbon (C) budget. However, effect of cropland management changes on SOC dynamics has not been recently assessed in the tropics.
   Studies were compiled in the tropics where SOC stocks were measured in the topsoil (0-20 or 0-30 cm depth) after the adoption of management practices that are expected to enhance SOC stocks, including tillage reduction, crop rotation, exogenous organic amendments, restitution of crop residues, mineral amendments, and combinations of these practices. Random forest regression was used to identify the determinants of SOC accumulation rates (ASOC) depending on the climate, soil characteristics and changes in management practices.
   214 cases were identified in 48 studies in 13 different countries. The average ASOC was 0.41 +/- 0.03 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (significantly greater than zero), for an average experiment duration of 13.6 +/- 0.6 years. Although a large part of the variability remained unexplained due to methodological bias in the studies or a lack of relevant predictors. The strongest predictors of ASOC were C inputs, duration of the experiments, and the management practices, whereas neither soil characteristics (soil type, clay content, and initial SOC stock) nor climate variables (mean annual temperature and rainfall, aridity index) affected ASOC. The SOC accumulation rates increased linearly with C inputs, and the conversion rate of C inputs to SOC was 8.2 +/- 0.8%. Given the competing uses of organic matter on many tropical farms, the benefits of using changes in management practices for climate change mitigation might be overrated. As ASOC decreased with the duration of the experiments, ASOC would probably be smaller if a period of 20 years were considered, as recommended by the IPCC guidelines. The management practice with the greatest ASOC was diversified crop rotation. Cropping systems where diverse practices were combined resulted in higher ASOC than individual practices such as reduced tillage and mineral fertilization on their own.
   The adoption of improved management practices that increase C inputs is still relevant for meeting the challenges of food security and adaptation to climate change.

AB Theory and evidence indicate that trees and other vegetation influence the atmospheric water-cycle in various ways. These influences are more important, more complex, and more poorly characterised than is widely realised. While there is little doubt that changes in tree cover will impact the water-cycle, the wider consequences remain difficult to predict as the underlying relationships and processes remain poorly characterised. Nonetheless, as forests are vulnerable to human activities, these linked aspects of the water-cycle are also at risk and the potential consequences of large scale forest loss are severe. Here, for non-specialist readers, I review our knowledge of the links between vegetation-cover and climate with a focus on forests and rain (precipitation). I highlight advances, uncertainties and research opportunities. There are significant shortcomings in our understanding of the atmospheric hydrological cycle and of its representation in climate models. A better understanding of the role of vegetation and tree-cover will reduce some of these shortcomings. I outline and illustrate various research themes where these advances may be found. These themes include the biology of evaporation, aerosols and atmospheric motion, as well as the processes that determine monsoons and diurnal precipitation cycles. A novel theory-the 'biotic pump'-suggests that evaporation and condensation can exert a major influence over atmospheric dynamics. This theory explains how high rainfall can be maintained within those continental land-masses that are sufficiently forested. Feedbacks within many of these processes can result in non-linear behaviours and the potential for dramatic changes as a result of forest loss (or gain): for example, switching from a wet to a dry local climate (or visa-versa). Much remains unknown and multiple research disciplines are needed to address this: forest scientists and other biologists have a major role to play. New ideas, methods and data offer opportunities to improve understanding. Expect surprises.

AB In recent decades, human activities have significantly influenced land use/land cover. Identifying pattern changes in regional land use/land cover and their drivers is crucial for land use planning and management decision making. This study aims to (1) describe land use/land cover changes that have taken place in Nigeria in the study period of 10 years (2000-2010), (2) determine the factors that drive those changes with emphasis on transition to cultivated land use and (3) examine the spatiotemporal intensity of land use. The study utilized the GlobeLand30 land cover datasets produced by the National Geomatics Center of China. We used the spatial calculating analysis model to analyse land use/land cover change, logistic regression to model drivers of cultivated land expansion and land use intensity comprehensive index model to examine the intensity of land use. Our results revealed that (1) conversions to cultivated land dominate the land use/land cover change processes and expansion was largely at the detriment of the grassland, shrubland and forests; (2) biophysical, socio-economic and proximity factors are significant determinants of transition to cultivated land use. Population density is negatively related to cultivated land expansion, which suggests labour scarcity in the agricultural sector that can consequently result into low productivity and (3) significant discrepancies exist in the intensity of land use between the southern and northern regions of the country. Policy measures aimed at improving agricultural productivity remain one of the best ways to reduce pressure on increasingly scarce land resource and conserve natural ecosystems in Nigeria.

AB Anthropogenic migration barriers fragment many populations and limit the ability of species to respond to climate-induced biome shifts. Conservation actions designed to conserve habitat connectivity and mitigate barriers are needed to unite fragmented populations into larger, more viable metapopulations, and to allow species to track their climate envelope over time. Landscape genetic analysis provides an empirical means to infer landscape factors influencing gene flow and thereby inform such conservation actions. However, there are currently many methods available for model selection in landscape genetics, and considerable uncertainty as to which provide the greatest accuracy in identifying the true landscape model influencing gene flow among competing alternative hypotheses. In this study, we used population genetic simulations to evaluate the performance of seven regression-based model selection methods on a broad array of landscapes that varied by the number and type of variables contributing to resistance, the magnitude and cohesion of resistance, as well as the functional relationship between variables and resistance. We also assessed the effect of transformations designed to linearize the relationship between genetic and landscape distances. We found that linear mixed effects models had the highest accuracy in every way we evaluated model performance; however, other methods also performed well in many circumstances, particularly when landscape resistance was high and the correlation among competing hypotheses was limited. Our results provide guidance for which regression-based model selection methods provide the most accurate inferences in landscape genetic analysis and thereby best inform connectivity conservation actions.

AB In tropical tree communities, processes occurring during early life stages play a critical role in shaping forest composition and diversity through differences in species' performance. Predicting the future of tropical forests depends on a solid understanding of the drivers of seedling survival. At the same time, factors determining spatial and temporal patterns of seedling survival can play a large role in permitting species coexistence in diverse communities. Using long-term data on the survival of more than 45 000 seedlings of 238 species in a Neotropical forest, we assessed the relative importance of key abiotic and biotic neighbourhood variables thought to influence individual seedling survival and tested whether species vary significantly in their responses to these variables, consistent with niche differences. At the community level, seedling survival was significantly correlated with plant size, topographic habitat, neighbourhood densities of conspecific seedlings, conspecific and heterospecific trees and annual variation in water availability, in descending order of effect size. Additionally, we found significant variation among species in their sensitivity to light and water availability, as well as in their survival within different topographic habitats, indicating the potential for niche differentiation among species that could allow for species coexistence.

AB Drought strongly influences terrestrial C cycling via its effects on plant H2O and CO2 exchange. However, the treatment of photosynthetic physiology under drought by many ecosystem and earth system models remains poorly constrained by data. We measured the drought response of four tree species and evaluated alternative model formulations for drought effects on photosynthesis (A). We implemented a series of soil drying and re wetting events (i.e. multiple droughts) with four contrasting tree species in large pots (75 L) placed in the field under rainout shelters. We measured leaf-level gas exchange, predawn and midday leaf water potential (Psi(pd) and Psi(md)), and leaf isotopic composition (delta C-13) and calculated discrimination relative to the atmosphere (Delta). We then evaluated eight modeling frameworks that simulate the effects of drought in different ways. With moderate reductions in volumetric soil water content (theta), all species reduced stomatal conductance (g(s)), leading to an equivalent increase in water use efficiency across species inferred from both leaf gas exchange and Delta, despite a small reduction in photosynthetic capacity. With severe reductions in theta, all species strongly reduced g(s) along with a coincident reduction in photosynthetic capacity, illustrating the joint importance of stomatal and non-stomatal limitations of photosynthesis under strong drought conditions. Simple empirical models as well as complex mechanistic model formulations were equally successful at capturing the measured variation in A and g(s), as long as the predictor variables were available from direct measurements (theta, Psi(pd), and Psi(md)). However, models based on leaf water potential face an additional challenge, as we found that Psi(pd) was substantially different from Psi(soll) predicted by standard approaches based on theta. Modeling frameworks that combine gas exchange and hydraulic traits have the advantage of mechanistic realism, but sacrificed parsimony without an improvement in predictive power in this comparison. Model choice depends on the desired balance between simple empiricism and mechanistic realism. We suggest that empirical models implementing stomatal and non-stomatal limitations based on theta are highly predictive simple models. Mechanistic models that incorporate hydraulic traits have excellent potential, but several challenges currently limit their widespread implementation.

AB Urban green infrastructure, GI (e.g., parks, gardens, green roofs) are potentially important biodiversity habitats, however their full ecological capacity is poorly understood, in part due to the difficulties of monitoring urban wildlife populations. Ecoacoustic surveying is a useful way of monitoring habitats, where acoustic indices (AIs) are used to measure biodiversity by summarising the activity or diversity of biotic sounds. However, the biases introduced to AIs in acoustically complex urban habitats dominated by anthropogenic noise are not well understood. Here we measure the level of activity and diversity of the low (0-12 kHz, (l)) and high (12-96 kHz, (h)) frequency biotic, anthropogenic, and geophonic components of 2452 h of acoustic recordings from 15 sites across Greater London, UK from June to October 2013 based on acoustic and visual analysis of recordings. We used mixed-effects models to compare these measures to those from four commonly used Ms: Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), Acoustic Diversity Index (ADI), Bioacoustic Index (BI), and Normalised Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI). We found that three AIs (ACI(l), BIl, NDSIl) were significantly positively correlated with our measures of biotic(l) activity and diversity. However, all three were also correlated with anthropogenict activity, and BIl and NDSIl were correlated with anthropogenic(l) diversity. All low frequency Ms were correlated with the presence of geophonic(l) sound. Regarding the high frequency recordings, only one AI (ACI(h)) was positively correlated with measured biotic(h) activity, but was also positively correlated with anthropogenic(h) activity, and no index was correlated with biotic(h) diversity. The AIs tested here are therefore not suitable for monitoring biodiversity acoustically in anthropogenically dominated habitats without the prior removal of biasing sounds from recordings. However, with further methodological research to overcome some of the limitations identified here, ecoacoustics has enormous potential to facilitate urban biodiversity and ecosystem monitoring at the scales necessary to manage cities in the future.

AB Advances in metacommunity theory have made a significant contribution to understanding the drivers of variation in biological communities. However, there has been limited empirical research exploring the expression of metacommunity theory for two fundamental components of beta diversity: nestedness and species turnover. In this paper, we examine the influence of local environmental and a range of spatial variables (hydrological connectivity, proximity and overall spatial structure) on total beta diversity and the nestedness and turnover components of beta diversity for the entire macroinvertebrate community and active and passively dispersing taxa within pond habitats. High beta diversity almost entirely reflects patterns of species turnover (replacement) rather than nestedness (differences in species richness) in our dataset. Local environmental variables were the main drivers of total beta diversity, nestedness and turnover when the entire community was considered and for both active and passively dispersing taxa. The influence of spatial processes on passively dispersing taxa, total beta diversity and nestedness was significantly greater than for actively dispersing taxa. Our results suggest that species sorting (local environmental variables) operating through niche processes was the primary mechanism driving total beta diversity, nestedness and turnover for the entire community and active and passively dispersing taxa. In contrast, spatial factors (hydrological connectivity, proximity and spatial eigenvectors) only exerted a secondary influence on the nestedness and turnover components of beta diversity.

AB Carbon reserves are important for maintaining tree function during and after stress. Increasing tree mortality driven by drought globally has renewed the interest in how plants regulate allocation of recently fixed C to reserve formation. Three-year-old seedlings of two species (Tilia platyphyllos and Pinus sylvestris) were exposed to two intensities of experimental drought during similar to 10 weeks, and C-13 pulse labelling was subsequently applied with rewetting. Tracking the C-13 label across different organs and C compounds (soluble sugars, starch, myo-inositol, lipids and cellulose), together with the monitoring of gas exchange and C mass balances over time, allowed for the identification of variations in C allocation priorities and tree C balances that are associated with drought effects and subsequent drought release. The results demonstrate that soluble sugars accumulated in P. sylvestris under drought conditions independently of growth trends; thus, non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) formation cannot be simply considered a passive overflow process in this species. Once drought ceased, C allocation to storage was still prioritized at the expense of growth, which suggested the presence of 'droughtmemory effects', possibly to ensure future growth and survival. On the contrary, NSC and growth dynamics in T. platyphyllos were consistent with a passive (overflow) view of NSC formation.

AB Monsoonal climates at low latitudes (<32 degrees N) are an inevitable consequence of seasonal migrations of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), but the character of these monsoons depends on continental configuration, oro-graphic expression and the strength of Hadley circulation. To explore the evolution of monsoon systems across southern Asia we compare climate signatures archived in ten Paleogene floras from northern India, Tibet and southern China, occupying low palaeolatitudes at a time of extreme global warmth and elevated CO2. Fossil leaf form reveals that under such 'hothouse' conditions megathermal early Eocene to earliest Miocene forests were exposed to strong monsoonal climates typical of those experienced today arising from annual migrations of the ITCZ, possibly enhanced by a lower equator-to-pole temperature gradient. Throughout the Paleogene an elevated Tibetan highland produced no discernable modification of this ITCZ monsoon, although rainfall seasonality similar to that of the modern South Asia Monsoon (SAM) is observed in northern India as early as the beginning of the Eocene, despite its near-equatorial palaeoposition. In South China rainfall seasonality increased progressively achieving modem monsoon-like wet season/dry season precipitation ratios by the early Oligocene. Despite evidencing weak rainfall seasonality overall, fossil leaves from South China have exhibited monsoon-adapted morphologies, comparable to those seen in today's Indonesia-Australia Monsoon, for at least 45 million years. Together, the Indian and South China fossil leaf assemblages show that the evolution of megathermal ecosystems across southern Asia has been influenced profoundly by monsoonal climates for at least the last 56 million years. The Paleogene ITCZ-driven monsoon system strongly impacted India as it transited the Equator likely eliminating Gondwanan taxa not able to adapt to seasonal precipitation extremes. Furthermore, powerful seasonally-reversing winds, and associated surface ocean currents, are likely to have facilitated two-way biotic transfer between India and Eurasia long before closure of the Tethys Ocean.

AB Terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) for each plant functional type (PFT) is a key variable for linking the energy, water and carbon cycles of the atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere. Process-based algorithms have been widely used to estimate global terrestrial ET, yet each ET individual algorithm has exhibited large uncertainties. In this study, the support vector machine (SVM) method was introduced to improve global terrestrial ET estimation by integrating three process-based ET algorithms: MOD16, PT-JPL and SEMI-PM. At 200 FLUXNET flux tower sites, we evaluated the performance of the SVM method and others, including the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method and the general regression neural networks (GRNNs) method together with three process-based ET algorithms. We found that the SVM method was superior to all other methods we evaluated. The validation results showed that compared with the individual algorithms, the SVM method driven by tower-specific (Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, MERRA) meteorological data reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) by approximately 0.20 (0.15) mm/day for most forest sites and 0.30 (0.20) mm/day for most crop and grass sites and improved the squared correlation coefficient (R-2) by approximately 0.10 (0.08) (95% confidence) for most flux tower sites. The water balance of basins and the global terrestrial ET calculation analysis also demonstrated that the regional and global estimates of the SVM-merged ET were reliable. The SVM method provides a powerful tool for improving global ET estimation to characterize the long-term spatiotemporal variations of the global terrestrial water budget.

AB Genetic exchange between divergent evolutionary lineages, from introgressive hybridization between locally adapted populations to insertion of retroviral sequences into eukaryotic genomes, has now been documented. The detection of frequent divergence-with-gene-flow contrasts the neo-Darwinian paradigm of largely allopatric diversification. Nevertheless, of even greater significance is the growing wealth of data suggesting that the recipients of the transferred genomic material gain adaptive phenotypes from the donor lineages. This adaptive enrichment is reflected by changes in pathogenicity in viruses and bacteria, the transformation of ecological amplitude in eukaryotes, and adaptive radiations in extremely diverse lineages. Although genetic exchange may produce maladaptive consequences, most of the recently reported examples suggest increases in fitness, and many such adaptive trait transfers have been identified in our own species.

AB Seed dispersal constitutes a pivotal process in an increasingly fragmented world, promoting population connectivity, colonization and range shifts in plants. Unveiling how multiple frugivore species disperse seeds through fragmented landscapes, operating as mobile links, has remained elusive owing to methodological constraints for monitoring seed dispersal events. We combine for the first time DNA barcoding and DNA microsatellites to identify, respectively, the frugivore species and the source trees of animal-dispersed seeds in forest and matrix of a fragmented landscape. We found a high functional complementarity among frugivores in terms of seed deposition at different habitats (forest vs. matrix), perches (isolated trees vs. electricity pylons) and matrix sectors (close vs. far from the forest edge), cross-habitat seed fluxes, dispersal distances and canopy-cover dependency. Seed rain at the land-scape-scale, from forest to distant matrix sectors, was characterized by turnovers in the contribution of frugivores and source-tree habitats: open-habitat frugivores replaced forest-dependent frugivores, whereas matrix trees replaced forest trees. As a result of such turnovers, the magnitude of seed rain was evenly distributed between habitats and landscape sectors. We thus uncover key mechanisms behind "biodiversity-ecosystem function" relationships, in this case, the relationship between frugivore diversity and landscape-scale seed dispersal. Our results reveal the importance of open-habitat frugivores, isolated fruiting trees and anthropogenic perching sites (infrastructures) in generating seed dispersal events far from the remnant forest, highlighting their potential to drive regeneration dynamics through the matrix. This study helps to broaden the "mobile-link" concept in seed dispersal studies by providing a comprehensive and integrative view of the way in which multiple frugivore species disseminate seeds through real-world landscapes.

AB Our growing human population will be increasingly dependent on bees and other pollinators that provide the essential delivery of pollen to crop flowers during bloom. Within the context of challenges to crop pollinators and crop production, farm managers require strategies that can reliably provide sufficient pollination to ensure maximum economic return from their pollinator-dependent crops. There are unexploited opportunities to increase yields by managing insect pollination, especially for crops that are dependent on insect pollination for fruit set. We introduce the concept of Integrated Crop Pollination as a unifying theme under which various strategies supporting crop pollination can be developed, coordinated, and delivered to growers and their advisors. We emphasize combining tactics that are appropriate for the crop's dependence on insect-mediated pollination, including the use of wild and managed bee species, and enhancing the farm environment for these insects through directed habitat management and pesticide stewardship. This should be done within the economic constraints of the specific farm situation, and so we highlight the need for flexible strategies that can help growers make economically-based ICP decisions using support tools that consider crop value, yield benefits from adoption of ICP components, and the cost of the practices. Finally, education and technology transfer programs will be essential for helping land managers decide on the most efficient way to apply ICP to their unique situations. Building on experiences in North America and beyond, we aim to provide a broad framework for how crop pollination can help secure future food production and support society's increasing demand for nutritious diets.

ID COMPLEX TRAITS; IDENTIFICATION; ANCESTRY; REVEALS; COLOR
AB The yak is remarkable for its adaptation to high altitude and occupies a central place in the economies of the mountainous regions of Asia. At lower elevations, it is common to hybridize yaks with cattle to combine the yak's hardiness with the productivity of cattle. Hybrid males are sterile, however, preventing the establishment of stable hybrid populations, but not a limited introgression after backcrossing several generations of female hybrids to male yaks. Here we inferred bovine haplotypes in the genomes of 76 Mongolian yaks using high-density SNP genotyping and whole-genome sequencing. These yaks inherited similar to 1.3% of their genome from bovine ancestors after nearly continuous admixture over at least the last 1,500 years. The introgressed regions are enriched in genes involved in nervous system development and function, and particularly in glutamate metabolism and neurotransmission. We also identified a novel mutation associated with a polled (hornless) phenotype originating from Mongolian Turano cattle. Our results suggest that introgressive hybridization contributed to the improvement of yak management and breeding.

AB Modes and mechanisms of speciation are best studied in young species pairs. In older taxa, it is increasingly difficult to distinguish what happened during speciation from what happened after speciation. Lake Victoria cichlids in the genus Pundamilia encompass a complex of young species and polymorphic populations. One Pundamilia species pair, P. pundamilia and P. nyererei, is particularly well suited to study speciation because sympatric population pairs occur with different levels of phenotypic differentiation and reproductive isolation at different rocky islands within the lake. Genetic distances between allopatric island populations of the same nominal species often exceed those between the sympatric species. It thus remained unresolved whether speciation into P. nyererei and P. pundamilia occurred once, followed by geographical range expansion and interspecific gene flow in local sympatry, or if the species pair arose repeatedly by parallel speciation. Here, we use genomic data and demographic modelling to test these alternative evolutionary scenarios. We demonstrate that gene flow plays a strong role in shaping the observed patterns of genetic similarity, including both gene flow between sympatric species and gene flow between allopatric populations, as well as recent and early gene flow. The best supported model for the origin of P. pundamilia and P. nyererei population pairs at two different islands is one where speciation happened twice, whereby the second speciation event follows shortly after introgression from an allopatric P. nyererei population that arose earlier. Our findings support the hypothesis that very similar species may arise repeatedly, potentially facilitated by introgressed genetic variation.

AB Addition of external carbon sources to post-denitrification systems is frequently used in wastewater treatment plants to enhance nitrate removal. However, little is known about the fate of micropollutants in post-denitrification systems and the influence of external carbon dosing on their removal. In this study, we assessed the effects of two different types and availability of commonly used carbon sources -methanol and ethanol-on the removal of micropollutants in biofilm systems. Two laboratory-scale moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs), containing AnoxKaldnes K1 carriers with acclimated biofilm from full-scale systems, were operated in continuous-flow using wastewater dosed with methanol and ethanol, respectively. Batch experiments with 22 spiked pharmaceuticals were performed to assess removal kinetics. Acetyl-sulfadiazine, atenolol, citalopram, propranolol and trimethoprim were easily biotransformed in both MBBRs (biotransformations rate constants 410 between 1.2 and 12.9 L g(biomass)(-1) d(-1)), 13 compounds were moderately biotransformed (rate constants between 0.2 and 2 L g(biomass)(-1) d(-1)) and 4 compounds were recalcitrant. The methanol-dosed MBBR showed higher kw (e.g., 1.5-2.5-fold) than in the ethanol-dosed MBBR for 9 out of the 22 studied compounds, equal k(bio) for 10 compounds, while 3 compounds (i.e., targeted sulfonamides) were biotransformed faster in the ethanol dosed MBBR. While biotransformation of most of the targeted compounds followed first-order kinetics, removal of venlafaxine, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethizole could be described with a cometabolic model. Analyses of the microbial composition in the biofilms using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing revealed that the methanol-dosed MBBR contained higher microbial richness than the one dosed with ethanol, suggesting that improved biotransformation of targeted compounds could be associated with higher microbial richness. During continuous-flow operation, at conditions representative of full-scale denitrification systems (hydraulic residence time = 2 h), the removal efficiencies of micropollutants were below 35% in both MBBRs, with the exception of atenolol and trimethoprim (>80%). Overall, this study demonstrated that MBBRs used for post denitrification could be optimized to enhance the biotransformation of a number of micropollutants by accounting for optimal carbon sources and extended residence time.

AB AimIn ectotherms, the colour of an individual's cuticle may have important thermoregulatory and protective consequences. In cool environments, ectotherms should be darker, to maximize heat gain, and larger, to minimize heat loss. Dark colours should also predominate under high UV-B conditions because melanin offers protection. We test these predictions in ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) across space and through time based on a new, spatially and temporally explicit, global-scale combination of assemblage-level and environmental data.
   LocationAfrica, Australia and South America.
   MethodsWe sampled ant assemblages (n=274) along 14 elevational transects on three continents. Individual assemblages ranged from 250 to 3000 m a.s.l. (minimum to maximum range in summer temperature of 0.5-35 degrees C). We used mixed-effects models to explain variation in assemblage cuticle lightness. Explanatory variables were average assemblage body size, temperature and UV-B irradiation. Annual temporal changes in lightness were examined for a subset of the data.
   ResultsAssemblages with large average body sizes were darker in colour than those with small body sizes. Assemblages became lighter in colour with increasing temperature, but darkened again at the highest temperatures when there were high levels of UV-B. Through time, temperature and body size explained variation in lightness. Both the spatial and temporal models explained c. 50% of the variation in lightness.
   Main conclusionsOur results are consistent with the thermal melanism hypothesis, and demonstrate the importance of considering body size and UV-B radiation exposure in explaining the colour of insect cuticle. Crucially, this finding is at the assemblage level. Consequently, the relative abundances and identities of ant species that are present in an assemblage can change in accordance with environmental conditions over elevation, latitude and relatively short time spans. These findings suggest that there are important constraints on how ectotherm assemblages may be able to respond to rapidly changing environmental conditions.

AB This study investigates the socio-ecological system dominated by pasture land in Asteroussia Mountains (Crete, Greece) between 1950 and 2010 with the aim to identify changes in the most relevant system's attributes, as a contribution to the study of land degradation from the resilience perspective. The analysis of 10 system indicators identifies two time periods (1950 - mid 1980s and mid 1980s - 2010) characterized by distinct relations between system's components. The grazing system was sustainable in the former time period being satisfactorily managed with moderately-low soil erosion rates despite adverse soil, topographic and climate conditions. Larger land patches have experienced better system's performance than smaller patches. The latter time interval was characterized by landscape fragmentation which has impacted negatively the stability of the overall system. A continuous growth in livestock density was observed in the study period determining high soil erosion rates, loss in plant productivity and a general over-exploitation of natural resources. A significant increase in desertification risk and a parallel decrease of ecological resilience were observed in the last time interval. The contrasting spatial patterns of system's indicators - possibly associated with different responses to land degradation - can be considered in the design of mitigation strategies addressing climate change and socioeconomic vulnerability of Mediterranean pasture land.

AB The true status of many endangered plants is uncertain because the locations of all extant populations are not known. Species distribution models (SDMs) can direct searches for additional populations, but habitat fragmentation may influence the distribution of rare species more than climatic or edaphic factors in human-dominated landscapes. In this study, I test the ability of SDMs to predict rare plant occurrences in a fragmented landscape and the importance of predicted habitat suitability versus landscape context. I built SDMs for eight rare woodland plants and assessed them using an independent data set including plant community surveys of 51 sites. I used community data to determine whether SDMs predict the right habitat type even when the target rare species was absent. I then modelled rare species presence based on predicted habitat suitability, distance to the nearest known population and the amount of forest habitat within 500 m of the site. SDMs were effective for seven of the eight species, with the degree of predicted habitat suitability positively related to species' occurrence. I found new populations of four of the eight species. However, the amount of forest habitat available in the vicinity of a plot was also a positive predictor of rare plant occurrences. Among sites predicted to be suitable, the distance to the nearest known population was the strongest predictor of rare plant occurrence.Synthesis and applications. Species distribution models (SDMs) can effectively target searches for populations of rare species even in human-dominated landscapes. Surveying the plant community at sites predicted to be suitable can help to improve the SDM. SDMs used in conjunction with data on landscape context can maximize the efficiency of searches for rare species and show which species are restricted by dispersal limitation and habitat fragmentation in addition to edaphic and climatic factors.

AB Ecologists have identified numerous keystone species, defined as organisms that have outsized ecological impacts relative to their biomass. Here we identify human beings as a higher-order or 'hyperkeystone' species that drives complex interaction chains by affecting other keystone actors across different habitats. Strong indirect effects and a global reach further characterize these interactions and amplify the impacts of human activities on diverse ecosystems, from oceans to forests. We require better understanding of hyperkeystone interaction chains most urgently, especially for marine species and terrestrial large carnivores, which experience relatively higher exploitation rates than other species. This requires innovative approaches that integrate the study of human behavior with food-web theory, and which might provide surprising new insights into the complex ecology of our own species.

AB Fungi that produce their fruiting bodies underground within the soil profile are known commonly as truffles. Truffle fruiting bodies harbor a diverse but poorly understood microbial community of bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi. In this study, we used next-generation 454 amplicon pyrosequencing of the V1 and V4 region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in order to characterize and compare effects of truffle species and geographic origin on the truffle microbiome. We compared truffle microbiomes of the glebal tissue for eight truffle species belonging to four distinct genera within the Pezizales: Tuber, Terfezia, Leucangium, and Kalapuya. The bacterial community within truffles was dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacterioides, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes. Bacterial richness within truffles was quite low overall, with between 2-23 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Notably, we found a single Bradyrhizobium OTU to be dominant within truffle species belonging to the genus Tuber, irrespective of geographic origin, but not in other truffle genera sampled. This study offers relevant insights into the truffle microbiome and raises questions concerning the recruitment and function of these fungal-associated bacteria consortia.

TI Aridity and plant uptake interact to make dryland soils hotspots for

AB Nitric oxide (NO) is an important trace gas and regulator of atmospheric photochemistry. Theory suggests moist soils optimize NO emissions, whereas wet or dry soils constrain them. In drylands, however, NO emissions can be greatest in dry soils and when dry soils are rewet. To understand how aridity and vegetation interact to generate this pattern, we measured NO fluxes in a California grassland, where wemanipulated vegetation cover and the length of the dry season and measured [delta(15)-N]NO and [delta(18)-O] NO following rewetting with N-15-labeled substrates. Plant N uptake reduced NO emissions by limiting N availability. In the absence of plants, soil N pools increased and NO emissions more than doubled. In dry soils, NO-producing substrates concentrated in hydrologically disconnected microsites. Upon rewetting, these concentrated N pools underwent rapid abiotic reaction, producing large NO pulses. Biological processes did not substantially contribute to the initial NO pulse but governed NO emissions within 24 h postwetting. Plants acted as an N sink, limiting NO emissions under optimal soil moisture. When soils were dry, however, the shutdown in plant N uptake, along with the activation of chemical mechanisms and the resuscitation of soil microbial processes upon rewetting, governed N loss. Aridity and vegetation interact to maintain a leaky N cycle during periods when plant N uptake is low, and hydrologically disconnected soils favor both microbial and abiotic NO-producing mechanisms. Under increasing rates of atmospheric N deposition and intensifying droughts, NO gas evasion may become an increasingly important pathway for ecosystem N loss in drylands.

AB Retention of nitrogen (N) is a critical ecosystem function, especially in the face of widespread anthropogenic N enrichment; however, our understanding of the mechanisms involved is limited. Here, we tested under glasshouse conditions how plant community attributes, including variations in the dominance, diversity and range of plant functional traits, influence N uptake and retention in temperate grassland. We added a pulse of N-15 to grassland plant communities assembled to represent a range of community-weighted mean plant traits, trait functional diversity and divergence, and species richness, and measured plant and microbial uptake of N-15, and leaching losses of N-15, as a short-term test of N retention in the plant-soil system. Root biomass, herb abundance and dominant plant traits were the main determinants of N retention in the plant-soil system: greater root biomass and herb abundance, and lower root tissue density, increased plant N-15 uptake, while higher specific leaf area and root tissue density increased microbial N-15 uptake. Our results provide novel, mechanistic insight into the short-term fate of N in the plant-soil system, and show that dominant plant traits, rather than trait functional diversity, control the fate of added N in the plant-soil system.

AB Due to its special geological history, the New Caledonian Archipelago is a mosaic of soil types, and in combination with climatic conditions this results in a heterogeneous environment across relatively small distances. A group of over 20 endemic species of Diospyros (Ebenaceae) has rapidly and recently radiated on the archipelago after a single long-distance dispersal event. Most of the Diospyros species in the radiating group are morphologically and ecologically well differentiated, but they exhibit low levels of DNA variability. To investigate the processes that shaped the diversification of this group we employed restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq). Over 8400 filtered SNPs generally confirm species delimitations and produce awell-supported phylogenetic tree. Our analyses document local introgression, but only a limited potential for gene flow over longer distances. The phylogenetic relationships point to an early regional clustering among populations and species, indicating that allopatric speciation with respect to macrohabitat (i.e., climatic conditions) may have had a role in the initial differentiation within the group. A later, more rapid radiation involved divergence with respect to microhabitat (i.e., soil preference). Several sister species in the group show a parallel divergence in edaphic preference. Searches for genomic regions that are systematically differentiated in this replicated phenotypic divergence pointed to loci potentially involved in ion binding and cellular transport. These loci appear meaningful in the context of adaptations to soil types that differ in heavy-metal and mineral content. Identical nucleotide changes affected only two of these loci, indicating that introgression may have played a limited role in their evolution. Our results suggest that both allopatric diversification and (parapatric) ecological divergence shaped successive rounds of speciation in the Diospyros radiation on New Caledonia.

AB Understanding what drives or prevents long-distance migrants to respond to environmental change requires basic knowledge about the wintering and breeding grounds, and the timing of movements between them. Both strong and weak migratory connectivity have been reported for Palearctic passerines wintering in Africa, but this remains unknown for most species. We investigated whether pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca from different breeding populations also differ in wintering locations in west-Africa. Light-level geolocator data revealed that flycatchers from different breeding populations travelled to different wintering sites, despite similarity in routes during most of the autumn migration. We found support for strong migratory connectivity showing an unexpected pattern: individuals breeding in Fennoscandia (S-Finland and S-Norway) wintered further west compared to individuals breeding at more southern latitudes in the Netherlands and SW-United Kingdom. The same pattern was found in ring recovery data from sub-Saharan Africa of individuals with confirmed breeding origin. Furthermore, population-specific migratory connectivity was associated with geographical variation in breeding and migration phenology: birds from populations which breed and migrate earlier wintered further east than birds from late' populations. There was no indication that wintering locations were affected by geolocation deployment, as we found high repeatability and consistency in C-13 and N-15 stable isotope ratios of winter grown feathers of individuals with and without a geolocator. We discuss the potential ecological factors causing such an unexpected pattern of migratory connectivity. We hypothesise that population differences in wintering longitudes of pied flycatchers result from geographical variation in breeding phenology and the timing of fuelling for spring migration at the wintering grounds. Future research should aim at describing how temporal dynamics in food availability across the wintering range affects migration, wintering distribution and populations' capacity to respond to environmental changes.

AB Within protected areas, biodiversity loss is often a consequence of illegal resource use. Understanding the patterns and extent of illegal activities is therefore essential for effective law enforcement and prevention of biodiversity declines. We used extensive data, commonly collected by ranger patrols in many protected areas, and Bayesian hierarchical models to identify drivers, trends, and distribution of multiple illegal activities within the Queen Elizabeth Conservation Area (QECA), Uganda. Encroachment (e.g., by pastoralists with cattle) and poaching of noncommercial animals (e.g., snaring bushmeat) were the most prevalent illegal activities within the QECA. Illegal activities occurred in different areas of the QECA. Poaching of noncommercial animals was most widely distributed within the national park. Overall, ecological covariates, although significant, were not useful predictors for occurrence of illegal activities. Instead, the location of illegal activities in previous years was more important. There were significant increases in encroachment and noncommercial plant harvesting (nontimber products) during the study period (1999-2012). We also found significant spatiotemporal variation in the occurrence of all activities. Our results show the need to explicitly model ranger patrol effort to reduce biases from existing uncorrected or capture per unit effort analyses. Prioritization of ranger patrol strategies is needed to target illegal activities; these strategies are determined by protected area managers, and therefore changes at a site-level can be implemented quickly. These strategies should also be informed by the location of past occurrences of illegal activity: the most useful predictor of future events. However, because spatial and temporal changes in illegal activities occurred, regular patrols throughout the protected area, even in areas of low occurrence, are also required.

AB Understanding the role of predators in food webs can be challenging in highly diverse predator/prey systems composed of small cryptic species. DNA based dietary analysis can supplement predator removal experiments and provide high resolution for prey identification. Here we use a metabarcoding approach to provide initial insights into the diet and functional role of coral-dwelling predatory fish feeding on small invertebrates. Fish were collected in Moorea (French Polynesia) where the BIOCODE project has generated DNA barcodes for numerous coral associated invertebrate species. Pyrosequencing data revealed a total of 292 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) in the gut contents of the arc-eye hawkfish (Paracirrhites arcatus), the flame hawkfish (Neocirrhites armatus) and the coral croucher (Caracanthus maculatus). One hundred forty-nine (51%) of them had species-level matches in reference libraries (>98% similarity) while 76 additional OTUs (26%) could be identified to higher taxonomic levels. Decapods that have a mutualistic relationship with Pocillopora and are typically dominant among coral branches, represent a minor contribution of the predators' diets. Instead, predators mainly consumed transient species including pelagic taxa such as copepods, chaetognaths and siphonophores suggesting non random feeding behavior. We also identified prey species known to have direct negative interactions with stony corals, such as Hapalocarcinus sp, a gall crab considered a coral parasite, as well as species of vermetid snails known for their deleterious effects on coral growth. Pocillopora DNA accounted for 20.8% and 20.1% of total number of sequences in the guts of the flame hawkfish and coral croucher but it was not detected in the guts of the arc-eye hawkfish. Comparison of diets among the three fishes demonstrates remarkable partitioning with nearly 80% of prey items consumed by only one predator. Overall, the taxonomic resolution provided by the metabarcoding approach highlights a highly complex interaction web and demonstrates that levels of trophic partitioning among coral reef fishes have likely been underestimated. Therefore, we strongly encourage further empirical approaches to dietary studies prior to making assumptions of trophic equivalency in food web reconstruction.

AB Global population growth has caused extensive human-induced environmental change, including a near-ubiquitous transformation of the acoustical environment due to the propagation of anthropogenic noise. Because the acoustical environment is a critical ecological dimension for countless species to obtain, interpret and respond to environmental cues, highly novel environmental acoustics have the potential to negatively impact organisms that use acoustics for a variety of functions, such as communication and predator/prey detection. Using a comparative approach with 308 populations of 183 bird species from 14 locations in Europe, North American and the Caribbean, I sought to reveal the intrinsic and extrinsic factors responsible for avian sensitivities to anthropogenic noise as measured by their habitat use in noisy versus adjacent quiet locations. Birds across all locations tended to avoid noisy areas, but trait-specific differences emerged. Vocal frequency, diet and foraging location predicted patterns of habitat use in response to anthropogenic noise, but body size, nest placement and type, other vocal features and the type of anthropogenic noise (chronic industrial vs. intermittent urban/traffic noise) failed to explain variation in habitat use. Strongly supported models also indicated the relationship between sensitivity to noise and predictive traits had little to no phylogenetic structure. In general, traits associated with hearing were strong predictors - species with low-frequency vocalizations, which experience greater spectral overlap with low-frequency anthropogenic noise tend to avoid noisy areas, whereas species with higher frequency vocalizations respond less severely. Additionally, omnivorous species and those with animal-based diets were more sensitive to noise than birds with plant-based diets, likely because noise may interfere with the use of audition in multimodal prey detection. Collectively, these results suggest that anthropogenic noise is a powerful sensory pollutant that can filter avian communities nonrandomly by interfering with birds' abilities to receive, respond to and dispatch acoustic cues and signals.

AB River ecological functioning can be conceptualized according to a four-dimensional framework, based on the responses of aquatic and riparian communities to hydrogeomorphic constraints along the longitudinal, transverse, vertical and temporal dimensions of rivers. Contemporary riparian vegetation responds to river dynamics at ecological timescales, but riparian vegetation, in one form or another, has existed on Earth since at least the Middle Ordovician (c. 450Ma) and has been a significant controlling factor on river geomorphology since the Late Silurian (c. 420Ma). On such evolutionary timescales, plant adaptations to the fluvial environment and the subsequent effects of these adaptations on fluvial sediment and landform dynamics resulted in the emergence, from the Silurian to the Carboniferous, of a variety of contrasted fluvial biogeomorphic types where water flow, morphodynamics and vegetation interacted to different degrees. Here we identify several of these types and describe the consequences for biogeomorphic structure and stability (i.e. resistance and resilience), along the four river dimensions, of feedbacks between riparian plants and hydrogeomorphic processes on contrasting ecological and evolutionary timescales.

AB In the water-limited Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Control Project Region, reference evapotranspiration (ETO) is a vital hydrological factor for the revegetation implementation, and its long-term variation is of much interest in climate change studies. In our study, temporal and spatial patterns in ET and related driving factors in the project region are evaluated for the period 1959-2011, based on daily data from 46 meteorological stations, using Mann-Kendall CM-K) test, Sen's slope estimator, and multivariate regression. The results indicated that annual ETO had an insignificant decreasing trend in the study area, in which 15 stations showed significant negative trends and only 1 station showed significant positive trend at the 95% confidence level. Significant downward ETO was detected in the north sub-region (I) in spring, in the west sub-region (II) in summer and autumn. Analysis of the impacts of meteorological variables on spatiotemporal trends of ETO showed that wind speed was the most dominant factor affecting ETO variation at 35 stations. Downward ETO induced by decreased wind speed may be result from revegetation of Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Control Project. In addition, ET change was influenced by sunshine duration in summer and maximum air temperature in winter. Better understanding ET response to climate change will enable efficient use of water resources and vegetation management, which could improve the ecological and environmental quality in Beijing, Tianjin, and the surrounding areas.

AB Neonicotinoid insecticides are widely used for control of insect pests around the world and are especially pervasive in agricultural pest management. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that the broad-scale and prophylactic uses of neonicotinoids pose serious risks of harm to beneficial organisms and their ecological function. This provides the impetus for exploring alternatives to neonicotinoid insecticides for controlling insect pests. We draw from examples of alternative pest control options in Italian maize production and Canadian forestry to illustrate the principles of applying alternatives to neonicotinoids under an integrated pest management (IPM) strategy. An IPM approach considers all relevant and available information to make informed management decisions, providing pest control options based on actual need. We explore the benefits and challenges of several options for management of three insect pests in maize crops and an invasive insect pest in forests, including diversifying crop rotations, altering the timing of planting, tillage and irrigation, using less sensitive crops in infested areas, applying biological control agents, and turning to alternative reduced risk insecticides. Continued research into alternatives is warranted, but equally pressing is the need for information transfer and training for farmers and pest managers and the need for policies and regulations to encourage the adoption of IPM strategies and their alternative pest control options.

AB Monitoring the distribution and abundance of hunted wildlife is critical to achieving sustainable resource use, yet adequate data are sparse for most tropical regions. Conventional methods for monitoring hunted forest-vertebrate species require intensive in situ survey effort, which severely constrains spatial and temporal replication. Integrating local ecological knowledge (LEK) into monitoring and management is appealing because it can be cost-effective, enhance community participation, and provide novel insights into sustainable resource use. We develop a technique to monitor population depletion of hunted forest wildlife in the Brazilian Amazon, based on the local ecological knowledge of rural hunters. We performed rapid interview surveys to estimate the landscape-scale depletion of ten large-bodied vertebrate species around 161 Amazonian riverine settlements. We assessed the explanatory and predictive power of settlement and landscape characteristics and were able to develop robust estimates of local faunal depletion. By identifying species-specific drivers of depletion and using secondary data on human population density, land form, and physical accessibility, we then estimated landscape-and regional-scale depletion. White-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), for example, were estimated to be absent from 17% of their putative range in Brazil's largest state (Amazonas), despite 98% of the original forest cover remaining intact. We found evidence that bushmeat consumption in small urban centers has far-reaching impacts on some forest species, including severe depletion well over 100 km from urban centers. We conclude that LEK-based approaches require further field validation, but have significant potential for community-based participatory monitoring as well as cost-effective, large-scale monitoring of threatened forest species.

AB The Sirex woodwasp, Sirex noctilio, and its fungal mutualist, Amylostereum areolatum, together constitute one of the most damaging invasive pests of pine. Despite a century of research and well-established management programs, control remains unpredictable and spread continues to new areas. Variable success in managing this pest has been influenced by complex invasion patterns, the multilayered nature of biological interactions, the varying local ecologies, and microevolutionary population processes in both the biocontrol organisms and in the wasps. Recent research findings are challenging the historical perspectives on methods to manage the Sirex woodwasp, calling for management programs to incorporate the variable local dynamics affecting this pest complex. In this regard, the Sirex woodwasp provides a superb model to illustrate the need for a different approach to develop efficient and sustainable management tools to deal with the growing and global nature of pest invasions in forests and plantations.

AB The use of charcoal as a soil amendment is currently of great interest to sequester carbon and improve soil fertility, however, studies of sites where charcoal amendments to the soil have been made many years ago are lacking at the moment. In this study we investigated historical charcoal production sites in Germany that have not been in use for >60 years, and evaluated the effects of the former charcoal inputs on soil and vegetation parameters relative to those of adjacent, unamended areas. Surface soil samples (0-5, 5-20 cm) were taken from five sites located on extremely acidic (Siegerland, pH 3.8-4.1) and base rich soils (Eifel, pH 4.8-5.3) in species poor (Luzulo-Fagetum) and species rich (Hordelymo-Fagetum) beech forests, respectively. We determined stocks of black carbon (BC) and natural soil organic carbon (SOC = total C minus BC) as well as of soil nutrient stocks (NO3-N, P, K, Mg), cation exchange capacity and water holding capacity, and we mapped plant composition to calculate richness and evenness. The results showed that historical charcoal production sites were enriched with BC and also exhibited increased stocks of natural SOC and total N possibly due to enhanced stabilization of natural SOC by the charcoal. The availability of nitrate-nitrogen, phosphate and potassium was increased when the charcoal was added to the base rich soils and less so when charcoal was added to the extremely acidic soils. Plant biodiversity was not different between the sites of historical charcoal addition and the reference sites. We conclude that charcoal additions may increase soil carbon storage capacity over prolonged periods of time without negatively affecting plant ecological interactions over the long term.

AB Supertree methods construct trees on a set of taxa (species) combining many smaller trees on the overlapping subsets of the entire set of taxa. A 'quartet' is an unrooted tree over 4 taxa, hence the quartet-based supertree methods combine many 4-taxon unrooted trees into a single and coherent tree over the complete set of taxa. Quartet-based phylogeny reconstruction methods have been receiving considerable attentions in the recent years. An accurate and efficient quartet-based method might be competitive with the current best phylogenetic tree reconstruction methods (such as maximum likelihood or Bayesian MCMC analyses), without being as computationally intensive. In this paper, we present a novel and highly accurate quartet-based phylogenetic tree reconstruction method. We performed an extensive experimental study to evaluate the accuracy and scalability of our approach on both simulated and biological datasets.

AB The instrumental temperature record is of insufficient length to fully express the natural variability of past temperature. High elevation tree-ring widths from Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) are a particularly useful proxy to infer temperatures prior to the instrumental record in that the tree-rings are annually dated and extend for millennia. From ring-width measurements integrated with past treeline elevation data we infer decadal- to millennial-scale temperature variability over the past 4,500 years for the Great Basin, USA. We find that twentieth century treeline advances are greater than in at least 4,000 years. There is also evidence for substantial volcanic forcing of climate in the preindustrial record and considerable covariation between high elevation tree-ring widths and temperature estimates from an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model over much of the last millennium. A long-term temperature decline of similar to-1.1 A degrees C since the mid-Holocene underlies substantial volcanic forcing of climate in the preindustrial record.

AB Dead wood is a key substrate for forest biodiversity, hosting a rich and often threatened biodiversity of wood-living species. However, the relationship between the occurrence of dead wood and associated species is modified by several environmental factors. Here we review the present state of knowledge on how dead wood on different spatial and temporal scales affects saproxylic biodiversity. We searched for peer-reviewed studies on saproxylic species that compared dead wood distribution on at least two spatial or temporal scales. We scanned close to 300 articles, of which 34 fit our criteria. 20 studies were directed towards the current amount of dead wood at different scale levels and how this relates to the abundance or occurrence of saproxylic species, embracing scales from 10 m to 10 km. 14 studies compared time-lagged effects of dead wood, covering time-lags from 25 years to more than 200 years. The reviewed articles focused mainly on European forest and addressed invertebrates (mostly beetles), alone or in combination with fungi (27 articles), fungi (six articles), or lichens (one article). Although the significance of dead wood for forest biodiversity is firmly established, the reviewed studies show that we still have limited knowledge of the relationship between saproxylic biodiversity and spatial and temporal scales. Based on the reviewed studies, we conclude that there is large variation in response to spatial and temporal dead wood patterns between different taxa and subgroups. Still, several of the reviewed papers indicate that time-lagged effects deserve more attention, especially on a landscape scale and for specialized or red-listed species. Further work is required before firm management recommendations can be suggested.

AB Fire and drought are selective driving forces in Mediterranean plants, and thus their ability to resprout or recruit after these disturbances is of paramount importance. The contrast in regeneration niche between resprouters and seeders, and each group's different root characteristics, suggest that they are subjected to different degrees of environmental stress and, consequently, to different evolutionary forces.
   We compared leaf traits, xylem traits related to hydraulic efficiency and vulnerability to cavitation, and the physiological response to an imposed drought between seedlings of resprouters and seedlings of seeders. We used 12 species co-existing in Mediterranean basin ecosystems.
   Major differences were found in the xylem architecture and leaf traits, and in the response to drought conditions. Seeders were more efficient at transporting water to leaves but formed, in turn, a safer xylem network. They also presented higher photosynthesis and transpiration rates, and earlier stomatal closure with drought, but good leaf dehydration tolerance.
   Seeders and resprouters can be considered two syndromes whose different functional characteristics are related to water availability and drought responses. These characteristics, together with their differences in rooting habits, account for their distinct regeneration niches and, thus, their co-existence.

AB Invasive plants can have a major impact on local plant and animal communities. However, effects of plant invasions on arthropod communities and the potential drivers have rarely been studied. We present a meta-analysis of 56 studies on the impact of plant invasions on abundance and richness of local arthropod communities. Moreover, we study the role of five invader and habitat attributes to assess their influence on the direction and magnitude of effect on arthropod communities: the time since introduction; woody vs. herbaceous invaders; presence of native congeners; canopy cover of the invader; and single vs. multiple invaders. We found that overall invaded habitats had a 29% lower arthropod abundance and a 17% lower taxonomic richness compared with non-invaded habitats. Woody invaders had a stronger negative impact on arthropod communities than herbaceous invaders, reducing abundance and richness by as much as 55% and 21%, respectively.Synthesis. Our study demonstrates that arthropod communities are negatively affected by plant invasions, which may have substantial effects on other ecosystem features, such as pollination, food web dynamics, decomposition as well as habitat heterogeneity. Loss of arthropod diversity is generally directly associated with loss of plant species richness. Therefore, the reduction we see could be causally connected to the effect of the invader on the habitat. The physical dominance of woody invaders compared with herbaceous invaders could be a main driver for this effect.

AB We document the rapid transformation of one of the Earth's last remaining Arctic refugia, a change that is being driven by global warming. In stark contrast to the amplified warming observed throughout much of the Arctic, the Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) of subarctic Canada has maintained cool temperatures, largely due to the counteracting effects of persistent sea ice. However, since the mid-1990s, climate of the HBL has passed a tipping point, the pace and magnitude of which is exceptional even by Arctic standards, exceeding the range of regional long-term variability. Using high-resolution, palaeolimnological records of algal remains in dated lake sediment cores, we report that, within this short period of intense warming, striking biological changes have occurred in the region's freshwater ecosystems. The delayed and intense warming in this remote region provides a natural observatory for testing ecosystem resilience under a rapidly changing climate, in the absence of direct anthropogenic influences. The environmental repercussions of this climate change are of global significance, influencing the huge store of carbon in the region's extensive peatlands, the world's southern-most polar bear population that depends upon Hudson Bay sea ice and permafrost for survival, and native communities who rely on this landscape for sustenance.

AB Temperature can regulate a number of important biological processes and species interactions. For example, environmental temperature can alter insect herbivore consumption, growth and survivorship, suggesting that temperature-driven impacts on herbivory could influence plant community composition or nutrient cycling. However, few studies to date have examined whether rising temperature influences herbivore preference and performance among multiple plant species, which often dictates their impact at the community level. Here, we assessed the effects of temperature on the performance and preference of the generalist herbivore Popillia japonica among nine plant species. We show that, on average, consumption rates and herbivore performance increased at higher temperatures. However, there was considerable variation among plant species with consumption and performance increasing on some plant species at higher temperatures but decreasing on others. Plant nutritional quality appeared to influence these patterns as beetles increased feeding on high-nitrogen plants with increasing temperature, suggesting stronger nitrogen limitation. In addition to changes in feeding rates, feeding preferences of P. japonica shifted among temperatures, a pattern that was largely explained by differential deterrence of plant chemical extracts at different temperatures. In fact, temperature-induced changes in the efficacy of plant chemical extracts led P. japonica to reduce its diet breadth at higher temperatures. Our results indicate that rising temperatures will influence herbivore feeding behavior by altering the importance of plant nutritional and chemical traits, suggesting that climate change will alter the strength and sign of plant-insect interactions.

AB The relative contribution of top-down and bottom-up processes regulating primary decomposers can influence the strength of the link between the soil animal community and ecosystem functioning. Although soil bacterial communities are regulated by bottom-up and top-down processes, the latter are considered to be less important in structuring the diversity and functioning of fungal-dominated ecosystems. Despite the huge diversity of mycophagous (fungal-feeding) soil fauna, and their potential to reverse the outcomes of competitive fungal interactions, top-down grazing effects have never been found to translate to community-level changes. We constructed soil mesocosms to investigate the potential of isopods grazing on cord-forming basidiomycete fungi to influence the community composition and functioning of a complex woodland soil microbial community. Using metagenomic sequencing we provide conclusive evidence of direct top-down control at the community scale in fungal-dominated woodland soil. By suppressing the dominant cord-forming basidiomycete fungi, isopods prevented the competitive exclusion of surrounding litter fungi, increasing diversity in a community containing several hundred fungal species. This isopod-induced modification of community composition drove a shift in the soil enzyme profile, and led to a restructuring of the wider mycophagous invertebrate community. We highlight characteristics of different soil ecosystems that will give rise to such top-down control. Given the ubiquity of isopods and basidiomycete fungi in temperate and boreal woodland ecosystems, such top-down community control could be of widespread significance for global carbon and nutrient cycling.

AB AimSpecies distribution models often assume a changing climate (dynamic climate variables) but unchanged land use (static land use variables) to estimate future species distribution shifts. However, scenarios of projected land use change are available to calculate dynamic land use variables. Surprisingly, the importance of using dynamic instead of static land use variables when projecting potential future species distributions under climate change remains largely unexplored. We tested whether the joint inclusion of land use and climate change scenarios altered the projection of future species distribution compared with the classical approach assuming unchanged land use.

   MethodsWe used land use and climate change scenarios to estimate the future distribution of a butterfly species (Lycaena dispar) according to different perspectives of projected environmental change: (1) land use change (dynamic land use and static climate variables), (2) climate change (static land use and dynamic climate variables) and (3) global change (dynamic land use and climate variables). As the importance of land use variables is known to depend on the spatial resolution of the models, we built them across a range of resolutions (50km, 10km and 5km) to examine the resolution-dependent relevance of using dynamic instead of static variables.
   ResultsFor each resolution, the projected distribution changes were unaltered when using dynamic instead of static land use variables in the models. It was mainly due to the low thematic resolution of the land use change scenarios that include only few dynamic variables.
   Main conclusionsEven at fine spatial resolution (5km), the available land use change scenarios poorly represent habitat suitability for the species. Hence, they may be of limited support to estimate future species distributions. Instead of supporting the assumption of unchanged future land use, our results plea for an improvement of the thematic resolution of land use change scenarios.

AB Recent technological advancements now allow us to obtain geographical position data for a wide range of animal movements. Here we used light-level geolocators to study the annual migration cycle in great reed warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus), a passerine bird breeding in Eurasia and wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. We were specifically interested in seasonal strategies in routes and schedules of migration. We found that the great reed warblers (all males, no females were included) migrated from the Swedish breeding site in early August. After spending up to three weeks at scattered stopover sites in central to south-eastern Europe, they resumed migration and crossed the Mediterranean Sea and Sahara Desert without lengthy stopovers. They then spread out over a large overwintering area and each bird utilised two (or even three) main wintering sites that were spatially separated by a distinct mid-winter movement. Spring migration initiation date differed widely between individuals (1-27 April). Several males took a more westerly route over the Sahara in spring than in autumn, and in general there were fewer long-distance travels and more frequent shorter stopovers, including one in northern Africa, in spring. The shorter stopovers made spring migration on average faster than autumn migration. There was a strong correlation between the spring departure dates from wintering sites and the arrival dates at the breeding ground. All males had a high migration speed in spring despite large variation in departure dates, indicating a time-minimization strategy to achieve an early arrival at the breeding site; the latter being decisive for high reproductive success in great reed warblers. Our results have important implications for the understanding of long-distance migrants' ability to predict conditions at distant breeding sites and adapt to rapid environmental change.

AB In this paper, the objective is to assess the influence of the institutional organisation of AESs on farmers' participation in the schemes. The literature reveals that the institutional organisation of AESs can influence participation in the schemes and that this participation rate is an important indicator of the schemes' eventual environmental effectiveness. The paper describes several alternative ways to design and implement AESs, and two study regions were chosen in which several of these alternatives have been applied in practice: the region of Flanders, in Belgium; and the state of Arkansas, in the US. On the basis of the results obtained one could argue that farmers are generally more in favour of a flexible approach towards AESs, in which they have the freedom to decide on contract terms and the related payment. However, although this could have a positive effect on the environmental effectiveness of the schemes, it could also significantly increase the transaction costs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The principle of limiting similarity suggests that species must be functionally different to coexist; based on the assumption that inter-specific competition should be greatest between functionally similar species. There has been controversy over the generality of this assembly rule for plant communities with some studies finding evidence for limiting similarity and others not. One approach to testing this is to examine the invasion' success of species into communities in which the functional group composition has been manipulated. Using a meta-analysis approach, we examined the generality of limiting similarity for plant communities based on published experimental studies. We asked is establishment of an invading species less successful if it belongs to a functional group that is already present in the community compared to a community in which that functional group is absent? We explored separately colonisation (i.e. germination, establishment or seedling survival) and performance (i.e. biomass, cover or growth) of different functional groups (forbs and grasses) and experimental designs (removal experiments of more or less natural communities and synthetic-assemblage experiments). We found that communities containing functionally similar resident species did reduce invader colonisation and performance of forb invaders, but did not reduce colonisation or performance of grass invaders. Evidence in support of limiting similarity was only detected in synthetic-assemblage experiments and not when studies used functional group removal from natural' communities. Functional similarity is an important aspect of biotic resistance for forb invaders, but was only found in artificial communities. This has implications for restoration ecology especially when communities are built de novo. However, we suggest that limiting similarity plays a limited role in biotic resistance, because no evidence was detected in established communities.

AB Public participation was one of the hallmarks of the California Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) Initiative, a planning process to support the redesign of California's system of marine protected areas (MPAs). The MLPA Initiative implemented innovative and unconventional public outreach and engagement strategies to assist local communities share relevant knowledge and data, and provide timely and targeted contributions to MPA planning discussions. This collaborative model helped broaden traditional forms of participation to ensure public input received and integrated into MPA planning legitimately reflected the interests and priorities of California's coastal communities. A number of considerations were critical to the success of this collaborative approach, including: understanding the needs and limitations of public audiences; working directly with communities to identify appropriate outreach and engagement strategies; prioritizing strategies that supported a multi-directional exchange of information; adapting strategies based on public feedback and internal lessons learned; and hiring professional public engagement specialists. Strategies evolved over time and increased the level and quality of public participation over this multi-stage planning process. Experiences gained from the MLPA Initiative can be used to encourage consideration of collaborative participation in other environmental planning and decision-making processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB 1. Rapid environmental change occurring in high-latitude regions has the potential to cause extensive thawing of permafrost. Retrogressive thaw slumps are a particularly spectacular form of permafrost degradation that can significantly impact lakewater chemistry; however, to date, the effects on aquatic biota have received little attention. 2. We used a diatom-based palaeolimnological approach featuring a paired lake study design to examine the impact of thaw slumping on freshwater ecosystems in the low Arctic of western Canada. We compared biological responses in six lakes affected by permafrost degradation with six undisturbed, reference lakes. 3. Slump-affected lakes exhibited greater biological change than the paired reference systems, although all systems have undergone ecologically significant changes over the last 200 years. Four of the six reference systems showed an increase in the relative abundance of planktonic algal taxa (diatoms and scaled chrysophytes), the earliest beginning about 1900, consistent with increased temperature trends in this region. 4. The response of sedimentary diatoms to thaw slumping was understandably variable, but primarily related to the intensity of disturbance and associated changes in aquatic habitat. Five of the slump-affected lakes recorded increases in the abundance and diversity of periphytic diatoms at the presumed time of slump initiation, consistent with increased water clarity and subsequent development of aquatic macrophyte communities. Slump-affected lakes generally displayed lower nutrient levels; however, in one system, thaw slumping, induced by an intense fire at the site in 1968, ostensibly led to pronounced nutrient enrichment that persists today. 5. Our results demonstrate that retrogressive thaw slumping represents an important stressor to the biological communities of lakes in the western Canadian Arctic and can result in a number of limnological changes. We also show that palaeolimnological methods are effective for inferring the timing and response of aquatic ecosystems to permafrost degradation. These findings provide the first long-term perspective on the biological response to permafrost thaw, a stressor that will become increasingly important as northern landscapes respond to climate change.

AB Spatial conservation prioritization should seek to anticipate climate change impacts on biodiversity and to mitigate these impacts through the development of dynamic conservation plans. Here, we defined spatial priorities for the conservation of amphibians inhabiting the Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot that overcome the likely impacts of climate change on the distribution of this imperiled fauna. First, we built ecological niche models (ENMs) for 431 amphibian species both for current time and for the mid-point of a 30-year period spanning 2071-2099 (i.e. 2080). For modeling species' niches, we combined six modeling methods and three different climate models. We also quantified and mapped model uncertainties. Our consensus models forecasted range shifts that culminate with high species richness in central and eastern Atlantic Forest, both for current time and for 2080. Most species had a significant range contraction (up to 72%) and 12% of species were projected to be regionally extinct. Most species would need to disperse because suitable climatic sites will change. Therefore, we identified a network of priority sites for conservation that minimizes the distance a given species would need to disperse because of changes in future habitat suitability (i.e. climate-forced dispersal) as well as uncertainties associated to ENMs. This network also maximized complementary species representation across currently established protected areas. Priority sites already include possible dispersal corridors linking current and future suitable habitats for amphibians. Although we used the a top-ranked Biodiversity Hotspot and amphibians as a case study for illustrating our approach, our study may help developing more effective conservation strategies under climate change, especially when applied at different spatial scales, geographic regions, and taxonomic groups.

AB Aim Small (< 1 km2) alpine glaciers are likely to disappear in this century, resulting in decreased regional habitat heterogeneity in associated streams. Both heterogeneity within and spatial isolation among glacier-influenced streams can enhance beta diversity of stream-dwelling organisms. We measured beta at both community and population-genetic levels within and among streams currently influenced by small Pyrenean glaciers. We aimed to evaluate whether patterns are analogous between the two levels, to apply various approaches for characterizing beta, and to infer the outcome of future glacier loss on regional biodiversity. Location Four glacier-fed basins in the Parc National des Pyrenees, France. Methods We classified each of 18 stream reaches across the basins into either high-, mid- or low-glaciality (glacial influence) groups according to four physicochemical characteristics. At each reach, we collected macroinvertebrate communities and evaluated mitochondrial DNA haplotypes for 1113 individuals of Baetis alpinus Pictet. Using taxa/haplotypes as basic units, we evaluated community and population-genetic beta diversity simultaneously. We measured beta diversity in three major ways: as multivariate (Sorensen's dissimilarity, Jost D) and classical (gamma/alpha) variation to compare among glaciality groups, and as turnover along the glaciality gradient within each basin. Results For most approaches at both organizational levels, beta was greatest among high-glaciality reaches, absolute values of variation of beta in high-glaciality streams were strikingly similar between levels, and the steepest turnover within basins occurred between high- and mid-glaciality reaches. Therefore, high-glaciality reaches contained assemblages and populations that were unique both within that stream type (among basins) and compared with other stream types within basins. Main conclusions Parallel beta diversity patterns at population-genetic and community levels suggested that environmental drivers influence these levels analogously. Extreme conditions (e.g. low temperature, high instability, isolation) in high-glaciality streams probably enhance beta at both levels. Stream beta diversity is likely to decrease substantially with continued glacial reduction in this system.

ID LITHOBATES-CATESBEIANUS; NOISE; ANURA
AB Invasive species are known to affect native species in a variety of ways, but the effect of acoustic invaders has not been examined previously. We simulated an invasion of the acoustic niche by exposing calling native male white-banded tree frogs (Hypsiboas albomarginatus) to recorded invasive American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) calls. In response, tree frogs immediately shifted calls to significantly higher frequencies. In the post-stimulus period, they continued to use higher frequencies while also decreasing signal duration. Acoustic signals are the primary basis of mate selection in many anurans, suggesting that such changes could negatively affect the reproductive success of native species. The effects of bullfrog vocalizations on acoustic communities are expected to be especially severe due to their broad frequency band, which masks the calls of multiple species simultaneously.

AB The objective of this study is to globally assess the effects of atmospheric nitrogen deposition and climate, associated with rising levels of atmospheric CO2, on the variability of carbon isotope discrimination (?13C), and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) of angiosperm and conifer tree species. Eighty-nine long-term isotope tree-ring chronologies, representing 23 conifer and 13 angiosperm species for 53 sites worldwide, were extracted from the literature, and used to obtain long-term time series of ?13C and iWUE. ?13C and iWUE were related to the increasing concentration of atmospheric CO2 over the industrial period (18502000) and to the variation of simulated atmospheric nitrogen deposition and climatic variables over the period 19502000. We applied generalized additive models and linear mixed-effects models to predict the effects of climatic variables and nitrogen deposition on ?13C and iWUE. Results showed a declining ?13C trend in the angiosperm and conifer species over the industrial period and a 16.1% increase of iWUE between 1850 and 2000, with no evidence that the increased rate was reduced at higher ambient CO2 values. The temporal variation in ?13C supported the hypothesis of an active plant mechanism that maintains a constant ratio between intercellular and ambient CO2 concentrations. We defined linear mixed-effects models that were effective to describe the variation of ?13C and iWUE as a function of a set of environmental predictors, alternatively including annual rate (Nrate) and long-term cumulative (Ncum) nitrogen deposition. No single climatic or atmospheric variable had a clearly predominant effect, however, ?13C and iWUE showed complex dependent interactions between different covariates. A significant association of Nrate with iWUE and ?13C was observed in conifers and in the angiosperms, and Ncum was the only independent term with a significant positive association with iWUE, although a multi-factorial control was evident in conifers.

AB Throughout the southern part of the boreal forest, timber harvesting has generated a young forest matrix interspersed with mature remnants and fragmented by numerous roads. These changes have modified the abundance and diversity of many animal species and destabilized some trophic networks. Because wolves (Canis lupus) are apex predators of the boreal food web, wolf response to cumulative disturbances could have important impacts on the entire ecosystem. Our objective was to assess the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on wolf habitat selection in a highly disturbed landscape. Between 2005 and 2010, we tracked 22 wolves with GPS collars in nine packs inhabiting the southern fringe of Quebec's boreal forest. Using resource selection functions, we assessed the synergistic impacts of anthropogenic disturbances and habitat quality on habitat selection. Wolves selected areas providing food or likely to improve hunting success, but avoided anthropogenic disturbances, especially in regions with high levels of human activity. Interestingly, wolves seemed more tolerant of infrastructure when frequenting high-quality habitats. We demonstrate how anthropogenic disturbances may influence wolf habitat selection. Wildlife managers should take into account predator responses to logging-related disturbances when planning forest management for potential prey species. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Performance of migrating birds can be affected by a number of intrinsic and extrinsic factors like morphology, meteorological conditions and migration strategies. We compared travel speeds of four raptor species during their crossing of the Sahara desert. Focusing the analyses on this region allows us to compare different species under equivalent conditions in order to disentangle which factors affect migratory performance.
   Methodology/Principal Finding: We tracked raptors using GPS satellite transmitters from Sweden, Spain and Italy, and evaluated their migratory performance at both an hourly and a daily scale. Hourly data (flight speed and altitude for intervals of two hours) were analyzed in relation to time of day, species and season, and daily data (distance between roosting sites) in relation to species, season, day length and tailwind support.
   Conclusions/Significance: Despite a clear variation in morphology, interspecific differences were generally very small, and did only arise in spring, with long-distance migrants (>5000 km: osprey and Western marsh-harrier) being faster than species that migrate shorter distances (Egyptian vulture and short-toed eagle). Our results suggest that the most important factor explaining hourly variation in flight speed is time of day, while at a daily scale, tailwind support is the most important factor explaining variation in daily distance, raising new questions about the consequences of possible future changes in worldwide wind patterns.

AB Because most clonal vertebrates have hybrid genomic constitutions, tight linkages are assumed among hybridization, clonality, and polyploidy. However, predictions about how these processes mechanistically relate during the switch from sexual to clonal reproduction have not been validated. Therefore, we performed a crossing experiment to test the hypothesis that interspecific hybridization per se initiated clonal diploid and triploid spined loaches (Cobitis) and their gynogenetic reproduction. We reared two F1 families resulting from the crossing of 14 pairs of two sexual species, and found their diploid hybrid constitution and a 1:1 sex ratio. While males were infertile, females produced unreduced nonrecombinant eggs (100%). Synthetic triploid females and males (96.3%) resulted in each of nine backcrossed families from eggs of synthesized diploid F1s fertilized by haploid sperm from sexual males. Five individuals (3.7%) from one backcross family were genetically identical to the somatic cells of the mother and originated via gynogenesis; the sperm of the sexual male only triggered clonal development of the egg. Our reconstruction of the evolutionary route from sexuality to clonality and polyploidy in these fish shows that clonality and gynogenesis may have been directly triggered by interspecific hybridization and that polyploidy is a consequence, not a cause, of clonality.

AB Spring habitats are highly diverse and have a mosaic microhabitat structure. They are endangered by diffuse exploitation as drinking-water resources, an impact likely to increase with climate change. Diatoms were sampled from stones and bryophytes in 110 nonthermal, near-natural springs in the southeastern Alps (Trentino) and 16 carbonate springs in the Dolomiti Bellunesi National Park. Fuzzy clustering identified 6 assemblages in the main types of springs. Carbonate rheocrenes hosted Achnanthidium spp., Gomphonema elegantissimum, and Nitzschia fonticola. Several of these species are rheophilic. This group was divided into 4 subassemblages defined by decreasing A. lineare and increasing A. pyrenaicum with increasing flow. Carbonate rheocrenes with shading or moderate NO3- enrichment contained a majority of sciaphilic and NO3-tolerant taxa: Cocconeis taxa, Amphora spp., Caloneis fontinalis, Reimeria spp., and Eunotia arcubus. Well-buffered siliceous rheocrenes supported Diatoma spp., Eunotia minor, Encyonema minutum, Navicula exilis, and Planothidium lanceolatum. Many of these species are heliophilic and rheophilic. Carbonate rheocrenes with lower conductivities or seasonal desiccation contained typical taxa of unstable environments: Diadesmis spp., Planothidium frequentissimum, Meridion circulare, and Achnanthidium dolomiticum. Carbonate rock-face seepages and some tufa springs supported xerotolerant diatom species with a preference for higher conductivities: Encyonopsis spp., Delicata spp., Gomphonema lateripunctatum, Denticula spp., and Cymbopleura spp. Siliceous seepages and pool springs, some very-low alkalinity rheocrenes, and 1 iron spring were characterized by acidophilous mire taxa, such as Eunotia spp., Frustulia crassinervia, and Tabellaria flocculosa, and very-low-alkalinity indicators, such as Psammothidium acidoclinatum. The other iron springs harbored species-poor assemblages with low numbers of cells. Many diatom species showed a significant preference for stones or bryophytes. Epibryon had higher richness and diversity than epilithon, and mean diversity did not differ among the most frequent bryophyte species. Bryophytes are quick and easy to sample and are proposed as the target substratum for diatom-based assessments of springs.

AB Between 2005 and 2009, we deployed 58 miniature pop-up satellite archival tags (PSAT) and 132 implanted archival tags on juvenile Atlantic bluefin tuna (age 2-5) in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. Data returned from these efforts (n = 26 PSATs, 1 archival tag) revealed their dispersal routes, horizontal and vertical movements and habitat utilization. All of the tagged bluefin tuna remained in the northwest Atlantic for the duration observed, and in summer months exhibited core-use of coastal seas extending from Maryland to Cape Cod, MA, (USA) out to the shelf break. Their winter distributions were more spatially disaggregated, ranging south to the South Atlantic Bight, northern Bahamas and Gulf Stream. Vertical habitat patterns showed that juvenile bluefin tuna mainly occupied shallow depths (mean = 5-12 m, sd = 15-23.7 m) and relatively warm water masses in summer (mean = 17.9-20.9 degrees C, sd = 4.2-2.6 degrees C) and had deeper and more variable depth patterns in winter (mean = 41-58 m, sd = 48.9-62.2 m). Our tagging results reveal annual dispersal patterns, behavior and oceanographic associations of juvenile Atlantic bluefin tuna that were only surmised in earlier studies. Fishery independent profiling from electronic tagging also provide spatially and temporally explicit information for evaluating dispersals rates, population structure and fisheries catch patterns.

AB Animals in urban environments often must adjust their vocalizations to be heard over the din of anthropogenic ambient noise. Most studies of this process use current comparisons of environments that vary in ambient noise; here, we evaluate over time the effects of the urban environment on signal structure and salience. We show that white-crowned sparrow, Zonotrichia leucophrys, song increased in minimum frequency between 1969 and 2005 in San Francisco, California, U.S.A., coincident with rising levels of traffic noise. A higher minimum frequency is less likely to be masked by low-frequency ambient noise and thus is more likely to be effective as a communication signal. To test whether this change in song affects receiver response, we presented territorial males current (2005) and historical (1969) local songs. Males responded more strongly to current than to historical songs, suggesting that current songs communicate more effectively in the current local environment. The results suggest that behavioural adjustment to anthropogenic ambient noise over time can affect cultural evolution and communication. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain sex-related differences in foraging in sexually monomorphic seabirds. The 'intersexual competition' hypothesis suggests that parents are in competition and that the dominated sex must adapt its behaviour to avoid competing with the dominant one. The 'energetic constraint' hypothesis suggests that differential energetic requirements lead to different foraging behaviour. We examined sexual differences in foraging behaviour of a sexually monomorphic tropical seabird, the Barau's petrel, Pterodroma baraui, throughout the breeding period. We found sexual differences in foraging habitats and activities, but these were not consistent throughout the breeding period. During the prelaying exodus, males foraged further from the colony, in waters with greater surface chlorophyll concentration, and were more active than females. Males systematically took the first incubation shift, which was always longer than the others. However, no sex-related differences in foraging behaviour were observed during the chick-rearing period, both sexes sharing parental duties equally. We suggest that the sexual differences observed early in the breeding period are due to the specific needs of males and females. Females need to restore their body condition as quickly as possible after laying, which forces males to take the first long incubation shift at the nest. This may explain why males forage more actively during the prelaying exodus, to prepare for this long fasting period. Our results support for the first time the 'energy constraint' hypothesis to explain sexual differences in behaviour of a small, monomorphic procellariiform seabird.

AB Urbanization is a major driver of land cover change worldwide, yet little is known about how urbanization affects beneficial arthropod communities. This study examined how local and landscape scale variables associated with urbanization influenced parasitic Hymenoptera abundance and diversity in residential and commercial properties along a rural to urban landscape gradient in Wisconsin. At a landscape scale, 300 m surrounding sites, land cover percentages were calculated for five cover classes: impervious cover, forest, grassland, agriculture, and urban green space. In addition, habitat diversity (Simpson's index) was calculated for the landscape surrounding study sites. At a local scale (within the boundaries of an individual property), flower diversity, flower area, tree density, and hardscape were measured and related to parasitoid abundance and diversity. During 2006 and 2007, parasitoids were sampled twice a month June-August using yellow sticky cards. Parasitoid abundance was a positive function of flower diversity, a local scale variable. The positive relationship between parasitoid abundance and flower diversity only occurred in areas containing high to moderate levels of urban development, suggesting parasitoids locally benefited from the increased availability of floral resources in urban but not rural sites. Parasitoid diversity decreased as impervious cover increased in the surrounding landscape. Parasitoid diversity decreased by approximately 10% in highly urbanized sites relative to rural sites, a pattern driven by several parasitoid families not detected in urban sites. These results suggest conservation strategies that focus on landscape variables at multiple scales can play an integral role in preserving beneficial arthropods across urban landscapes.

AB Eelgrass (Zostera marina) used to dominate the vegetation in Odense Fjord, Denmark, and covered >17 km(2) of the shallow fjord in 1983. Decades of excessive nutrient loading has lead to decreased eelgrass distribution, and only similar to 2 km(2) is covered at present. The state of low eelgrass coverage has not changed despite significant improvements of water quality in the past >10 years, and lugworms, Arenicola marina, have colonized the former eelgrass areas (1-8 ind.m(-2)). It was hypothesized that the lack of eelgrass recovery was due to A. marina, which was investigated by a combined field and laboratory approach. At a study site where eelgrass used to dominate, a seasonal study of lugworm population dynamics and sediment reworking activity was performed. Additionally, density dependent burial of eelgrass seeds and seedlings due to sediment reworking by A. marina was investigated in mesocosm experiments. Our results indicate that A. marina may negatively impact eelgrass recovery, since sediment reworking lead to rapid burial of eelgrass seeds and seedlings; within 1-2 months, 95% of seeds and 75% of seedlings were buried below critical depth. Considerations based on empirical modeling suggest that negative impact occur even at low A. marina density (5-10 ind.m(-2)). Therefore the spread of A. marina into former eelgrass areas is critical, since eelgrass recovery may be severely impaired, even when water quality favors eelgrass recolonization.

AB An understanding of the drivers of tree growth at the species level is required to predict likely changes of carbon stocks and biodiversity when environmental conditions change. Especially in species-rich tropical forests, it is largely unknown how species differ in their response of growth to resource availability and individual size. We use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to quantify the impact of light availability and tree diameter on growth of 274 woody species in a 50-ha long-term forest census plot in Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Light reaching each individual tree was estimated from yearly vertical censuses of canopy density. The hierarchical Bayesian approach allowed accounting for different sources of error, such as negative growth observations, and including rare species correctly weighted by their abundance. All species grew faster at higher light. Exponents of a power function relating growth to light were mostly between 0 and 1. This indicates that nearly all species exhibit a decelerating increase of growth with light. In contrast, estimated growth rates at standardized conditions (5 cm dbh, 5% light) varied over a 9-fold range and reflect strong growth-strategy differentiation between the species. As a consequence, growth rankings of the species at low (2%) and high light (20%) were highly correlated. Rare species tended to grow faster and showed a greater sensitivity to light than abundant species. Overall, tree size was less important for growth than light and about half the species were predicted to grow faster in diameter when bigger or smaller, respectively. Together light availability and tree diameter only explained on average 12% of the variation in growth rates. Thus, other factors such as soil characteristics, herbivory, or pathogens may contribute considerably to shaping tree growth in the tropics.

AB Recent theoretical and experimental work suggests that species diversity enhances the temporal stability of communities. However, empirical support largely comes from experimental communities. The relationship between diversity and stability in natural communities, and the ones facing environmental changes in particular, has received less attention. We created a gradient of fertility in a natural alpine meadow community to test the effects of diversity and fertilization on the temporal variability of community cover and cover of component species and to determine the importance of asynchrony, portfolio effects, cover and dominance for diversity-stability relationships. Although fertilization strongly reduced species richness, the temporal stability in community cover increased with fertilization. Most species showed a decline of temporal stability in mean population cover with fertilization, but two grass species, which dominated fertilized communities after 10 years, showed an increase of stability. Detailed analysis revealed that the increased dominance of these two highly stable grass species was associated with increased community stability at high levels of fertilization. In contrast, we found little support for other mechanisms that have been proposed to contribute to community stability, such as changes in asynchrony and portfolio effects. We conclude that the presence of highly productive species that have stabilizing properties dominate fertilized assemblages and enhance ecosystem stability.

AB Citizen science and community-based monitoring programs are increasing in number and breadth, generating volumes of scientific data. Many programs are ill-equipped to effectively manage these data. We examined the art and science of multi-scale citizen science support, focusing on issues of integration and flexibility that arise for data management when programs span multiple spatial, temporal, and social scales across many domains. Our objectives were to: (1) briefly review existing citizen science approaches and data management needs: (2) propose a framework for multi-scale citizen science support: (3) develop a cyber-infrastructure to support citizen science program needs: and (4) describe lessons learned. We find that approaches differ in scope, scale, and activities and that the proposed framework situates programs while guiding cyber-infrastructure system development. We built a cyber-infrastructure support system for citizen science programs (www.citsci.org) and show that carefully designed systems can be adept enough to support programs at multiple spatial and temporal scales across many domains when built with a flexible architecture. The advantage of a flexible, yet controlled, cyber-infrastructure system lies in the ability of users with different levels of permission to easily customize the features themselves, while adhering to controlled vocabularies necessary for cross-discipline comparisons and meta-analyses. Program evaluation tied to this framework and integrated into cyber-infrastructure support systems will improve our ability to track effectiveness. We compare existing systems and discuss the importance of standards for interoperability and the challenges associated with system maintenance and long-term support. We conclude by offering a vision of the future of citizen science data management and cyber-infrastructure support. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A rich theoretical framework exists for understanding animal conflict. When two opponents fight over a resource, the duration, intensity and outcome of the fight ought to be determined in large part by the relative difference in resource-holding power between contestants. While our understanding of onetime conflict resolution is excellent, our knowledge is still limited of how these rules scale up when contests occur in a social context where individuals have long-term interactions. Here, we use a convenient model system, Neolamprologus pulcher, a small cooperatively breeding cichlid fish, to explore decisions in pairwise contests over resources in a species where two individual contestants are likely to remain in the same social group, and regularly and repeatedly interact. Contests began after approximately 1 min, with a short display phase, and continued in an aphasic manner for an average of 10 min before a clear winner emerged. Information about opponents' body size was important when deciding on the giving-up point, but contestants' own body size was not, suggesting that assessment of opponent size is paramount in contest decision making. No sex differences were detected in contest structure, duration or intensity, and contests between males or between females were indistinguishable. These results offer an important window on conflict in a cooperative breeder and shed insight on rules of engagement within hierarchical social groups.

AB Slow-growing juveniles of shade-tolerant plant species are predicted to have tough leaves because of the high cost of leaf replacement in shade relative to potential carbon gain. We assessed the degree of correlated evolution among eight traits associated with leaf toughness and the relationships of those traits with the growth and mortality rates of 197 tree and shrub species from the understory of the 50-ha forest dynamics plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Path analysis with phylogenetically independent contrasts revealed that leaves attained material toughness (resistance to fracture per unit fracture area) through increases in tissue density, percent cellulose per unit dry mass, and vein fracture toughness. Lamina density and cellulose content evolved independently and thus represent different paths to material toughness. Structural toughness (resistance to fracture per unit fracture length) depended on material toughness and lamina thickness. Mortality rates of individuals 1-10 cm in stem diameter were negatively correlated with material toughness and lamina density but were independent of structural toughness and cell wall fiber contents. Leaf toughness traits were uncorrelated with relative growth rates. Results imply that material toughness enhances resistance to natural enemies, which increases survival and offsets the biomass allocation cost of producing tough leaves in the shaded understory.

AB P>It is increasingly being recognized that global ecological research requires novel methods and strategies in which to combine process-based ecological models and data in cohesive, systematic ways. Model-data fusion (MDF) is an emerging area of research in ecology and palaeoecology. It provides a new quantitative approach that offers a high level of empirical constraint over model predictions based on observations using inverse modelling and data assimilation (DA) techniques. Increasing demands to integrate model and data methods in the past decade has led to MDF utilization in palaeoecology, ecology and earth system sciences. This paper reviews key features and principles of MDF and highlights different approaches with regards to DA. After providing a critical evaluation of the numerous benefits of MDF and its current applications in palaeoecology (i.e. palaeoclimatic reconstruction, palaeovegetation and palaeocarbon storage) and ecology (i.e. parameter and uncertainty estimation, model error identification, remote sensing and ecological forecasting), the paper discusses method limitations, current challenges and future research direction. In the ongoing data-rich era of today's world, MDF could become an important diagnostic and prognostic tool in which to improve our understanding of ecological processes while testing ecological theory and hypotheses and forecasting changes in ecosystem structure, function and services.

AB In previous studies, feathers of adult predatory birds have been evaluated as valid non-destructive biomonitor matrices for persistent organic pollutants (POPS). In this study, we assessed for the first time the usefulness of nestling raptor feathers for non-destructive biomonitoring of POPs. For this purpose, we collected body feathers and blood of nestlings from three avian top predators from northern Norway: northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) and golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos). We were able to detect a broad spectrum of legacy POPs in the nestling feathers of all three species (Sigma PCBs: 6.78-140 ng g(-1); DDE: 3.15-145 ng g(-1); Sigma PBDEs: 0.538-7.56 ng g(-1)) However, these concentrations were lower compared to other studies on raptor species, probably due to the aspect of monitoring of nestlings instead of adults. Besides their analytical suitability, nestling feathers also appear to be biologically informative: concentrations of most POPs in nestling feathers showed strong and significant correlations with blood plasma concentrations in all species (p<0.050; 0.775<r<0.994). In addition, the reported correlations between feathers and blood plasma were much higher than those previously reported for adult individuals. Accumulation profiles and species-specific differences were in accordance with other toxicological studies on avian species and generally in agreement with the specific ecology of the studied species. In summary, our results indicate that the use of nestling feathers of northern raptors may be a valid and promising non-destructive biomonitoring strategy for POPs in their ecosystems.

AB Sperm competition is a potent postcopulatory selective force where sperm from rival males compete to fertilize a limited set of ova. Considering that sperm production is costly, we expect males to strategically allocate sperm in accordance with the level of competition. Accordingly, previous work has examined a male's strategic allocation in terms of sperm number. However, the seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) transferred along with sperm may also play a crucial role in competition. Surprisingly, the strategic allocation of Sfps has remained largely unexplored. Using Drosophila melanogaster, we examined the expression of three seminal fluid and four spermatogenesis genes in response to perceived sperm competition intensity by manipulating male density in a pre-mating and courtship environment. In the pre-mating environment, we found that males modified Sfp ratios by reducing the production of two spfs when potential rivals were present, while one Sfp and all spermatogenesis genes remained unaltered. In the courtship environment, males did not modify spermatogenesis or Sfp production in response to either rival males or female presence. Our data suggest that perceived competition in the pre-mating environment places a significant influence on Sfp allocation, which may be a general trend in promiscuous animal systems with internal fertilization.

AB Conserving saproxylic beetles in temperate forests will require a better understanding of habitat requirements. So far, quantitative community studies have rarely considered their vertical requirements. In comparison with the tropical forest canopy, it remains to be seen whether a comparably high level of beetle diversity exists in the temperate forest canopy.
   We compared saproxylic beetle assemblages at two vertical levels in three temperate French forests. Two datasets originated from emergence traps of pine and oak deadwood substrates (mid-canopy and forest floor branches) in lowland forests. The third compared flying beetle fauna at mid-canopy and understory levels using pairs of flight interception traps in beech-fir mountain forests.
   Our study provided contrasting results regarding the contribution of each stratum to biodiversity. Whereas higher abundance and species richness were apparent in understory samples in beech-fir stands and in oak branches, no difference for richness - or even the opposite pattern for abundance - was observed in pine branches. A significant inter-strata dissimilarity was revealed in all datasets. Each stratum harbored specialist taxa. Exclusive canopy species accounted for 20-40% of all species. In accordance with dissimilarity partitioning, arboreal saproxylic beetle communities were not just nested subsets of ground assemblages.
   It is likely that microhabitat requirements, food availability and other non-resource-based factors (microclimate preference, species interactions) drive the stratification of beetle assemblages.
   Our results lend support (i) to the recommendation of a multi-strata sampling strategy for forest insects and (ii) to management practices in favour of valuable canopy micro-habitats. 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Habitat fragmentation alters fire regimes by changing the spatial and temporal context in which fire operates, potentially altering ecosystem state and threatening taxa. In the fragmented wheatbelt of Western Australia, spatial patterns of contemporary fire and their effects on biodiversity conservation are poorly understood. We addressed this by: (1) determining if fire regimes differed between vegetation remnants of differing sizes and uncleared vegetation, using analysis of satellite imagery; (2) determining vegetation structural responses to time since fire in three habitats: mallee-shrub, Acacia shrublands and mallee-heath; and (3) exploring the consequences of these differences, using the fire-sensitive malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata) as a case study. Fire was infrequent in small remnants, more frequent in large remnants, and most frequent in uncleared areas. Key vegetation structural attributes for malleefowl, such as canopy and litter cover, increased beyond 45 years post-fire in mallee-shrub, reached a plateau in mallee-heath after 30-40 years, and declined in Acacia shrublands after 25-40 years. Senescence in long-unburnt vegetation, combined with rare contemporary fires, suggest progressive decline in habitat quality of Acacia shrublands for malleefowl in the wheatbelt. In the adjacent, continuously vegetated landscapes, more frequent (and extensive) fires in structurally developing mallee-shrub communities are of concern for malleefowl conservation.

AB The growing pressure on fresh water resources demands that agriculture becomes more productive with its current water use. Increasing water productivity is an often cited solution, though the current levels of water productivity are not systematically mapped. A global map of water productivity helps to identify where water resources are productively used, and identifies places where improvements are possible. The WATPRO water productivity model for wheat, using remote sensing data products as input, was applied at a global scale with global data sets of the NDVI and surface albedo to benchmark water productivity of wheat for the beginning of this millennium. Time profiles of the NDVI were used to determine the time frame from crop establishment to harvest on a pixel basis, which was considered the modelling period. It was found that water productivity varies from approximately 0.2 to 1.8 kg of harvestable wheat per cubic metre of water consumed. From the 10 largest producers of wheat, France and Germany score the highest country average water productivity of 1.42 and 1.35 kg m(-3), respectively. The results were compared with modelling information by Liu et al. (2007) who applied the GEPIC model at a global scale to map water productivity, and by Chapagain and Hoekstra (2004) who used FAO statistics to determine water productivity per country. A comparison with Liu et al. showed a good correlation for most countries, but the correlation with the results by Chapagain and Hoekstra was less obvious. The global patterns of the water productivity map were compared with global data sets of precipitation and reference evapotranspiration to determine the impact of climate and of water availability reflected by precipitation. It appears that the highest levels of water productivity are to be expected in temperate climates with high precipitation. Due to its non-linear relationship with precipitation, iris expected that large gains in water productivity can be made with in situ rain water harvesting or supplemental irrigation in dry areas with low seasonal precipitation. A full understanding of the spatial patterns by country or river basin will support decisions on where to invest and what measures to take to make agriculture more water productive.

AB In spite of evidence for positive diversity-productivity relationships increasing plant diversity has highly variable effects on the performance of individual plant species, but the mechanisms behind these differential responses are far from being understood. To gain deeper insights into the physiological responses of individual plant species to increasing plant diversity we performed systematic untargeted metabolite profiling on a number of herbs derived from a grassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment). The Jena Experiment comprises plots of varying species number (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 60) and number and composition of functional groups (1 to 4; grasses, legumes, tall herbs, small herbs). In this study the metabolomes of two tall-growing herbs (legume: Medicago x varia; non-legume: Knautia arvensis) and three small-growing herbs (legume: Lotus corniculatus; non-legumes: Bellis perennis, Leontodon autumnalis) in plant communities of increasing diversity were analyzed. For metabolite profiling we combined gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) and UPLC coupled to FT-ICR-MS (LC-FT-MS) analyses from the same sample. This resulted in several thousands of detected m/z-features. ANOVA and multivariate statistical analysis revealed 139 significantly changed metabolites (30 by GC-TOF-MS and 109 by LC-FT-MS). The small-statured plants L. autumnalis, B. perennis and L. corniculatus showed metabolic response signatures to increasing plant diversity and species richness in contrast to tall-statured plants. Key-metabolites indicated C-and N-limitation for the non-leguminous small-statured species B. perennis and L. autumnalis, while the metabolic signature of the small-statured legume L. corniculatus indicated facilitation by other legumes. Thus, metabolomic analysis provided evidence for negative effects of resource competition on the investigated small-statured herbs that might mechanistically explain their decreasing performance with increasing plant diversity. In contrast, taller species often becoming dominant in mixed plant communities did not show modified metabolite profiles in response to altered resource availability with increasing plant diversity. Taken together, our study demonstrates that metabolite profiling is a strong diagnostic tool to assess individual metabolic phenotypes in response to plant diversity and ecophysiological adjustment.

   Dietary studies are important in understanding the ecological role of marine mammals and in formulating appropriate management plans in terms of their interactions with fisheries. The validity of such studies has, however, often been compromised by unrepresentative sampling procedures, resulting in false weight being given to external factors seeming to influence diet composition. The bias caused by non-random sampling was examined, using canonical correspondence analysis to assess how the prey species composition in digestive tract samples of Baltic grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) was related to spatial, temporal, and demographic factors and to whether the samples were collected in association with fishing gear or not ("sampling condition"). Geographic region explained the largest fraction of the observed variation, followed by sampling condition, age group, and year. Season and gender were not statistically significant. Segregation of the two age categories "pups" and "juveniles-adults", and the two geographic categories "Baltic proper" and "Gulf of Bothnia" are proposed to estimate the diet and fish consumption of the Baltic grey seal population as a whole. Atlantic herring was the most commonly recovered prey item in all areas and age groups, followed by European sprat in the south, and common whitefish in the north. Pups had eaten relatively more small non-commercial species than older seals.

AB Robust estimates of dispersal are critical for understanding population dynamics and local adaptation, as well as for successful spatial management. Genetic isolation by distance patterns hold clues to dispersal, but understanding these patterns quantitatively has been complicated by uncertainty in effective density. In this study, we genotyped populations of a coral reef fish (Amphiprion clarkii) at 13 microsatellite loci to uncover fine-scale isolation by distance patterns in two replicate transects. Temporal changes in allele frequencies between generations suggested that effective densities in these populations are 4-21 adults/km. A separate estimate from census densities suggested that effective densities may be as high as 82-178 adults/km. Applying these effective densities with isolation by distance theory suggested that larval dispersal kernels in A. clarkii had a spread near 11 km (427 km). These kernels predicted low fractions of self-recruitment in continuous habitats, but the same kernels were consistent with previously reported, high self-recruitment fractions (40-60%) when realistic levels of habitat patchiness were considered. Our results suggested that ecologically relevant larval dispersal can be estimated with widely available genetic methods when effective density is measured carefully through cohort sampling and ecological censuses, and that self-recruitment studies should be interpreted in light of habitat patchiness.

AB Changes in species assemblages of intertidal foraminifera can be used to estimate the amount of earthquake-related subsidence during plate-boundary earthquakes at the Cascadia subduction zone. The accuracy and precision of foraminiferal methods in paleoenvironmental reconstruction is underpinned by the relations between contemporary taxa and their environment, which are used to calibrate fossil foraminiferal assemblages in sediment sequences. A contemporary training set of surface sediment samples from five intertidal marshes along the Oregon coast was used to determine foraminiferal distributions and prevailing environmental control(s) along elevational transects. Dominant taxa include Balticammina pseudomacrescens, Trochamminita irregularis, Haplophragmoides wilberti, Trochammina inflata, Jadammina macrescens and Miliammina fusca. Unconstrained cluster analysis and detrended correspondence analysis was used to identify two elevation-dependent faunal zones: Faunal Zone I (upland, high marsh, middle marsh) dominated by Balticammina pseudomacrescens, Haplophragmoides wilberti and Trochammina inflata, and Faunal Zone II (low marsh and tidal flat) dominated by Miliammina fusca. Site-specific differences in assemblages at three marshes enabled further subdivision of Faunal Zone I. Zone la is based on one or more of Balticammina pseudomacrescens, Trochammina inflata, Trochamminita irregularis and Haplophragrnoides sp., and Zone Ib on Jadammina macrescens, Haplophragmoides sp., Trochammina inflata and Miliammina fusca. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and partial CCA of the training set from the Nehalem River marsh transect was used to infer that the zonation of foraminifera is elevation-dependent (39% of explained variance).
   A transfer function was developed to reconstruct sudden changes in relative sea-level during plate-boundary earthquakes in Oregon. The results indicate a robust performance of the transfer function (r(jack)(2) = 0.82) with the error estimate (RMSEPjack = 0.20 m) comparable to local and regional transfer functions from other temperate marshes. To illustrate the potential of the technique, the transfer function was applied to reconstruct subsidence during the AD 1700 earthquake using at Alsea Bay, Oregon. The reconstruction (0.18 +/- 0.20 m) is less than half the subsidence estimate of Nelson et al. [2008. Great-earthquake palogeoesy and tsunamis of the past 2000 years at Alsea Bay, central Oregon coast, USA. Quaternary Science Reviews, 27, 747-768] using their foraminiferal transfer function, perhaps because of differences in taxonomy and the species relationship to elevation.

TI The geographic scale of diversification on islands: genetic and

AB Background: Oceanic islands provide unique scenarios for studying the roles of geography and ecology in driving population divergence and speciation. Assessing the relative importance of selective and neutral factors in driving population divergence is central to understanding how such divergence may lead to speciation in small oceanic islands, where opportunities for gene flow and population mixing are potentially high. Here we report a case of genetic and morphological structure in the Mascarene grey white-eye (Zosterops borbonicus) a species that shows a striking, geographically structured plumage polymorphism on the topographically and ecologically complex island of Reunion, yet is monotypic on the relatively uniform neighbouring island of Mauritius.
   Results: Analysis of 276 AFLP loci in 197 individuals revealed prolonged independent evolution of Reunion and Mauritius populations, which is congruent with previous mtDNA assessments. Furthermore, populations on Reunion showed significant differentiation into three main genetic groups separating lowland from highland areas despite the small geographic distances involved. Genetic differentiation along the altitudinal gradient is consistent with morphometric analysis of fitness-related traits. Birds in the highlands were larger, yet had relatively smaller beaks than in the lowlands, suggesting the role of selection in shaping morphology and restricting gene flow along the gradient. No genetic differentiation between plumage morphs was detected in neutral markers, suggesting that plumage differences are of recent origin.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest a dual role of vicariance and natural selection in differentiating populations of a passerine bird in an oceanic island at very small spatial scales. We propose a combination of past microallopatry driven by volcanic activity and selection-constrained dispersal along steep ecological gradients to explain the striking levels of population structure found within the island, although the possibility that genetic differences evolved in situ along the gradient cannot be ruled out at present. The lack of congruence between genetic groups and plumage morphs suggests that the latter are of recent origin and likely due to social or sexual selection acting on few loci. The presence of sharp and stable contact zones between plumage morphs suggests that they could be on independent evolutionary trajectories, yet whether or not they represent incipient species will require further research to directly assess the degree of reproductive isolation among them.

AB Question
   What are the responses of epiphytic lichens to the intensity of management along a large environmental gradient in Mediterranean Quercus forests?
   Location
   Central Spain.
   Methods
   This study was carried out on 4590 trees located in 306 forest stands dominated by Quercus faginea or Quercus ilex ssp. ballota. The effect of forest management and other predictor variables on several species diversity indicators were studied. Variables modelled were total species richness, cyanolichen richness and community composition. A large number of predictor variables were included: forest fragmentation (patch size, stand variability), climate and topographic (altitude, slope, sun radiation, annual rainfall and mean annual temperature) and intensity of management. General linear models and constrained ordination techniques were used to model community traits and species composition, respectively.
   Results
   Total richness and especially cyanolichens richness were significantly and negatively affected by the intensity of management. Lichen composition was influenced by management intensity, climatic and topographic variables and stand variability.
   Conclusions
   In Mediterranean forests, human activities related to forestry, agricultural and livestock use cause impoverishment of lichen communities, including the local disappearance of the most demanding species. The conservation of unmanaged forests with a dense canopy is crucial for lichen diversity.

AB Invasive alien plants constitute a major threat to local biodiversity. Moreover, their appearance often coincides with land use change. Many endangered groups of organisms suffer from habitat loss, which is often a consequence of the invasion of alien plants This paper examines how invasive alien goldenrods Solidago spp affect the richness of endangered grassland bird species and numbers of breeding pairs in abandoned meadows in southern Poland. Meadows invaded by goldenrods (n = 15) had lower bird spedes richness and a lower number of breeding pairs than meadows in which goldenrods were absent (n = 15) Two important factors positively influencing bird species richness were meadow area and shrub density (the latter only in meadows without goldenrods). Moreover, both the index of potential food density (number of butterflies) and plant species richness were much lower in meadows invaded by goldenrods than in meadows without these plants Urgent action aimed at preventing the invasion of alien goldenrods in abandoned meadows is needed and such measures should involve regular mowing Our results also highlight the fact that land abandonment in Central and Eastern Europe is not necessarily as beneficial for biodiversity as it is commonly believed and it may even lead to a decrease in the populations of several bird species in the agricultural landscape.

AB The timing of birth is often correlated with offspring fitness in animals, but experimental studies that disentangle direct effects of parturition date and indirect effects mediated via variation in female traits are rare. In viviparous ectotherms, parturition date is largely driven by female thermal conditions, particularly maternal basking strategies. Our field and laboratory studies of a viviparous lizard (Niveoscincus ocellatus) show that earlier-born offspring are more likely to survive through their first winter and are larger following that winter, than are later-born conspecifics. Thus, the association between parturition date and offspring fitness is causal, rather than reflecting an underlying correlation between parturition date and maternal attributes. Survival selection on offspring confers a significant advantage for increased maternal basking in this species, mediated through fitness advantages of earlier parturition. We discuss the roles of environmentally imposed constraints and parent-offspring conflict in the evolution of maternal effects on parturition date.

AB Plankton samples were collected from six remote freshwater and saline lakes located at altitudes of 3,204 to 4,718 m and 1,000 km apart within an area of ca. 1 million km(2) on the eastern Tibetan Plateau to comparatively assess how environmental factors influence the diversity of bacterial communities in high-altitude lakes. The composition of the bacterioplankton was investigated by analysis of large clone libraries of 16S rRNA genes. Comparison of bacterioplankton diversities estimated for the six Tibetan lakes with reference data previously published for lakes located at lower altitudes indicated relatively low taxon richness in the Tibetan lakes. The estimated average taxon richness in the four Tibetan freshwater lakes was only one-fifth of the average taxon richness estimated for seven low-altitude reference lakes. This cannot be explained by low coverage of communities in the Tibetan lakes by the established libraries or by differences in habitat size. Furthermore, a comparison of the taxonomic compositions of bacterioplankton across the six Tibetan lakes revealed low overlap between their community compositions. About 70.9% of the operational taxonomic units (99% similarity) were specific to single lakes, and a relatively high percentage (11%) of sequences were <95% similar to publicly deposited sequences of cultured or uncultured bacteria. This beta diversity was explained by differences in salinity between lakes rather than by distance effects. Another characteristic of the investigated lakes was the predominance of Cyanobacteria (Synechococcus) and Bacteroidetes. These features of bacterioplankton diversity may reflect specific adaptation of various lineages to the environmental conditions in these high-altitude lakes.

AB The assumption that mortality risk increases with dispersal distance has rarely been tested. We compared patterns of natal dispersal in the American marten (Martes americana) between a large regenerating forest landscape and an uncut landscape that was dominated by more mature forest to test whether mortality risk increased with dispersal distance, and whether variation in mortality risk influenced dispersal distance. Mortality risk increased with dispersal distance in both landscape treatments, but the distance-dependent increase in mortality in the regenerating landscape was twice that in the uncut landscape. Differences in body condition, supported by other data on foraging efficiency, suggested that juveniles from the regenerating landscape were less able to cope with the energetic demands of dispersal compared with juveniles from older forests. Juveniles travelled shorter distances in the regenerating versus uncut landscape. These results implied that dispersal was costly in terms of juvenile survival and that mean dispersal distance was shaped, in part, by mortality risk.

We developed a new approach that combined meteorological and biometric C cycling data for a mixed deciduous forest in Michigan, USA, to provide novel estimates of whole-ecosystem labile C production and reallocation to structural net primary production (NPP). We substantiated inferred seasonal patterns of labile C production and reallocation to structural NPP with measurements of Populus grandidentata and Quercus rubra wood non-structural carbohydrate concentration and mass over two years. Our analysis showed that 55% of annual net canopy C assimilate (A(c)) was first allocated to labile C production rather than to immediate structural NPP. Labile C produced during the latter half of summer later supported dormant-season structural growth and respiration, with 34% of structural NPP in a given year requiring labile C stored during previous years. Seasonal changes in wood non-structural carbohydrate concentration and mass generally corroborated inferred temporal patterns of whole-ecosystem labile C production and reallocation to structural NPP. Our findings confirm that disparities can arise between same-year meteorological and biometric net ecosystem production when meteorologically measured C assimilation and biometrically measured growth are asynchronous because of temporary photosynthate allocation to labile C storage. We conclude that a broader understanding of labile C production and reallocation at the ecosystem scale is important to interpreting lagged canopy C cycling and structural growth processes.

AB Chironomids and pollen were studied in a radiocarbon-dated sediment sequence obtained from a former lake near the Maloja Pass in the Central Swiss Alps (1865 m a.s.l.) to reconstruct the Lateglacial environment. Pollen assemblages imply a vegetation development around the Maloja Pass from shrub tundra at the beginning of the Allerod to coniferous forest during the early Holocene with a lowering of the timberline during the Younger Dryas. Chironomid assemblages are characterized by several abrupt shifts in dominant taxa through the Lateglacial. The occurrence of taxa able to survive hypoxia in the second part of the Allerod and during the Preboreal, and their disappearance at the onset of the Younger Dryas cold phase suggest summer thermal stratification and unfavourable hypolimnetic oxygen conditions in the palaeo-lake during the warmer periods of the Lateglacial interstadial and early Holocene. Mean July air temperatures were reconstructed using a chironomid-temperature transfer function from the Alpine region. The pattern of reconstructed temperature changes agrees well with the Greenland delta O-18 record and other Lateglacial temperature inferences from Central Europe. The inferred July temperatures of ca 10.0 degrees C during most of the Allerod were slightly lower than modern values (10.8 degrees C) and increased up to ca 11.7 degrees C (i.e., above present-day values) at the end of the Allerod. The first part of the Younger Dryas was colder (ca 8.8 degrees C) than the second part (ca 9.8 degrees C). During most of the Preboreal, the temperatures persisted within the limits of 13.5-14.5 degrees C (i.e., ca 3 degrees C above present-day values). The amplitudes of temperature changes at the Allerod-Younger Dryas-Preboreal transitions were ca 3.5-4.0 degrees C. The temperature reconstruction also shows three short-lived cooling events of ca 1.5-2.0 degrees C, which may be attributed to the centennial-scale Greenland Interstadial events GI-1d and GI-1b, and the Preboreal Oscillation.

AB Several studies have reported a positive relationship between species richness and ecosystem functioning. However, if much of a particular ecosystem function is performed by one species (i.e. a functionally dominant species) and this species is also a competitive dominant that excludes other taxa from a habitat, then it is possible to obtain a negative relationship between richness and ecosystem functioning. Results of a leaf pack breakdown experiment in a small stream suggested that the caddisfly Pycnopsyche gentilis, a common detritivorous insect in North American headwater streams, was both a functional and competitive dominant. In a second experiment we compared the effect of Pycnopsyche on leaf breakdown to that of other detritivore taxa by enclosing them with leaf packs in a section of headwater stream in which they were uncommon (Pycnopsyche transplant experiment). Final leaf pack mass was significantly lower in the Pycnopsyche enclosure treatment; leaves exposed to a greater diversity of detritivores displayed little reduction in leaf mass. These results demonstrated that Pycnopsyche was a functionally dominant detritivore. In a third experiment (Pycnopsyche density experiment) we found that Pycnopsyche was also a competitively dominant species. Leaf packs and large Pycnopsyche were placed in enclosures that were permeable to the majority of other detritivores but not Pycnopsyche. Leaf mass lost increased with increasing Pycnopsyche density. Leaf packs exposed to Pycnopsyche, however, contained fewer detritivore taxa which suggested that Pycnopsyche was also a competitive dominant. There was a negative relationship between three measures of diversity and leaf litter breakdown in the Pycnopsyche density experiment. Experiments conducted in natural communities that incorporate important species interactions may produce diversity-ecosystem function relationships other than the positive ones that are commonly reported.

AB Tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) are an ancient taxon of one genus, Glossina, and limited species diversity. All are exclusively haematophagous and Confined to sub-Saharan Africa. The Glossina are the principal vectors of African trypanosomes Tryponosoma sp. (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) and as such, are of great medical and economic importance. Clearly tsetse flies and trypanosomes are coadapted and evolutionary interactions between them are manifest. Numerous clonally reproducing strains of Trypanosoma sp. exist and their genetic diversities and spatial distributions are in a inadequately known. Here I review the breeding structures of the principle trypanosome vectors, G. morsitans s.l., G. pallidipes, G. palpalis s.l. and G. fuscipes fuscipes. All show highly structured populations among which there is Surprisingly little detectable gone flow. Rather less is known of the breeding structure of T brucei seosulato vis a vis their vector tsetse flies but many genetically differentiated Strains exist in nature. Genetic recombination in Tryponosoma via meiosis has recently been demonstrated in the laboratory thereby furnishing a mechanism of strain differentiation in addition to that of simple mutation. Spatially and genetically representative sampling of both trypanosome species and strains and their Glossina vectors is a major barrier to a comprehensive understanding of their mutual relationships.

ID LANDSCAPE; GEOGRAPHY; VALUES
AB Drawing on recent conceptualisations of 'performativity' this article examines the experiential knowledge of a heterogenous group of people who regularly walk through a maze of criss-crossing paths in a relatively flat suburban Australian reserve. Attention is given to how routine walking can be conceptualised as one way of 'doing' nature. Routine walking is conceptualised as a territory-making process. Mindful of the social context and bodily experience, walking offers insights into the possibilities of making points of connection with the performances of plants and animals. While experiential knowledge from habitual walking illustrates the blurring of culture-nature dichotomies, walkers still rely on the fiction of the distinction that divides them to make sense of self and place. To elicit a more conversational narrative and tap into the lived experiences of walking, our methodological approach relied upon photography. How respondents express a type of care for, and protect animals and plants in a territory understood as their own backyard has direct relevance to recent discussions of the role residents can play in the current and future environmental management of suburban reserves and parks.

AB The genus Croomia (Stemonaceae) comprises three herbaceous perennial species that are distributed in temperate-deciduous forests in Southeastern North America (C. pauciflora) and East Asia (C. japonica, C. heterosepala). The two Asian species have abutting ranges in South Japan, but C. japonica also occurs disjunctively on the adjacent Asiatic mainland in East China. In our phylogenetic analysis of Croomia, based on chloroplast (cp) DNA sequence variation of the trnL-F region, and rooted with Stemona spp., the two Asian species are identified as sister that likely diverged in the Mid-to-Late Pleistocene (0.84-0.13 mya), whereas the divergence of C pauciflora dates back to the Late Plio-/Pleistocene (<2.6 mya). Phylogeographical analysis of the two East Asian species detected seven cpDNA (trnL-F) haplotypes across 16 populations surveyed, and all of those were fixed for a particular cpDNA haplotype (H-E = 0.0, G(ST) = 1). A survey of inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) markers also detected remarkably low levels of within-population diversity (C. japonica: H-E = 0.085; C. heterosepala: H-E = 0.125), and high levels of inter-population differentiation (C. japonica: phi(ST) = 0.736; C. heterosepala: phi(ST) = 0.550), at least partly due to pronounced regional genetic substructure within both species. Non-overlapping distributions of cpDNA haplotypes and strong genetic (cpDNA/ISSR) differentiation among populations and/or regions accord with findings of a nested clade analysis, which inferred allopatric fragmentation as the major process influencing the spatial haplotype distribution of the two species. Based on mismatch distribution analysis and neutrality tests, we do not find evidence of population expansion in both species. Overall, we conclude that components of temperate-deciduous forest types in South Japan and East China are particularly sensitive to range fragmentation, isolation, and enhanced (incipient) species formation through climate-induced expansions of other forest types over glacial and interglacial periods of the (Late) Quaternary.

AB Low rates of growth for conifers at high elevations may relate to problems in acquiring or utilizing carbon. A traditional hypothesis for growth limits of trees at alpine treeline is that low photosynthesis (A) leads to insufficient supply of carbon for growth. Alternatively, the sink-limitation hypothesis questions the importance of low A, and suggests that trees at treeline have abundant carbon for growth as a result of greater decreases in carbon use [respiration (R) and growth] than A at higher elevations. Concentrations of carbon intermediates (e.g., nonstructural carbohydrates, NSC) have been used to support the sink-limitation hypothesis, with the assumption that NSC reflects the ratio of carbon source to sinks. Our objective was to determine elevation effects on carbon balance (whole-plant uptake, storage, and efflux of carbon) of tree seedlings during their critical establishment phase at timberline. Changes in A and R (of whole crowns), NSC (starches and simple sugars), and growth were measured in seedlings of a treeline (Abies lasiocarpa) and nontreeline species (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Seedlings were outplanted at the lower (2,450 m) and upper (3,000 m) edges of the timberline zone in the Rocky Mountains, USA. At the upper compared with lower elevation, both species had 10-20% less root and needle growth, 13-15% less A, 35-39% less R, and up to 50% greater NSC. A. lasiocarpa allocated more biomass to needles and had greater A but less NSC than P. menziesii. The greater effects of elevation on R compared with A led to a 1.3-fold increase in A:R at the upper elevation, and a corresponding increase in starch (r(2) = 0.42)-a pattern consistent with the predictions of the sink-limitation hypothesis. Nevertheless, A and dry mass gain were positively correlated (r(2) = 0.42), indicating that variation in photosynthesis was related to growth of seedlings at timberline.

AB 1. Chaparral shrub species along the southwest coast of North America survive wildfire by three different life history types: non-sprouters (NS) are killed by fire and only re-establish through germination of fire-stimulated seeds; facultative sprouters (FS) re-establish by a combination of vegetative sprouting and seed germination; and obligate sprouters (OS) only re-establish by vegetative sprouting because their seeds do not survive fire.
   2. Post-fire seedlings of NS and FS re-establish in open canopy gaps, whereas OS seedlings primarily recruit in deep shade during fire-free intervals.
   3. It was hypothesized that these life history differences, compared within the same family, Rhamnaceae, would result in differential seedling resistance to water stress such that NS > FS > OS.
   4. Seedlings were grown in large pots in a common garden under treatments of sun, shade, irrigation and water stress. Mortality and physiology of seedlings were monitored for about 1 year.
   5. In response to the water stress treatment in full sun, life history types were not different in their dry season predawn water potentials, which were extremely negative (< -9 MPa). Water potential of water-stressed shade grown plants were also not different, but were less negative than the sun treatment during the dry season (about -6 MPa).
   5. For plants grown in full sun under water stress, NS exhibited 23% mortality, FS 60% and OS 35% mortality, while irrigated controls had greatly reduced mortality across all life histories. Among shade grown plants under water stress, NS exhibited 30% mortality, FS 20% and OS 1% mortality. This pattern of differential mortality was the same for irrigated plants indicating that water stress was not the cause of mortality in the shade.
   6. Greater stem and root resistance to water stress induced cavitation were strongly correlated with lower percent mortality during the summer dry season suggesting a link between these traits and fitness.
   7. Synthesis. This study finds a link between life history type and water stress tolerance. Consistent with open canopy specialization, NS survived best in full sun. The FS and OS life history type had better survival in the shade. The OS was unexpectedly versatile, surviving well in the sun and shade. The evolutionary history of the life history types is discussed as an important factor in linking water stress tolerance and life history.

AB Disentangling the relative contributions of selective and neutral processes underlying phenotypic and genetic variation under natural, environmental conditions remains a central challenge in evolutionary ecology. However, much of the variation that could be informative in this area of research is likely to be cryptic in nature; thus, the identification of wild populations suitable for study may be problematic. We use a landscape genetics approach to identify such populations of three-spined stickleback inhabiting the Saint Lawrence River estuary. We sampled 1865 adult fish over multiple years. Individuals were genotyped for nine microsatellite loci, and georeferenced multilocus data were used to infer population groupings, as well as locations of genetic discontinuities, under a Bayesian model framework (GENELAND). We modelled environmental data using nonparametric multiple regression to explain genetic differentiation as a function of spatio-ecological effects. Additionally, we used genotype data to estimate dispersal and gene flow to parameterize a simple model predicting adaptive vs. plastic divergence between demes. We demonstrate a bipartite division of the genetic landscape into freshwater and maritime zones, independent of geographical distance. Moreover, we show that the greatest proportion of genetic variation (31.5%) is explained by environmental differences. However, the potential for either adaptive or plastic divergence between demes is highly dependent upon the strength of migration and selection. Consequently, we highlight the utility of landscape genetics as a tool for hypothesis generation and experimental design, to identify focal populations and putative selection gradients, in order to distinguish between phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation.

AB Tropical botanical gardens have played an important role in the distribution, naturalisation and spread of non-native plants worldwide. Appropriate guidance relating to risk assessments of established botanical garden collections is often scarce. This paper uses the Amani Botanical Garden (ABG), Tanzania, as a case study to highlight appropriate methods to assess the risks posed by existing and future collections in tropical botanical gardens. Key considerations included field assessments of species status using accepted definitions of naturalisation, spread and invasion, distinguishing between intentionally and unintentionally introduced species, identifying taxonomic patterns in invasion status, assessing patterns in habitats colonised, and determining how knowledge of invasion elsewhere might be useful in forecasting risk. Out of the 214 alien plant species surviving from the original plantings in the early 20th century, 35 had only regenerated, 38 had locally naturalised while 16 had spread widely in the botanical garden. A further 16 species with unclear introduction records in the garden were also found to be naturalised. A greater proportion of introduced species were potentially invasive than might be expected from previous analyses of global floras. Overall, just over half of all naturalised and spreading species were also observed in forest fragments and edges. The proportion of species that had been recorded elsewhere as naturalised/invasive was significantly related to their status in ABG, with 94% of spreading species and 79% of naturalising species being recorded as naturalised or invasive elsewhere, compared to 57% of species that were only regenerating and 49% of species only surviving. Recommendations for further risk assessments of botanical garden collections are discussed.

AB The response of zooplankton assemblages to variations in the water quality of four man-made lakes, caused by eutrophication and siltation, was investigated by means of canonical correspondence analysis. Monte Carlo simulations using the CCA eigenvalues as test statistics revealed that changes in zooplankton species composition along the environmental gradients of trophic state and abiogenic turbidity were highly significant. Brachionus calyciflorus, Thermocyclops sp. and Argyrodiaptomus sp. were good indicators of eutrophic conditions, whereas B. dolabratus, Keratella tropica and Hexarthra mira were good indicators of high turbidity due to suspended sediments. Overall, our results showed that changes in the water quality of man-made lakes in a tropical semi-arid region have significant effects on the structure of zooplankton assemblages that can potentially affect the functioning of these ecosystems.

AB Despite its size and attractiveness, many Lucanus cervus sites remain undetected in NW Europe because of its short flight period and its nocturnal activity. Therefore, presentday designated conservation areas for L. cervus are probably insufficient for a sustainable conservation of the species. We applied eight species distribution modelling techniques (artificial neural networks, classification tree analysis, generalised additive models, generalised boosting models, generalised linear models, mixture discriminant analysis, multiple adaptive regression splines and random forests) to predict the distribution of L cervus in Belgium using 10 randomly generated calibration and evaluation sets. We used AUC, sensitivity (% correctly predicted presences in the evaluation set) and specificity (% correctly predicted absences in the evaluation set) and Kappa statistics to compare model performances. To avoid the incorporation of only marginally suitable woodland sites into the Natura 2000 network, we, conservatively, considered the species as being present only in grid cells where all 10 randomly generated model sets predicted the species as such. Model performance was, on average, good allowing to predict the potential distribution of L. cervus accurately. According to the predicted distribution using the more robust prevalence threshold, only 5731 ha (11% of the potentially suitable area) is protected under the Natura 2000 scheme in Belgium. Subsequently, we categorised the potentially suitable woodlands into three conservation priority categories based on their surface area and the already designated Natura 2000 area. Including the most suitable L. cervus woodlands previously not included in the Natura 2000 sites within such network would require protecting an area of 15,260 ha. Finally, we discuss the implications of using species distribution modelling for nature policy decisions in designating conservation networks. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental variation is widely viewed as a major force driving morphological change and speciation. Although many environmental attributes are potentially critical for adaptive responses within and between species, the individual and relative importance of these diverse attributes remain poorly understood. Here we combine a geographical information systems (GIS)-based analysis of environmental variation with a multipopulation analysis of phenotypic, physiological, and genetic variation, to generate and test hypotheses of environmental factors likely driving adaptive divergence within and between two wild Andean plant species. First, we document large environmental differences between population locations of the two species, and among regions within species. Second, we show evidence for inter- and intraspecific differences in genetically based phenotypic and physiological variation. Third, combining these data, we report evidence for trait-environment associations both among populations within species, and between species, that are strongly indicative of recent and rapid adaptive responses. Finally, we show that these trait-environment associations cannot be simply explained by genetic relatedness within species, reinforcing our inference that local, regional, and species-wide environmental conditions are responsible for phenotypic and physiological diversification. The strongest trait-environment associations involve temperature and precipitation gradients, suggesting these climatic factors are predominant drivers of adaptive diversification in these species.

AB The rate of species loss is increasing at a global scale, and human-induced extinctions are biased toward predator species. We examined the effects of predator extinctions on a foundation species, the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica). We performed a factorial experiment manipulating the presence and abundance of three of the most common predatory crabs, the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), stone crab (Menippe mercenaria), and mud crab (Panopeus herbstii) in estuaries in the eastern United States. We tested the effects of species richness and identity of predators on juvenile oyster survival, oyster recruitment, and organic matter content of sediment. We also manipulated the density of each of the predators and controlled for the loss of biomass of species by maintaining a constant mass of predators in one set of treatments and simultaneously using an additive design. This design allowed us to test the density dependence of our results and test for functional compensation by other species.
   The identity of predator species, but not richness, affected oyster populations. The loss of blue crabs, alone or in combination with either of the other species, affected the survival rate of juvenile oysters. Blue crabs and stone crabs both affected oyster recruitment and sediment organic matter negatively. Mud crabs at higher than ambient densities, however, could fulfill some of the functions of blue and stone crabs, suggesting a level of ecological redundancy. Importantly, the strong effects of blue crabs in all processes measured no longer occurred when individuals were present at higher-than-ambient densities. Their role as dominant predator is, therefore, dependent on their density within the system and the density of other species within their guild (e. g., mud crabs). Our findings support the hypothesis that the effects of species loss at higher trophic levels are determined by predator identity and are subject to complex intraguild interactions that are largely density dependent. Understanding the role of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning or addressing practical concerns, such as loss of predators owing to overharvesting, remains complicated because accurate predictions require detailed knowledge of the system and should be drawn from sound experimental evidence, not based on observations or generalized models.

AB Ecological corridors are frequently suggested to increase connectivity in fragmented landscapes even though the empirical evidence for this is still limited. Here, we studied whether corridors, in the form of linear grass strips promote the dispersal of three grassland butterflies, using mark-recapture technique in an agricultural landscape in southern Sweden. We found no effects of the presence of corridors or of corridor length on inter-patch dispersal probabilities. Instead, dispersal probabilities appeared to be related to the quality, areas and population densities of the source and recipient patches. For two of the species, the density of captured individuals along corridors was better predicted by the corridor length than by the straight-line distance from a pasture, suggesting that short-distance movements within habitat patches result in a diffusion of individuals along corridors. A literature review revealed that only 16 published studies had explicitly studied the effect of corridors on insect movement. The context in which studies were performed appeared to affect whether corridors facilitated dispersal or not. All seven studies where the corridors consisted of open areas surrounded by forest showed positive effects, while only two out of six studies where corridors consisted of grassland surrounded by other open habitats showed positive effects of corridors. Our results clearly demonstrate that corridors do not always have positive effects on insect dispersal and that the effect seems to depend on the quality of the surrounding matrix, on the spatial scale in which the study is performed and on whether true dispersal or routine movements are considered.

AB Understanding the impacts of combined resource supplies on seedlings is critical to enable prediction of establishment growth, and forest dynamics. We investigated the effects of irradiance and water treatments on absolute growth, and relative growth rate (RGR) and its components, for seedlings of four Quercus species differing in leaf habit and with a wide variation in seed mass. Plants were grown for 6.5 months at three levels of irradiance (100, 27, and 3% daylight), and treated during the last 2.5 months with two watering treatments (frequent watering v. suspended watering). Both shade and drought reduced seedling growth rates, with a significant interaction: under full irradiance the drought treatment had a stronger impact on RGR and final biomass than under deep shade. For three species, seed mass was positively related to absolute growth, with stronger correlations at lower irradiance. The evergreen species grew faster than the deciduous species, though leaf habit accounted for a minor part of the interspecific variation in absolute growth. Seedling biomass was determined positively either by RGR or seed mass; RGR was positively linked with net assimilation rate (NAR) and leaf mass fraction (LMF), and seed mass was negatively linked with RGR and LMF, but positively linked with NAR. Seedling RGR was not correlated with light-saturated net photosynthetic rate, but was strongly correlated with the net carbon balance estimated, from photosynthetic light-response curves, considering daily variation in irradiance. These findings suggest an approach to applying short-term physiological measurements to predict the RGR and absolute growth rate of seedlings in a wide range of combinations of irradiance and water supplies.

AB As essential compounds of plant cell walls, hemicelluloses account for about a quarter of all plant biomass worldwide.
   In seed cotyledons and endosperm of species from several plant families, hemicelluloses are used as mobile carbon reserves. Whether cell wall hemicelluloses of non-reproductive plant tissue are multifunctional molecules, which can also serve as carbon sources during periods of enhanced carbon demand, is still equivocal.
   This review summarizes the current understanding of a possible reserve function of hemicelluloses. Although several descriptive and experimental studies suggested at least partial mobility of cell wall polysaccharides in mature, non-reproductive plant tissues, there is still a need for a broad-scale, ecophysiological exploration of the actual nature of hemicelluloses beyond their structural function.
   The chemical heterogeneity of hemicelluloses may be the major problem for precise quantitative analyses on a large, comparative scale.
   Because of the abundant distribution of hemicelluloses in plants, the existence of a significant mobile carbohydrate pool in cell walls of non-reproductive organs would shed rather new light on plant carbon relations in a source-sink context.
   Consequently, a reserve function of hemicelluloses questions the conventional division of cell compounds into structural (i.e. immobile) and non-structural (i.e. mobile) compounds.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Understanding the mechanisms that maintain diversity is important for managing ecosystems for species persistence. Here we used a long-term data set to understand mechanisms of coexistence at the local and regional scales in the Cape Floristic Region, a global hotspot of plant diversity. We used a dataset comprising 81 monitoring sites, sampled in 1966 and again in 1996, and containing 422 species for which growth form, regeneration mode, dispersal distance and abundances at both the local (site) and meta-community scales are known. We found that species presence and abundance were stable at the meta-community scale over the 30 year period but highly unstable at the local scale, and were not influenced by species' biological attributes. Moreover, rare species were no more likely to go extinct at the local scale than common species, and that alpha diversity in local communities was strongly influenced by habitat. We conclude that stochastic environmental fluctuations associated with recurrent fire buffer populations from extinction, thereby ensuring stable coexistence at the meta-community scale by creating a "neutral-like" pattern maintained by niche-differentiation.

AB From the early 1990s through 2005, we conducted butterfly transect surveys annually at the same sites in three regions of Wisconsin. We compared specialist butterfly population indices at three sites where a permanent non-fire refugium (a unit kept unburned through cycles of rotational fire elsewhere in the site) was established during this study to indices at comparison sites (which had consistent management throughout this study) in the same region. At Crex Meadows (12,180 ha), all significant changes in specialist numbers skewed toward relatively higher abundance in the refugium (14 ha, last burned in 1988) during the later period (1998-2005) versus 10 comparison subsites (fire-managed in both periods) than expected from observations in the earlier period (1991-97). The same pattern occurred in the refugium (4 ha) at Bauer-Brockway (125 ha), after the rest of that unit (9 ha) had its first management fire. Population trends were positive in these refugia, while the comparison sites usually had less favorable trends, or otherwise had similar trends. At Muralt Bluff (25 ha), regal fritillaries (Speyeria idalia) were more concentrated in the refugium (3 ha, last burned in 1991) during the earlier period but were more abundant in both periods in the refugium than the other units there (fire-managed in both periods). In the earlier period at Muralt Bluff, this species significantly declined, the opposite trend of comparison sites (which always had never-burned refugia), but significantly increased in the later period, similar to comparison sites. The refugium did not benefit Ottoe skipper (Hesperia ottoe), which declined significantly in the earlier period and was not recorded in the later period. Formerly burned units began functioning as refugia only > 6-8 years after last fire and continued to increase in benefit for years after that. In fire-managed and fire-prone sites, we recommend the creation of permanent non-fire refugia for Lepidoptera conservation, placed where the most specialists will benefit and managed unintensively (e.g. mowing) if needed.

AB Interspecific and intervarietal hybridization may contribute to the biological diversity of fungal populations. Cryptococcus neoformans is a pathogenic yeast and the most common fungal cause of meningitis in patients with AIDS. Most patients are infected with either of the two varieties of C. neoformans, designated as serotype A (C. neoformans var. grubii) or serotype D (C. neoformans var. neoformans). In addition, serotype AD strains, which are hybrids of these two varieties, are commonly isolated from clinical and environmental samples. While most isolates of serotype A and serotype D are haploid, AD strains are diploid or aneuploid, and contain two sets of chromosomes and two mating type alleles, MATa and MAT alpha, one from each of the serotypes. The global population of serotype A is dominated by isolates with the MAT alpha mating type (A alpha); however, about half of the globally analyzed AD strains possess the extremely rare serotype A MAT alpha allele (Aa). We previously described an unusual population of serotype A in Botswana, in which 25% of the strains contain the rare MATa allele. Here we utilized two methods, phylogenetic analysis of three genes and genotyping by scoring amplified fragment length polymorphisms, and discovered that AD hybrid strains possessing the rare serotype A MATa allele (genotype AaD alpha) cluster with isolates of serotype A from Botswana, whereas AD hybrids that possess the MAT alpha serotype A allele (AaD alpha and A alpha D alpha) cluster with cosmopolitan isolates of serotype A. We also determined that AD hybrid strains are more resistant to UV irradiation than haploid serotype A strains from Botswana. These findings support two hypotheses: (i) AaD alpha strains originated in sub-Saharan Africa from a cross between strains of serotypes A and D; and (ii) this fusion produced hybrid strains with increased fitness, enabling the Botswanan serotype A MATa genome, which is otherwise geographically restricted, to survive, emigrate, and propagate throughout the world.

AB 1. We investigate the evolutionary responses to harvesting in ungulates using a state-dependent, stochastic, density-dependent individual-based model of red deer Cervus elaphus (L.) females subject to different harvesting regimes.
   2. The population's mean weight at first reproduction shifts towards light weights as harvesting increases, and its distribution changes from a single peak distribution under very low or high harvest rates, to a bimodal distribution under intermediate harvest rates.
   3. These results suggest that, consistent with previous studies on aquatic species, harvesting-induced mortality may drive adaptive responses in ungulates by reducing the fitness benefits from adult survival and growth in favour of early and lightweight reproduction.
   4. Selective harvesting for heavy animals has no additional effect on the evolutionarily stable strategy, suggesting that harvest rate is more important than the degree of selectivity in driving adaptive responses. However, selective harvesting of light females is positively associated with maturation weights even higher than those of a nonharvested population, probably due to the reduction in the fitness value of the offspring.
   5. The average number of weight at maturation strategies in the population declines but the total number of strategies across all simulations increases with harvest rate, suggesting that harvesting-induced selection on weight at maturity overcomes the increase in strategy diversity expected from density-dependent release.
   6. Yield initially increases with harvesting due to enhanced productivity of light females experiencing density-dependent release. However, it crashes under intense harvesting resulting in a population skewed to light, young and, therefore, less reproductive animals.

AB Aim Recently, a flurry of studies have focused on the extent to which geographical patterns of diversity fit mid-domain effect (MDE) null models. While some studies find strong support for MDE null models, others find little. We test two hypotheses that might explain this variation among studies: small-ranged groups of species are less likely than large-ranged species to show mid-domain peaks in species richness, and mid-domain null model predictions are less robust for smaller spatial extents than for larger spatial extents.
   Location We analyse data sets from elevational, riverine, continental and other domains from around the world.
   Methods We use a combination of Spearman rank correlations and binomial tests to examine whether differences within and among studies and domains in the predictive power of MDE null models vary with spatial scale and range size.
   Results Small-ranged groups of species are less likely to fit mid-domain predictions than large-ranged groups of species. At large spatial extents, diversity patterns of taxonomic groups with large mean range sizes fit MDE null model predictions better than did diversity patterns of groups with small mean range sizes. MDE predictions were more explanatory at larger spatial extents than at smaller extents. Diversity patterns at smaller spatial extents fit MDE predictions poorly across all range sizes. Thus, MDE predictions should be expected to explain patterns of species richness when ranges and the scale of analysis are both large.
   Main conclusions Taken together, the support for these hypotheses offers a more sophisticated model of when MDE predictions should be expected to explain patterns of species richness, namely when ranges and the scale of analysis are both large. Thus the circumstances in which the MDE is important are finite and apparently predictable.

AB 1. Species richness is the most widely used biodiversity index, but can be hard to measure. Many species remain undetected, hence raw species counts will often underestimate true species richness. In contrast, capture-recapture methods estimate true species richness and correct for imperfect and varying detectability.
   2. Detectability is a crucial quantity that provides the link between a species count and true species richness. For insects, it has hardly ever been estimated, although this is required for the interpretation of species counts.
   3. In the Swiss butterfly monitoring programme about 100 transect routes are surveyed seven times a year using a highly standardised protocol. In July 2003, control observers made two additional surveys on 38 transects. Data from these 38 quadrats were analysed to see whether currently available capture-recapture models can provide quadrat-specific estimates of species richness, and to estimate species detectability in relation to transect, observer, survey, region, and abundance.
   4. Species richness over the entire season cannot be estimated using current capture-recapture methods. The species pool was open, preventing use of closed population models, and detectability varied by species, preventing use of current open population models. Assuming a closed species pool during two mid-season (July) surveys, a Jackknife capture-recapture method was used that accounts for heterogeneity to estimate mean detectability and species richness.
   5. In every case, more species were present than were counted. Mean species detectability was 0.61 (SE 0.01) with significant differences between observers (range 0.37-0.83). Species-specific detection at time t + 1 was then modelled for those species seen at t for three mid-season surveys. Detectability averaged 0.50 (range 0.17-0.81) for individual species and 0.65, 0.44, and 0.42 for surveys. Abundant species were detected more easily, although this relationship explained only 5% of variation in species detectability.
   6. These are important, although not entirely unexpected, results for species richness estimation of short-lived animals. Raw counts of species may be misleading species richness indicators unless many surveys are conducted. Monitoring programmes should be calibrated, i.e. the assumption of constant detectability over dimensions of interest needs to be tested. The development of capture-recapture or similar models that can cope with both open populations and heterogeneous species detectability to estimate species richness should be a research priority.

AB Acoustic signals attenuate with the distance over which they travel, but a vocalizing animal might maintain signal transmission by increasing vocal amplitude when addressing a distant receiver. Such behaviour is well known in humans as speakers vary vocal amplitude with changing distance from an audience, a phenomenon that has been interpreted as resulting from our higher cognitive abilities. However, whether nonhuman animals are capable of this form of vocal adjustment appears to be unknown. We investigated whether birds are also able to regulate the amplitude of their vocal signals depending on receiver distance. Male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, increased their song amplitude with increasing distance to addressed females, indicating that songbirds, like humans, respond to differences in communication distance and that they adjust vocal amplitude accordingly. Our findings show that animal communication is flexible in a previously unsuspected way, and that human speech and bird song share a basic mechanism for ensuring signal transmission. We suggest that this behaviour can be accounted for by simple proximate mechanisms rather than by the cognitive abilities that have been thought necessary in humans.

AB To optimize fitness, organisms may have to trade the number and quality of individual offspring against their own condition and survival. Limiting micronutrients such as antioxidants may be crucial to this trade-off. We investigated whether vitamin E, a major antioxidant in the diet of vertebrates, is limiting to barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) nestlings. We manipulated brood size to alter the intensity of sib-sib competition and supplemented nestlings with two different physiological doses of vitamin E while establishing a control group. Treatment effects were measured on body mass and size, feather growth, T cell-mediated immune response and hematocrit. Supplementation with vitamin E at intermediate physiological doses improved nestling mass and condition and feather growth, whereas higher physiological doses did not enhance offspring quality compared to a control treatment. The positive effects of vitamin E on body mass and condition were only detectable from days 6 to 10 when maximum growth rate is attained. Experimental enlargement of broods reduced body mass and size and T cell-mediated immune response only during the late nestling period. The effect of vitamin E supplementation did not depend on brood size manipulation, as revealed by the nonsignificant statistical interaction. This result contradicts the hypothesis that availability of vitamin E depends on intrabrood competition and instead suggests that it depends on concentration of vitamin E in the insect prey of swallows. Thus, antioxidants may be available in limited amounts to barn swallow nestlings and such limitation affects growth. In addition, present results confirm that barn swallow parents trade progeny number against growth and immunity of individual offspring.

AB The broad objective of multivariate data analysis in biology is to summarize associations among species (the dependent or response variables), and to elucidate species responses to one or more environmental factors (the independent or predictor variables). This objective is achieved by reducing the dimensionality of variable space to an efficient, low-dimensional summative model of the underlying data structure that reflects the coordinated response of species to environmental factors. While multivariate methods have proven indispensable for analyzing both experimental and survey data in the biological sciences, considerable confusion persists regarding the selection of appropriate analytical strategies. The selection of an appropriate analytical strategy, which includes important decisions regarding data transformation, variable standardization and methodological approach, should be based on fundamental considerations of statistical appropriateness, data structure, and study objectives. Unfortunately, past and more recent assessments of multivariate analytical strategies have been based largely on empirical models of questionable relevance. This empirical approach has led to misleading recommendations and erroneous generalizations regarding the relative efficacy of the available multivariate methods. This paper dispels these misleading recommendations and provides some general guidelines for selecting appropriate data transformations, variable standardizations and methodological approaches in the multivariate analysis of biological data.

AB Phylogeographic studies are often focused on temperate European species with relict footholds in the Mediterranean region. Past climatic oscillations usually induced range contractions and expansions from refugial areas located in southern Europe, and spatial distribution of genetic diversity show that northward expansions were usually pioneer-like. Actually, few studies have focused on circum-Mediterranean species, which probably were not influenced in the same way by climatic oscillations. We present the phylogeography of the bark beetle Tomicus destruens, which is restricted to the whole Mediterranean basin and the Atlantic coasts of North Africa and Portugal. We systematically sequenced 617 bp of the mitochondrial genes COI and COII for 42 populations (N = 219). Analysis revealed 53 haplotypes geographically structured in two clades, namely eastern and western clades, that diverged during the Pleistocene. A contact zone was identified along the Adriatic coast of Italy. Interestingly, we found contrasting levels of genetic structure within each clade. The eastern group was characterized by a significant phylogeographic pattern and low levels of gene flow, whereas the western group barely showed a spatial structure in haplotype distribution. Moreover, the main pine hosts were different between groups, with the Aleppo-brutia complex in the east and the maritime pine in the west. Potential roles of host species, climatic parameters and geographical barriers are discussed and the phylogeographic patterns are compared to classical models of postglacial recolonization in Europe.

AB Water stress and nitrogen (N) availability are the main constraints limiting yield in durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum). This work investigates the combined effects of N source (ammonium-NH4+, nitrate-NO3- or a mixture of both-NH4+:NO3-) and water availability (well-watered vs. moderate water stress) on photosynthesis and water-use efficiency in durum wheat (cv. Korifla) flag leaves grown under controlled conditions, using gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence and stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13). Under well-watered conditions, NH4+-grown plants had lower net assimilation rates (A) than those grown with the other two N forms. This effect was mainly due to lower stomatal conductance (g(s)). Under moderate water stress, differences among N forms were not significant, because water regime (WR) had a stronger effect on g(s) and A than did N source. Consistent with lower g(s), delta C-13 and transpiration efficiency (TE) were the highest in NH4+ leaves in both water treatments. These results indicate higher water-use efficiency in plants fertilized with NH4+ due to stomatal limitation on photosynthesis. Moreover, leaf delta C-13 is an adequate trait to assess differences in photosynthetic activity and water-use efficiency caused by different N sources. Further, the effect of these growing conditions on the nitrogen isotope composition (delta N-15) of flag leaves and roots was examined. Water stress increased leaf delta N-15 in all N forms. In addition, leaf delta N-15 increased as root N decreased and as leaf delta C-13 became less negative. Regardless of WR, the leaf delta N-15 of NO3--grown plants was lowest. Based on stepwise and canonical discriminant analyses, we conclude that plant delta N-15 together with delta C-13 and other variables may reflect the conditions of N nutrition and water availability where the plants were grown. Thus well-watered plants grown with NH4+:NO3- resembled those grown with NO3(-), whereas under water stress they were closer to plants grown with NH4+.

AB Human modification of landscapes overlying natural environmental heterogeneity is resulting in an increase in the numbers and types of ecological patches and their intervening boundaries. In this paper, we describe an operational framework for understanding and predicting dynamics of these biotic transitions for a range of environmental conditions across multiple spatial scales. We define biotic transitions as the boundary and the neighboring states, a more general definition than typically denoted by the terms boundary, ecotone, edge or gradient. We use concepts of patch dynamics to understand the structural properties of biotic transitions and to predict changes in boundaries through time and across space. We develop testable hypotheses, and illustrate the utility of our approach with examples from arid and semiarid ecosystems. Our framework provides new insights and predictions as to how landscapes may respond to future changes in climate and other environmental drivers.

AB 'River widenings' are commonly used in river restoration to allow channel movement within a spatially limited area. Restoration seeks to restore fluvial processes and to re-establish a more natural riparian community. This study investigates the performance of five river widenings in Switzerland, focusing on the re-establishment of riparian (semi-)terrestrial habitats and species, and highlights some factors that seem to influence their performance. The restoration projects are compared with pre-restoration conditions and near-natural conditions, which are assumed to represent the worst- and best-case conditions along a gradient of naturalness. Fuzzy ordination of vegetation data and calculation of landscape metrics based on habitat maps revealed marked differences between the degree of naturalness achieved by each individual restoration project. However, in C general river widenings were found to increase the in-stream habitat heterogeneity and enhanced the establishment of pioneer habitats and riparian plants. Analyses of species pools based on a hierarchic list of indicator species and correspondence analysis showed that the ability of river widenings to host typical riparian species and to increase local plant diversity strongly depends on the distance to near-natural stretches. Species dispersal and establishment might be hampered by decisions taken outside the scope of the restoration project. Therefore we conclude that action on the catchment scale is needed to maximize the benefits of local management. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Avian nest predation is known to increase with the degree of forest fragmentation. A common explanation is that farmland allows for high densities of generalist predators, and predators penetrating into the forest cause higher nest losses at forest-farmland edges than in forest interiors. In contrast to numerous patch-level studies of forest edge effects conducted earlier, we broadened the spatial extent to the landscape. We tested the hypothesis of increased predation near farmland over distances of > 4 km from forest-farmland edges into forest interiors in five mountain ranges in Germany, using artificial ground nests. We considered two landscape settings: (1) Transitions between a forest matrix and a farmland matrix, and (2) farmland patches within a forest matrix. Nest losses were not significantly higher in vicinity to a farmland matrix, but proximity to a pasture within the forest matrix strongly increased predation risk. We speculate that these differences resulted from landscape geometry. Farmland patches and matrix alike are highly attractive to generalist predators, and are regularly visited by red foxes from the forest. Predators that traverse the forest and take prey along the way, will cause a concentration of predation risk towards a patch (pasture), but not towards an adjacent matrix (farming lowlands), of feeding habitat. Contrary to previous evidence that edge effects in nest predation level off after 50 m, nest fate was related to distance to pastures across the entire study extent of 4.1 km. Our results suggest that landscape context and predator mobility may greatly affect spatial predation patterns.

AB Information about the sensitivity to climate of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) is valuable because it will allow forest managers to maximize growth, better understand how carbon sequestration may change over time, and better model and predict future ecosystem responses to climatic change. We examined the effects of climatic variability on the growth of Douglas-fir along an elevational gradient in the North Cascade Range, Washington (USA), at annual timescales during the 20th century. Multivariate analysis and correlation analysis were used to identify climate-growth relationships. Mid-elevation chronologies were negatively correlated with growing season maximum temperature and positively correlated with growing season precipitation. In contrast, high-elevation chronologies were positively correlated with annual temperatures and negatively correlated with previous-year winter Pacific Decadal Oscillation index. Projected increases in summer temperatures will likely cause greater soil moisture stress in many forested ecosystems. The potential of extended summer drought periods over decades may significantly alter spatial patterns of productivity, thus impacting carbon storage. It is likely that the productivity of Douglas-fir in the Cascade Range will decrease at sites with shallow, excessively drained soils, south- and west-facing aspects, and steep slopes and will increase at high-elevation sites.

AB Plant community diversity measured as species richness, is typically highest in the early post-fire years in California shrublands. However, this generalization is overly simplistic and the present study demonstrates that diversity is determined by a complex of temporal and spatial effects. Ninety sites distributed across southern California were studied for 5 years after a series of fires. Characteristics of the disturbance event, in this case fire severity, call alter post-fire diversity, both decreasing and increasing diversity, depending on life form. Spatial variability in resource availability is an important factor explaining patterns of diversity, and there is a complex interaction between landscape features and life form. Temporal variability in resource availability affects diversity, and the diversity peak in the immediate post-fire year (or two) appears to be driven by factors different from subsequent diversity peaks. Early post-fire diversity is influenced by life-history specialization, illustrated by species that spend the bulk of their life cycle as a dormant seed bank, which is then triggered to germinate by fire. Resource fluctuations, precipitation in particular, may be associated with subsequent post-fire diversity peaks. These later peaks in diversity comprise a flora that is compositionally different from the immediate post-fire flora, and their presence may be due to mass effects from population expansion of local populations in adjacent burned areas.

AB Socially monogamous species vary widely in the frequency of extrapair offspring, but this is usually discussed assuming that females are free to express mate choice. Using game-theory modeling, we investigate the evolution of male mate guarding, and the relationship between paternity and mate-guarding intensity. We show that the relationship between evolutionarily stable mate-guarding behavior and the risk of cuckoldry can be complicated and nonlinear. Because male fitness accumulates both through paternity at his own nest and through his paternity elsewhere, males evolve to guard little either if females are very, faithful or if they are very unfaithful. Attractive males are Usually expected to guard less than unattractive males, but within-pair paternity may correlate either positively or negatively with the number of extrapair offspring fertilized by a male. Negative correlations, whereby attractive males are cuckolded more, become more likely if the reason behind female extrapair behavior applies to most females (e.g., fertility insurance) rather than the subset mated to unattractive males (e.g., when females seek "good genes") and if mate guarding is efficient in controlling female behavior. We discuss the current state of empirical knowledge with respect to these findings.

AB The Eastern Mediterranean region is among the regions which were predicted to become drier under IPCC climate scenarios. Here, we document a gradual reduction of rainfall and tree growth and the loss of rural springs during the last decades of the twentieth century. Years with severe drought are associated with very low tree growth (dendrochronology) and dry falling of springs as evidenced by interviews with local stakeholders. The paper discusses the consequences of accelerating drought on natural vegetation and agriculture and points at the interaction with fire dynamics and economy, both likely to enhance the drought effect.

AB We argue that the genetic diversity of a dominant plant is important to the associated dependent community because dependent species such as herbivores are restricted to a subset of genotypes in the host-plant population. For plants that function as habitat, we predicted that greater genetic diversity in the plant population would be associated with greater diversity in the dependent arthropod community. Using naturally hybridizing cottonwoods ( Populus spp.) in western North America as a model system, we tested the general hypothesis that arthropod alpha (within cross-type richness) and beta (among cross-type composition) diversities are correlated with cottonwood cross types from local to regional scales. In common garden experiments and field surveys, leaf-modifying arthropod richness was significantly greater on either the F(1) (1.54 times) or backcross (1.46 times) hybrid cross types than on the pure broadleaf cross type ( P. deltoides Marshallor P. fremontii Watson). Composition was significantly different among three cross types of cottonwoods at all scales. Within a river system, cottonwood hybrid zones had 1.49 times greater richness than the broadleaf zone, and community composition was significantly different between each parental zone and the hybrid zone, demonstrating a hierarchical concentration of diversity. Overall, the habitats with the highest cottonwood cross-type diversity also had the highest arthropod diversity. These data show that the genetics of habitat is an important conservation concept and should be a component of conservation theory.

AB Recent experimental and simulation results, and competition-based ecological theory, predict a simple relationship between species richness and the invasibility of communities at small spatial scales - likelihood of invasion decreases with increasing richness. Here we show data from 42 continuous years of sampling old field succession that reveal quite different dynamics of plant invasion. Contrary to experimental studies, when richness was important in explaining invasion probability, it was typically positively associated with species invasion. Invasion of several species had a unimodal response to resident species richness, which appeared to be a mixture of compositional influences and a richness effect. Interestingly, invasions by native and exotic species did not fundamentally differ. Control of species invasion in this system is individualistic, caused by a variety of community-level mechanisms rather than a single prevailing richness effect.

AB [1] Methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes on east European tundra wetland ecosystems (67degrees23'N, 63degrees22'E) were measured by static chamber techniques in 1999. The 29 microsites were divided into wet flarks (WF), intermediate flarks (IF), wet lawns (WL), intermediate lawns (IL), and hummocks (HCK) in accordance to the water table (WT) and vegetation. The seasonal net ecosystem exchange (NEE) varied from -104 mg emission to 249 mg CO2-C m(-2) h(-1) uptake. Regression models were constructed to estimate the seasonal gross photosynthesis and respiration on each of the microsites. The cumulative gross photosynthesis (and respiration) was 68 (37), 131 (77), 176 (126), 164 (129), and 189 (187) g C m(-2) in a 100 day summer period in WF, IF, WL, IL, and HCK, respectively. The losses of carbon in winter accounted for 23.7%, 5.0%, 3.1%, 2.6%, and 2.3% of the net ecosystem production. CH4 emissions in summer (and winter) were 7.7 (7.8), 6.6 (0.8), 8.2 (0.4), 0.7 (0.3), and 0.1 (0.2) g C m(-2) for WF, IF, WL, IL, and HCK, respectively. The modeled annual carbon balance for grouped microsites shows that dry HCKs were carbon sources -7.5 g C yr(-1) while flarks and lawns were carbon sinks ranging from 2.2 to 35.9 g C yr(-1). The results show the importance of WT and vegetation composition on annual flux dynamics in a tundra wetland. CH4 emissions from arctic peatlands seem to be sensitive to changes in the WT.

AB We describe a method for comparing nuclear and organelle population differentiation (F-ST) in seed plants to test the hypothesis that pollen and seed gene flow rates are equal. Wright's infinite island model is used, with arbitrary levels of self-fertilization and biparental organelle inheritance. The comparison can also be applied to gene flow in animals. Since effective population sizes are smaller for organelle genomes than for nuclear genomes and organelles are often uniparentally inherited, organelle F-ST is expected to be higher at equilibrium than nuclear F-ST even if pollen and seed gene flow rates are equal. To reject the null hypothesis of equal seed and pollen gene flow rates, nuclear and organelle F-ST's must differ significantly from their expected values under this hypothesis. Finite island model simulations indicate that infinite island model expectations are not greatly biased by finite numbers of populations (greater than or equal to 100 subpopulations). The power to distinguish dissimilar rates of pollen and seed gene flow depends on confidence intervals for fixation index estimates, which shrink as more subpopulations and loci are sampled. Using data from the tropical tree Corythophora alta, we rejected the null hypothesis that seed and pollen gene flow rates are equal but cannot reject the alternative hypothesis that pollen gene flow is 200 times greater than seed gene flow.

AB Forty-nine surface sediment samples from the Congo deep-sea fan and adjacent hydrographic environments were prepared palynologically and analyzed for fossilizable dinoflagellate cysts. The main objective was to investigate the extent to which cysts reflect present-day hydrography, and therefore may be used downcore as paleoceanographic indicators. The region sampled covers a range of marine environments including the Congo River plume, the area of pronounced upwelling off West-Central Africa, and a nearshore-offshore gradient from coastal to oceanic waters. This is the first study of the effect of a major tropical river plume on associated cyst assemblages. Cyst counts were low, particularly near the river mouth and furthest offshore. A combination of statistical treatments was used to analyze the surface cyst assemblages, including cluster analysis, correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis. This helped to identify five distinctive sample groupings representing the main ecological signals in the cyst assemblage data. Group A, dominated by spherical brown protoperidinioid cysts, is an upwelling signal. Group B, dominated by the cosmopolitan species O. centrocarpum, is the main signal for the river plume effect, interpreted as reflecting the environmental instability this creates. Group C, dominated by S. delicatus with accessory O. centrocarpum, characterizes the outer plume, somehow reflecting the mixing of progressively diluted river plume water and the surrounding oceanic waters. Group D, with high proportions of Impagidinium and Nematosphaeropsis together with O. centrocarpurn and S. delicatus, characterizes the location of the Angola-Benguela Front. Group E, with mainly Impagidinium species, is an oceanic signal. The identification of nutrients and water stability as main determining factors influencing cyst signals has implications for cyst-based paleoenviromnental interpretations using transfer functions, which are developed almost exclusively from comparisons with more easily available data for sea-surface temperature, salinity, and sea ice.

AB Halimeda (Bryopsidales), a genus of calcified, segmented green seaweeds, abounds in reefs and lagoons throughout the tropics. To investigate phylogenetic, phylogeographic, and historic ecological relationships of the genus, the nuclear rDNA including the SSU and both ITS regions were sequenced. A maximum likelihood tree revealed the following: (1) there were anatomical and morphological synapomorphies for five well-supported lineages; (2) the last common ancestor of one lineage invaded sandy substrata; those of two other lineages established in wave-affected habitats, whereas the cenancestor of the remaining two lineages occupied sheltered rocky slopes. Yet, several species adapted to new habitats subsequently, resulting in several cases of convergence; (3) all lineages separated into Atlantic and Indo-Pacific daughters, likely resulting from the rise of the Panamanian Isthmus. Each daughter pair gave rise to additional convergent species in similar habitats in different oceans; (4) Halimeda opuntia, the only monophyletic pantropical species detected so far, dispersed from the Indo-Pacific into the Atlantic well after the closure event; (5) minor SSU-sequence differences across species and phylogeographic patterns of vicariance indicated a relatively recent diversification of the extant diversity. Cretaceous and Early Tertiary fossil look-alikes of modern species must then have resulted from iterative convergence. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

AB Sexual dimorphism is an important characteristic of many mammals, but little is known about how environmental variables may affect its phenotypic expression. The relationships between population size, body mass, seasonal mass changes, and sexual mass dimorphism were investigated using 22 years of data on individually marked bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) on Ram Mountain, Alberta. The number of adult ewes was artificially maintained low from 1972 to 1981 and then allowed to increase. The body mass of males from 0 to 7 years of age was negatively affected by population density. Female body mass was negatively affected by population density up to 2 years of age. As the number of ewes increased, sexual mass dimorphism of sheep aged 2-7 years declined. Population density had a negative effect on seasonal mass changes of young males and females. Density also had a weak but significant positive effect on yearly mass gain of 2-year-old females, suggesting compensatory growth. Females appear to compensate for resource shortages early in life, while males show a lifelong negative effect. We suggest that these sexual differences are due to the greater flexibility of resource allocation to growth or reproduction by females than by males.

AB The early colonization of newly created coarse woody material (CWM) by beetles was studied in aspen mixedwood forests at two locations in north-central Alberta. Healthy trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) trees, in old (> 100 years) and mature (40-80 years) stands, were cut to provide three types of CWM: stumps, bolts on the ground (logs), and bolts suspended above the ground to simulate snags. Over 2 years, 1049 Coleoptera, representing 49 taxa, were collected. Faunal structure differed little between the two locations. Species diversity was higher in old than in mature stands, and higher in stumps and logs than in suspended bolts; however, these "snags" tended to have higher abundance when compared with stumps and logs. Overall beetle abundance and the catch of wood-boring beetles was significantly higher in the first year post-treatment, mainly because of the ambrosia beetle (Trypodendron retusum (LeConte)) and one of its predators, Rhizophagus remotus LeConte; however, beetle diversity was higher in the second year, suggesting that early wood-boring species may "precondition" the wood for a number of succeeding species. The high turnover rate of taxa and spatial or temporal variation in faunal structure suggests that effort focused on habitat classification of CWM will facilitate management to conserve saproxylic faunal diversity.

AB Restoring fire-suppressed longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) sandhill communities often includes reducing hardwood structure before re-establishing maintenance fire regimes. Using a randomized complete block design, we compared the effects of three hardwood reduction techniques (spring burning, application of the ULW (R) form of the herbicide hexazinone. and midstory chainsaw felling/girdling) and a no-treatment control on oak and longleaf pine densities in fire-suppressed sandhills at Eglin Air Force Base. FL. Treatments were applied in the spring and summer of 1995. Felling/girdling and herbicide plots were also burned for fuel reduction from March to April in 1997. Frequently burned, high-quality sandhill plots were sampled to establish reference conditions. Pre-treatment diameter distributions of oaks followed a negative-exponential curve in all treatments, but were Aat with low tree densities in reference plots. Oak densities were significantly reduced in the herbicide and felling/girdling plots in 1995. Compared to the controls, growing season fire topkilled up to 20% more hardwoods among smaller trees in 1995, but this value increased to approximately 50% after 1996. In all pears, the greatest reduction of oak juvenile density (<1.4 m high) was caused by herbicide application. Control plots contained significantly fewer oak juveniles than the burn and felling/girdling plots. Reference plots contained the lowest and most variable oak juvenile densities. Size distributions of longleaf pine across all plots were bimodal with modes at 0-4.9 and 25-29.9 cm in diameter. The highest mode was at 0-4.9 cm in treatment plots and at 25-29.9 cm in reference plots, Only fire quantitatively changed the distributions by the attrition of the smallest trees >1.4 m high in all years. Fire caused approximately 50% decreases in longleaf pine juvenile (<1.4 m high) density in 1995 and 1997. By 1997, median juvenile densities converged to 5-6 stems/200 m(2) in all treatments, including the control. Juvenile densities were slightly higher and more variable in reference plots than in treatments. In 1997, fuel reduction burns in the herbicide and felling/girdling plots decreased densities of recently germinated longleaf pines to <5 seedlings/20 m(2), a 90% decrease compared to 1996 densities. Seedling densities dropped by approximately 50% in control and burn plots, although these sites received no manipulations after 1995. Seedling densities only decreased by 22% in reference plots (205 seldlings/20m(2) in 1996), which did experience some fires, (C) 2001 Elsevier science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Each summer Adelie penguins breed in large disjunct colonies on ice-free areas around the Antarctic continent. Comprising > 10 million birds, this species represents a dominant feature of the Antarctic ecosystem. The patchy distribution within a large geographical range, natal philopatry and a probable history of refugia, suggest that this species is likely to exhibit significant genetic differentiation within and among colonies. We present data from seven microsatellite DNA loci for 442 individuals from 13 locations around the Antarctic continent. With the exception of one locus, there was no significant genic or genotypic heterogeneity across populations. Pairwise F-ST values were low with no value > 0.02. When all colonies were compared in a single analysis, the overall F-ST value was 0.0007. Moreover, assignment tests were relatively ineffective at correctly placing individuals into their respective collection sites. These data reveal a lack of genetic differentiation between Adelie penguin colonies around the Antarctic continent, despite substantial levels of genetic variation. We consider this homogeneity in terms of the dispersal of individuals among colonies and the size of breeding groups and discuss our results in terms of the glacial history of Antarctica.

AB Epidemiological models predict a positive relationship between host population density and abundance of macroparasites. Here I test these by a comparative study. I used data on communities of four groups of parasites inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract of mammals, nematodes of the orders Oxyurida. Ascarida. Enoplida and Spirurida, respectively. The data came from 44 mammalian species and represent examination of 16 886 individual hosts. I studied average prevalence of all nematodes within an order in a host species. a measure of community level abundance, and considered the potential confounding effects of host body weight, fecundity, age at maturity and diet. Host population density was positively correlated with parasite prevalence within the order Oxyurida, where all species have direct life cycles. Considering the effects of other variables did not change this. This supports the assumption that parasite transmission rate generally is a positive function of host population density. It also strengthens the hypothesis that host densities generally act as important determinants of species richness among directly transmitted parasites and suggests that negative influence of such parasites on host population growth rate increase with increasing host population density among host species. Within the other three nematode orders. where a substantial number of the species have indirect life cycles, no relationships between prevalence and host population density were seen. Again, considering the effects of other variables did not affect this conclusion. This suggests that host population density is a poor predictor of species richness of indirectly transmitted parasites and that effects of such parasites on host population dynamics do not scale with host densities among species of hosts.

SO ECOGRAPHY

DT Article
ID VISITATION RATES; COMMUNITY; FLOWERS
AB Nine Campanula species occurring along the elevation gradient of Mt Olympos were studied regarding their pollination ecology. The main issues considered were 1) the relative importance of various insect taxa as Campanula pollinators, 2) the patterns of pollinators' size and activity as a function of altitude, 3) the effect of pollinator exclusion on floral longevity, and 4) the extent to which the morphological difference of C. versicolor from the other Campanula species on Mt Olympos is expressed in its pollinating fauna. The vast majority of Campanula pollinators were solitary bees. Andrenidae and Megachilidae bees (mainly Chelostoma campanulorum) dominated the pollinating fauna of most species. Melittidae and bumblebees were the commonest pollinators of high altitude species. Campanula versicolor differs from the other Campanula species in that its corolla is not bell-shaped but Rat. Mainly Apis mellifera syrphid flies, and carpenter bees, unlike all other Campanula species on Mt Olympos pollinated it. Ar the species level, rather large altitudinal differences of Campanula populations did not result into large diversification of their pollinating fauna. The insect visitation rate to flowers decreased with altitude. When pollinators were excluded, the floral longevity of the species examined increased three to five times. Neither Rower phase (male of females) was consistently favoured in the absence of pollinators. The pollen loads of the different insect taxa (Apis mellifera included) were of variable purity. The majority of Megachilidae bees carried pollen loads of high purity. Pollen loads From insects visiting Campanula species at high altitudes did not differ significantly in their purity from those visiting lowland species. The distribution of Campanula pollinators' body size along the altitudinal gradient exhibited a U-shaped pattern. No relationship was found between insect-pollinator body size and corolla size of Campanula species.

AB In order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the large amount of RAPD polymorphism found in 1990 in a population of the selfing; annual Medicago truncatula GAERTN. (Fabaceae), we have analysed most of the individuals (n = 363) from the same population 6 years later using microsatellite loci. We confirm the result of the earlier study, namely that this population is very polymorphic and highly subdivided, with approximately 37% of the variance distributed among subpopulations, only 50 m apart one from another. We use standard F-statistics analyses, linkage disequilibria, minimum spanning network, multilocus assignment tests and spatial autocorrelation analyses to test the hypotheses that spatial structure and outcrossing events are involved in maintaining the large amount of genetic diversity at the level of each subpopulation. Interestingly, fine-scale spatial structure could be observed in only one subpopulation suggesting that other mechanisms are acting elsewhere. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of fine spatial genetic structure in a predominantly selfing species.

AB Comparisons of the patterns of differentiation among genetic markers with different modes of inheritance fan provide insights into patterns of sex-biased dispersal and gene flow. Here, we compare the patterns of differentiation in six microsatellite loci among eight northern breeding populations of the yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia) with results obtained with mitochondrial DNA. Significant but low levels of differentiation (overall F-ST = 0.014; overall R-ST = 0.015) were present across all populations. The level of differentiation is substantially less than that observed in the same samples based on mitochondrial DNA control region variation. The presence of low population imbalance index values and significant isolation-by-distance relationships for both F-ST and R-ST suggests that these populations are at evolutionary equilibrium and that the high degree of similarity between populations may be due to high levels of male-biased gene flow. This suggests that there may be significant but previously unappreciated differences in the long-distance and/or episodic dispersal behaviour of males and females in these birds.

AB Carotenoids are important as pigments for bright: coloration of animals, and as physiologically active compounds with a wide array of health-related functions. Carotenoid-dependent coloration may have evolved as a signal to conspecifics; however, factors that may limit availability of carotenoids are poorly known. We investigated how the acquisition of carotenoids may be constrained by availability in the environment, diet, genetic make-up and health status of wild American kestrels (Falco sparverius). Plasma concentrations of siblings at the time of fledging showed a high degree of resemblance; however, a cross-fostering experiment revealed that variance was largely explained by nest of rearing, rather than nest of origin, thus indicating a low genetic component. A multivariate analysis of attributes of nestlings (sex, size, plasma proteins, immune function), parental reproduction (laying date, clutch size) and rearing conditions (brood size, size hierarchy nestling mortality) showed only a small significant effect of leucocyte differentials on carotenoid concentrations of nestlings. A strong environmental effect on plasma carotenoids was demonstrated by levels of adult kestrels being correlated within mated pairs, and having a significant association with the abundance of voles, the primary prey species, per territory.

AB Twenty sites in the lower San Joaquin River drainage, California, were sampled from 1993 to 1995 to characterize fish communities and their associations with measures of water quality and habitat quality. The feasibility of developing an Index of Biotic Integrity was assessed by evaluating four fish community metrics, including percentages of native fish, omnivorous fish, fish intolerant of environmental degradation, and fish with external anomalies. Of the thirty-one taxa of fish captured during the study, only 10 taxa were native to the drainage. Multivariate analyses of percentage data identified four site groups characterized by different groups of species. The distributions of fish species were related to specific conductance, gradient, and mean depth; however, specific conductance acted as a surrogate variable for a large group of correlated variables. Two of the fish community metrics - percentage of introduced fish and percentage of intolerant fish - appeared to be responsive to environmental quality but the responses of the other two metrics - percentage of omnivorous fish and percentage of fish with anomalies - were less direct. The conclusion of the study is that fish communities are responsive to environmental conditions, including conditions associated with human-caused disturbances, particularly agriculture and water development. The results suggest that changes in water management and water quality could result in changes in species distributions. Balancing the costs and benefits of such changes poses a considerable challenge to resource managers.

AB Nineteen species of lizards simultaneously studied at the Curua-Una in the central Amazon of Brazil separate on the basis of microhabitat use and prey types. There is no relationship between microhabitat niche breadths and dietary niche breadths, species using the greatest diversity of microhabitats do not necessarily use the greatest diversity of prey types. A pseudocommunity analysis revealed that the lizard assemblage is structured with respect to microhabitat and diets. A comparison of dietary overlaps with phylogenetic similarities indicates that much of the variation in dietary similarity in this assemblage is associated with phylogenetic similarity. A similar analysis with microhabitat overlaps yielded no relationship to phylogenetic similarity. These results suggest that much of the structure in this particular assemblage is historical, i.e., not the direct result of ongoing species interactions at the local level. Because this assemblage is comprised of lizards from a diversity of higher taxa (families). we suggest that historical factors may be more important in determining structure in phylogenetically deeply rooted assemblages than in phylogenetically shallow-rooted assemblages.

AB We used permanent plot inventories from 1969-1973 and 1988-1993 to describe forest species distribution patterns of the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, a 2,185 ha basin in western North Carolina, USA. We used canonical correspondence analysis to explore the vegetation-site patterns for the 1970s and 1990s inventories combined. Site variables were determined by direct measurements or calculated by digital geographical information system mapping methods. Site variables were percent slope, elevation, terrain shape, precipitation, modified azimuth, soil organic matter content, soil depth, soil clay content, depth of A-horizon, potential solar radiation, and mean temperature during the growing season. Fifty percent of the variation in the vegetation distribution was explained by the site variables used in the canonical correspondence analysis. Soil organic matter, terrain shape, and elevation were the variables most strongly related to vegetation distribution. Species associated with convex terrain (upper slopes and ridges), such as Pinus rigida, Quercus coccinea, and Quercus velutina, decreased in abundance from the 1970s to the 1990s; species associated with soils having high organic matter content and deep A-horizons, such as Liriodendron tulipifera, Rhododendron maximum, and Tsuga canadensis increased in abundance. Individual species responded differently to site gradients. For example, Acer rubrum, Quercus prinus, Oxydendrum arboreum, and Nyssa sylvatica were located in the center of the ordination space (i.e., their occurrence was not related to any of the site variables), which suggests that these species are habitat generalists.

AB The regeneration (regrowth into viable plants) and colonization (establishment in the sediment) abilities of vegetative fragments of 16 aquatic plant species occurring in habitats with different disturbance frequencies were compared through a laboratory experiment. The hypothesis was that plants occurring in habitats frequently disturbed by floods should have higher regeneration and colonization abilities than plants in rarely disturbed habitats. Four types of fragments were collected from the plants and their regrowth and/or rooting into the sediment were recorded over 10 weeks. Numerous species exhibited a trade-off between their regeneration and colonization abilities (e.g. Sparganium emersum, Luronium natans), others presented fragments with high abilities in both fields (e.g. Myriophyllum spicatum, Potamogeton coloratus), and others showed fragments with low abilities in both fields (e.g. Utricularia vulgaris, Potamogeton lucens). The characteristics of two species (Potamogeton coloratus, Ceratophyllum demersum) did not fit in very well with the hypothesis, but this could be explained by their competitive abilities and ecological amplitude. Most species from habitats rarely disturbed by floods presented low regeneration and colonization abilities. As predicted, species from habitats with high or intermediate disturbance frequencies presented at least one of the two tactics, and this could be related to their adaptation strategies in withstanding disturbance events.

AB We examine long-term changes in the structure and composition of the groundfish species assemblage in four regions of the northwestern North Sea during the period 1925-96. Species diversity in the whole groundfish assemblage has declined in the three areas where fishing pressure has been greatest. In the area where fishing pressure was least, no trend in species diversity was detected. Only in the most intensively fished area was there a negative trend in species diversity in the non-target species assemblage. Marked spatial variation in species diversity was observed. For the whole groundfish assemblage, diversity was greatest in the inshore and southern regions and least in the offshore northern area. For the non-target species assemblage, the spatial diversity gradient was reversed. Multi-variate analyses indicated long-term changes and between-area differences in the species composition of both the whole groundfish assemblage and the non-target species subset. However, these changes consisted mostly of subtle variations in the relative and absolute abundance of a few key species, rather than major species replacement events. Only one species showed any marked increase in abundance: a dominant species which became more abundant. Examination of species aggregated length-frequency distributions indicated a shift towards an assemblage dominated by smaller fish in the whole assemblage, but not in the non-targeted assemblage.

AB 1. Self-thinning is a progressive decline in population density caused by competitively induced losses in a cohort of growing individuals and can be depicted as: log(10) (density) = c - beta log(10) (body mass).
   2. In mobile animals, two mechanisms for self-thinning have been proposed: (i) the space hypothesis predicts that maximum population density for a given body size is the inverse of territory size, and hence, the self-thinning slope is the negative of the slope of the allometric territory-size relationship; (ii) the energetic equivalence hypothesis predicts that the self-thinning slope is the negative of the slope of the allometric metabolic rate relationship, assuming a constant supply of energy for the cohort.
   3. Both hypotheses were tested by monitoring body size, population density, food availability and habitat for young-of-the-year Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in Catamaran Brook, New Brunswick. The results were consistent with the predictions of the space hypothesis. Observed densities did not exceed the maximum densities predicted and the observed self-thinning slope of -1.16 was not significantly different from the slope of -1.12, predicted by the allometry of territory size for the population under study.
   4. The observed self-thinning slope was significantly steeper than -0.57, predicted by the allometry of metabolic rate. perhaps because of a gradual decline in food abundance over the study period. The decline in density was more rapid in very shallow sites and may have been partly caused by a seasonal change in water depth and an ontogenetic habitat shift rather than solely by competition for food or space.
   5. The allometry of territory size may be a useful predictor of self-thinning in populations of mobile animals competing for food and space.

AB Most models of population dynamics do not take sexual reproduction into account (i.e. they do not consider the role of males). However, assumptions behind this practice-that no demographic sex differences exist and males are always abundant enough to fertilize all the females-are usually not justified in natural populations. On the contrary, demographic sex differences are common, especially in polygynous species. Previous models that consider sexual reproduction report a stabilizing effect through mixing of different genotypes, thus suggesting a decrease in the propensity for complex dynamics in sexually reproducing populations. Here we show that considering the direct role of males in reproduction and density dependence leads to the conclusion that a two-sex model is not necessarily more stable compared with the corresponding one-sex model. Although solutions exist where sexual reproduction has a stabilizing effect even when no genotypic variability is included (primarily when associated with monogamy), factors like polygyny, sex differences in survival or density dependence, and possible alterations of the primary sex ratio (the Trivers-Willard mechanism), may enlarge the parametric region of complex dynamics. Sexual reproduction therefore does not necessarily increase the stability of population dynamics and can have destabilizing effects, at least in species with complicated mating systems and sexual dimorphism.

AB Comparative estimates of the leaf area index (LAI) of a mangrove forest canopy in Peninsular Malaysia were obtained by 3 independent methods: (1) from direct measurement of canopy leaf area above a prescribed ground area; (2) from simple measurements of light flux density above and beneath the canopy; (3) from measurements of direct beam transmittance through the canopy. Measurements were also made of the rate of net photosynthesis at different levels in the canopy. LAIs obtained by direct measurement ranged from 2.2 to 7.4 over 4 replicate 0.25 m(2) quadrats, with a mean of 4.9. This high degree of variability was attributed partly to the small quadrat size and partly to the spatial heterogeneity of the canopy. In contrast, estimates of LAI obtained from log averaged measurements of light transmission over a larger area of forest varied by less than 5% between replicates, with an average of 5.1. Measurements of direct beam transmittance yielded an average canopy LAI of 4.4. Average rates of net photosynthesis ranged from 4 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) at the bottom of the canopy to about 10 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) at the top of the canopy. The LAI weighted average rate of net photosynthesis integrated over the entire canopy was 9 mu mol CO2 m(-2) leaf s(-1). Assuming an effective daylength of 8 h, total daily net photosynthetic carbon fixation was estimated to be 155 kg C ha(-1) d(-1), giving an annual net photosynthetic production of 56 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). This is substantially higher than previously reported for mangrove forests.

AB Spatial characteristics of Suillus variegatus populations, including the size, distribution and number of genets, were measured in four naturally regenerated stands of Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris in Sweden that were more than 100 years old. In the oldest forest, a continuous tree-layer had been present at least since the last forest fire in 1647. Genets were identified based on somatic incompatibility reactions performed on mycelial cultures from sporocarps. In total, 38 genets were identified from 120 tested sporocarps. The maximal extension of a genet, as reflected by its outermost sporocarps, was 27 m in the oldest stand and ranged between 10 and 17 m in the other stands. On average, genet size was 20 m in the oldest stand and 10 m in the other stands. Other genets were not found within the domains of established genets. The closest detected distance between genets was 1.5 m, and the average distance was 4 m. The number of genets ranged between 56 and 74 ha(-1) at the studied sites. Possible reasons for the high degree of resemblance in characteristics in old forests between S. variegatus, the dominant bolete in mature forests, and S. bovinus when present, more a characteristic for younger forests and only scarcely occurring in older forests, are discussed.

AB Species composition patterns and vegetation-environment relationships were quantified for high-elevation rock outcrops of the Southern Appalachian Mountains, an infrequent and insular habitat in a forested landscape. Outcrops occur over a wide geographic range encompassing extensive variation in both geology and climate. Geographic-scale factors interact with site-scale factors to produce variation in vegetation among outcrops. Similarly, site-scale factors interact with micro-scale factors to produce variation in vegetation within outcrops. To provide a quantitatively-based classification of outcrop vegetation we used a TWINSPAN analysis of 154 100-m(2) plots. We recognized nine communities that primarily correspond to different combinations of elevation, bedrock type, geography, and moisture. Within outcrops of a single bedrock type, vegetation composition of 100-m(2) plots was consistently correlated with elevation and solar radiation, but relationships to soil nutrients varied with bedrock type. Both site-scale (100 m(2)) factors (e.g. elevation, slope, aspect, and bedrock type) and plot-scale (1-m(2)) microsite factors (e.g. soil depth, vegetation height, soil nutrients) were strongly correlated with species composition at the 1-m(2) level. Environment can be used to predict composition more effectively for 100-m(2) plots on a single bedrock type than either across bedrock types or at a 1-m(2) scale. Composition-environment relationships resemble those described for outcrop systems from other regions with pronounced topographic relief more than they do those described for the nearby but flatter and lower-elevation outcrops of the Southeastern Piedmont. There is strong spatial autocorrelation in this community, perhaps owing to dispersal limitation. Consequently, a comprehensive conservation strategy must include reservation of both a range of geologic types and a range of geographic locations.

AB We examined habitat features at several spatial scales that were associated with predation of New England cottontails (Sylvilagus transitionalis) by mammalian carnivores. The fate (killed or survived) of marked cottontails was compared with the characteristics of the habitat patch they occupied and composition of the surrounding landscape. The perimeter-to-area ratio of an occupied patch, the amount of disturbed habitat within 0.5 km of a patch, and the amount of coniferous forest within 1 km of a patch were greater for killed rabbits than for those that survived. The amount of water within 1 km and an index of landscape evenness were greater for rabbits that survived. Habitat features in the vicinity of patches occupied by cottontails apparently influenced the distribution and movements of carnivores. Characteristics of patches likely influenced rabbit exposure and predator success. We propose that predation of cottontails was a multiscaled process. Landscape composition (ca. 250 km(2)) influenced the relative abundance of predators. The distribution of predators within a landscape was a function of the distribution of life requisites (multiple patches, ca. 250 ha). Predators then selected a patch in which to forage on the basis of its relative productivity compared with adjacent patches. Finally, once a predator entered a patch, the vulnerability of a resident cottontail was dependent on the site (ca. 250 m(2)) occupied by the rabbit. This hierarchical approach may help resolve the current debate on the risk of predation in fragmented landscapes.

AB The carbon rand nitrogen cycles are crucial for understanding the changing Earth system, influencing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, primary productivity of the biosphere, and biogenic emissions of reactive trace species. The carbon budget of the terrestrial biosphere has attracted special attention because of its role in atmospheric changes in carbon dioxide. The terrestrial biosphere influences atmospheric CO2 through three main modes: First, large, nearly balanced fluxes of CO2 in photosynthesis and respiration exhibit a degree of interannual variability which can influence atmospheric CO2, at feast on annual to decadal time scales. Second, land use changes release CO2 to the atmosphere. Third, poorly understood processes are likely resulting in enhanced uptake of CO2 in certain ecosystems, acting as a sink in the global carbon cycle. This sink may result from forest demographics, atmospheric N deposition, or direct CO2 fertilizatian, or some synergistic combination of those processes. Global estimates of terrestrial carbon cycle components requires the use of remote observations; however, the appropriate remote sensing strategies are quite different for the various components.

AB 1. The proposition that strong functional predator-prey links are associated wit compartments in food webs (Paine 1980) is examined for a large, well-documented web, the Ythan estuary.
   2. A simple method for the detection and description of infrastructure within binary food webs is described and this is applied to 12 webs previously analysed by Pimm & Lawton (1980) and to the Ythan web.
   3. There was evidence for significant compartmentation in several real webs, all of which are reasonably well documented, aquatic and benthic. However, there was no evidence of compartments in the Ythan web.
   4. Manipulative field experiments on a range of avian, fish and invertebrate predators provided no evidence for strong functional interactions in the Ythan web.
   5. It is concluded that the lack of both compartments and strong linkage is consistent with Paine's hypothesis, but that the proposition needs further testing for other well-described systems.

AB Habitat selection by cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) larger than 9 cm total length was monitored during winter and summer. The trout had strong preferences for depths > 25 cm and areas where instream and overhead cover exceeded 40% of the local surface area. The fish selected a variety of substrate sizes. Stream areas with mean water velocities < 20 cm/s were preferred. Compared with previous studies, the trout used low-velocity areas more, and we suggest that this is due to less competitive interaction from other young salmonids. The trout used the larger pools (> 20 m2)  considerably less during winter than during summer. Otherwise, little seasonal variation in habitat use was found. A composite measure of water depth and cover appeared to be the most important of the measured environmental factors influencing habitat selection in the stream. The larger trout, which were presumably dominant, occupied the deepest pool areas. The trout selected spatial habitats in proportions significantly different from the available habitat, demonstrating strong habitat preferences. It is concluded that observations of habitat occupancy without considering habitat availability may give biased results.

AB We studied the effects of cattle on selection of home ranges and habitats by female mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) on summer range in the Sierra Nevada, California. Three grazing levels (no grazing, moderate grazing, and heavy grazing) were imposed on 3 fenced range units over 3 years. Habitat selection by 13 radio-collared female mule deer was estimated each summer; habitat selection by radio-collared cattle was estimated at the 2 grazing levels. In the absence of grazing, meadow-riparian habitat comprised a greater proportion of deer home ranges than during grazing. During moderate and heavy grazing, a greater proportion of montane shrub habitat was included within deer home ranges than when ungrazed. Within home ranges, deer preferred meadow-riparian habitat at all grazing levels, whereas aspen (Populus tremuloides) habitat was preferred only during no grazing. Deer preference for meadow-riparian habitat declined over the summer, more so with cattle grazing. Cattle also preferred meadow-riparian and aspen habitats. The greatest effect of cattle on habitat selection by female mule deer occurred during the late summer with heavy grazing when forage and cover were at a minimum in preferred habitats. Female mule deer shifted habitat use by reducing their use of habitats preferred by cattle and increasing their use of habitats avoided by cattle. These results were consistent with expectations of competition and habitat selection theory.

AB Public Safety Personnel (PSP; e.g., correctional workers and officers, firefighters, paramedics, police officers, and public safety communications officials (e.g., call center operators/dispatchers)) are regularly exposed to potentially psychologically traumatic events (PPTEs). PSP also experience other occupational stressors, including organizational (e.g., staff shortages, inconsistent leadership styles) and operational elements (e.g., shift work, public scrutiny). The current research quantified occupational stressors across PSP categories and assessed for relationships with PPTEs and mental health disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression). The participants were 4820 PSP (31.7% women) responding to established self-report measures for PPTEs, occupational stressors, and mental disorder symptoms. PPTEs and occupational stressors were associated with mental health disorder symptoms (ps < 0.001). PSP reported substantial difficulties with occupational stressors associated with mental health disorder symptoms, even after accounting for diverse PPTE exposures. PPTEs may be inevitable for PSP and are related to mental health; however, leadership style, organizational engagement, stigma, sleep, and social environment are modifiable variables that appear significantly related to mental health.

AB Biodiversity on Earth is strongly affected by human alterations to the environment. The majority of studies have considered aboveground biodiversity, yet little is known about whether biodiversity changes below-ground follow the same patterns as those observed aboveground. It is now established that communities of soil biota have been substantially altered by direct human activities such as soil sealing, agricultural land-use intensification, and biological invasions resulting from the introduction of non-native species. In addition, altered abiotic conditions resulting from climate change have also impacted soil biodiversity. These changes in soil biodiversity can alter ecosystem functions performed by the soil biota, and therefore, human-induced global changes have a feedback effect on ecosystem services via altered soil biodiversity. Here, we highlight the major phenomena that threaten soil biodiversity, and we propose options to reverse the decline in soil biodiversity. We argue that it is essential to protect soil biodiversity as a rich reservoir that provides insurance against the changes wrought by the Anthropocene. Overall, we need to better understand the determinants of soil biodiversity and how they function, plan to avoid further losses, and restore soil biodiversity where possible. Safeguarding this rich biotic reservoir is essential for soil sustainability and, ultimately, the sustainability of human society.

AB Deleterious effects of habitat fragmentation and benefits of connecting fragments could be significantly underestimated because changes in colonization and extinction rates that drive changes in biodiversity can take decades to accrue. In a large and well-replicated habitat fragmentation experiment, we find that annual colonization rates for 239 plant species in connected fragments are 5% higher and annual extinction rates 2% lower than in unconnected fragments. This has resulted in a steady, nonasymptotic increase in diversity. with nearly 14% more species in connected fragments after almost two decades. Our results show that the full biodiversity value of connectivity is much greater than previously estimated, cannot be effectively evaluated at short time scales, and can be maximized by connecting habitat sooner rather than later.

AB The management of parasites, insect pests and vectors requests development of novel, effective and eco-friendly tools. The development of resistance towards many drugs and pesticides pushed scientists to look for novel bioactive compounds endowed with multiple modes of action, and with no risk to human health and environment. Several natural products are used as alternative/complementary approaches to manage parasites, insect pests and vectors due to their high efficacy and often limited non-target toxicity. Their encapsulation into nanosystems helps overcome some hurdles related to their physicochemical properties, for instance limited stability and handling, enhancing the overall efficacy. Among different nanosystems, micro- and nanoemulsions are easy-to-use systems in terms of preparation and industrial scale-up. Different reports support their efficacy against parasites of medical importance, including Leishmania, Plasmodium and Trypanosoma as well as agricultural and stored product insect pests and vectors of human diseases, such as Aedes and Culex mosquitoes. Overall, micro- and nanoemulsions are valid options for developing promising eco-friendly tools in pest and vector management, pending proper field validation. Future research on the improvement of technical aspects as well as chronic toxicity experiments on non-target species is needed.

AB Despite widespread efforts to implement climate services, there is almost no literature that systematically analyzes users' needs. This paper addresses this gap by applying a decision analysis perspective to identify what kind of mean sea level rise (SLR) information is needed for local coastal adaptation decisions. We first characterize these decisions, then identify suitable decision analysis approaches and the sea level information required, and finally discuss if and how these information needs can be met given the state of the art of sea level science. We find that four types of information are needed: (i) probabilistic predictions for short-term decisions when users are uncertainty tolerant; (ii) high-end and low-end SLR scenarios chosen for different levels of uncertainty tolerance; (iii) upper bounds of SLR for users with a low uncertainty tolerance; and (iv) learning scenarios derived from estimating what knowledge will plausibly emerge about SLR over time. Probabilistic predictions can only be attained for the near term (i.e., 2030-2050) before SLR significantly diverges between low and high emission scenarios, for locations for which modes of climate variability are well understood and the vertical land movement contribution to local sea levels is small. Meaningful SLR upper bounds cannot be defined unambiguously from a physical perspective. Low- to high-end scenarios for different levels of uncertainty tolerance and learning scenarios can be produced, but this involves both expert and user judgments. The decision analysis procedure elaborated here can be applied to other types of climate information that are required for mitigation and adaptation purposes.

AB Aim This paper presents the statistical bases for temporal beta-diversity analysis, a method to study changes in community composition through time from repeated surveys at several sites. Surveys of that type are presently done by ecologists around the world. A temporal beta-diversity Index (TBI) is computed for each site, measuring the change in species composition between the first (T1) and second surveys (T2). TBI indices can be decomposed into losses and gains; they can also be tested for significance, allowing one to identify the sites that have changed in composition in exceptional ways. This method will be of value to identify exceptional sites in space-time surveys carried out to study anthropogenic impacts, including climate change. Innovation The null hypothesis of the TBI test is that a species assemblage is not exceptionally different between T1 and T2, compared to assemblages that could have been observed at this site at T1 and T2 under conditions corresponding to H-0. Tests of significance of coefficients in a dissimilarity matrix are usually not possible because the values in the matrix are interrelated. Here, however, the dissimilarity between T1 and T2 for a site is computed with different data from the dissimilarities used for the T1-T2 comparison at other sites. It is thus possible to compute a valid test of significance in that case. In addition, the paper shows how TBI dissimilarities can be decomposed into loss and gain components (of species, or abundances-per-species) and how a B-C plot can be produced from these components, which informs users about the processes of biodiversity losses and gains through time in space-time survey data. Main conclusion Three applications of the method to different ecological communities are presented. This method is applicable worldwide to all types of communities, marine, and terrestrial. R software is available implementing the method.

AB Theoretical models pertaining to feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes are prevalent in multiple biological fields. An integrative overview is currently lacking, due to little crosstalk between the fields and the use of different methodological approaches. Here, we review a wide range of models of eco-evolutionary feedbacks and highlight their underlying assumptions. We discuss models where feedbacks occur both within and between hierarchical levels of ecosystems, including populations, communities and abiotic environments, and consider feedbacks across spatial scales. Identifying the commonalities among feedback models, and the underlying assumptions, helps us better understand the mechanistic basis of eco-evolutionary feedbacks. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks can be readily modelled by coupling demographic and evolutionary formalisms. We provide an overview of these approaches and suggest future integrative modelling avenues. Our overview highlights that eco-evolutionary feedbacks have been incorporated in theoretical work for nearly a century. Yet, this work does not always include the notion of rapid evolution or concurrent ecological and evolutionary time scales. We show the importance of density- and frequency-dependent selection for feedbacks, as well as the importance of dispersal as a central linking trait between ecology and evolution in a spatial context. A is available for this article.

AB Classic research on elevational gradients in plant-herbivore interactions holds that insect herbivore pressure is stronger under warmer, less seasonal climates characteristic of low elevations, and that this in turn selects for increased defence in low- (relative to high-) elevation plants. However, recent work has questioned this paradigm, arguing that it overly simplifies the ecological complexity in which plant-insect herbivore interactions are embedded along elevational gradients. Numerous biotic and abiotic factors vary with elevation, and their simultaneous influences are the focus of current work on elevational gradients in insect herbivory and plant defences. The present review 1) synthesizes current knowledge on elevational gradients in plant-insect herbivore interactions; 2) critically analyses research gaps and highlights recent advances that contribute to filling these gaps; and 3) outlines new research opportunities to uncover underlying mechanisms and build towards a unified theory on elevational gradients. We conclude that the next generation of studies should embrace community complexity - including multi-trophic dynamics and the multivariate nature of plant defence - and to do so by combining observational data, manipulative experiments and emerging analytical tools.

However, these may be difficult to obtain for mobile species, especially colonial central-place foragers (CCPFs; e.g., bats, corvids, social insects), because it is often impractical to determine the provenance of individuals observed beyond breeding sites. Moreover, some CCPFs, especially in the marine realm (e.g., pinnipeds, turtles, and seabirds) are difficult to observe because they range tens to ten thousands of kilometers from their colonies. It is hypothesized that the distribution of CCPFs depends largely on habitat availability and intraspecific competition. Modeling these effects may therefore allow distributions to be estimated from samples of individual spatial usage. Such data can be obtained for an increasing number of species using tracking technology. However, techniques for estimating population-level distributions using the telemetry data are poorly developed. This is of concern because many marine CCPFs, such as seabirds, are threatened by anthropogenic activities. Here, we aim to estimate the distribution at sea of four seabird species, foraging from approximately 5,500 breeding sites in Britain and Ireland. To do so, we GPS-tracked a sample of 230 European Shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis, 464 Black-legged Kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla, 178 Common Murres Uria aalge, and 281 Razorbills Alca torda from 13, 20, 12, and 14 colonies, respectively. Using Poisson point process habitat use models, we show that distribution at sea is dependent on (1) density-dependent competition among sympatric conspecifics (all species) and parapatric conspecifics (Kittiwakes and Murres); (2) habitat accessibility and coastal geometry, such that birds travel further from colonies with limited access to the sea; and (3) regional habitat availability. Using these models, we predict space use by birds from unobserved colonies and thereby map the distribution at sea of each species at both the colony and regional level. Space use by all four species' British breeding populations is concentrated in the coastal waters of Scotland, highlighting the need for robust conservation measures in this area. The techniques we present are applicable to any CCPF.

AB The native distribution of the blue crab Callinectes sapidus in the western Atlantic extends from Nova Scotia to Argentina. Introduced to Europe at the beginning of the 20th century, it is currently recorded almost ubiquitously in the Mediterranean and in the Black Sea. An overview of the occurrence, abundance, and ecological impact of the species in southern European waters is provided; additionally, we present a pragmatic assessment of its management scenarios, explicitly considering the dual nature of C sapidus as both an invasive species and a fishery resource. We emphasise that the ongoing expansion of C sapidus in the region may represent a stimulating challenge for the identification and implementation of future strategies in the management of invasive crustaceans. The impact of the invader could be converted into an enhancement of the services delivered by southern European coastal ecosystems, while mitigation costs could be transformed into profits for local populations.

AB 1. A major challenge of current ecological research is to determine the responses of plant and animal communities and ecosystem processes to future environmental conditions. Ecosystems respond to climate change in complex ways, and the outcome may significantly depend on biodiversity.
   2. We studied the relative effects of enhanced drought and of plant species mixture on soil biota and on litter decomposition in a Mediterranean oak forest. We experimentally reduced precipitation, accounting for seasonal precipitation variability, and created a single-species litter (Quercus pubescens), a two-species litter mixture (Q. pubescens + Acer monspessulanum) and a three-species litter mixture (Q. pubescens + A. monspessulanum + Cotinus coggygria).
   3. In general, drier conditions affected decomposers negatively, directly by reducing fungal biomass and detritivorous mesofauna, and also indirectly by increasing the predation pressure on detritivorous mesofauna by predatory mesofauna. This is reflected under drier conditions in that Collembola abundance decreased more strongly than Acari abundance. One Collembola group (i.e. Neelipleona) even disappeared completely.
   4. Increased drought strongly decreased litter decomposition rates. Mixed litter with two and three plant species positively affected soil biota communities and led to a more efficient litter decomposition process, probably through a greater litter quality. Faster decomposition in mixed litter can thus compensate slower decomposition rates under drier condition.
   5. Synthesis. Our results highlight that, within our study system, drier climate strongly impacts on soil biodiversity and hence litter decomposition. Species-rich litter may mitigate such a decline in decomposition rates. Diverse plant communities should hence be maintained to reduce shifts in ecosystem functioning under climate change.

ID SCIENCE; BIODIVERSITY; SYSTEMS
AB Founded in 2012, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is one of the most ambitious attempts to date to bridge the divide between scientific knowledge and indigenous and local knowledge. Doing so requires overcoming participatory, epistemological and ontological challenges, including different communicative forms, diverging criteria for knowledge validation, and conflicting views of nature. Central IPBES documents are analyzed to see how the platform deals with these challenges. While IPBES constitutes an unprecedented, innovative and ambitious institutional design for the cross-fertilization of knowledge, the results show that IPBES (i) struggles to reconcile an open, collaborative atmosphere with the demands for structure set by the scientific format, (ii) tends to shy away from potentially conflict-laden issues and disagreements, (iii) often treats scientific knowledge and indigenous or local knowledge as easily distinguishable entities, and (iv) has yet to solve the epistemological challenges of knowledge generation and validation when working across knowledge-systems. Taken together, these features seem to hinder the cross-fertilization of knowledge. The case of IPBES thus holds important lessons for future efforts to transform both knowledge production and the overall framing of challenges within global environmental governance.

AB Stomatal conductance influences both photosynthesis and transpiration, thereby coupling the carbon and water cycles and affecting surface-atmosphere energy exchange. The environmental response of stomatal conductance has been measured mainly on the leaf scale, and theoretical canopy models are relied on to upscale stomatal conductance for application in terrestrial ecosystem models and climate prediction. Here we estimate stomatal conductance and associated transpiration in a temperate deciduous forest directly on the canopy scale via two independent approaches: (i) from heat and water vapor exchange and (ii) from carbonyl sulfide (OCS) uptake. We use the eddy covariance method to measure the net ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of OCS, and we use a flux-gradient approach to separate canopy OCS uptake from soil OCS uptake. We find that the seasonal and diurnal patterns of canopy stomatal conductance obtained by the two approaches agree (to within +/- 6% diurnally), validating both methods. Canopy stomatal conductance increases linearly with above-canopy light intensity (in contrast to the leaf scale, where stomatal conductance shows declining marginal increases) and otherwise depends only on the diffuse light fraction, the canopy-average leaf-to-air water vapor gradient, and the total leaf area. Based on stomatal conductance, we partition evapotranspiration (ET) and find that evaporation increases from 0 to 40% of ET as the growing season progresses, driven primarily by rising soil temperature and secondarily by rainfall. Counterintuitively, evaporation peaks at the time of year when the soil is dry and the air is moist. Our method of ET partitioning avoids concerns about mismatched scales or measurement types because both ET and transpiration are derived from eddy covariance data. Neither of the two ecosystem models tested predicts the observed dynamics of evaporation or transpiration, indicating that ET partitioning such as that provided here is needed to further model development and improve our understanding of carbon and water cycling.

AB Remote sensing (RS)'approaches commonly applied to constrain estimates of gross primary production (GPP) employ greenness-based vegetation indices derived from surface reflectance data. Such approaches cannot capture dynamic changes of photosynthesis rates as caused by environmental stress. Further, applied vegetation indices are often affected by background reflectance or saturation effects. Sun. induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F) provides the most direct measure of photosynthesis and has been recently proposed as a new RS approach to improve estimates of GPP and tracing plant stress reactions. This work aims to provide further evidence on the complementary information content of F and its relation to changes in photosynthetic activity compared to traditional RS approaches. We use the airborne imaging spectrometer HyPlant to obtain several F products including red fluorescence (F-687), far-red fluorescence (F-760), F-760 yield (F-760yield) and the ration between F-687 and F-760 (F-ratio). We calculate several vegetation indices indicative for vegetation greenness. We apply a recently proposed F-based semi-mechanistic approach to improve the forward modeling of GPP using F-760 and compare this approach with a traditional one based on vegetation greenness and ground measurements of GPP derived from chamber measurements. In addition, we assess the sensitivity of F-760yield and Fratio for environmental stress. Our results show an improved predictive capability of GPP when using F-760 compared to greenness-based vegetation indices. F-760yield and F-ratio show a strong variability in time and between different crop types suffering from different levels of water shortage, indicating a strong sensitivity of F products for plant stress reactions. We conclude that the new RS approach of F provides complements to the set of commonly applies RS: The use of F-760 improves constraining estimates of GPP while the ratio of red and far-red F shows large potential for tracking spatio-temporal plant adaptation in response to environmental stress conditions.

AB Establishing physiological thresholds to drought-induced mortality in a range of plant species is crucial in understanding how plants respond to severe drought. Here, five common European tree species were selected (Acer campestre L., Acer pseudoplatanus L., Carpinus betulus L., Corylus avellana L. and Fraxinus excelsior L.) to study their hydraulic thresholds to mortality. Photosynthetic parameters during desiccation and the recovery of leaf gas exchange after rewatering were measured. Stem vulnerability curves and leaf pressure-volume curves were investigated to understand the hydraulic coordination of stem and leaf tissue traits. Stem and root samples from well-watered and severely drought-stressed plants of two species were observed using transmission electron microscopy to visualize mortality of cambial cells. The lethal water potential (.lethal) correlated with stem P99 (i.e., the xylem water potential at 99% loss of hydraulic conductivity, PLC). However, several plants that were stressed beyond the water potential at 100% PLC showed complete recovery during the next spring, which suggests that the.lethal values were underestimated. Moreover, we observed a 1:1 relationship between the xylem water potential at the onset of embolism and stomatal closure, confirming hydraulic coordination between leaf and stem tissues. Finally, ultrastructural changes in the cytoplasm of cambium tissue and mortality of cambial cells are proposed to provide an alternative approach to investigate the point of no return associated with plant death.

AB The extent that biotic interactions and dispersal influence species ranges and diversity patterns across scales remains an open question. Answering this question requires framing an analysis on the frontier between species distribution modelling (SDM), which ignores biotic interactions and dispersal limitation, and community ecology, which provides specific predictions on community and meta-community structure and resulting diversity patterns such as species richness and functional diversity. Using both empirical and simulated datasets, we tested whether predicted occurrences from fine-resolution SDMs provide good estimates of community structure and diversity patterns at resolutions ranging from a resolution typical of studies within reserves (250m) to that typical of a regional biodiversity study (5km). For both datasets, we show that the imprint of biotic interactions and dispersal limitation quickly vanishes when spatial resolution is reduced, which demonstrates the value of SDMs for tracking the imprint of community assembly processes across scales.

AB The increasing frequency and severity of wildfires has led to growing attention to the effects of fire disturbance on soil microbial communities and biogeochemical cycling. While many studies have examined fire impacts on plant communities, and a growing body of research is detailing the effects of fire on soil microbial communities, little attention has been paid to the interaction between plant recolonization and shifts in soil properties and microbial community structure and function. In this study, we examined the effect of a common post-fire colonizer plant species, Corydalis aurea, on soil chemistry, microbial biomass, soil enzyme activity and bacterial community structure one year after a major forest wildfire in Colorado, USA, in severely burned and lightly burned soils. Consistent with past research, we find significant differences in soil edaphic and biotic properties between severe and light burn soils. Further, our work suggests an important interaction between fire severity and plant effects by demonstrating that the recolonization of soils by C. aurea plants only has a significant effect on soil bacterial communities and biogeochemistry in severely burned soils, resulting in increases in percent nitrogen, extractable organic carbon, microbial biomass, beta-glucosidase enzyme activity and shifts in bacterial community diversity. This work propounds the important role of plant colonization in succession by demonstrating a clear connection between plant colonization and bacterial community structure as well as the cycling of carbon in a post-fire landscape. This study conveys how the strength of plant microbe interactions in secondary succession may shift based on an abiotic context, where plant effects are accentuated in harsher abiotic conditions of severe burn soils, with implications for bacterial community structure and enzyme activity.

AB Insights from the social identity approach can be useful in understanding the drivers of dysfunctional conflict in environmental and natural resources management (ENRM). Such conflicts tend to be shaped by multiple factors including: the governance arrangements that are in place and how deliberations are undertaken; the conduct and interactions of stakeholders and the wider citizenry; and the conflict legacy, which can perpetuate a 'culture of conflict' around particular issues. This paper presents an integrative conceptual model of the socio-political landscape of ENRM conflict, which draws these multiple factors together. The social identity approach is then introduced as an appropriate lens through which the drivers of conflict in ENRM can be further interrogated. Key social identity mechanisms are discussed along with their contribution to the proliferation of dysfunctional conflict in ENRM. Based on this analysis, it is found that the social identity approach presents a way to understand the subtle and sometimes invisible social structures which underlie ENRM, and that ENRM issues ought to be viewed as a series of conflict episodes connected across time and contexts by the conflict legacy. The conceptual model, and its interpretation through the social identity approach, raises a number of implications for the current theory, practice and institutions involved in the wicked socio-political landscape of ENRM. These implications are examined, followed by a discussion of some opportunities to address the impact of social identity on dysfunctional conflict drawn from empirical Australian and international examples in the literature.

AB The first decade of Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) has uncovered a wealth of disease-associated variants. Two important derivations will be the translation of this information into a multiscale understanding of pathogenic variants and leveraging existing data to increase the power of existing and future studies through prioritization. We explore edge prediction on heterogeneous networks-graphs with multiple node and edge types-for accomplishing both tasks. First we constructed a network with 18 node types-genes, diseases, tissues, pathophysiologies, and 14 MSigDB (molecular signatures database) collections-and 19 edge types from high-throughput publicly-available resources. From this network composed of 40,343 nodes and 1,608,168 edges, we extracted features that describe the topology between specific genes and diseases. Next, we trained a model from GWAS associations and predicted the probability of association between each protein-coding gene and each of 29 well-studied complex diseases. The model, which achieved 132-fold enrichment in precision at 10% recall, outperformed any individual domain, highlighting the benefit of integrative approaches. We identified pleiotropy, transcriptional signatures of perturbations, pathways, and protein interactions as influential mechanisms explaining pathogenesis. Our method successfully predicted the results (with AUROC = 0.79) from a withheld multiple sclerosis (MS) GWAS despite starting with only 13 previously associated genes. Finally, we combined our network predictions with statistical evidence of association to propose four novel MS genes, three of which (JAK2, REL, RUNX3) validated on the masked GWAS. Furthermore, our predictions provide biological support highlighting REL as the causal gene within its gene-rich locus. Users can browse all predictions online (http://het.io). Heterogeneous network edge prediction effectively prioritized genetic associations and provides a powerful new approach for data integration across multiple domains.

AB Understanding the forces shaping ecological communities is crucial to basic science and conservation. Neutral theory has made considerable progress in explaining static properties of communities, like species abundance distributions (SADs), with a simple and generic model, but was criticised for making unrealistic predictions of fundamental dynamic patterns and for being sensitive to interspecific differences in fitness. Here, we show that a generalised neutral theory incorporating environmental stochasticity may resolve these limitations. We apply the theory to real data (the tropical forest of Barro Colorado Island) and demonstrate that it much better explains the properties of short-term population fluctuations and the decay of compositional similarity with time, while retaining the ability to explain SADs. Furthermore, the predictions are considerably more robust to interspecific fitness differences. Our results suggest that this integration of niches and stochasticity may serve as a minimalistic framework explaining fundamental static and dynamic characteristics of ecological communities.

AB Ensemble forecasting is advocated as a way of reducing uncertainty in species distribution modeling (SDM). This is because it is expected to balance accuracy and robustness of SDM models. However, there are little available data regarding the spatial similarity of the combined distribution maps generated by different consensus approaches. Here, using eight niche-based models, nine split-sample calibration bouts (or nine random model-training subsets), and nine climate change scenarios, the distributions of 32 forest tree species in China were simulated under current and future climate conditions. The forecasting ensembles were combined to determine final consensual prediction maps for target species using three simple consensus approaches (average, frequency, and median [PCA]). Species' geographic ranges changed (area change and shifting distance) in response to climate change, but the three consensual projections did not differ significantly with respect to how much or in which direction, but they did differ with respect to the spatial similarity of the three consensual predictions. Incongruent areas were observed primarily at the edges of species' ranges. Multiple stepwise regression models showed the three factors (niche marginality and specialization, and niche model accuracy) to be related to the observed variations in consensual prediction maps among consensus approaches. Spatial correspondence among prediction maps was the highest when niche model accuracy was high and marginality and specialization were low. The difference in spatial predictions suggested that more attention should be paid to the range of spatial uncertainty before any decisions regarding specialist species can be made based on map outputs. The niche properties and singlemodel predictive performance provide promising insights that may further understanding of uncertainties in SDM.

AB What are the neural mechanisms of face recognition? It is believed that the network of face-selective areas, which spans the occipital, temporal, and frontal cortices, is important in face recognition. A number of previous studies indeed reported that face identity could be discriminated based on patterns of multivoxel activity in the fusiform face area and the anterior temporal lobe. However, given the difficulty in localizing the face-selective area in the anterior temporal lobe, its role in face recognition is still unknown. Furthermore, previous studies limited their analysis to occipito-temporal regions without testing identity decoding in more anterior face-selective regions, such as the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. In the current high-resolution functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging study, we systematically examined the decoding of the identity of famous faces in the temporo-frontal network of face-selective and adjacent non-face-selective regions. A special focus has been put on the face-area in the anterior temporal lobe, which was reliably localized using an optimized scanning protocol. We found that face-identity could be discriminated above chance level only in the fusiform face area. Our results corroborate the role of the fusiform face area in face recognition. Future studies are needed to further explore the role of the more recently discovered anterior face-selective areas in face recognition.

AB Life-history traits in birds, such as lifespan, age at maturity, and rate of reproduction, vary across environments and in combinations imposed by trade-offs and limitations of physiological mechanisms. A plethora of studies have described the diversity of traits and hypothesized selection pressures shaping components of the survival-reproduction trade-off. Life-history variation appears to fall along a slow-fast continuum, with slow pace characterized by higher investment in survival over reproduction and fast pace characterized by higher investment in reproduction over survival. The Pace-of-Life Syndrome (POLS) is a framework to describe the slow-fast axis of variation in life-history traits and physiological traits. The POLS corresponds to latitudinal gradients, with tropical birds exhibiting a slow pace of life. We examined four possible ways that the traits of high-elevation birds might correspond to the POLS continuum: (i) rapid pace, (ii) tropical slow pace, (iii) novel elevational pace, or (iv) constrained pace. Recent studies reveal that birds breeding at high elevations in temperate zones exhibit a combination of traits creating a unique elevational pace of life with a central trade-off similar to a slow pace but physiological trade-offs more similar to a fast pace. A paucity of studies prevents consideration of the possibility of a constrained pace of life. We propose extending the POLS framework to include trait variation of elevational clines to help to investigate complexity in global geographic patterns.

AB The identification of a universal law that can predict the spatiotemporal structure of any entity at any scale has long been pursued. Thermodynamics have targeted this goal, and the concept of entropy has been widely applied for various disciplines and purposes, including landscape ecology. Within this discipline, however, the uses of the entropy concept and its underlying assumptions are various and are seldom described explicitly. In addition, the link between this concept and thermodynamics is unclear. The aim of this paper is to review the various interpretations and applications of entropy in landscape ecology and to sort them into clearly defined categories. First, a retrospective study of the concept genesis from thermodynamics to landscape ecology was conducted. Then, 50 landscape ecology papers that use or discuss entropy were surveyed and classified by keywords, variables and metrics identified as related to entropy. In particular, the thermodynamic component of entropy in landscape ecology and its various interpretations related to landscape structure and dynamics were considered. From the survey results, three major definitions (i.e., spatial heterogeneity, the unpredictability of pattern dynamics and pattern scale dependence) associated with the entropy concept in landscape ecology were identified. The thermodynamic interpretations of these definitions are based on different theories. The thermodynamic interpretation of spatial heterogeneity is not considered relevant. The thermodynamic interpretation related to scale dependence is also questioned by complexity theory. Only unpredictability can be thermodynamically relevant if appropriate measurements are used to test it.

AB The altitudinal shifts of many montane populations are lagging behind climate change. Understanding habitual, daily behavioural rhythms, and their climatic and environmental influences, could shed light on the constraints on long-term upslope range-shifts. In addition, behavioural rhythms can be affected by interspecific interactions, which can ameliorate or exacerbate climate-driven effects on ecology. Here, we investigate the relative influences of ambient temperature and an interaction with domestic sheep (Ovis aries) on the altitude use and activity budgets of a mountain ungulate, the Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra). Chamois moved upslope when it was hotter but this effect was modest compared to that of the presence of sheep, to which they reacted by moving 89-103m upslope, into an entirely novel altitudinal range. Across the European Alps, a range-shift of this magnitude corresponds to a 46% decrease in the availability of suitable foraging habitat. This highlights the importance of understanding how factors such as competition and disturbance shape a given species' realised niche when predicting potential future responses to change. Furthermore, it exposes the potential for manipulations of species interactions to ameliorate the impacts of climate change, in this case by the careful management of livestock. Such manipulations could be particularly appropriate for species where competition or disturbance already strongly restricts their available niche. Our results also reveal the potential role of behavioural flexibility in responses to climate change. Chamois reduced their activity when it was warmer, which could explain their modest altitudinal migrations. Considering this behavioural flexibility, our model predicts a small 15-30m upslope shift by 2100 in response to climate change, less than 4% of the altitudinal shift that would be predicted using a traditional species distribution model-type approach (SDM), which assumes that species' behaviour remains unchanged as climate changes. Behavioural modifications could strongly affect how species respond to a changing climate.

AB The ability to cultivate food is an innovation that has produced some of the most successful ecological strategies on the planet. Although most well recognized in humans, where agriculture represents a defining feature of civilization, species of ants, beetles, and termites have also independently evolved symbioses with fungi that they cultivate for food. Despite occurring across divergent insect and fungal lineages, the fungivorous niches of these insects are remarkably similar, indicating convergent evolution toward this successful ecological strategy. Here, we characterize the microbiota of ants, beetles, and termites engaged in nutritional symbioses with fungi to define the bacterial groups associated with these prominent herbivores and forest pests. Using culture-independent techniques and the in silico reconstruction of 37 composite genomes of dominant community members, we demonstrate that different insect-fungal symbioses that collectively shape ecosystems worldwide have highly similar bacterial microbiotas comprised primarily of the genera Enterobacter, Rahnella, and Pseudomonas. Although these symbioses span three orders of insects and two phyla of fungi, we show that they are associated with bacteria sharing high whole-genome nucleotide identity. Due to the fine-scale correspondence of the bacterial microbiotas of insects engaged in fungal symbioses, our findings indicate that this represents an example of convergence of entire host-microbe complexes.
   IMPORTANCE The cultivation of fungi for food is a behavior that has evolved independently in ants, beetles, and termites and has enabled many species of these insects to become ecologically important and widely distributed herbivores and forest pests. Although the primary fungal cultivars of these insects have been studied for decades, comparatively little is known of their bacterial microbiota. In this study, we show that diverse fungus-growing insects are associated with a common bacterial community composed of the same dominant members. Furthermore, by demonstrating that many of these bacteria have high whole-genome similarity across distantly related insect hosts that reside thousands of miles apart, we show that these bacteria are an important and underappreciated feature of diverse fungus-growing insects. Because of the similarities in the agricultural lifestyles of these insects, this is an example of convergence between both the life histories of the host insects and their symbiotic microbiota.

   PREDATION
AB Large carnivore populations are imperiled worldwide through habitat loss, insufficient prey, and intolerance by people, promoting concerns that their populations will persist only in protected areas and remote regions. This assumption is challenged by recent colonization of areas with high human use in the former ranges of several carnivore species, including cougars (Puma concolor). We hypothesized that cougars adjust their behavior to accommodate anthropogenic development, facilitating successful use of modified habitats. We tested this hypothesis using resource selection functions for 42 individual cougars maintaining home ranges across a gradient of anthropogenic development. We evaluated variation in selection among individual cougars by time of day, home-range location (i.e., rural vs. wilderness cougars), and using functional response curves. Cougars stayed further away from both roads and buildings during the day than they did at night, and wilderness cougars showed stronger avoidance of anthropogenic features than did their rural counterparts. Selection patterns of individual cougars varied greatly, and some of this variation was explained by the functional response. For example, cougars decreased their avoidance of some anthropogenic features as those features became more prevalent on the landscape. Failure to account for potential functional responses in habitat selection could lead to overestimation of negative impacts of development for adaptable large carnivores. Given high adaptability to anthropogenic habitat modification displayed by cougars, cougar persistence in increasingly developed landscapes may depend more on human tolerance than on maintaining large tracts of pristine wilderness.

AB The Random Forests classification algorithm was used to predict the occurrence of the realized climate niche for two sub-specific varieties of Pinus ponderosa and three varieties of Pseudotsuga menziesii from presence-absence data in forest inventory ground plots. Analyses were based on ca. 271,000 observations for P. ponderosa and ca. 426,000 observations for P. menziesii, with ca. 6% of the observations in each dataset recording the presence of one of the varieties. Classification errors to the respective databases attributable to fitting the models were ca. 5%, most of which were from falsely predicting varietal occurrence. Confusion in classifying varieties was nil. The primary drivers of the niche model were summer precipitation, winter precipitation and summer degree-days >5 C for the varieties of P. ponderosa and the summer-winter temperature differential, summer maximum temperatures and summer precipitation for the varieties of P. menziesii. Projected impacts of global warming using output from an ensemble of 17 general circulation models were greater for P. ponderosa than for P. menziesii and for varieties of both species from inland climates than from coastal. Projected impacts imply dire consequences for the varieties of P. menziesii occurring in Mexico. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Eukaryotic cells typically contain numerous mitochondria, each with multiple copies of their own genome, the mtDNA. Uniparental transmission of mitochondria, usually via the mother, prevents the mixing of mtDNA from different individuals. While on the one hand, this should resolve the potential for selection for fast-replicating mtDNA variants that reduce organismal fitness, maternal inheritance will, in theory, come with another set of problems that are specifically relevant to males. Maternal inheritance implies that the mitochondrial genome is never transmitted through males, and thus selection can target only the mtDNA sequence when carried by females. A consequence is that mtDNA mutations that confer male-biased phenotypic expression will be prone to evade selection, and accumulate. Here, we review the evidence from the ecological, evolutionary and medical literature for male specificity of mtDNA mutations affecting fertility, health and ageing. While such effects have been discovered experimentally in the laboratory, their relevance to natural populations-including the human population-remains unclear. We suggest that the existence of male expression-biased mtDNA mutations is likely to be a broad phenomenon, but that these mutations remain cryptic owing to the presence of counter-adapted nuclear compensatory modifier mutations, which offset their deleterious effects.

AB Broad-scale models describing predator prey preferences serve as useful departure points for understanding predator-prey interactions at finer scales. Previous analyses used a subjective approach to identify prey weight preferences of the five large African carnivores, hence their accuracy is questionable. This study uses a segmented model of prey weight versus prey preference to objectively quantify the prey weight preferences of the five large African carnivores. Based on simulations of known predator prey preference, for prey species sample sizes above 32 the segmented model approach detects up to four known changes in prey weight preference (represented by model break-points) with high rates of detection (75% to 100% of simulations, depending on number of break-points) and accuracy (within 1.3 +/- 4.0 to 2.7 +/- 4.4 of known break-point). When applied to the five large African carnivores, using carnivore diet information from across Africa, the model detected weight ranges of prey that are preferred, killed relative to their abundance, and avoided by each carnivore. Prey in the weight ranges preferred and killed relative to their abundance are together termed "accessible prey''. Accessible prey weight ranges were found to be 14-135 kg for cheetah Acinonyx jubatus, 1-45 kg for leopard Panthera pardus, 32-632 kg for lion Panthera leo, 15-1600 kg for spotted hyaena Crocuta crocuta and 10-289 kg for wild dog Lycaon pictus. An assessment of carnivore diets throughout Africa found these accessible prey weight ranges include 88 +/- 2% (cheetah), 82 +/- 3% (leopard), 81 +/- 2% (lion), 97 +/- 2% (spotted hyaena) and 96 +/- 2% (wild dog) of kills. These descriptions of prey weight preferences therefore contribute to our understanding of the diet spectrum of the five large African carnivores. Where datasets meet the minimum sample size requirements, the segmented model approach provides a means of determining, and comparing, the prey weight range preferences of any carnivore species.

AB To test the hypothesis that mechanical strain in the posterior human sclera is altered with age, 20 pairs of normal eyes from human donors aged 20 to 90 years old were inflation tested within 48-h postmortem. The intact posterior scleral shells were pressurized from 5 to 45 mmHg, while the full-field three-dimensional displacements of the scleral surface were measured using laser speckle interferometry. The full strain tensor of the outer scleral surface was calculated directly from the displacement field. Mean maximum principal (tensile) strain was computed for eight circumferential sectors ( wide) within the peripapillary and mid-peripheral regions surrounding the optic nerve head (ONH). To estimate the age-related changes in scleral strain, results were fit using a functional mixed effects model that accounts for intradonor variability and spatial autocorrelation. Mechanical tensile strain in the peripapillary sclera is significantly higher than the strain in the sclera farther away from the ONH. Overall, strains in the peripapillary sclera decrease significantly with age. Sectorially, peripapillary scleral tensile strains in the nasal sectors are significantly higher than the temporal sectors at younger ages, but the sectorial strain pattern reverses with age, and the temporal sectors exhibited the highest tensile strains in the elderly. Overall, peripapillary scleral structural stiffness increases significantly with age. The sectorial pattern of peripapillary scleral strain reverses with age, which may predispose adjacent regions of the lamina cribrosa to biomechanical insult. The pattern and age-related changes in sectorial peripapillary scleral strain closely match those seen in disk hemorrhages and neuroretinal rim area measurement change rates reported in previous studies of normal human subjects.

AB The role of ontogenetic processes for the emergence of personality has received only little attention in the past. One reason for the lack of experimental studies on personality development may be that trait consistency over time is one of the cornerstones of the definition of animal personality, whereas, also by definition, ontogeny deals with change over time. Single traits or correlations between traits may be consistent or inconsistent throughout ontogeny; however, the proximate and ultimate causes are not well understood. Environmental factors acting upon individuals during early ontogeny potentially influence personality development substantially. Early environments may severely constrain but also adaptively shape individuals. We examined the personality development of cavies, Cavia aperea, when exposed to increasing and decreasing photoperiod before and after birth. We determined how these predictive environmental cues influenced the development of three behavioural and two physiological traits, their temporal consistency and the correlations between them. We found remarkable plasticity in the development of personality in the cavy, despite a relatively high degree of temporal consistency in most traits. There were stable correlations, some of which became tighter over time, between basal cortisol levels, resting metabolic rate and fearlessness across two different ontogenetic stages. However, we also found that some correlations emerged only after maturation or disappeared over time. Whereas exploration behaviour was tightly correlated with basal cortisol and boldness was correlated with resting metabolic rate, both correlations disappeared in mature animals. Instead, a correlation between exploration and boldness was evident in mature animals. These results call for a broader incorporation of developmental aspects into personality research.

AB Genetic introgression is pervasive in nature and may lead to large-scale phenotypic assimilation and/or admixture of populations, but there is limited knowledge on whether large phenotypic changes are typically accompanied by high levels of introgression throughout the genome. Using bioacoustic, biometric, and spectrophotometric data from a flycatcher (Tyrannidae) system in the Neotropical genus Zimmerius, we document a mosaic pattern of phenotypic admixture in which a population of Zimmerius viridiflavus in northern Peru (henceforth "mosaic") is vocally and biometrically similar to conspecifics to the south but shares plumage characteristics with a different species (Zimmerius chrysops) to the north. To clarify the origins of the mosaic population, we used the RAD-seq approach to generate a data set of 37,361 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A range of population-genetic diagnostics shows that the genome of the mosaic population is largely indistinguishable from southern Z. viridiflavus and distinct from northern Z. chrysops, and the application of parsimony and species tree methods to the genome-wide SNP data set confirms the close affinity of the mosaic population with southern Z. viridiflavus. Even so, using a subset of 2710 SNPs found across all sampled lineages in configurations appropriate for a recently proposed statistical ("ABBA/BABA") test that distinguishes gene flow from incomplete lineage sorting, we detected low levels of gene flow from northern Z. chrysops into the mosaic population. Mapping the candidate loci for introgression from Z. chrysops into the mosaic population to the zebra finch genome reveals close linkage with genes significantly enriched in functions involving cell projection and plasma membranes. Introgression of key alleles may have led to phenotypic assimilation in the plumage of mosaic birds, suggesting that selection may have been a key factor facilitating introgression.

AB The evolution and maintenance of consistent individual differences, so called animal personalities, have attracted much research interest over the past decades. Variation along common personality traits, such as boldness or exploration, is often associated with risk-reward trade-offs. Individuals that are bolder and hence take more risks may be more successful in acquiring resources over the short term. Cautious individuals taking fewer risks may, on the other hand, live longer, but may also gather fewer resources over the short term. According to recent theory, individual differences in personality may be functionally related to individual differences in cognitive performance (i.e., the way in which individuals acquire or use information). Individual differences in the acquisition speed of cognitively challenging tasks are often associated with a speed-accuracy trade-off. Accuracy can be improved by investing more time in the decision-making process or, conversely, decisions can be made more quickly at the cost of making more mistakes. Hence, the speed-accuracy trade-off often involves a risk-reward trade-off. We tested whether 3 personality traits, boldness, activity, and aggressiveness, are correlated with individual learning, associative learning speed, and behavioral flexibility as assessed by reversal learning in wild cavies (Cavia aperea). We found strong positive relationships between all personality traits and learning speed, whereas flexibility was negatively associated with aggressiveness. Our results support the hypothesis that performance reflects individual differences in personality in a predictable way.

AB It remains a challenge to identify the geographical patterns and underlying environmental associations of species with unique ecological niches and distinct behaviors. This in turn hinders our understanding of the ecology as well as effective conservation management of threatened species. The white-eared night heron (Gorsachius magnificus) is a non-migratory nocturnal bird species that has a patchy distribution in the mountainous forests of East Asia. It is currently categorized as "Endangered'' on the IUCN Red List, primarily due to its restricted range and fragmented habitat. To improve our knowledge of the biogeography and conservation of this species, we modeled the geographical pattern of its suitable habitat and evaluated the potential impacts of climate change using ecological niche modeling with a maximum entropy approach implemented in Maxent. Our results indicated that the amount of suitable habitat in all of East Asia was about 130 000 km(2), which can be spatially subdivided into several mountain ranges in southern and southwestern China and northern Vietnam. The extent of suitable habitat range may shrink by more than 35% under a predicted changing climate when assuming the most pessimistic condition of dispersal, while some more suitable habitat would be available if the heron could disperse unrestrainedly. The significant future changes in habitat suitability suggested for Gorsachius magnificus urge caution in any downgrading of Red List status that may be considered. Our results also discern potentially suitable areas for future survey efforts on new populations. Overall, this study demonstrates that ecological niche modeling offers an important tool for evaluating the habitat suitability and potential impacts of climate change on an enigmatic and endangered species based on limited presence data.

AB The Tibetan Plateau has a significant role with regard to atmospheric circulation and the monsoon in particular. Changes between a closed plant cover and open bare soil are one of the striking effects of land use degradation observed with unsustainable range management or climate change, but experiments investigating changes of surface properties and processes together with atmospheric feedbacks are rare and have not been undertaken in the world's two largest alpine ecosystems, the alpine steppe and the Kobresia pygmaea pastures of the Tibetan Plateau. We connected measurements of micro-lysimeter, chamber, C-13 labelling, and eddy covariance and combined the observations with land surface and atmospheric models, adapted to the highland conditions. This allowed us to analyse how three degradation stages affect the water and carbon cycle of pastures on the landscape scale within the core region of the Kobresia pygmaea ecosystem. The study revealed that increasing degradation of the Kobresia turf affects carbon allocation and strongly reduces the carbon uptake, compromising the function of Kobresia pastures as a carbon sink. Pasture degradation leads to a shift from transpiration to evaporation while a change in the sum of evapotranspiration over a longer period cannot be confirmed. The results show an earlier onset of convection and cloud generation, likely triggered by a shift in evapotranspiration timing when dominated by evaporation. Consequently, precipitation starts earlier and clouds decrease the incoming solar radiation. In summary, the changes in surface properties by pasture degradation found on the highland have a significant influence on larger scales.

AB Targeted conservation and management programs are crucial for mitigating anthropogenic threats to declining biodiversity. Although evolutionary processes underpin extant patterns of biodiversity, it is uncommon for resource managers to explicitly consider genetic data in conservation prioritization. Genetic information is inherently relevant to management because it describes genetic diversity, population connectedness, and evolutionary history; thereby typifying their behavioral traits, physiological climate tolerance, evolutionary potential, and dispersal ability. Incorporating genetic information into spatial conservation prioritization starts with reconciling the terminology and techniques used in genetics and conservation science. Genetic data vary widely in analyses and their interpretations can be challenging even for experienced geneticists. Therefore, identifying objectives, decision rules, and implementations in decision support tools specifically for management using genetic data is challenging. Here, we outline a framework for eight genetic system characteristics, their measurement, and how they could be incorporated in spatial conservation prioritization for two contrasting objectives: biodiversity preservation vs maintaining ecological function and sustainable use. We illustrate this framework with an example using data from Tridacna crocea (Lamarck, 1819) (boring giant clam) in the Coral Triangle. We find that many reefs highlighted as conservation priorities with genetic data based on genetic subregions, genetic diversity, genetic distinctness, and connectivity are not prioritized using standard practices. Moreover, different characteristics calculated from the same samples resulted in different spatial conservation priorities. Our results highlight that omitting genetic information from conservation decisions may fail to adequately represent processes regulating biodiversity, but that conservation objectives related to the choice of genetic system characteristics require careful consideration.

AB Different marine species and their larvae have characteristics that can expand or contract their potential dispersal, which can add complexity to the management of species assemblages. Here we used a multi-scale biophysical modeling framework, the Connectivity Modeling System, for the analysis of network connectivity for 5 Caribbean coral reef-associated species in order to gauge similarities and dissimilarities among species as well as among Caribbean regions. We estimated local dispersal and retention to assess regional exchanges, and our results revealed that the population structures of coral and fish are different and should thus have dissimilar management requirements in many regions, with some notable exceptions. Populations of Porites astreoides corals appear fragmented, suggesting that loss of adult colonies in any region may significantly impact regional recruitment success and connectivity. At the other end of the spectrum, populations of bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum are highly connected, and removal of adults in any single region would not imply future recruitment failure in that region. We suggest using a 'diversity of exogenous settlement' index as a proxy of recolonization potential, which is related to the stability of regional connectivity networks. We demonstrate that resolving multispecies larval transport dynamics helps identify regions of both network stability for multi-generational connectivity (e.g. stable larval sources and corridors) pertinent to regional-level management and network inconsistencies among species which are pertinent to the success of local management.

AB Prediction of forest fire ignition may aid in forest fire vigilance and monitoring, and in prioritizing forest fuel treatments. In this paper, we chose easily obtained spatial variables pertaining to topography, vegetation types, meteorological conditions, climate, and human activity to predict forest fire ignition in Heilongjiang province, China, using logistic regression. Results showed fire ignition prediction through logistic regression had good accuracy. Climatic variables (e.g., average annual mean temperature and precipitation) and meteorological conditions (e.g., daily minimum temperature, daily minimum humidity, daily mean humidity, and mean wind speed) are the main determinants of natural forest fires. In the case of anthropogenic fires, vegetation types and human activity as indicated by distances to roads and settlements combined with suitable meteorological conditions (e.g., daily mean humidity) are the main driving factors. The fire ignition probability map can be easily used to prioritize areas for vigilance, to make decisions on allocating firefighting resources, and to select vulnerable spots for forest fuel treatments. It was found that forest fuel treatments should be focused on the Great Xing'an Mountains.

AB Climate change has resulted in upward elevational shifts in the distribution of animals and plants in many areas. The potential consequences of such changes for alpine bird communities were assessed by modelling data on breeding bird distributions along altitudinal gradients in the European Alps in relation to habitat, topography and temperature. Models were used to assess species' sensitivity to potential future environmental change by estimating distributions under a range of scenarios of habitat and climate change, thereby identifying likely future conservation priorities. Distributions of the majority of forest or shrub species remained stable or increased in response to climate change as a result of elevational shifts in suitable habitats. However, open habitat species may face a severe decrease in distribution as grasslands are colonised by forest and shrubs, because much of the area considered is not at a sufficient altitude to accommodate further elevational shifts. This may be exacerbated if vegetation development is constrained at high altitudes, leading to a habitat 'squeeze' caused by an asymmetric response of vegetation zones to climate change. These results suggest that grassland species may be of conservation concern in the future, and that management strategies to maintain openness should be prioritised. However, model outcomes also suggested such management may not be sufficient for a number of species if climate change results in a mismatch between the distribution of suitable climates and suitable habitats. The loss of open habitats may therefore present a serious conservation problem for mountain biodiversity in the future. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hybridization plays an important evolutionary role in several groups of organisms. A phylogenetic approach to detect hybridization entails sequencing multiple loci across the genomes of a group of species of interest, reconstructing their gene trees, and taking their differences as indicators of hybridization. However, methods that follow this approach mostly ignore population effects, such as incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Given that hybridization occurs between closely related organisms, ILS may very well be at play and, hence, must be accounted for in the analysis framework. To address this issue, we present a parsimony criterion for reconciling gene trees within the branches of a phylogenetic network, and a local search heuristic for inferring phylogenetic networks from collections of gene-tree topologies under this criterion. This framework enables phylogenetic analyses while accounting for both hybridization and ILS. Further, we propose two techniques for incorporating information about uncertainty in gene-tree estimates. Our simulation studies demonstrate the good performance of our framework in terms of identifying the location of hybridization events, as well as estimating the proportions of genes that underwent hybridization. Also, our framework shows good performance in terms of efficiency on handling large data sets in our experiments. Further, in analysing a yeast data set, we demonstrate issues that arise when analysing real data sets. Although a probabilistic approach was recently introduced for this problem, and although parsimonious reconciliations have accuracy issues under certain settings, our parsimony framework provides a much more computationally efficient technique for this type of analysis. Our framework now allows for genome-wide scans for hybridization, while also accounting for ILS.

AB The Janzen-Connell hypothesis proposes that plant interactions with host-specific antagonists can impair the fitness of locally abundant species and thereby facilitate coexistence. However, insects and pathogens that associate with multiple hosts may mediate exclusion rather than coexistence. We employ a simulation model to examine the effect of enemy host breadth on plant species richness and defence community structure, and to assess expected diversity maintenance in example systems. Only models in which plant enemy similarity declines rapidly with defence similarity support greater species richness than models of neutral drift. In contrast, a wide range of enemy host breadths result in spatial dispersion of defence traits, at both landscape and local scales, indicating that enemy-mediated competition may increase defence-trait diversity without enhancing species richness. Nevertheless, insect and pathogen host associations in Panama and Papua New Guinea demonstrate a potential to enhance plant species richness and defence-trait diversity comparable to strictly specialised enemies.

AB Many animal species are living in urban areas, where they encounter human-altered environmental conditions. Artificial light and traffic noise are two of the most prominent anthropogenic factors, both of which potentially affect animal life. Here we studied the changes in traffic noise conditions over the morning in the urban bird habitat of the city of Seville, Spain. We tested experimentally whether noise from human activities can cause a shift in the timing of birdsong activity. Our data revealed that noise conditions vary markedly among our replicate set of twelve streets. Relatively quiet streets show low base-line amplitude levels early in the morning, with frequent events of brief noise bursts, followed by a strong rise in noise levels. Relatively noisy streets have high base-line amplitude levels from a much earlier start in the morning. Experimental exposure data revealed a noise-related earlier start of dawn singing for two out of six species: the spotless starling Sturnus unicolor and the house sparrow Passer domesticus. Our experiment did not cover earlier singing species and revealed no impact for species with more-variable starting times of the dawn singing. Our study provides more insight into the intertwinings of bird and human behavior and confirms the potential for experimental approaches to successfully tackle questions related to the impact of anthropogenic factors on animal life in cities.

AB Beach litter is an environmental, health, and economic burden around the world. Reducing or eliminating beach litter requires a sound understanding of the beach users that often produce the litter. Education has consistently been promulgated as positively influencing environmental behaviors, though this is not well-investigated for the beach environment. In this citizen science project, school children surveyed the population in their various coastal communities in Chile, garnering over 900 responses nationwide. The survey included several domains concerning the problem of beach litter: demographic profiles of beach users (including education level), their littering behavior, and their disposition and preference towards solutions. Nearly half of the participants admitted to having littered in some way while the majority of those with college or graduate school education said they never litter, significantly more than lower education groups. A vast majority of the population endorsed a fine for beach littering. Community-level environmental education (for the entire population, including litterers) was the most common solution proposed by beach users, but was significantly less popular the more often the participant self-reported littering. Based on these results it is suggested that beach managers create multifaceted and localized solutions that involve several strategies (environmental education, fines, more trash cans) and also take into account the demographic profile of the beach users (including their education level), which could influence their littering behavior and support of potential solutions.

AB South-western Australia harbours a global biodiversity hotspot on the world's most phosphorus (P)-impoverished soils. The greatest biodiversity occurs on the most severely nutrient-impoverished soils, where non-mycorrhizal species are a prominent component of the flora. Mycorrhizal species dominate where soils contain slightly more phosphorus. In addition to habitat loss and dryland salinity, a major threat to plant biodiversity in this region is eutrophication due to enrichment with P. Many plant species in the south-western Australian biodiversity hotspot are extremely sensitive to P, due to a low capability to down-regulate their phosphate-uptake capacity. Species from the most P-impoverished soils are also very poor competitors at higher P availability, giving way to more competitive species when soil P concentrations are increased. Sources of increased soil P concentrations include increased fire frequency, run-off from agricultural land, and urban activities. Another P source is the P-fertilizing effect of spraying natural environments on a landscape scale with phosphite to reduce the impacts of the introduced plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, which itself is a serious threat to biodiversity. We argue that alternatives to phosphite for P. cinnamomi management are needed urgently, and propose a strategy to work towards such alternatives, based on a sound understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms of the action of phosphite in plants that are susceptible to P. cinnamomi. The threats we describe for the south-western Australian biodiversity hotspot are likely to be very similar for other P-impoverished environments, including the fynbos in South Africa and the cerrado in Brazil.

AB Different body components are thought to trade off in their growth and development rates, but the causes for relative prioritization of any trait remains a critical question. Offspring of species at higher risk of predation might prioritize development of locomotor traits that facilitate escaping risky environments over growth of mass. We tested this possibility in 12 altricial passerine species that differed in their risk of nest predation. We found that rates of growth and development of mass, wings, and endothermy increased with nest predation risk across species. In particular, species with higher nest predation risk exhibited relatively faster growth of wings than of mass, fledged with relatively larger wing sizes and smaller mass, and developed endothermy earlier at relatively smaller mass. This differential development can facilitate both escape from predators and survival outside of the nest environment. Tarsus growth was not differentially prioritized with respect to nest predation risk, and instead all species achieved adult tarsus size by age of fledging. We also tested whether different foraging modes (aerial, arboreal, and ground foragers) might explain the variation of differential growth of locomotor modules, but we found that little residual variation was explained. Our results suggest that differences in nest predation risk among species are associated with relative prioritization of body components to facilitate escape from the risky nest environment.

AB The measurement of 'cognitive bias' has recently emerged as a powerful tool for assessing animal welfare. Cognitive bias was initially, and widely, studied in humans, and describes the way in which particular emotions are associated with biases in information processing. People suffering from clinical levels of anxiety or depression, for example, interpret ambiguous events more negatively than do non-anxious or non-depressed people. Development of methods for use with non-human animals has revealed similar biases in several species of mammals and birds, and one invertebrate. However, cognitive bias has not been previously explored in any species of non-human primate, despite specific concerns raised about the welfare of these animals in captivity. Here, we describe a touchscreen-based cognitive-bias task developed for use with captive rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Monkeys were initially trained on a 'Go/No-Go' operant task, in which they learned to touch one of two lines that differed in size in order to receive a reward (food), and to desist from touching the other line to avoid a mildly aversive stimulus (delay to the next trial and white noise). In testing sessions, the monkeys were presented with lines of intermediate size. We measured whether touchscreen responses to these ambiguous stimuli were affected by husbandry procedures (environmental enrichment, and a statutory health check involving restraint and ketamine hydrochloride injection) presumed to induce positive and negative shifts in affective state, respectively. Monkeys made fewer responses to ambiguous stimuli post health check compared to during the phase of enrichment suggesting greater expectation of negative outcomes following the health check compared to during enrichment. Shifts in affective state following standard husbandry procedures may therefore be associated with changes in information processing similar to those demonstrated in anxious and depressed humans, and in a number of other taxa.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an important role in global climate dynamics and in primary production of terrestrial ecosystems; it represents the mass and energy transfer from the land to atmosphere. Limitations to measuring ET at large scales using ground-based methods have motivated the development of satellite remote sensing techniques. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the accuracy of the SEBAL algorithm for estimating surface turbulent heat fluxes at regional scale, using 28 images from MODIS. SEBAL estimates are compared with eddy-covariance (EC) measurements and results from the hydrological model MGB-IPH. SEBAL instantaneous estimates of latent heat flux (LE) yielded r(2) = 0.64 and r(2) = 0.62 over sugarcane croplands and savannas when compared against in situ EC estimates. At the same sites, daily aggregated estimates of LE were r(2) = 0.76 and r(2) = 0.66, respectively. Energy balance closure showed that turbulent fluxes over sugarcane croplands were underestimated by 7% and 9% over savannas. Average daily ET from SEBAL is in close agreement with estimates from the hydrological model for an overlay of 38,100 km(2) (r(2) = 0.88). Inputs to which the algorithm is most sensitive are vegetation index (NDVI), gradient of temperature (dT) to compute sensible heat flux (H) and net radiation (Re). It was verified that SEBAL has a tendency to overestimate results both at local and regional scales probably because of low sensitivity to soil moisture and water stress. Nevertheless the results confirm the potential of the SEBAL algorithm, when used with MODIS images for estimating instantaneous LE and daily ET from large areas.

AB The Transylvanian Plateau in Romania is well known to host large areas of a variety of dry grassland types, still traditionally managed by low-intensity mowing or grazing. While this natural heritage is now under threat from changes in agricultural practices, the diversity of Transylvanian dry grasslands is still little understood. There is a lack of both field data sampled with standardised methods and a syntaxonomic treatment with modern statistical methods and supra-regional perspective. Therefore, the European Dry Grassland Group (EDGG) carried out its first international Research Expedition in Transylvania 2009 to study syntaxonomy, vegetation-environment relationships, and biodiversity patterns of these communities. In various locations across Transylvania, we sampled 10-m(2) vegetation plots (n = 82) and nested-plot series from 0.0001 m(2) to 100 m(2) (n = 20), including all vascular plant, bryophyte, and lichen species, as well as structural and soil data. The vegetation classification was carried out with modified TWINSPAN, followed by determination of diagnostic species with phi values and a small-scale re-assignment of releves with the aim of crispness maximisation. Both TWINSPAN and ordination revealed three major groups of syntaxa, which were matched to three orders from the class of basiphilous dry grasslands, Festuco-Brometea, represented by one alliance each: rocky dry grasslands (Stipo pulcherrimae-Festucetalia pallentis: Seslerion rigidae); xeric grasslands on deep soils (Festucetalia valesiacae: Stipion lessingianae) and meso-xeric grasslands on deep soils (Brachypodietalia pinnati: Cirsio-Brachypodion pinnati). We accepted nine association-level units plus two that potentially merit association status but were only represented by one releve each. Most of the units could be identified with one or several previously described associations. To support nomenclatural stability, we provide a nomenclatural revision and designate nomenclatural types where previously there were none. Further, we used DCA ordination and analysis of variance to determine the main environmental drivers of floristic differentiation and to determine ecological and structural differences between the vegetation types. The strongest differentiation occurred along the aridity gradient with the dense, particularly diverse stands on more or less level sites on the one hand (Brachypodietalia pinnati) and the more open, less diverse stands on steep south-facing slopes on the other end of the gradient (Stipo pulcherrimae-Festucetalia pallentis, Festucetalia valesiacae). The two xeric orders were then separated along the second DCA axis, with the Stipo pulcherrimae-Festucetalia pallentis inhabiting the stone-rich sites at higher altitudes while the Festucetalia valesiacae occur on soft, deep substrata at lower altitudes. The analysed dry grassland communities have extraordinarily high a-diversity at all spatial scales for all plants and for vascular plants, but are relatively poor in bryophytes and lichens. Some formerly mown stands of the Festuco sulcatae-Brachypodietum pinnati (Brachypodietalia pinnati) are even richer in vascular plant species than any other recorded vegetation type worldwide on the spatial scales of 0.1 m(2) (43) and 10 m(2) (98); the respective releves are documented here for the first time. Also, the beta-diversity of the grasslands was unexpectedly high, with a mean z-value of 0.275.
   Despite its limited extent, the methodological thoroughness of this study allows us to shed new light on the syntaxonomy of dry grasslands in Romania and to raise the awareness that Transylvania still hosts High Nature Value grasslands that are biodiversity hotspots at a global scale but at the same time are highly endangered through changes in agricultural practices.

AB Development of long tree-ring records is an important task in paleoclimate studies. Here we presented a five-century long reconstruction of summer (June to August) temperature based on a tree ring-width chronology of Picea brachytyla var. complanata originating from the Hengduan Mountains of China. Climate-growth response analysis showed that summer temperature was the main climatic factor limiting tree-ring growth in the study area. The reconstructed summer temperature accounted for 47.6% of the variance in actual temperature during their common period A.D. 1958-2002. Analysis of the temperature reconstruction showed that major warm periods occurred in the A.D. 1710s-1750s, 1850s, 1920s-1950s and 1990s to present, whereas cold intervals occurred in the A.D. 1630s-1680s, 1790s-1800s, 1860s-1880s and 1950s-1980s, respectively. The low-frequency variation of the reconstruction agreed fairly well with tree-ring reconstructed temperature from nearby regions and with records of glacier fluctuations in the surrounding high mountains, suggesting that our reconstructed summer temperature was reliable, and could aid in the evaluation of regional climate variability.

AB Altitudinal gradients are often used as natural laboratories to study ecosystem dynamics, biodiversity, and species' distribution response to climate gradients. However, the underlying climate gradients are rarely described in detail, especially in the tropics. In this study, we describe the diurnal and seasonal patterns in microclimate across a 3900 m altitudinal gradient in and adjacent to the Kosnipata Valley in Manu National Park, Peru, on the eastern slope of the tropical Andes. We focus on the understudied altitudinal range between 1500 and 3500 m using micrometeorological data associated with a permanent tree plot network designed to study cloud forest biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics. Data from this plot network were supplemented with data in the public domain across a 20 000 km(2) area with time series at individual sites lasting from 2 to 17 yr. Observed diurnal and seasonal trends in microclimate variables were explained by diurnal and seasonal variation in solar radiation and atmospheric moisture flux. Altitudinal trends in microclimate varied seasonally, with solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit, and temperature reaching their annual maximum earlier at higher altitudes, likely because of seasonally shifting cloud dynamics. Cloud dynamics were important in determining diurnal, seasonal, and altitudinal trends in several microclimate variables, suggesting that changes to cloud frequency and altitudinal occurrence associated with global climate change could have important impacts on cloud forest ecosystem dynamics, in addition to those of rising temperatures.

AB On average, Australia is a dry continent with many competing uses for water. Hence, there is an urgent need to know actual evapotranspiration (ETa) patterns across wide areas of agricultural and natural ecosystems, as opposed to just point measurements of ETa. The Australian Government has tasked the science agencies with operationally developing monthly and annual estimates of ETa and other hydrological variables, and with forecasting water availability over periods of days to decades, as part of its national water assessment programme. To meet these needs, Australian researchers have become leaders in developing large-area methods for estimating ETa at regional and continental scales. Ground methods include meteorological models, eddy covariance towers, sap flow sensors and catchment water balance models. Remote sensing methods use thermal infrared, mid infrared and/or vegetation indices usually combined with meteorological data to estimate ETa. Ground and remote sensing ETa estimates are assimilated into the Australian Water Resource Assessment, which issues annual estimates of the state of the continental water balance for policy and planning purposes. The best ETa models are estimated to have an error or uncertainty of 10% to 20% in Australia. Developments in Australian ETa research over the past 20 years are reviewed, and sources of error and uncertainty in current methods and models are discussed.

AB Mapping requires a meaningful generalization of information. For vegetation maps, classification is frequently used to generalize the species composition of (semi-)natural plant assemblages. As an alternative to classification, ordination methods aim to extract major floristic gradients describing the prevailing compositional variation in a floristic data set as metric variables. This ability has been used previously to derive gradient maps of homogeneous landscapes that show plant species composition in continuous fields. In the present study, gradient mapping was used in a more heterogeneous landscape with intricate environmental gradients and higher variation in vegetation physiognomy. Since established ordination methods may have difficulties to cope with the highly variable plant species composition, we tested the novel method Isometric Feature Mapping (Isomap) against conventional methods (Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling). The resulting floristic gradients were related to hyperspectral imagery (HyMap) using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and subsequently mapped. Prediction uncertainties are provided as additional map. Isomap was able to preserve 74% of the original variation inherent to the floristic data set in a three-dimensional solution. This was considerably more than the established techniques achieved. The PLSR models for the floristic gradients extracted with Isomap showed model fits ranging from R-2 = 0.59 to R-2 = 0.73 in calibration and from R-2 = 0.55 to R-2 = 0.69 in tenfold cross-validation. The resulting gradient map provides detailed information on compositional vegetation patterns. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Invasive species have transformed local, regional and global biotas; however, few generalities about the mechanisms driving impacts of invaders have emerged. To explain variation in impacts among studies, we propose a broad framework that separates drivers of impacts into universal and unique attributes of the invasive species and the invaded habitat. Universal attributes are relevant to all invasions whereas unique attributes are distinct to a specific invasion. For example, impacts associated with the abundance of any invader or the properties of a specific invader (e.g., a rare toxin) represent a universal and unique impact attribute. Through meta-analyses of aquatic field experiments, we demonstrate the utility of our framework, documenting that both the abundance and the taxonomic identity of the invader significantly influence invasion outcomes for marine and freshwater plant and animal invaders. Our review also highlights that many more experiments are needed to test for universal attributes, such as priority effects, age and size, and how the attributes of the invaded habitat further modify invasion impacts. We hope that our framework will stimulate experimental invasion ecology and begin to reconcile the idiosyncrasies that currently impede the development of a unified framework for invasion impacts.

AB Adaptive Management (AM) is widely advocated as an approach to dealing with uncertainty in natural resource management as it provides an explicit framework for motivating, designing and interpreting the results of monitoring. One of the major factors impeding implementation is the failure to use appropriate process models; a core element of AM. Process models represent beliefs about the properties and dynamics of an ecological system and ecosystem responses to management. Quantitative models of ecosystem response help resolve ambiguity about the efficacy of management and facilitate iterative updating of knowledge using monitoring data. We report on the use of a state-and-transition model (STM) in the Adaptive Management of native woodland vegetation in south-eastern Australia. The STM is implemented as a Bayesian network, making it simple to communicate and update with new data as they arise. Application of the model is demonstrated using case-study and simulation data. We show how the model may be used to predict the probability of achieving desirable state transitions at restoration sites and how monitoring of those sites can be used to update the model (learn) and adapt (review restoration strategies). After just one monitoring/learning cycle, 7 years after the first investments, we found that updated models predict markedly different transition probabilities compared with initial models based on expert opinion. This has strong implications for the apparent cost-efficiency of restoration strategies. The STM approach provides a sound theoretical basis for restoration decisions, while the Bayesian network implementation provides a workable framework for using the STM adaptively.

AB Monitoring changes in population levels of a wide range of species in biodiversity research and conservation requires practical, easy-to-use and efficient assessment and monitoring methods. Dragonflies (Insecta: Odonata) are a valuable tool for assessing aquatic systems and have been used as indicators of ecological health, ecological integrity, and environmental change, including climatic change, as well as indicators of habitat recovery. We field-tested a freshwater ecological integrity index, the Dragonfly Biotic Index (DBI), based on dragonfly assemblages at the local scale, and compared the DBI to a biodiversity index (average taxonomic distinctness. AvTD) as well as to a standard freshwater benthic macroinvertebrate-based freshwater health index (South African Scoring System, using Average Score Per Taxon, ASPT). We sampled 20 river sites, selected a priori. Adult dragonflies and benthic macroinvertebrates were collected using standardized methods. Environmental variables were collected in situ, and water samples taken. Temperature and pH were the most important physical environmental variables in explaining the assemblage structure, and we found significant abiotic-biotic relationships, as well as biotic-biotic relationships. Overall, dragonflies were more sensitive to changes in river condition than were macroinvertebrates, in part because they were responding at the species rather than higher taxonomic level. AvTD scores did not show any significant relationship with changes in river condition. Furthermore, sites with low biotic scores (indicating disturbance) had high AvTD values. In contrast, DBI site value and ASPT scores were highly significantly correlated. We conclude that dragonfly assemblages in the form of a DBI are an excellent tool for environmental assessment and monitoring freshwater biodiversity, with the potential to replace labour-intensive benthic macroinvertebrate-based freshwater quality assessments, such as SASS.

AB The notion of ecosystem health has been widely adopted in environmental policy, particularly in the management of river systems. Despite this, even a notional understanding of ecosystem health and its assessment in connected aquifer ecosystems remains elusive. In this article, we propose a definition and provide a tiered framework for the assessment of ecosystem health in groundwater. From the literature we identify general attributes of a healthy groundwater ecosystem and from these develop primary (Tier 1) indicators of health. Where Tier 1 benchmarks are exceeded or more detailed assessment is required, we discuss a range of indicators (Tier 2) that may together generate a multimetric index of groundwater health. Our case study using samples from an alluvial aquifer in north-western New South Wales, Australia, demonstrates the utility of both tiers of the framework, and the ability of the approach to separate disturbed and undisturbed sites. The process of multimetric development is simple and our Tier 2 benchmarks determined from limited data. Nevertheless, our framework will be applicable and readily adaptable to site-specific contexts.

AB Questions: What is the current distribution of pine and oak species along environmental gradients in southern Spain? Do pine and oak regeneration niches differ from the environmental niches of adults? Is oak species regeneration favoured under the canopy of pine forests?
   Location: Forest areas of Andalusia (similar to 87 600km(2), southern Spain).
   Methods: We compiled extensive forest inventory data to explore differences in abundance (basal area, m(2) ha(-1)) patterns of adults (dbh > 7.4 cm) and regeneration (dbh <= 7.4 cm) of five pine and five oak species. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and generalized linear models were applied to explore species-environment relationships along climatic, edaphic, topographic and fire-frequency gradients.
   Results: Both pines and oaks segregated along complex environmental gradients, with pines generally dominating in more severe (colder and drier) environments, while oaks dominated in milder, wetter winter areas. In 40-55% of mature pine stands there was a lack of regeneration in the understorey, while in two oak species (Q. suber and Q. canariensis) 70% of stands did not show regeneration. Pine recruits were found at a higher frequency and abundance under the canopy of their congeners, whereas some oaks (Q. ilex) had greater regeneration under mixed pine-oak canopies.
   Conclusions: Climatic limitations and soil properties partly explained the regional distribution of pines and oaks. We found evidence for an upward shift of Q. ilex recruits towards areas with colder conditions in pine forests, which could be explained by a possible facilitative effect of the pine canopy on seedling establishment.

AB When ejaculates from rival males compete for fertilization, there is strong selection for sperm traits that enhance fertilization success. Sperm quantity is one such trait, and numerous studies have demonstrated a positive association between sperm competition and both testes size and the number of sperm available for copulations. Sperm competition is also thought to favor increases in sperm quality and changes in testicular morphology that lead to increased sperm production. However, in contrast to sperm quantity, these hypotheses have received considerably less empirical support and remain somewhat controversial. In a comparative study using the Australian Maluridae (fairy-wrens, emu-wrens, grasswrens), we tested whether increasing levels of sperm competition were associated with increases in both sperm quantity and quality, as well as an increase in the relative amount of seminiferous tubule tissue contained within the testes. After controlling for phylogeny, we found positive associations between sperm competition and sperm numbers, both in sperm reserves and in ejaculate samples. Additionally, as sperm competition level increased, the proportion of testicular spermatogenic tissue also increased, suggesting that sperm competition selects for greater sperm production per unit of testicular tissue. Finally, we also found that sperm competition level was positively associated with multiple sperm quality traits, including the proportion of motile sperm in ejaculates and the proportion of both viable and morphologically normal sperm in sperm reserves. These results suggest multiple ejaculate traits, as well as aspects of testicular morphology, have evolved in response to sperm competition in the Australian Maluridae. Furthermore, our findings emphasize the importance of postcopulatory sexual selection as an evolutionary force shaping macroevolutionary differences in sperm phenotype.

AB We have determined the photosynthetic production of dissolved (DOCp) and particulate organic carbon (POCp) along a longitudinal transect in the Mediterranean Sea during the summer stratification period. The euphotic layer-integrated rates of DOCp and POCp ranged between approximately 50-130 and 95-210 mgC m(-2) d(-1), respectively, and showed an east to west increasing trend. For the whole transect, the relative contribution of DOCp to total, euphotic layer-integrated primary production (percentage of extracellular release, PER) averaged similar to 37% and did not show any clear longitudinal pattern. In spite of the relatively high PER values, the measured DOCp rates were much lower than the estimated bacterial carbon demand, suggesting a small degree of coupling between phytoplankton exudation and bacterial metabolism. Our results, when compared with previous measurements obtained with the same methods in several ecosystems of contrasting productivity, support the view that the relative importance of DOCp increases under strong nutrient limitation.

AB Ecosystem service is an emerging concept that grows to be a hot research area in ecology. Spatially explicit ecosystem service values are important for ecosystem service management. However, it is difficult to quantify ecosystem services. Remote sensing provides images covering Earth surface, which by nature are spatially explicit. Thus, remote sensing can be useful for quantitative assessment of ecosystem services. This paper reviews spatially explicit ecosystem service studies conducted in ecology and remote sensing in order to find out how remote sensing can be used for ecosystem service assessment. Several important areas considered include land cover, biodiversity, and carbon, water and soil related ecosystem services. We found that remote sensing can be used for ecosystem service assessment in three different ways: direct monitoring, indirect monitoring, and combined use with ecosystem models. Some plant and water related ecosystem services can be directly monitored by remote sensing. Most commonly, remote sensing can provide surrogate information on plant and soil characteristics in an ecosystem. For ecosystem process related ecosystem services, remote sensing can help measure spatially explicit parameters. We conclude that acquiring good in-situ measurements and selecting appropriate remote sensor data in terms of resolution are critical for accurate assessment of ecosystem services.

AB Historic events such as the uplift of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (Q-T Plateau) and climatic oscillations in the Quaternary period greatly affected the evolution and modern distribution of Sino-Tibetan flora. Stellera chamaejasme, a perennial herb with flower color polymorphism that is distributed from the mountainous southeastern Q-T Plateau (Hengduan Mountains, H-D Mountains) to the vast platform of the Q-T Plateau and the adjacent plain of northern China, provides an excellent model to explore the effects of historic events on the origination and variation of species. In this study, we conducted a phylogenetic and phylogeographical study using three chloroplast sequences (trnT-L, trnL-F and rpL16) in 26 populations of S. chamaejasme and 12 outgroups from the Thymeleaceae. Phylogenetic analysis and molecular clock estimation revealed that the monophyletic origin of S. chamaejasme occurred ca. 6.5892 Ma, which is consistent with the radical environment changes caused by the rapid uplift of the Q-T Plateau ca. 7 Ma. Intra-specific differentiation of S. chamaejasme is estimated to have occurred after ca. 2.1 Ma. Twelve haplotypes were revealed from combined trnL-F and rpL16 sequences. High genetic diversity (h(T)=0.834) and population differentiation (N-ST = 0.997 and G(ST) = 0.982) imply restricted gene flow among populations and significant geographical or environmental isolation. All populations from the vast plain of northern China were dominated by one haplotype (H1), and the same haplotype was fixed in most populations from the high elevation platform of the western and northern Q-T Plateau. In contrast, the majority of the haplotypes were found in the relatively narrow area of the H-D Mountains, in the southeastern distribution of S. chamaejasme. The contrasting haplotype distribution patterns suggested that the H-D Mountains were either a refugium for S. chamaejasme during the Quaternary climatic oscillations or a diversification center of this species. The present wide distribution of this species on the Q-T Plateau platform and in northern China is likely to have resulted from a rapid post-glacial population expansion from the southeastern refugium involving founder effects, facilitated by the adjacent geographic range with a similar grassland habitat.

AB 1. Pollen-mediated gene flow from ecological core populations may hamper the ability of populations to invade new, closely adjacent habitats. The potential for the invasion of a new habitat is enhanced when selection against immigrants is augmented by the elevation of self-fertilization. This shift imparts a measure of reproductive isolation to the invader.
   2. Whereas genetically mediated changes in selfing often accompany niche shifts in plants, the elevation of self-fertilization by plastic responses to novel, stressful, environments has not been explored. Here I will show that invaders of novel habitats may have elevated levels of self-fertility mediated by alterations in floral form and self-compatibility.
   3. Heightened selfing facilitates the evolution of local adaptation by increasing the additive genetic variance for tolerance to the new habitat. Heightened selfing also facilitates local adaptation by increasing reproductive assurance.
   4. Elevated levels of selfing based on developmental responses are immediate, as opposed to that obtained by multigenerational selection.
   5. Synthesis. The likelihood of a niche shift will be substantially enhanced if the invader is protected from the swamping effect of gene flow from a nearby core population. This protection may be afforded by an environment-induced elevation of self-fertility. The likelihood of a niche shift also is enhanced by an increase in reproductive assurance which may be vital to the survival of an invading population whose reproductive success is density-dependent.

AB P>1. The core assumption of neutral theory is that all individuals in a community have equal fitness regardless of species, and regardless of the species composition of the community. But, real communities consist of species exhibiting large trait differences; hence these differences must be subject to perfect fitness-equalizing trade-offs for neutrality to hold.
   2. Here we explain that perfect equalizing trade-offs are extremely unlikely to occur in reality, because equality of fitness among species is destroyed by: (i) any deviation in the functional form of the trade-off away from the one special form that gives equal fitness; (ii) spatial or temporal variation in performance; (iii) random species differences in performance.
   3. In the absence of the density-dependent processes stressed by traditional niche-based community ecology, communities featuring small amounts of (i) or (ii) rapidly lose trait variation, becoming dominated by species with similar traits, and exhibit substantially lower species richness compared to the neutral case. Communities featuring random interspecific variation in traits (iii) lose all but a few fortuitous species.
   4. Thus neutrality should be viewed, a priori, as a highly improbable explanation for the long-term co-occurrence of measurably different species within ecological communities. In contrast, coexistence via niche structure and density dependence, is robust to species differences in baseline fitness, and so remains plausible.
   5. We conclude that: (i) co-occurring species will typically exhibit substantial differences in baseline fitness even when (imperfect) equalizing trade-offs have been taken into account; (ii) therefore, communities must be strongly niche structured, otherwise they would lose both trait variation and species richness; (iii) nonetheless, even in strongly niche-structured communities, it is possible that the abundance of species with similar traits are at least partially free to drift.

AB Aim
   To determine if it is possible to generate analytically derived regionalizations for multiple groups of European plants and animals and to explore potential influences on the regions for each taxonomic group.
   Location
   Europe.
   Methods
   We subjected range maps of trees, butterflies, reptiles, amphibians, birds and mammals to k-means clustering followed by v-fold cross-validation to determine the pattern and number of regions (clusters). We then used the mean range sizes of species in each group as a correlate of the number of regions obtained for each taxon, and climate and species richness gradients as correlates of the spatial arrangement of the group-specific regions. We also included the pattern of tree clusters as a predictor of animal clusters in order to test the 'habitat templet' concept as an explanation of animal distribution patterns.
   Results
   Spatially coherent clusters were found for all groups. The number of regions ranged from three to eight and was strongly associated with the mean range sizes of the species in each taxon. The cluster patterns of all groups were associated with various combinations of climate, underlying species richness gradients and, in the case of animals, the arrangement of tree clusters, although the rankings of the correlates differed among groups. In four of five groups the tree pattern was the strongest single predictor of the animal cluster patterns.
   Main conclusions
   Despite a long history of human disturbance and habitat modification, the European biota retains a discernable biogeographic structure. The primary driver appears to be aspects of climate related to water-energy balance, which also influence richness gradients. For many animals, the underlying habitat structure, as measured by tree distributions, appears to have a strong influence on their biogeographic structure, highlighting the need to preserve natural forest formations if we want to preserve the historical signal found in geographic distributions.

AB Species delimitation detected by molecular markers is complicated by introgression and incomplete lineage sorting between species. Recent modeling suggests that fixed genetic differences between species are highly related to rates of intraspecific gene flow. However, it remains unclear whether such differences are due to high levels of intraspecific gene flow overriding the spread of introgressed alleles or favoring rapid lineage sorting between species. In pines, chloroplast (cp) and mitochondrial (mt) DNAs are normally paternally and maternally inherited, respectively, and thus their relative rates of intraspecific gene flow are expected to be high and low, respectively. In this study, we used two pine species with overlapping geographical distributions in southeast China, P. massoniana and P. hwangshanensis, as a model system to examine the association between organelle gene flow and variation within and between species. We found that cpDNA variation across these two pine species is more species specific than mtDNA variation and almost delimits taxonomic boundaries. The shared mt/cp DNA genetic variation between species shows no bias in regard to parapatric versus allopatric species' distributions. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that high intraspecific gene flow has accelerated cpDNA lineage sorting between these two pine species.

AB English yew (Taxus baccata L, Taxaceae), a Tertiary relict, provides a seminal example of a widespread albeit locally endangered (often close to extinction) tree species. In order to gain detailed insights into the evolutionary dynamics of the species on a broad geographical scale, over 1000 trees from 91 populations of English yew in the western Mediterranean were analyzed using seven nuclear microsatellite markers. Our results revealed contrasting patterns of genetic structure at different spatial scales: genetic variation was highly structured at the local scale, while only a low proportion of the observed variation was attributed to regional differences. We also found a geographic gradient of decreasing diversity and increasing population divergence from northwest (central Europe and northern Iberian Peninsula) to southeast (Mediterranean Iberia and North Africa). The patterns revealed in this study probably reflect the combined effects of Quaternary climatic changes and recent impact of human activities, and potentially also more ancient events dating back to the Tertiary. Both climatic and anthropogenic factors seem to have conducted to a long history of population isolation, which may have contributed significantly to enhance population divergence through restricted gene flow and genetic drift.

AB Hawksbill sea turtles, Eretmochelys imbricata, are closely associated with coral reef and other hard-bottom habitats. Seagrass pastures are peripheral habitats for Caribbean hawksbills. With the decline in quality and quantity of coral reefs, seagrass habitats may become more important for hawksbills. We use data from a 30-year mark-recapture study of hawksbills and green turtles, Chelonia mydas, in the southern Bahamas to assess the quality of a seagrass habitat for hawksbills. Size distribution, residence times, and body condition index for the seagrass hawksbill aggregation are similar to those of hawksbill aggregations over Caribbean reefs. Somatic growth rates of seagrass hawksbills are in the upper range of those reported for reef hawksbills. Based on these parameters, peripheral seagrass habitats can support healthy, productive hawksbill aggregations. During the 30-year study, a sixfold variation in green turtle density in the study area did not affect the productivity or body condition of hawksbills.

AB Aim
   To test whether bird assemblages are shifting upwards in their elevational distribution in synchrony with current climate warming and/or habitat changes.
   Location
   A gradient of elevation in the Italian Alps (Alta Valsessera, Piedmont).
   Methods
   We used data from two recent atlas surveys performed on a 1 x 1 km grid at an 11-year interval (1992-94 and 2003-05). We modelled the elevational gradient of avifaunal composition, using a sample-based approach, in an effort to detect evidence for an upward elevational shift of bird zonation. Changes in species richness were controlled for. The results from this analysis were compared with those obtained using a species-based approach. Changes in climate and landscape between the two surveys were assessed using local meteorological data and Corine Land Cover maps, respectively.
   Results
   We detected small avifaunal changes between the two surveys: (1) mean elevations increased for the majority of species, but the average change was not significantly different from zero; (2) the species richness increased, but this was mainly due to an increase in sampling effort; and (3) a change in species composition was detected, which was at the limit of significance and corresponded on average to a 29-m upward elevational shift in the distribution of the avifauna. The shift was the same for open land and forest bird communities. During the same period, the mean temperature increased by c. 1 degrees C in the area, and a slight trend towards vegetation closure by woody plants was detected.
   Main conclusions
   The use of fine-scale breeding bird atlases in mountainous regions, together with ordination methods, provides a sensitive tool to test and measure elevational shifts in species ranges, but the results have to be interpreted carefully. In our case, the observed elevational shift in the distributions of the avifauna cannot unambiguously be attributed to climate warming. This shift is smaller than expected from the regional increase in temperature, which raises the question of how closely bird distributions match climate change.

AB P>1. Senescence (or 'ageing') is a widespread and important process in wild animal populations, but variation in ageing patterns within and between species is poorly understood.
   2. In cooperatively breeding species, the costs of reproduction are shared between breeders and one or more helpers. The effects of ageing in breeders may therefore be moderated by the presence of helpers, but there have been very few studies of senescence patterns in natural populations of cooperative breeders.
   3. Here, we use 13 years of data from a long-term study population of wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta) to investigate age-related changes in several traits known to be key components of reproductive success in females of this species.
   4. Four of the six traits studied exhibited significant declines with age, indicating senescence. Litter size, the number of litters produced per year and the number of pups that survived to emergence from the natal burrow per year all increased with female age up to a peak at c. 4 years, and declined steeply thereafter; the mean pup weight at emergence in a given litter declined steadily from age zero.
   5. These results provide the first evidence of reproductive senescence in a wild population of a cooperatively breeding vertebrate. Breeding success declined with age despite the sharing of reproductive costs in this species, but further study is needed to investigate whether helping affects other aspects of senescence, including survival.

AB The identification of functional traits critical to plant responses to the environment promotes our understanding of assembly of communities which relies on environmental filtering. However, the recent trait-community approaches mostly ignore the influence of plant-plant interactions by mainly focusing on traits related to abiotic filtering processes. The conceptual framework we propose aims to clarify how the functional diversity of communities depends on the filtering effect of competition on relevant traits. We define two types of competition-related traits: competitive effect traits reflect the changes in local resources levels due to plant activity while competitive response traits are related to plant response to these resource depletions. We then suggest that the contribution of both types of competition-related traits to functional diversity depends on the importance of competition, previously defined as the effect of competition on plant fitness relative to that of other environmental factors. Therefore, the divergence of functional diversity is predicted to be maximized at intermediate levels of competition in relation to the coexistence of species with different strategies characterized by highly contrasted values of competition-related traits.

TI Measuring the importance of competition in plant communities
SO JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE competition; competition coefficient; population dynamics; population
   growth rate; stochastic model
ID DYNAMICS; DEPENDENCE; GROWTH
AB Plant ecologists have developed numerous ways to measure competition and to rank the effects of competition relative to other factors. According to one line of logic, there is an important distinction between competitive intensity (broadly, the absolute, proximate effects on individuals) and the importance of competition (loosely, the relative effects on ecological or evolutionary processes).
   It has been argued recently that there is a great deal of confusion in the literature regarding these concepts. We agree and suggest that this arose because of loose logic in the initial formulation, and that this has been perpetuated and exacerbated in recent critiques.
   Using a simple example, we argue that recent analyses have generated new problems because of a failure to measure importance in terms of individual fitness (defined in an evolutionary sense) or per capita rates of population change. Only when calculated in this way can importance be measured relative to all other processes in the life cycle.
   It is not possible to directly measure the importance of competition from short-term experiments that last less than one generation, using data from artificial conditions, or using data from glasshouse experiments.
   Too often researchers use the term 'importance' without stating clearly what this is measured with respect to. We highlight, for example, that importance could be measured for population growth rate, community composition or community invasibility and that the appropriate measure would differ in each case.
   Synthesis. We ask whether a single index of importance is really useful in plant ecology. The concept focuses on index-based measures of competition using experimental data, narrowly concentrating on comparing two theories of plant competition. In the rest of the ecological world, researchers are using model-based analyses of field data and increasingly sophisticated fitting techniques to dissect out the various processes determining the dynamics of single and interacting populations and making a great deal of progress. It is obviously very useful to disentangle the effects of competition at different stages in the life cycle and to determine how these vary along environmental gradients. However, the measure of competition and the measure of importance should be tailored to the question being addressed.

AB Cores from South Africa assigned to the "Victoria West" industry have long been purported as a "proto-Levallois" core form, and thus regarded as ancestral to the Levallois prepared core technologies of the Middle Paleolithic and African Middle Stone Age. Similarities in form between Victoria West cores, in terms of surface morphology and the removal of large flakes from a prepared surface, led to hypothesized schemes of technological evolution from Victoria West cores through to fully developed Levallois cores. However, the phylogenetic basis of this Victoria West "proto-Levallois" hypothesis, and the assumptions of phylogenetic homology upon which it rests, have never been tested formally. In recent years, archaeologists have begun to use phylogenetic methods drawn from biology to test hypotheses of technological and cultural evolution. Here, the phylogenetic assumptions of the Victoria West "proto-Levallois" hypothesis are tested directly using a cladistic (maximum parsimony) protocol. The cladistic analyses indicate that Victoria West cores are not the basal sister taxon of a Levallois clade, as predicted by the proto-Levallois hypothesis. Moreover, character analyses demonstrate that several characters relating to core surfaces and flake scar morphology are not phylogenetically homologous, but result from convergent technological evolution within the Acheulean techno-complex. Post hoc analyses further determine that these results are not confounded by choice of outgroup or raw material factors. The results were also shown to be robust on the basis of the ensemble retention index statistic, bootstrap analyses, and permutation tests, Hence, it is concluded that Victoria West cores do not represent a "proto-Levallois" core form, and that the term "para-Levallois" should more correctly be applied on phylogenetic grounds. It is further argued that even in cases where different technologies are found to share phylogenetically homologous features, use of the term "proto" is questionable on theoretical grounds.

AB Quantification of feeding rates and selectivity of zooplankton is vital for understanding the mechanisms structuring marine ecosystems. However, methodological limitations have made many of these studies difficult. Recently, molecular based methods have demonstrated that DNA from prey species can be used to identify zooplankton gut contents, and further, quantitative gut content estimates by quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays targeted to the 18S rRNA gene have been used to estimate feeding rates in appendicularians and copepods. However, while standard single primer based qPCR assays were quantitative for the filter feeding appendicularian Oikopleura dioica, feeding rates were consistently underestimated in the copepod Calanus finmarchicus. In this study, we test the hypothesis that prey DNA is rapidly digested after ingestion by copepods and describe a qPCR-based assay, differential length amplification qPCR (dla-qPCR), to account for DNA digestion. The assay utilizes multiple primer sets that amplify different sized fragments of the prey 18S rRNA gene and, based on the differential amplification of these fragments, the degree of digestion is estimated and corrected for. Application of this approach to C. finmarchicus fed Rhodomonas marina significantly improved quantitative feeding estimates compared to standard qPCR. The development of dla-qPCR represents a significant advancement towards a quantitative method for assessing in situ copepod feeding rates without involving cultivation-based manipulation.

AB We present a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the influence of altitude on plant phenology over an area, delimited by 46 to 49 degrees N latitude and 5 to 15 degrees E longitude, that includes major parts of the Alpine region for the period 1971-2000. Our attention is focused on flowering of widely distributed plants in Europe, including some important allergenic species. We calculated the dependence of phenological mean dates on altitude for different phenophases as a linear regression. Results show a statistically significant linear dependence (p < 0.0001) for each phenophase, with regression coefficients that range from 0.92 +/- 0.21 d (100 m)(-1) altitude for beginning of flowering of Norway spruce to 4.56 +/- 0.21 d (100 m)(-1) for beginning of flowering of common hazel. Phenological temporal trends and thermal temporal trends show a less strong dependence on altitude, predominantly non-significant. The most significant regression coefficients are negative for phenological trends (beginning of flowering of common alder, -0.065 +/- 0.028 d yr(-1) (100 m)(-1), p = 0.0187, and Norway spruce, -0.049 +/- 0.020 d yr(-1) (100 m)(-1), p = 0.0167) and positive for temperature trends (February, 0.0017 degrees C yr(-1) (100 m)(-1), p < 0.0001). The significant linear dependence of February temperature trends on altitude induces an inverse significant linear dependence for phenological trends of flowering of common alder (occurring in March). The prevalence of negative mean phenological trends suggests a stronger advance of flowering phases at higher altitude. Finally, a regional analysis suggests a tendency towards a stronger altitudinal response in the northern than in the southern Alps.

AB Monitoring patterns of fauna diversity across the landscape, both spatially and temporally, presents special challenges due to the dynamic nature of populations and complex interactions with the local and regional environment. One area where progress is being made is the development of relationships between regional biodiversity with indirect indicators or surrogates, such as vegetative production. in this paper we discuss implementation of a dynamic habitat index, originally developed in Australia, to Canadian conditions. The index, based on the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) absorbed by vegetation, a variable which is analogous to green vegetation cover, is derived solely from satellite data. The index utilizes time series of satellite observations of greenness to derive three indicators of the underlying vegetation dynamics; the cumulative annual greenness, the minimum level of perennial cover, and the degree of vegetation seasonality. We apply the index across Canada and compare the three components by ecozones, demonstrating that Canada's terrestrial environment can effectively be clustered into five major dynamic habitat regimes. These range from those with low cumulative greenness and highly seasonal variation in cover, to regimes which have high canopy light absorbance with limited seasonality and continuous annual green cover. By comparing data from multiple years, our analysis indicates that a number of these ecozones have experienced changes in their composition over the past 6 years. We believe this methodology can provide an initial stratification of large areas for biodiversity monitoring and can be used to focus finer scale approaches to specific regions of interest or monitor regions too remote for comprehensive field surveys.

AB Crop landraces are managed populations that evolve in response to gene flow and selection. Cross-pollination among fields, seed sharing by farmers, and selection by management and environmental conditions play roles in shaping crop characteristics. We used common gardens to explore the local adaptation of maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) landrace populations from Chiapas, Mexico to altitude. We sowed seeds of 21 populations from three altitudinal ranges in two common gardens and measured two characteristics that estimate fitness: likelihood of producing good quality seed and the total mass of good quality seed per plant. The probability of lowland plants producing good quality seed was invariably high regardless of garden, while highland landraces were especially sensitive to altitude. Their likelihood of producing good seed quadrupled in the highland site. The mass of good quality seed showed a different pattern, with lowland landraces producing 25% less seed mass than the other types at high elevations. Combining these two measures of fitness revealed that the highland landraces were clearly adapted to highland sites, while lowland and midland landraces appear more adapted to the midland site. We discuss this asymmetry in local adaptation in light of climate change and in situ conservation of crop genetic resources.

AB In strongly seasonal environments, the timing of birth can have important fitness consequences. We investigated which factors affect parturition date and how birthdate interacts with sex, maternal characteristics and environmental variables to affect the growth and survival of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) lambs in a marked population in Alberta. Over 14 years, the estimated birthdate of 216 lambs ranged from 21 May to 18 July. Parturition date was heritable and genetically correlated with maternal mass the previous fall. Weaning a lamb delayed parturition the following year by about 7 days. Birthdate did not affect summer growth rate, but late-born lambs were lighter in mid September (the approximate time of weaning) than early-born ones. Birthdate did not affect survival to weaning, but late birth decreased survival to 1 year for male lambs. Forage quality, measured by fecal crude protein, did not affect survival to 1 year. Once we accounted for lamb mass in mid September, birthdate no longer affected the probability of survival, suggesting that late birth decreased survival by shortening a lamb's growing season. Because there was no compensatory summer growth, late-born lambs were smaller than early-born ones at the onset of winter. Our data highlight the importance of birthdate on life history traits and suggest that resource scarcity had more severe consequences for juvenile males than for females.

AB Previous studies have attempted to assess the reproductive benefits of polyandry in mammals but have failed to account for variation in mating frequency across experimental treatments. Recently, it has been shown that multiply sired litters are common in natural populations of house mice, suggesting that female mice are actively polyandrous and sperm competition occurs in this species. Here we show that female house mice mated to 3 males (polyandry) had greater postbirth pup survival than females mated 3 times to the same male (monandry). Remote behavioral observations revealed that copulation frequency did not differ across our experimental treatments. We discuss this result with reference to genetic benefit hypotheses for the evolution of polyandry. Furthermore, by genotyping parents and offspring in the polyandrous treatment, we assessed which male reproductive traits contributed to paternity. We found that the first principal component describing variation in 10 male reproductive variables explained a significant proportion of the variation in paternity when males were second to mate. This component was weighted predominantly by measures of sperm length, suggesting that males with short sperm may be more successful when engaging in a disfavored role of sperm competition.

AB Patterns of spatial autocorrelation of biota and distributional similarity (concordance) between assemblages of different organism groups have important implications in both theoretical ecology and biodiversity conservation. Here we report environmental gradients and spatial distribution patterns of taxonomic composition among stream fish, benthic macroinvertebrate, and diatom assemblages along a fragmented stream in south-western France. We quantified spatial patterns of lotic assemblage structure along this stream, and we tested for concordance in distribution patterns among the three taxonomic groups. Our results showed that both environmental characteristics and stream assemblages were spatially autocorrelated. For stream fish and diatom assemblages, these patterns reflected assemblage changes along the longitudinal stream gradient, whereas environmental variables and benthic macroinvertebrates exhibited a more patchy spatial pattern. Cross-taxa concordance was significant between stream fish and diatoms, and between stream fish and benthic macroinvertebrates. The assemblage concordance between stream fish and diatoms could be attributed to similar responses along the longitudinal gradient, whereas those between stream fish and benthic macroinvertebrates may result from biotic interactions. Based on potential dispersal capacities of taxa, our results validated the hypotheses that weakly dispersing taxa exhibit greater concordance than highly dispersing ones and that dispersal capacities affect how taxonomic groups respond to their local environment. Both diatoms and highly dispersing stream fish were affected by stream fragmentation (i.e. the number of dams between sites), while the effect of fragmentation was not significant for invertebrates that fly well in their adult stage, thus emphasizing the importance of the way of dispersal. These results suggest that addressing the effects of dispersal capacity on stream assemblage patterns is crucial to identifying mechanisms behind patterns and to better understanding the determinants of stream biodiversity.

AB Dendrobium officinale is a critically endangered perennial herb endemic to China. Determining the levels of genetic diversity and patterns of population genetic structure of this species would assist in its conservation and management. Data of 12 populations were used to assess its genetic diversity and population structure, employing the method of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). A high level of genetic diversity was detected (H-E = 0.269) with POPGENE. As revealed by AMOVA analysis, there was moderate variation between pairs of populations with Phi(ST) values ranging from 0.047 to 0.578 and on average 26.97% of the genetic variation occurred among populations. Three main clusters were shown in UPGMA dendrogram using TFPGA, which is consistent with the result of principal coordinate ananlysis (PCO) using NTSYS. Keeping a stable environment is critical for the in situ conservation and management of this rare and endangered plant, and for ex situ conservation it is important to design an integrated germplasm bank.

AB Southern Siberian mountain ranges encompass strong climatic contrasts from the relatively oceanic northern foothills to strongly continental intermountain basins in the south. Landscape-scale climatic differences create vegetation patterns, which are analogous to the broad-scale vegetation zonation over large areas of northern Eurasia. In their southern, continental areas, these mountains harbour forest types which potentially resemble the full-glacial forests recently reconstructed for Central Europe. To identify forest vegetation-environment relationships in the southern Siberian mountain ranges, forest vegetation of the Western Sayan Mountains was sampled on a 280 km transect running from the northern foothills with oceanic climatic features to the continental Central Tuvinian Basin in the south. Based on the species composition, vegetation was classified into hemiboreal forests, occurring at drier and summer-warm sites with high-pH soil, and taiga, occurring at wetter, summer-cool sites with acidic soil. Hemiboreal forests included Betula pendula-Pinus sylvestris mesic forest, Larix sibirica dry forest and Pinus sylvestris dry forest. Taiga included Abies sibirica-Betula pendula wet forest, Abies sibirica-Pinus sibirica mesic forest and Pinus sibirica-Picea obovata continental forest. Hemiboreal forests were richer in vascular plant species, while taiga was richer in ground-dwelling cryptogams. Vegetation-environment relationships were analysed by indirect and direct ordination. Winter and summer temperatures and precipitation exerted a dominant influence on species composition. Soil pH was also an important correlate of species composition, but this factor itself was probably controlled by precipitation. At a more local scale, the main source of variation in species composition was topography, producing landscape patterns of contrasting plant communities on slopes of different aspects and valley bottoms. The response of tree species to major environmental factors was expressed with Huisman-Olff-Fresco models. Larix sibirica appeared to be most resistant to drought and winter frosts, Pinus sibirica was adapted to low temperatures both in winter and summer, and Picea obovata had an intermediate response to climate. Betula pendula, Pinus sylvestris and Populus tremula were associated with the warmest sites with intermediate precipitation, while Abies sibirica was the most moisture-demanding species, sensitive to deep winter frosts.

AB The localization of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) refugia is crucial information to understand a species' history and predict its reaction to future climate changes. However, many phylogeographical studies often lack sampling designs intensive enough to precisely localize these refugia. The hairy land snail Trochulus villosus has a small range centred on Switzerland, which could be intensively covered by sampling 455 individuals from 52 populations. Based on mitochondrial DNA sequences (COI and 16S), we identified two divergent lineages with distinct geographical distributions. Bayesian skyline plots suggested that both lineages expanded at the end of the LGM. To find where the origin populations were located, we applied the principles of ancestral character reconstruction and identified a candidate refugium for each mtDNA lineage: the French Jura and Central Switzerland, both ice-free during the LGM. Additional refugia, however, could not be excluded, as suggested by the microsatellite analysis of a population subset. Modelling the LGM niche of T. villosus, we showed that suitable climatic conditions were expected in the inferred refugia, but potentially also in the nunataks of the alpine ice shield. In a model selection approach, we compared several alternative recolonization scenarios by estimating the Akaike information criterion for their respective maximum-likelihood migration rates. The 'two refugia' scenario received by far the best support given the distribution of genetic diversity in T. villosus populations. Provided that fine-scale sampling designs and various analytical approaches are combined, it is possible to refine our necessary understanding of species responses to environmental changes.

AB Following the creation of new land surfaces, there is in initial build-up phase of ecosystem development, but after a prolonged absence of major disturbance a retrogressive (decline) phase often follows due to reduced nutrient availability over time. Although many studies have considered how the soil community changes during the build-up phase, the response of this community to the retrogressive phase is poorly known. We measured litter and soil communities of microfauna and macrofauna along the Franz Josef Glacier chronosequence ill New Zealand that spans ca. 120,000 years, and includes well-established build-up and retrogressive stages. We aimed to assess whether the abundances, community Structure and diversity of these groups show the same pattern across the sequence as that for vegetation. With regard to microfaunal abundances, litter-dwelling microbe-feeding nematodes were most abundant in the first stage of the chronosequence, but several other groups of microfauna ill both the soil and litter increased sharply during the first few stages and declined sharply during the last (retrogressive) stages. The ratios of bacterial- to fungal-feeding nematodes in both soil and litter were lowest for the filial stages of the chronosequence, and (ill the case of soil) for some of the early stages, pointing to domination by the fungal-based energy channel at those stages for which soil organic matter content or quality were lowest. This is consistent with the fungal-based energy channel being better adapted than the bacterial-based channel for resource-poor conditions. The main groups of macroinvertebrates typically had their lowest abundances at the very early and late stages of the chronosequence, although the relative abundances of different taxa differed during the intermediate stages. Taxonomic diversity of nematodes and macroinvertebrates ill both litter and soil varied strongly with chronosequence stage but differed among taxa; diversity of only one group (macroinvertebrates ill litter) declined significantly during retrogression. Diversity of nematodes and macroinvertebrates along the sequence did not closely match tree diversity or soil chemical properties, but community composition of these groups was often related to tree community composition and ratios of soil C to N, C to P and N to P. Different groups of soil invertebrates show contrasting responses to chronosequence stage, probably because they differ in their relative response to bottom-up and top-down controls. However, the abundance of most groups increased during the build-up phase and declined during retrogression. As such, the build-up and decline phases observed for plant communities and ecosystem processes across long-term chronosequences also apply to soil communities, pointing to the importance of resource availability as a major driver of soil biota during long-term ecosystem change.

AB The changes in bacterial communities associated with the marine sponge Mycale laxissima on transfer to aquaculture were studied using culture-based and molecular techniques. M. laxissinta was maintained alive in flowthrough and closed recirculating aquaculture systems for 2 years and I year, respectively. The bacterial communities associated with wild and aquacultured sponges, as well as the surrounding water, were assessed using 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Bacterial richness and diversity were measured using DOTUR computer software, and clone libraries were compared using S-LIBSHUFF. DGGE analysis revealed that the diversity of the bacterial community of M. laxissima increased when sponges were maintained in aquaculture and that bacterial communities associated with wild and aquacultured M. laxissima were markedly different than those of the corresponding surrounding water. Clone libraries of bacterial 16S rRNA from sponges confirmed that the bacterial communities changed during aquaculture. These communities were significantly different than those of seawater and aquarium water. The diversity of bacterial communities associated with M. laxissima increased significantly in aquaculture. Our work shows that it is important to monitor changes in bacterial communities when examining the feasibility of growing sponges in aquaculture systems because these communities may change. This could have implications for the health of sponges or for the production of bioactive compounds by sponges in cases where these compounds are produced by symbiotic bacteria rather than by the sponges themselves.

AB Complementary resource use is regarded as a mechanism that contributes to positive relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Here, we used a biodiversity experiment composed of nine potentially dominant species (grasses: Alopecurus pratensis, Arrhenatherum elatius, Dactylis glomerata, Phleum pratense, Poa trivialis; legumes: Trifolium pratense, T repens; non-legume herbs: Anthriscus sylvestris, Geranium pratense) to test for differences among monocultures and mixtures and for effects of species richness and the presence of particular species on the use of aboveground space. The number of rooting shoots determined in a line transect increased from monocultures to mixtures. Particularly, the presence of A. elatius in mixtures caused a higher shoot density at the community level. The number of pin contacts per sampling point (cumulative cover) at the community level, analysed with the point intercept method, was higher in mixtures than monocultures, and higher in mixtures with than without A. elatius. The effect was attributable to increased densities across the strata of the vertical stand profile as well as to an increase in community height. The impact of species richness on the use of aboveground space differed considerably between individual species. A. elatius achieved increased densities across all strata of the stand profile, while D. glomerata reached higher densities with a more pronounced use of space in the upper strata with increasing species richness of mixtures. Cumulative cover of P. pratense and A. pratensis was not affected by species richness, while the remaining species decreased space use mostly in the upper strata with increasing species richness or in mixtures with the competitively superior A. elatius. Our study shows that potentially dominant species are limited in their ability for adaptive responses to canopy shading. Nevertheless, the differential responses to species richness of individual species with regard to vertical niche occupation resulted in positive diversity effects on aboveground space use at the community level.

AB Relationships among individual variation in exercise capacity, resting metabolism and morphology may offer insights into the mechanistic basis of whole-animal performance, including possible performance trade-offs (e. g. burst versus sustainable exercise, resting 'maintenance' costs versus maximal power output). Although there have been several studies of correlations between performance, metabolism and morphology in fish, birds and squamate reptiles, relatively little work has been done with mammals. We measured several aspects of forced and voluntary locomotor performance in Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus), along with minimal and maximal aerobic metabolic rates and organ sizes (mainly visceral organs and the musculoskeletal system). Maximal sprint and aerobic speeds and maximal oxygen consumption (V-O2max) during forced exercise were similar to those of other small rodents; basal metabolic rate was below allometric predictions. At all tested speeds, voluntary running had a lower energy cost than forced treadmill running, due primarily to a higher zero-speed intercept of the speed-versus-power (oxygen consumption) relationship during forced running. Incremental costs of transport (slopes of speed-versus-power regressions) were slightly higher during voluntary exercise. Few of the correlations among performance variables, or between performance and organ morphology, were statistically significant. These results are consistent with many other studies that found weak correlations between organismal performance (e. g. VO2max) and putatively relevant subordinate traits, thus supporting the idea that some components within a functional system may exhibit excess capacity at various points in the evolutionary history of a population, while others constitute limiting factors.

AB The relation between functional traits and abundance of species has the potential to provide evidence on the mechanisms that structure local ecological communities. The niche-limitation/limiting-similarity hypothesis, derived from MacArthur and Levins' original concept, predicts that species that are similar to others in terms of functional traits will suffer greater competition and hence be less abundant. On the other hand, the environment-filtering/ habitat-optimum hypothesis predicts that groups of species with functional traits that are close to the optimum for that environment, and are therefore similar to other species, will be more abundant. We propose a new niche-assembly model for predicting the relative abundance of species in communities from their functional traits, which can detect the patterns that would be expected from either of these hypotheses. The model was fitted to eight plant communities sampled in the Lake Ohau district of New Zealand. For seven of the sites, the patterns could not be distinguished from that expected under a null model. However, in one site there was highly significant departure from the null model in the direction expected from the niche-limitation hypothesis. The site was probably the most productive of those examined. It is possible that competition for light rather than belowground resources, or faster recovery from disturbance, allowed greater predictability. Surprisingly, the predictability was seen when just the presences of a species' neighbours in trait space were taken into account, but not when the potential effects of those neighbours were weighted by their abundance. For three of the four model types, the effects of species on each other were consistently negative: a significant trend. These results contradict the various neutral models of ecological communities.

AB A size-resolved pelagic ecosystem model is developed using descriptions of physical limits to biological processes and allometric relationships to determine physiological rates. The model contains three functional groups: phytoplankton, protozoans and metazoans-requiring three separately resolved size distributions. Within each functional group the size-resolution of the model can be altered without changing the model parameters, which are the coefficients of the allometric relationships, or changing the model equations, which are characteristic of each functional group. This approach allows the number of size-classes to be varied, and for a convergence of output with increasing resolution to be achieved. In this paper, a biological configuration is analysed composed of 62 size-classes doubling in biomass between classes and ranging in volume over 19 orders of magnitude from 0.32 mu m(3), representative of the cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus sp., to 2.05 x 10(18) mu m(3), representative of a metazoan size-class with an equivalent spherical radius of 78.8 cm. The phytoplankton size-classes extend through the first 17 size-classes, protozoan from the 9th to 21st, and metazoan from the 18th to 62nd. The size-resolved model is coupled to a ID model of the oceanic mixed layer. Numerical experiments show the size-resolved model is relatively insensitive to size resolution and higher order closure terms with the 62 size-class configuration, but is sensitive to initial conditions. The model output is most sensitive to the parameter describing the smallest size-class of prey available to a metazoan predator, and the nitrogen content of a phytoplankton cell. The concentration of DIN and biomass of protozoa are in general the most sensitive model outputs. These experiments provide a background understanding for further application of the size-resolved pelagic ecosystem model. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated genetic differentiation and migration patterns in a small livebearing fish, Poecilia mexicana, inhabiting a sulfidic Mexican limestone cave (Cueva del Azufre). We examined fish from three different cave chambers, the sulfidic surface creek draining the cave (El Azufre) and a nearby surface creek without the toxic hydrogen sulphide (Arroyo Cristal). Using microsatellite analysis of 10 unlinked loci, we found pronounced genetic differentiation among the three major habitats: Arroyo Cristal, El Azufre and the cave. Genetic differentiation was also found within the cave between different pools. An estimation of first-generation migrants suggests that (i) migration is unidirectional, out of the cave, and (ii) migration among different cave chambers occurs to some extent. We investigated if the pattern of genetic differentiation is also reflected in a morphological trait, eye size. Relatively large eyes were found in surface habitats, small eyes in the anterior cave chambers, and the smallest eyes were detected in the innermost cave chamber (XIII). This pattern shows some congruence with a previously proposed morphocline in eye size. However, our data do not support the proposed mechanism for this morphocline, namely that it would be maintained by migration from both directions into the middle cave chambers. This would have led to an increased variance in eye size in the middle cave chambers, which we did not find. Restricted gene flow between the cave and the surface can be explained by local adaptations to extreme environmental conditions, namely H2S and absence of light. Within the cave system, habitat properties are patchy, and genetic differentiation between cave chambers despite migration could indicate local adaptation at an even smaller scale.

AB Hubbell's neutral theory of biodiversity has generated much debate over the need for niches to explain biodiversity patterns. Discussion of the theory has focused on its neutrality assumption, i.e. the functional equivalence of species in competition and dispersal. Almost no attention has been paid to another critical aspect of the theory, the assumptions on the nature of the speciation process. In the standard version of the neutral theory each individual has a fixed probability to speciate. Hence, the speciation rate of a species is directly proportional to its abundance in the metacommunity. We argue that this assumption is not realistic for most speciation modes because speciation is an emergent property of complex processes at larger spatial and temporal scales and, consequently, speciation rate can either increase or decrease with abundance. Accordingly, the assumption that speciation rate is independent of abundance (each species has a fixed probability to speciate) is a more natural starting point in a neutral theory of biodiversity. Here we present a neutral model based on this assumption and we confront this new model to 20 large data sets of tree communities, expecting the new model to fit the data better than Hubbell's original model. We find, however, that the data sets are much better fitted by Hubbell's original model. This implies that species abundance data can discriminate between different modes of speciation, or, stated otherwise, that the mode of speciation has a large impact on the species abundance distribution. Our model analysis points out new ways to study how biodiversity patterns are shaped by the interplay between evolutionary processes (speciation, extinction) and ecological processes (competition, dispersal).

AB The Chaco Serrano Woodland from central Argentina has been dramatically reduced during the past 30 years, and is currently confined to several isolates of different size. In this study, we evaluated the effects of forest size, isolation and edge formation on plant species richness. Furthermore, we tested whether plants species with particular ecological traits were differentially affected by habitat fragmentation. Habitat area showed the highest explanatory value for plant species richness in stepwise multiple regressions. The effect of area was most pronounced for rare species, suggesting that large forests are necessary to preserve species with low local or regional abundance. Differences between edge and interior of Chaco Serrano were more pronounced for native and shrub species richness. The analysis of individual species cover revealed that native and biotically pollinated plants were less abundant in woodland edges. Our results showed that forest transformation into smaller remnants has lead to an impoverishment of plant communities, with particular subsets of species defined by ecological traits (rarity, origin and pollination mode) being more susceptible.

AB Over-exploitation and fragmentation are serious problems for tropical forests. Most sustainable forest management practices avoid clear-cuts and apply selective logging systems focused on a few commercial species. We applied a simulation model to estimate the impact of such selective logging scenarios on the genetic diversity and demography of four tropical tree species from French Guiana. The simulations used data on genetic and demographic composition, growth, phenology and pollen and seed dispersal obtained for Dicorynia guianensis, Sextonia rubra, Symphonia globulifera and Vouacapoua americana at the experimental site in Paracou. Whereas Symphonia globulifera serves as a model for a species with low logging pressure, the other three species represent the most exploited tree species in French Guiana. In simulations with moderate logging, typical for French Guiana, with large cutting diameter (> 60 cm diameter) and long cutting cycles (65 years), the two species V. americana and Sextonia rubra were not able to recover their initial stock at the end of the rotation period, with a large decrease in the number of individuals and in basal area. Under a more intensive logging system (cutting diameter > 45 cm diameter, cutting cycles of 30 years) that is common practice in the Brazilian Amazon, only Symphonia globulifera showed no negative impact. Generally, the differences between the genetic parameters in the control scenarios without logging and the logging scenarios were surprisingly small. The main reasons for this were the overlapping of generations and the effective dispersal ability of gene vectors in all species, which guarantee relative homogeneity of the genetic structure in different age classes. Nevertheless, decreasing the population size by logging reduced the number of genotypes and caused higher genetic distances between the original population and the population at the end of the logging cycles. Sensitivity analysis showed that genetic changes in the logging scenarios were principally determined by the growth, densities and cutting diameter of each species, and only to a very small extent by the reproductive system including factors such as pollen and seed dispersal and flowering phenology.

AB Feeding habits and gill raker morphology were examined for the three major planktivorous pelagic fishes, Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus, Pacific round herring Etrumeus teres and Japanese jack mackerel Trachurus japonicus, off the northern and western coasts of Kyushu, in the north-eastern part of the East China Sea in the summer months of 2001. Using fishes in the same size range (80-140 mm, standard length), the stomach contents of the three fish species were compared. The diet of the Japanese anchovy mainly consisted of Oncaeidae copepods, while the diets of the Pacific round herring and Japanese jack mackerel were dominated by calanoid copepods at all stations. Comparisons between prey size in the stomach, zooplankton size in the water and gill raker morphology suggested that the stomach contents of the three species were characterized mainly by the difference in the feeding behaviour between Japanese anchovy (filter-feeding) and the other two species (particulate-feeding), rather than by the difference in the morphology of feeding apparatus only. It was concluded that behavioural adaptations in the feeding of these pelagic fishes brought about trophic partitioning to some degree in this pelagic ecosystem in summer. Although the diets of these three species overlapped to some extent, there was still little likelihood of competition between the Japanese anchovy and the other two species. The potential for competition between the Pacific round herring and the Japanese jack mackerel is discussed.

AB Sexual selection predicts that males should signal their viability and health and this is often achieved with elaborate ornaments. However, females' phenotypic and genotypic quality may also be related to ornamental expression. We investigated the association between a female ornamental trait (white wing plumage) and female quality in the common eider, Somateria mollissima. Only females incubate and care for young, so male parental effort did not influence the females' condition, and the ornament is expressed only in females, so it is not a neutral correlated response to selection of the same ornament in males. We recorded the expression of this ornament in relation to the number of eggs laid and to mass loss and immunological status during incubation. Females that experienced a large mass loss and/or a reduction in immune cell levels (immunosuppression) had less white in the new wing bands produced after breeding. These results are the first to show a correlation between tolerance of reproductive costs and the expression of a strictly female ornament in a species with conventional sex roles.

AB Eurasian badgers, Meles meles, have been shown to possess limited genetic population structure within Europe; however, field studies have detected high levels of philopatry, which are expected to increase population structure. Population structure will be a consequence of both contemporary dispersal and historical processes, each of which is expected to be evident at a different scale. Therefore, to gain a greater understanding of gene flow in the badger, we examined microsatellite diversity both among and within badger populations, focusing on populations from the British Isles and western Europe. We found that while populations differed in their allelic diversity, the British Isles displayed a similar degree of diversity to the rest of western Europe. The lower genetic diversity occurring in Ireland, Norway and Scotland was more likely to have resulted from founder effects rather than contemporary population density. While there was significant population structure (F(ST) = 0.19), divergence among populations was generally well explained by geographic distance (P < 0.0001) across the entire range studied of more than 3000 km. Transient effects from the Pleistocene appear to have been replaced by a strong pattern of genetic isolation by distance across western Europe, suggestive of colonization from a single refugium. Analysis of individuals within British populations through Mantel tests and spatial autocorrelation demonstrated that there was significant local population structure across 3-30 km, confirming that dispersal is indeed restricted. The isolation by distance observed among badger populations across western Europe is likely to be a consequence of this restricted local dispersal.

AB The distribution and abundance of desert plant communities were examined in the lower reaches of the Tarim River, southern Xinjiang. Eighteen plant species were collected at 18 sites along a sequence of increasing ground-water depths in six transects. Except for Tamarix ramosissima and Populus euphratica, which were distributed across nearly all sites, most of the investigated species had low frequency of occurrence. Correspondence analysis (CA) of the 18 species revealed a separation of growth forms into distinct groups corresponding to different ground-water levels. Three clearly defined groups of growth forms were strongly associated with three distinct ground-water zones, ranging from < 3, 3-5 and > 5 m, respectively. Four taxa groups were found to correspond to the three ground-water zones and to several other environmental factors. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of the 18 species and seven environmental variables would suggest a major botanical gradient exists relating to ground-water depth and secondary gradients exists that include soil moisture, pH and to a lesser extent alkalinity and mineralization.

AB During the Late Pleistocene, glaciers sundered many species into multiple glacial refugia where populations diverged in allopatry. Although deeply divergent mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages often reflect the number of refugia occupied, it is unlikely that populations that split during the recent Wisconsin glaciations will have reached reciprocal monophyly. We examined mtDNA control region sequences from eastern and western populations of wood ducks (Aix sponsa) to determine whether their current, disjunct distribution is consistent with the occupancy of two glacial refugia. We used the 'isolation with migration' coalescent method (IM) to simultaneously estimate effective population sizes, maternal gene flow, and time since divergence. We found 24 unique haplotypes, none of which were shared between the eastern and western populations, but we did not find diagnostic monophyletic lineages suggestive of long-term isolation in multiple glacial refugia. However, a high Phi(ST) (0.31) indicates that eastern and western populations are well differentiated in mtDNA, and results from IM suggest that these populations have been diverging, without extensive gene flow, for 10 000 to 124 000 years. Results from im further suggest that these populations most likely split about 34 000 years ago, and this time of divergence is consistent with the occupancy of multiple glacial refugia during the Late Wisconsin glaciation. Eastern wood ducks are characterized by high genetic diversity, a large effective population size, and a recent population expansion, while western wood ducks have much less genetic diversity, a smaller population size, and have not undergone a recent population expansion.

Two management strategies are being advanced to reduce propagule supply and invasions from overseas shipping. Ballast water exchange (BWE) is now required by several nations and is expected to be replaced by discharge standards (maximum organismal concentrations), negotiated as a treaty within the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Here, we provide the first forecast and comparison of changes to propagule supply at a national scale, resulting from these alternate management strategies. For unmanaged ballast water, sampled ships (n = 354) arriving to the US typically contained zooplankton concentrations < 3000 organisms m(-3), but some ships (1.1%) contained > 50 000 organisms m(-3). Only 3.8% of these arrivals :meet the IMO standards. BWE substantially reduces zooplankton concentrations, but we estimate that <= 17.2% Of BWE ships will meet IMO standards. Although most overseas arrivals discharged < 1500 m(3) of ballast water, discharges are reported as high as 103 +/- 000 m, and total inocula >= 10(6) remain possible, even under the more stringent IMO strategy.

AB Plant species richness and cover of 698 samples of weed flora, recorded in standard plots in the Czech Republic from 1955 to 2000, were related to altitudinal floristic regions, soil types, cultivated crops, climate, altitude and year of the record. Stepwise backward elimination of explanatory variables was used to analyse the data, taking into account their interactive nature, until the general linear model contained only significant terms. Net effects of particular variables on weed species number and cover, independent of covariance with other variables, were determined. Weed species number and cover were significantly affected by altitudinal floristic region and its interaction with the year of sampling. Both weed species number and cover decreased over time, more so in the moderate-to-cold than in the warm altitudinal floristic region, due to the increase in agricultural intensification being more profound at higher than lower altitudes. There was no direct effect of soil type on weed species number, whereas the decrease of weed cover with increasing crop cover was more pronounced on nutrient-poor than nutrient-rich soils. Maize fields contained the lowest number of weed species, while root crops and fodder plants were most species rich. Within the group of other cereals than maize, spring barley and oats harboured more weed species than winter wheat and, in particular, than rye. The differences in weed flora were largely attributable to management and partly related to crop-specific agricultural practices as well as general changes in the management of arable fields over the last decades.

AB Fisheries oceanography can be defined as the study of the ecology of fishes in the ocean: so defined, it comprises study at all levels of ecological organization - organisms, populations, communities, and ecosystems. The early life history of fishes plays out at each of these levels of organization. A paradigm developed by Johan Hjort at the turn of the twentieth century, along with postulates by Hjort and many of his colleagues that followed, came to guide much of fisheries oceanography through the ensuing hundred years. Research themes that address these postulates can be roughly partitioned as the study of the physiological ecology of the eggs and larvae of fishes in the sea, and the study of the abundance and distribution of fish propagules. Using case studies of organisms and physical processes, considerable progress has been made in understanding the causes of variation in population recruitment, defined either by stage-based models and simulated by individual-based models. Some of this progress has been published in Scientia Marina, or its predecessor Investigacion Pesquera. The causes of variation, however, are interactive and operative at differing, yet often overlapping, spatial and temporal scales. Difficulty in matching spatial scales that typically differ by an order of magnitude or more, will continue to trouble the resolution of causes of population recruitment. Moreover, study of the causes of variation in recruitment has not led to predictive power at an annual scale. Prediction at a decadal scale, using community (or more appropriately larval fish assemblages) and ecosystem level dynamics, is more hopeful.

AB We combine simulations with spatial statistics to estimate the parameters of a metapopulation model for the epiphytic lichen Lobaria pulmonaria specializing on aspen (Populus tremula) and goat willow (Salix caprea) in Fennoscandian boreal old-growth forests. We estimated the parameters of a forest landscape model (FIN-LANDIS) by repeatedly running simulations and selecting the set of parameters for tree ecology and fire regime that reproduced empirical host tree density and spatial patterns. Second, we tested which variables were important in epiphyte colonization and estimated the dispersal kernel. Third, we run a metapopulation model for the lichen across the estimated landscape scenarios and selected values for the remaining parameters that reproduced the empirical patterns of epiphyte occurrence. There was little variation in predicted dynamics, occupancy and spatial patterns between replicate metapopulation simulations. However, more data would be required for accurately estimating the parameters of FIN-LANDIS primarily because of the inherent stochasticity in large scale forest fires. Following the beginning of fire suppression in the study area 150 years ago, the model predicts that lichen occupancy first increases but subsequently declines. The lower occupancy in the past than at present is explained by high rate of tree destruction by fires, which increases local extinction rate in patch-tracking metapopulations. In the absence of fires, the occupancy increases because of lower extinction rate, but without forest fires or alternative means of host tree regeneration, the lichen is predicted to go ultimately extinct because of severely reduced density of aspen and goat willow.

AB As human impacts on the environment intensify, the future of plant and animal biodiversity will depend increasingly on the floras surviving in human-dominated "countryside" habitats. To begin to characterize these floras for the Neotropics, we investigated the richness and composition of herbaceous and shrubby plant communities in six forested and deforested habitats, in three replicated study areas (7.5-km in diameter), of southern Costa Rica. We chose habitat types that are common throughout the tropics, to begin building a general understanding of both the habitats of origin and the diversity of countryside floras. Focal forest habitats were understory, 1- to 2-year-old tree-fall gaps, and riverbanks, all in primary forest. Focal deforested habitats were ungrazed road verges, grazed pasture, and riverbanks in grazed pasture. Non-riverbank habitats were sampled both near and far from. forest edge. In total, we sampled 772 species from 79 families, similar to 40% of the non-tree plant diversity of the region. Only 6% of identified species are known to be exotic. In each study area, understory and pasture plots were consistently species poor, while tree-fall gaps and road verges near forest were consistently the most species-rich habitats. In each study area, we found the same proportion of species restricted to forested habitats (similar to 45%) and deforested habitats (similar to 37%), and the same proportion of "countryside-habitat generalists" ( similar to 18%) occurring in both forested and deforested habitats. However, different forested habitats supported different proportions of country side-habitat generalists in each study area, although understory plots consistently 'supported the fewest generalists. Among forested habitats, riverbanks were the most similar floristically to deforested habitats. Pasture riverbanks and road verges near forest supported plant communities most similar to those in forested habitats. The uniqueness and richness of each habitat suggests that countrysides with diverse land uses can support many native herbaceous and shrubby plant species. As it becomes increasingly difficult to protect large tracts of undisturbed tropical forest, we suggest that conservation goals expand to encompass maintenance of heterogeneity in countryside landscapes.

AB Intensification of agriculture is believed to have caused declines in farmland bird populations. One of the key elements of recent agricultural intensification is the increased use of pesticides. However, studies elucidating relationships between individual management practices and responses in bird populations remain rare. Here, evidence is presented of indirect effects of pesticides on behaviour and nestling condition of yellowhammers (Emberiza citrinella L.). Insecticide use was associated with reduced abundance of invertebrate food at the field scale resulting, early in the season (when nestlings were fed exclusively on invertebrates), in a negative correlation with yellowhammer foraging intensity. There was also a negative relationship between insecticide use and nestling body condition. While cumulative effects of repeated spraying can have impacts, the occurrence of any insecticide spraying in the breeding season may be more detrimental than multiple sprays at other times. Minimising applications of persistent broad-spectrum insecticides during March-June, the provision of alternative unsprayed foraging habitat and advice on mitigating indirect effects of pesticides to advisers and users are likely to benefit nesting yellowhammers.

AB Analyses of daily water quality data from two streams draining a pair of small coastal catchments in South Devon, England reveal that what conventionally would be thought to show random noise, has a discernable structure and is clear evidence of process. Catchment and aquatic systems are non-equilibrium systems and climate drivers cause fluctuations in water quality both in terms of the concentrations of individual parameters and in the correlations between parameters. The data reveal non-linear coupling at small scales and show evidence of fractal properties both of which may be evidence of self-organised phenomena at small scales in catchments and streams. These data show that: (a) water quality and catchment nutrient export data may be strongly aliased, and (b) there is a fundamental degree of indeterminacy underlying the data we can collect and the knowledge we can generate from the data. New techniques of data based modelling that use the data itself to define more parsimonious predictive models are needed because such an approach recognises the partial nature of our knowledge and requires adequate monitoring and adaptive management programs.

AB Understanding the key ecological factors that moderate the relationship between biodiversity and the productivity of ecosystems is a major challenge for ecological research. Here we show that the relationship between the species richness of primary producers and net rates of biomass production in streams depends on the history of discharge-related disturbances. Using common methods to study 83 streams in the mid-Atlantic United States, we demonstrate that a positive relationship between producer richness and the net production of biomass only occurs in streams characterized by highly variable, unpredictable discharge regimes that represent frequently disturbed environments to benthic organisms. This pattern is partly explained by predictable changes in the composition of species assemblages among disturbed streams. The pattern also results because, in disturbed systems, species have faster rates of biomass accumulation when they are a part of species-rich assemblages. We discuss several possible explanations for this result. Our study supports qualitative predictions from theoretical and small-scale experimental work that the strength of the diversity-productivity relationship will depend explicitly on the disturbance regime of an ecosystem. The results have important implications for the management and conservation of aquatic resources as they suggest that changes to the productivity and diversity of streams may have their greatest impacts on organisms and systems that are most sensitive to disturbance.

AB The Holocene environmental history and climate are reconstructed for Ratasjoen, a low- alpine lake in south-central Norway. The reconstructions are based on chironomids, diatoms, pollen, plant macrofossils, and sediment characteristics. From plant macrofossil evidence, birch trees (Betula pubescens) immigrated ca. 10,000 cal BP. The chironomid-inferred mean July air temperature was high, but may be unreliable during the early stages of the lake's history due to the high abundance of Chironomus anthracinus type, a taxon that may include several species. From ca. 9000 cal BP the inferred mean July temperature was lower (ca. 9 degreesC). Temperatures increased towards 8000 cal BP and pine ( Pinus sylvestris) reached its upper limit near the lake. July temperature may have become a significant factor controlling long-term pH in the lake, starting shortly after 8000 cal BP. High pH values were associated with periods of warm summers and lower pH values occurred during periods of colder summers. Alkalinity processes within the lake and/or the catchment are possible factors controlling this relationship. A temperature decline at ca. 5400 cal BP separated two 10.6 degreesC temperature maxima around 6400 and 4500 cal BP. The 1.5 degreesC decline in July air temperatures from ca. 4400 cal BP was paralleled by a decrease of pH from 7.2 to 6.8. Following the temperature drop, first pine and then birch trees declined and disappeared from the catchment and organic accumulation in the lake increased. The increased organic accumulation rate had a positive effect on diatom production. At ca. 2700 cal BP the temperature reached a minimum (ca. 9.2 degreesC) and correspondingly a second pH minimum was reached. Temperature decreased again slightly at ca. 400 cal BP during the 'Little Ice Age', before increasing by about 0.5 degreesC towards the present. Percentage organic carbon as estimated by loss-on-ignition appears to be better correlated with chironomid-inferred July temperatures than organic accumulation rates, at least for the last 9000 years. Accumulation rates of organic sediments are more coupled with catchment-related processes, such as erosion and major changes in vegetation, than is percentage organic carbon.

TI Egg colouration and male parental effort in the pied flycatcher Ficedula
   hypoleuca
SO JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SEXUAL SELECTION; IMMUNITY
AB A recent hypothesis posits that the bright colours of many avian eggs may act like signals of female genetic quality or condition to males in species with biparental care, inducing them to work harder for their offspring. We measured the colour of blue eggs of pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca in Central Spain with a spectrophotometer on the day of laying, and also quantified the provisioning effort by males and females during the last days of the nestling period. Both chromaticity coordinates in the CIELAB colour space (blue to yellow, green to red) showed significant associations with male provisioning rates, explaining more than 20% of variation in male parental effort. Male provisioning rates were positively correlated with nestling condition, thereby potentially contributing to female fitness. This evidence is only tentative until experimental confirmation, but suggests that males are affected by the colour of their mates' eggs, a possibility not considered hitherto in the study of sexual selection.

AB Epilithic, epiphytic and epipelic diatoms were sampled at four sampling stations monthly from June to October in three boreal rivers in South Finland to examine the seasonal community persistence and stability of diatom communities in three habitats. The variation of successive samples in ordination space using Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling was substantial and without an evident pattern; there were no clear differences between community stability on three different substrata. At two stations, Multi Response Permutation Procedures showed significant among-group differences indicating that diatom communities were distinctly different among the three substrata. According to Indicator Species Analysis, we found several species showing significant (p < 0.05) specificity for, and fidelity to, certain substrata at two stations. The stability between sampling months in the rank abundance of diatom taxa was lowest among epiphytic communities. At each station, Spearman rank correlation decreased substantially until August indicating a distinct change in rank abundances. Communities tended to revert to their pre-disturbance state toward autumn after a major spate in the end of August. Using linear regression, we found that changes in total P were significantly (p < 0.05) related to community stability in the epilithon. Species turnover seemed to be highest among epiphyton and lowest among epipelic communities. Although these differences could partly result from lower diversity in epiphyton, they probably reflect lower persistence among epiphytic communities in these boreal rivers.

AB Microsite characteristics of established Picea abies seedlings were studied in a windthrow area of a Picea-dominated old-growth forest in the southern boreal zone of Finland. The seedling (height 3-30 cm) density, most of which was Picea (87%, ca. 31000 ha(-1)), was high (ca. 36 000 ha(-1)). Seedlings of Betula pubescens (ca. 2000 ha(-1)) and Sorbus aucuparia (ca. 2100 ha(-1)) were also abundant. The distribution of Picea seedlings across microsite types was significantly nonrandom. Picea seedlings were found in microsites created by windthrow disturbance, particularly advanced-decay wood, and uprooting pits and mounds. Sixty-three percent of the Picea seedlings occurred in these microsites, although they only covered ca. 28% of the study area. As a result of this pattern, Picea seedlings were aggregated in space and the majority of seedlings grew on microsites located above average local ground level. These results demonstrate the importance of disturbed microsites for the natural regeneration of Picea after windthrow disturbance. In managed forests, when naturally regenerating Picea on fertile sites, effort should be taken to create regeneration microsites similar to those created by natural disturbances, i.e. uprooting niches and decaying logs. These microsites are also important for the maintenance of biodiversity in managed forests.

AB Significant advances have recently been made in our understanding of the mechanism of inorganic carbon transport in algae and, especially, cyanobacteria with inorganic carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs). Furthermore, the role of CCMs in increasing the rate of photosynthesis in air-equilibrated solutions is also quite well understood. However, less often considered is how the presence ( or absence) of a CCM relates to the biology of algae. This mini-review relates the occurrence of algal CCMs to phylogeny, life form, life history, and interactions with other organisms. While some patterns can be seen, the occurrence of CCMs in relation to the overall biology of the algae needs more investigation.

AB Current knowledge of patterns and abundance of deciduous trees in the pre-industrial landscape of boreal Sweden is limited. This is due to a dramatic transformation of the forest landscape during the last 100 years and the lack of representative forest reserves. We used historical records to study change in five mixed deciduous forests between 1866 and 1999. The results show that large changes occurred due to complex interactions between fire disturbance, fire suppression, logging and silviculture. Before fire suppression, the presence of deciduous trees was mainly determined by earlier fire influence. Later selective logging disturbed natural succession and favoured regeneration of deciduous trees. During the 20(th) century deciduous trees were removed by girdling, thinning and herbicide spraying. Much of the mixed deciduous stands changed to coniferous stands between 1906-15 and 1969-70, and then deciduous trees were totally removed from these stands between late 1960s and 1999. Today mixed deciduous forest occurs mainly in young stands and on other sites than previously. Our results also show that large coniferous trees and multi-aged forest occurred in all sites in the early 1900s. Most sites were dominated by coniferous species and forest dominated by deciduous trees occurred only in smaller areas. These results are not consistent with the current view that deciduous-dominated forest occupied substantial areas in boreal Sweden before fire suppression. Appropriate changes in forest management are discussed, as is the value of historical data in interpreting changes in forest landscapes.

AB Three new plant macrofossil assemblages were collected from Late Cretaceous and Paleocene fluvio-lacustrine sediments of the Pakawau and Kapuni groups in the northwest of the South Island, New Zealand. Palaeoenvironmental interpretations were made from each locality and palaeoclimate was deduced from the dicotyledonous angiosperm leaf component of each flora. A latest Cretaceous (Pakawau Bush Road locality) flora yielded 58 different dicotyledonous leaf forms; the two Paleocene collections, Ian's Tip and Pillar Point Track, included 23 and 28 dicotyledonous leaf forms respectively. Quantitative palaeoclimate estimates were obtained using both Leaf Margin Analysis (LMA) and the Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP). Temperature estimates suggest that there was a slight cooling from the latest Cretaceous into the early Paleocene in the northwest Nelson region of New Zealand, supporting similar Southern Hemisphere palaeoclimate findings from Antarctic data. Consistency in temperature estimates using different methods, including LMA, multivariate leaf morphological analysis (CLAMP), oxygen isotope data, regional versus local studies and global palaeoclimate models, suggests that the mean annual temperature for the Pakawau region in the latest Cretaceous was between 12 and 15degreesC. LMA produced temperature estimates between 6.5 and 8degreesC for the two Paleocene assemblages whereas CLAMP-produced estimates were slightly higher between 9 and 12.5degreesC (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Invasive nonindigenous plants are a primary threat to native species and the integrity of natural areas by causing changes in species composition and ecosystem processes. For many of the most invasive species, natural area managers lack species-specific and successful long-term management options. Moreover, repeated use of fire, herbicides, flooding, mowing, and other management options may have negative impacts on native species. Increasingly, land managers are considering biological weed control-the introduction of host-specific natural enemies from the native range of a nonindigenous plant species. The spread of garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata [M. Bieb.] Cavara and Grande), a European biennial herb, through forests of the eastern and midwestern United States and Canada has caused great concern. In 1998 a biological control program for garlic mustard was initiated and the search for potential biological control agents began in western Europe. Garlic mustard is under little herbivore pressure in North America, whereas 70 insect herbivores and 7 fungi are associated with this plant in Europe. While most of these species are not sufficiently host-specific to be considered for introduction into North America, five monophagous weevils and an oligophagous flea beetle that attack seeds, stems, and roots of garlic mustard were selected for further study, based on the assumption that simultaneous attack of different plant parts will provide superior control. Although literature records and preliminary investigations suggest that these herbivores have a very restricted host range, extensive experimental investigations will assess whether these insects are safe for introduction to North America. Development of successful biological control for garlic mustard will allow natural area managers to incorporate release of host-specific herbivores into their management strategy.

AB We studied annual and lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of both sexes of common buzzard Buteo buteo in eastern Westphalia, Germany. We followed a bottom-up approach starting from individual breeding attempts, over lifetime reproductive success to derive population demography. Annual breeding performance and survival followed a quadratic relationship with breeding experience; individuals starting their breeding career were less likely to survive and breed successfully than birds of intermediate breeding experience. According to an analysis of selection gradients, both the opportunity and intensity of selection peaked in the early stages of the breeding career. The distribution of both LRS and another fitness measure, lambda, was highly skewed, with ca 17% of adult birds producing 50% of fledglings in both sexes. Besides breeding life span and number of breeding attempts, habitat quality and plumage morph were significant predictors of LRS. There were strong differences in LRS and lambda between the plumage morphs in both sexes: intermediate pigmented buzzards were much more successful than either dark or light ones. There was no significant difference between buzzard cohorts either in LRS or lambda, nor did these fitness measures differ between individuals starting their breeding career at different conditions of food availability. Based on individual life histories, we formed a transition matrix and analysed its properties to study the population as a whole. This analysis showed that the population growth rate was close to unity (0.906, bootstrapped 95% confidence limits: 0.834 and 0.962). Analysis of reproductive values and elasticities further emphasised colour morph differences: the contribution of intermediate individuals to population growth greatly exceeded that of dark or light individuals. Thus most phenomena on all levels from individual breeding attempts over lifetime reproductive success to population demography can be explained by the fitness differences between the colour morphs with the intermediate morph maintaining the current population renewal potential.

AB A major task of the Grouse Specialist Group is to compile an IUCN/SSC Action Plan to assess threats and propose conservation actions for all grouse species worldwide. This paper provides an overview to the conservation status of and major threats to grouse based on information collected during the preparation of the Grouse Action Plan. Three species, Caucasian black grouse Tetrao mlokosiewiczi, Chinese grouse Bonasa sewerzowi and Siberian grouse Falcipennis falcipennis, are listed as globally near-threatened or data deficient, one newly-recognised species, Gunnison sage grouse Centrocercus minimus, is listed as globally endangered and two subspecies, Attwater's prairie chicken Tympanuchus cupido attwateri and Cantabrian capercaillie Tetrao urogallus cantabricus, qualify to be listed as globally threatened according to IUCN criteria. At a national level, 14 of the 18 species are red-listed in at least one country. Populations at the southern edge of a species' range and in densely populated regions are most often red-listed. Based on questionnaire results from 38 countries, habitat degradation, loss and fragmentation due to human land use activities are the major threats to grouse viability. Exploitation, predation and human disturbance were regionally felt to be critical. Major threats and their causes are reviewed based on questionnaire results and the Literature. Integrating habitat preservation and human land use practices is concluded to be the major challenge to grouse conservationists worldwide.

AB We present a gradient analysis of 620 vegetation samples covering most of the floristic and environmental variation in semi-natural grassland vegetation on well-drained soils in Denmark. Vegetation was sampled using frequency in subplots. Explanatory variables were surface inclination, aspect, pH, geographical co-ordinates together with indications of soil type. Detrended Correspondence Analysis revealed four floristic gradients that could be interpreted in ecological terms by measured variables supplemented with site calibrations based on weighted averaging of Ellenberg's indicator values. All four axes were interpreted using rank correlation statistics, and linear and non-linear multiple regression of sample scores on explanatory variables. The first gradient was from dry calcareous to humid acidic grasslands; the second reflected an underlying gradient in fertility; the third reflected regional differentiation and the fourth was associated with variation in intensity of competition as indicated by association with calibrated Grime-CSR values for the plots. We applied subset ordination to the data as a supplement to traditional permutation and correlation statistics to assess the consistency of ordination results. DCA axes 1 and 2 were consistent in space and time.
   This gradient analysis is discussed in a context of plant strategy theory and species diversity models. Ecocline patterns lend support to the view that grazing not only favours the ruderal strategy but also the stress-tolerant strategy. The low rank of competition as an explanatory variable for the floristical gradients supports the notion that competitive effects play a subordinate role for species composition compared to microclimate and soil conditions in infertile semi-natural grasslands.

AB As part of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment Program, fish were collected from 24 selected stream sites in the Willamette Basin during 1993-1995 to determine the composition of the fish assemblages and their relation to the chemical and physical environment. Variance in fish relative abundance was greater among all sites than among spatially distinct reaches within a site (spatial variation) or among multiple sampled years at a site (temporal variation). Therefore, data from a single reach in an individual year was considered to be a reliable estimator of the fish assemblage structure at a site when the data were normalized by percent relative abundance. Multivariate classification and ordination were used to examine patterns in environmental variables and fish relative abundance over differing spatial scales (among versus within ecoregions). Across all ecoregions tall sites), fish assemblages were primarily structured along environmental gradients of water temperature and stream gradient (coldwater, high-gradient forested sites versus warmwater, low-gradient Willamette Valley sites); this pattern superseded patterns that were ecoregion specific. Water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and physical habitat (e.g., riparian canopy and percent riffles) were associated with patterns of fish assemblages across all ecoregions; however, pesticide and total phosphorus concentrations were more important than physical habitat within the Willamette Valley ecoregion. Consideration of stream site stratification (e.g., stream size, ecoregion, and stream gradient), identification of fish to species level (particularly the sculpin family), and detailed measurement of habitat, diurnal dissolved oxygen, and water temperature were critical in evaluating the composition of fish assemblages in relation to land use. In general, these low-gradient valley streams typical of other agricultural regions had poor riparian systems and showed increases in water temperature, nutrients, and fine grain sediments that were associated with degradation in the native fish assemblages. There was an association of high abundances of introduced species and high percent external abnormalities in medium-sized river sites of mixed land use and high abundances of tolerant species in small streams of predominantly agricultural land use.

AB The fire history and the effect of fires on the long-term (apparent) rate of carbon accumulation (LORCA) in the Patvinsuo mire complex, eastern Finland, were determined through stratigraphic and pollen analyses of 98 pear cores. The peat cores were characterized by a large number of charcoal layers and the age of the basal peat varied between 57 and 10 500 years. Mire fires slowed down the progress of vertical peat accumulation and resulted in great carbon losses. The average LORCA in the Patvinsuo cores was clearly lower, 9.2 +/- 1.0 (SE) g m(-2) yr(-1), compared to the average Value for all mire sites in the southern half of Finland, 17.7 +/- 0.6 (SE) g m(-2) yr(-1). The average rate of carbon loss in Patvinsuo mire complex was 9.5 +/- 1.0 (SE) g m(-2) yr(-1) and the mean carbon loss in an individual fire was estimated to be 2.5 kg m(-2).

AB We used univariate and multivariate techniques to evaluate vegetation-environment relationships for plant functional groups on a tallgrass prairie site in northern Oklahoma, USA burned seasonally and grazed by bison (Bison bison L.). The objective of the study was to identify important environmental variables associated with variation ill residual aboveground standing crop (phytomass) and abundance of plant functional groups. Phytomass was predictably linked to season, with highest levels found in the latter portion of the growing season when the warm-season tallgrasses that dominated the site were most actively growing. When the effects of seasonal phenology were removed, stepwise regression revealed that phytomass variation was best explained by year-to-year climatic variation, seasonal burn type, and bison grazing. Phytomass was negatively related to bison grazing under all conditions. A number of plant functional groups responded to individual environmental variables: relative abundance levels of tallgrasses, little bluestem, annual grasses, forbs and legumes all varied with burn season; little bluestem, annual grasses, and sedges varied by topoedaphic position, while forbs exhibited a positive relationship with bison grazing intensity. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to directly relate composition patterns of functional groups to environmental variables. CCA bi-plot of the ordination revealed th:lt annual grasses were most closely associated with summer fires, sedges were associated with fall burns and the 1995 sampling year, legumes associated with a gradient representing the length of time since fire; while tallgrasses and little bluestem ordinated nearest a gradient representing bison grazing. Forbs and perennial grasses did not clearly associate with any particular environmental gradient, suggesting they were either simultaneously affected by several parameters or that environmental attributes important to these groups were not measured. Total phytomass and sedges were strongly influenced by yearly climatic variation. Relative abundance of some plant functional groups was principally determined by a single factor, while others were equally influenced by a suite of environmental interactions.

Alaska. All loci revealed high levels of variability with heterozygosity estimates ranging from 86 to 97% (mean heterozygosity: 89%). The variation was structured significantly among sites suggesting that the samples investigated were genetically distinct from each other. Genetic divergence was greatest between populations from the Bering Sea and those from Prince William Sound. The Kodiak Island and Point Chalmers samples appeared to be distinct from the Prince William Sound and Beriug Sea populations. The observed genetic distance relationships among samples could be explained largely in terms of geographical separation. (C) 1998 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

ID COMMUNITY
AB 1 In an investigation of the impact of the extreme drought of 1995, measurements of the relative water content (RWC) of leaves were conducted on a wide range of herbaceous species, distributed over a vegetation mosaic coinciding with local gradients in soil depth in a limestone dale at Burton in northern England. Variation in leaf RWC was analysed in relation to soil depth, soil water potential and species composition of the vegetation at the sampled sites.
   2 Despite the unusual severity of the drought, low RWC was confined to the vegetation of shallow daleside soils and rock outcrops where turgor remained conspicuously higher in tap-rooted forbs such as Sanguisorba minor and Pimpinella saxifraga. Over the sampled area as a whole, it was apparent that desiccation-avoidance through continued access to subsoil moisture was more important as a controller of leaf RWC than restriction of transpiration.
   3 Under the extreme conditions of 1995 differences in water relations became apparent between several pairs of congeners and morphologically similar species co-existing in the same communities.
   4 In species with distributions concentrated on the deeper soils of the plateau and valley bottom, a consistent correlation was established between declining frequency of occurrence and falling values in RWC. This relationship was due to the failure of outlying populations on shallow soil to maintain turgor and suggested that extreme moisture stress was acting as a resetting mechanism restricting the excursion of drought-sensitive species on to the areas of shallow soil.
   5 With the exception of a small number of tap-rooted plants, species associated with the shallow soils and rock outcrops showed a negative relationship between abundance in communities and leaf RWC; this supports the hypothesis that areas of shallow soil are suboptimal for such species and merely provide a refuge from the competitive effects of the more robust species occupying the deeper soils.

AB In this study of bryophyte diversity in 110 patches of spruce forests of bilberry, small fern, low herb, tall fern and tall herb type in Sor-Trondelag, central Norway, each patch (from 0.24 to 9.33 ha) was classified as one main vegetation type and one successional stage or cutting class. The bryophytes in each patch were censused in randomly established squares of 10 x 10 m, supplemented by complete sampling in the rest of the patch. A number of environmental variables was sampled, and the data sets treated with DCA and CCA. Altogether 210 bryophytes (71 liverworts and 139 mosses) were found in the squares, and 285 (96 liverworts and 189 mosses) in the forest patches. The average number of liverworts, mosses and bryophytes in forest patches increased gradually from the dry and poor to the moist and rich forest types. Several red listed and other interesting spruce forest species had their only or main occurrence in the rich and humid forest, and in old cutting classes.

AB Ecological restoration is increasingly invoked as a tool for the maintenance and regeneration of biodiversity. Yet the conceptual foundations and assumptions underlying many restoration management activities are frequently unclear or unstated. Unforeseen, undesirable consequences of restoration activities may emerge as a result. A general conceptual framework for restoration is needed to better accommodate dynamic habitat systems and evolving biota in restoration strategies. A preliminary framework for stream habitat restoration emphasizing stream habitat-biota development is proposed, As developing systems, streams and stream biota exhibit temporal behaviors that change with stream environments. Underlying the dynamic development of streams is potential capacity. Streams express this capacity as an array of habitats over time and across the landscape. Human land uses in the western United States have rapidly altered aquatic habitats and the processes that shape habitat. As a result, the diversity of native fishes and. their habitats has been suppressed. Restoration is fundamentally about allowing stream systems to reexpress their capacities. Several steps are provided to guide stream restoration activities. Key tasks include: identification of the historic patterns of habitat development; identification of developmental constraints; relief of those constraints; classification of sensitive, critical, or refuge habitats; protection of the developmental diversity that remains; and monitoring of biotic responses to habitat development.

AB Effects of soil scarification on long-term site productivity up to 70 years, and soil content of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and macro nutrients, were studied in five site preparation experiments, established between 1922 and 1965 on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) heathland, on poor sandy sediments, The soil was inverted by spade, heed, harrowed or ploughed. All scarification methods disturbed close to 100% of the soil surface, the most radical treatments to a depth of approximately 20 cm, Some of the experiments had an inadequate original design. However, by comparing the experiments some general characteristics were found. Site productivity measured as top height was higher on scarified plots than on control plots (P < 0.05), indicating that long-term site productivity was improved by scarification. Total C and N contents in soil were 6-41% and 16-30%, respectively, lower on scarified plots compared with control plots, On scarified plots, all mineral elements analysed showed equal or lower contents in the organic layer, including the field layer, ground layer, organic debris, and humus. Total contents of P, Mg and S in mineral soil samples from 60-100 cm depth were higher on scarified plots than in corresponding samples from control plots. On the two burned plots analysed, total C content in the soil was 2 and 31% lower than on controls, and total N content 10% higher and 63% lower. The results suggest that the risk for decreased long-term productivity on poor Scots pine sites caused by mechanical scarification methods used today are negligible.

AB The numbers of intestinal helminth species (parasite richness) recorded from each of 488 vertebrate host species are compared using data compiled from the published literature. Associations between parasite richness, sampling effort, host size and host habitat (aquatic versus terrestrial) are assessed using a method designed to control for phylogenetic association. Parasite richness increases with the number of surveys on which each estimate of parasite richness is based (sampling effort). When the effects of sampling effort are controlled for, there remains a strong positive relationship between parasite richness and host body size. There is no tendency for aquatic hosts to harbour more parasite species than terrestrial hosts independently of differences in sampling effort and body size. The results are interpreted in the context of hosts representing habitats for parasite colonization, resource allocation between parasite species, and the age of the major mammalian radiations.

AB Assemblages of diving beetles (Dytiscidae) and mosquito immatures (Culicidae) were studied during 1987-1988 in 40 small, more or less temporary, snowmelt pools in spruce swamp forest and clearings at the Arctic Circle in Sweden. Larger pools were warmer than smaller ones, and clearing pools were warmer than forest pools. Temperature differences between pools remained high until late July. Twenty-one dytiscid species, representing three guilds, occurred in the pools, and individual pools had 1-13 species. Ten species occurred in both habitats. A few stenotopic species of boreal swamp forests had in clearing pools apparently been replaced by some species with a preference for more productive, often man-made habitats. Six Aedes species were collected in the clearing pools. Five of these were found in the forest pools, of which three had no mosquito larvae. Dytiscid assemblages in both habitats and culicid assemblages in clearing pools showed strong nested patterns.
   Abundance and species richness of both culicids and dytiscids were higher in clearing than in forest pools with an area < 2 m(2) after that the effects of pool area had been accounted for (MANCOVA). In both habitats, abundance and species richness of both culicids and dytiscids were strongly and positively correlated with a linear combination of pool area, depth and temperature (Canonical Correlation). Increasing drought frequency of pools had a negative, less significant effect on the biota. In the clearing, the abiotic correlations with abundance were somewhat weakened chiefly by the relatively low abundance values from the largest pool.
   Distribution and mean abundance of individual dytiscid species were positively related in the clearing pools. Flying dytiscids were trapped in the larger (1.6 m(2)), but not in the smaller (0.07 m(2)) artificial pools, and the immigration rate was markedly higher on clearings than in forest. Dug pools were colonized faster on clearings than in forest. Even the flightless Hydroporus melanarius colonized dug pools during the first year.

AB A recent trend in some quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions using palaeoecological data is to use very many samples and rather few taxa. The question addressed here is, does high taxonomic precision improve quantitative estimates of past environmental variables derived from a commonly used reconstruction procedure: namely weighted averaging regression and calibration? Two modern data-sets, one of pollen spectra from southern Sweden and one of diatom assemblages from northwest Europe are used in weighted averaging regression and calibration to infer pH values. The root mean square of the pH prediction error is estimated by bootstrapping. The lowest prediction error occurs when all taxa are included in the numerical analyses. The implications of the need for high taxonomic precision in such quantitative analyses involving weighted averaging are discussed in terms of the development of sets of modern surface samples.

ID SUCCESSIONS; PASSERINES; SONGBIRDS; DECLINE
AB Ultimate factors underlying forest bird responses to human caused landscape changes are examined by comparing European and North American avifaunas, their history, taxonomic composition, and present day characteristic. Taxonomically, resident species show stronger affinities between the two continents than migrant birds. European avifauna is by and large of Palaeartic origin with only little Afrotropical or New World influence. By contrast, both Palaearctic and tropical elements are prominent in North American bird fauna. The taxonomical differences can be traced back to the Plio-Pleistocene history, and geographical configuration of the continental land masses. Human impact has also been of earlier origin and more drastic to European than to North American birds. The contemporary avifaunas of the two continents can be roughly grouped into three categories according to 'sensitivity' to human induced landscape changes. The western Palaearctic species group is not particularly sensitive to human impact due to preadaptations to the loss of habitats. For the American species group, the human induced framentation and habitat loss is an unpreceeded event which they have not had possibilities during their Pleistocene history to evolve adaptations to. The Siberian or Siberian-Canadian group of species is adapted to dynamic boreal landscapes but not to large-scale human caused alterations of habitats. Future population trends for the three species groups are outlined given the present trends in land use practices.

AB Beavers were re-introduced in the Biesbosch, The Netherlands, a wood dominated by willows Salix spp. Conservationists expected that herbivory by beavers would enhance succession to a mixed broad-leaved forest. Willows formed the staple food of the beavers, but they removed only 1.4% of the standing crop. rn the future, this might increase to 5%, which is roughly one-third of the regrowth of these willows. Non-willow species such as Alnus, Corylus, Fraxinus, Populus and Prunus were very uncommon in the Biesbosch, but they were positively selected by beavers away fr om the den and - in one year - away from the water. Beavers were possibly selecting complementary nutrients, choosing Corylus and Fraxinus for Na, and Prunus and Populus for p. Alternatively, they may have been eating a mixed diet as a strategy to avoid dietary deficiencies of whatever type. We conclude that the beavers will not enhance the succession to a more mixed forest, because they selectively remove non-willow tree species. In any case, we doubt whether such a succession would take place without restoration of a more natural water regime.

AB The bird populations of sixteen small isolated woodlands were enumerated and their pattems of abundance and species richness were analysed in relation to both between-patch (patch area, isolation, shape) and within-patch (habitat physiognomy) structure. The distribution of birds was found to be primarily related to landscape structure represented by an underlying gradient of habitat fragmentation. Three main pattems of avian patch occupancy were identified: woodland species, edge species and ubiquitous species. These pattems were explained due to the effects of landscape structure acting on individual populations consistent with metapopulation models. Numbers of woodland species declined over the fragmentation gradient whilst numbers of edge species increased. Pattems of avian distribution at the regional landscape were related to those at the broader national scale and results support the hypothesis that British mainland woodland bird distribution could be explained due to the effects of fragmentation.

AB Satellite-based models have been widely used to simulate vegetation gross primary production (GPP) at the site, regional, or global scales in recent years. However, accurately reproducing the interannual variations in GPP remains a major challenge, and the long-term changes in GPP remain highly uncertain. In this study, we generated a long-term global GPP dataset at 0.05 degrees latitude by 0.05 degrees longitude and 8 d interval by revising a light use efficiency model (i.e., EC-LUE model). In the revised EC-LUE model, we integrated the regulations of several major environmental variables: atmospheric CO2 concentration, radiation components, and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD). These environmental variables showed substantial long-term changes, which could greatly impact the global vegetation productivity. Eddy covariance (EC) measurements at 95 towers from the FLUXNET2015 dataset, covering nine major ecosystem types around the globe, were used to calibrate and validate the model. In general, the revised EC-LUE model could effectively reproduce the spatial, seasonal, and annual variations in the tower-estimated GPP at most sites. The revised EC-LUE model could explain 71 % of the spatial variations in annual GPP over 95 sites. At more than 95 % of the sites, the correlation coefficients (R-2) of seasonal changes between tower-estimated and model-simulated GPP are larger than 0.5. Particularly, the revised EC-LUE model improved the model performance in reproducing the interannual variations in GPP, and the averaged R-2 between annual mean tower-estimated and model-simulated GPP is 0.44 over all 55 sites with observations longer than 5 years, which is significantly higher than those of the original EC-LUE model (R-2 = 0.36) and other LUE models (R-2 ranged from 0.06 to 0.30 with an average value of 0.16). At the global scale, GPP derived from light use efficiency models, machine learning models, and process-based biophysical models shows substantial differences in magnitude and interannual variations. The revised EC-LUE model quantified the mean global GPP from 1982 to 2017 as 106.2 +/- 2.9 Pg C yr(-1) with the trend 0.15 Pg C yr(-1). Sensitivity analysis indicated that GPP simulated by the revised EC-LUE model was sensitive to atmospheric CO2 concentration, VPD, and radiation. Over the period of 1982-2017, the CO2 fertilization effect on the global GPP (0.22 +/- 0.07 Pg C yr(-1)) could be partly offset by increased VPD (-0.17 +/- 0.06 Pg C yr(-1)). The long-term changes in the environmental variables could be well reflected in global GPP. Overall, the revised EC-LUE model is able to provide a reliable long-term estimate of global GPP. The GPP dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8942336.v3 (Zheng et al., 2019).

AB In 2012, an unusual outbreak of urban malaria was reported from Djibouti City in the Horn of Africa and increasingly severe out-breaks have been reported annually ever since. Subsequent investigations discovered the presence of an Asian mosquito species; Anopheles stephensi, a species known to thrive in urban environments. Since that first report, An. stephensi has been identified in Ethiopia and Sudan, and this worrying development has prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to publish a vector alert calling for active mosquito surveillance in the region. Using an up-to-date database of published locational records for An. stephensi across its full range (Asia, Arabian Peninsula, Horn of Africa) and a set of spatial models that identify the environmental conditions that characterize a species' preferred habitat, we provide evidence-based maps predicting the possible locations across Africa where An. stephensi could establish if allowed to spread unchecked. Unsurprisingly, due to this species' close association with man-made habitats, our maps predict a high probability of presence within many urban cities across Africa where our estimates suggest that over 126 million people reside. Our results strongly support the WHO's call for surveillance and targeted vector control and provide a basis for the prioritization of surveillance.

AB Invasive plant species can hinder the establishment and growth of native plants and impact several ecosystem properties, such as soil cover, nutrient cycling, fire regimes and hydrology. Controlling invasive plants is then a necessary, yet usually expensive, step towards the restoration of an ecosystem. A synthesis of literature is needed to understand variation in invasive plants' impacts and their practical control in restoration contexts, and to identify associated knowledge gaps. We reviewed 372 articles published from 2000 to 2019 covering the control of undesirable plants (both exotic invasive and overabundant native plant species) in ecological restoration to gather information on the main plants being controlled and methods used, and considering the distribution of studies among biomes and countries grouped according to the Human Development Index (HDI). Grasses and forbs were the most-studied invasive plant species in restoration sites, but invasive trees were well studied in the tropics.PoaceaeandAsteraceaewere the most studied families of invasive plants. Non-chemical interventions (mostly mowing and prescribed fire) were used in more than half of the reviewed studies globally, but chemical methods (mainly glyphosate spraying, used in 40% of projects using herbicides) are also common. The reviewed studies were mostly performed in countries with very high HDI. Countries with low and medium HDI used only non-chemical methods. Synthesis and applications. Decisions about which control method to use depend heavily on the invasive plant species' growth forms, the local economic situation where the restoration sites are located and resources available for control. More developed countries tend to use more chemical control, whereas less developed ones use mainly non-chemical methods. Since most of the reviewed studies were performed in countries with very high HDI, we lack information from developing countries, which concentrates global hotspots for biodiversity conservation and global commitments of forest and landscape restoration.

AB Aim To understand how functional traits and evolutionary history shape the geographic distribution of plant life on Earth, we need to integrate high-quality and global-scale distribution data with functional and phylogenetic information. Large-scale distribution data for plants are, however, often restricted to either certain taxonomic groups or geographic regions. Range maps only exist for a small subset of all plant species and digitally available point-occurrence information is biased both geographically and taxonomically. Floras and checklists represent an alternative, yet rarely used potential source of information. They contain highly curated information about the species composition of a clearly defined area, and together virtually cover the entire global land surface. Here, we report on our recent efforts to mobilize this information for macroecological and biogeographical analyses in the GIFT database, the Global Inventory of Floras and Traits. Location Global. Taxon Land plants (Embryophyta). Methods GIFT integrates plant distributions from regional Floras and checklists with functional traits, phylogenetic information, and region-level geographic, environmental and socio-economic data. It contains information about the floristic status (native, endemic, alien and naturalized) and takes advantage of the wealth of trait information in the regional Floras, complemented by data from global trait databases. Results GIFT 1.0 holds species lists for 2,893 regions across the whole globe including ~315,000 taxonomically standardized species names (i.e. c. 80% of all known land plant species) and ~3 million species-by-region occurrences. Based on a hierarchical and taxonomical derivation scheme, GIFT contains information for 83 functional traits and more than 2.3 million trait-by-species combinations and achieves unprecedented coverage in categorical traits such as woodiness (~233,000 spp.) or growth form (~213,000 spp.). Main conclusions Here, we present the structure, content and automated workflows of GIFT and a corresponding web-interface () as proof of concept for the feasibility and potential of mobilizing aggregated biodiversity data for global macroecological and biogeographical research.

AB Accurately quantifying gross primary production (GPP) globally is critical for assessing plant productivity, carbon balance, and carbon-climate feedbacks, while current GPP estimates exhibit substantial uncertainty. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) observed by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) has offered unprecedented opportunities for monitoring land photosynthesis, while its sparse coverage remains a bottleneck for mapping finer-resolution GPP globally. Here, we used the global, OCO-2-based SIF product (GOSIF) and linear relationships between SIF and GPP to map GPP globally at a 0.05 degrees spatial resolution and 8-day time step for the period from 2000 to 2017. To account for the uncertainty of GPP estimates resulting from the SIF-GPP relationship, we used a total of eight SIF-GPP relationships with different forms (universal and biome-specific, with and without intercept) at both site and grid cell levels to estimate GPP. Our results showed that all of the eight SIF-GPP relationships performed well in estimating GPP globally. The ensemble mean 8-day GPP was generally highly correlated with flux tower GPP for 91 eddy covariance flux sites across the globe (R-2 = 0.74, Root Mean Square Error = 1.92 g C m(-2) d(-1)). Our fine-resolution GPP estimates showed reasonable spatial and seasonal variations across the globe and fully captured both seasonal cycles and spatial patterns present in our coarse-resolution (1 degrees) GPP estimates based on coarse-resolution SIF data directly aggregated from discrete OCO-2 soundings. SIF-GPP relationships with different forms could lead to significant differences in annual GPP particularly in the tropics. Our ensemble global annual GPP estimate (135.5 +/- 8.8 Pg C yr(-1)) is between the median estimate of non-process based methods and the median estimate of process-based models. Our GPP estimates showed interannual variability in many regions and exhibited increasing trends in many parts of the globe particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. With the availability of high-quality, gridded SIF observations from space (e.g., TROPOMI, FLEX), our novel approach does not rely on any other input data (e.g., climate data, soil properties) and therefore can map GPP solely based on satellite SIF observations and potentially lead to more accurate GPP estimates at regional to global scales. The use of a universal SIF-GPP relationship versus biome-specific relationships can also avoid the uncertainty associated with land cover maps. Our novel, independent GPP product (GOSIF GPP), freely available at our data repository, will be valuable for studying photosynthesis, carbon cycle, agricultural production, and ecosystem responses to climate change and disturbances, informing ecosystem management, and benchmarking terrestrial biosphere and Earth system models.

AB Global ecology - the study of the interactions among the Earth's ecosystems, land, atmosphere and oceans - depends crucially on global observations: this paper focuses on space-based observations of global terrestrial ecosystems. Early global ecology relied on an extrapolation of detailed site-level observations, using models of increasing complexity. Modern global ecology has been enabled largely by vegetation indices (greenness) from operational space-based imagery but current capabilities greatly expand scientific possibilities. New observations from spacecraft in orbit allowed an estimation of gross carbon fluxes, photosynthesis, biomass burning, evapotranspiration and biomass, to create virtual eddy covariance sites in the sky. Planned missions will reveal the dimensions of the diversity of life itself. These observations will improve our understanding of the global productivity and carbon storage, land use, carbon cycle-climate feedback, diversity-productivity relationships and enable improved climate forecasts. Advances in remote sensing challenge ecologists to relate information organised by biome and species to new data arrayed by pixels and develop theory to address previously unobserved scales.

AB Objectives: We aimed to construct a mortality prediction model using the random forest (RF) algorithm for acute kidney injury (AKI) patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), and compared its performance with that of two other machine learning models and the customized simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II model.
   Methods: We used medical information mart for intensive care (MIMIC) III database for model development and performance comparison. The RF model uses the same predictor variable set as that of the SAPS II model. We also developed three other models and compared the RF model with the other three models in prediction performance. Three other models include support vector machine (SVM) model, artificial neural network (ANN) model and customized SAPS II model. In model comparison, the prediction performance of each model was assessed by the Brier score, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy and F1 score.
   Results: The final cohort consisted of 19044 patients with AKI in the ICU. The observed in-hospital mortality of AKI patients is 13.6% in the final cohort. The results of model performance comparison show that the Brier score of the RF model is 0.085 (95% CI: 0.084-0.086) and AUROC of the RF model is 0.866 (95% CI: 0.862-0.870). The accuracy of the RF model is 0.728 (95% CI: 0.715-0.741). The F1 score of the RF model is 0.459 (95% CI: 0.449-0.470). The calibration plots show that the RF model slightly overestimates mortality in patients with low risk of death and underestimates mortality in patients with high risk of death.
   Conclusion: There is great potential for the RF model in mortality prediction for AKI patients in ICU. The RF model may be helpful to aid ICU clinicians to make timely clinical intervention decisions for AKI patients, which is critical to help reduce the in-hospital mortality of AKI patients. A prospective study is necessary to evaluate the clinical utility of the RF model.

AB Population genetic data underpin many studies of behavioral, ecological, and evolutionary processes in wild populations and contribute to effective conservation management. However, collecting genetic samples can be challenging when working with endangered, invasive, or cryptic species. Environmental DNA (eDNA) offers a way to sample genetic material non-invasively without requiring visual observation. While eDNA has been trialed extensively as a biodiversity and biosecurity monitoring tool with a strong taxonomic focus, it has yet to be fully explored as a means for obtaining population genetic information. Here, we review current research that employs eDNA approaches for the study of populations. We outline challenges facing eDNA-based population genetic methodologies, and suggest avenues of research for future developments. We advocate that with further optimizations, this emergent field holds great potential as part of the population genetics toolkit.

AB Soils are a fundamental component of terrestrial ecosystems, and play key roles in biogeochemical cycles and the ecology of microbial, plant and animal communities. Global increases in the intensity and frequency of ecological disturbances are driving major changes in the structure and function of forest ecosystems, yet little is known about the long-term impacts of disturbance on soils. Here we show that natural disturbance (fire) and human disturbances (clearcut logging and post-fire salvage logging) can significantly alter the composition of forest soils for far longer than previously recognized. Using extensive sampling across a multi-century chronosequence in some of the tallest and most carbon-dense forests worldwide (southern Australian, mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests), we provide compelling evidence that disturbance impacts on soils are evident up to least eight decades after disturbance, and potentially much longer. Relative to long-undisturbed forest (167 years old), sites subject to multiple fires, clearcut logging or salvage logging were characterized by soils with significantly lower values of a range of ecologically important measures at multiple depths, including available phosphorus and nitrate. Disturbance impacts on soils were most pronounced on sites subject to compounding perturbations, such as multiple fires and clearcut logging. Long-lasting impacts of disturbance on soil can have major ecological and functional implications.

AB The subtribe Espeletiinae (Asteraceae), endemic to the high-elevations in the Northern Andes, exhibits an exceptional diversity of species, growth-forms, and reproductive strategies. This complex of 140 species includes large trees, dichotomous trees, shrubs and the extraordinary giant caulescent rosettes, considered as a classic example of adaptation in tropical high-elevation ecosystems. The subtribe has also long been recognized as a prominent case of adaptive radiation, but the understanding of its evolution has been hampered by a lack of phylogenetic resolution. Herein, we produce the first fully resolved phylogeny of all morphological groups of Espeletiinae, using whole plastomes and about a million nuclear nucleotides obtained with an original de novo assembly procedure without reference genome, and analyzed with traditional and coalescent-based approaches that consider the possible impact of incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization on phylogenetic inference. We show that the diversification of Espeletiinae started from a rosette ancestor about 2.3 Ma, after the final uplift of the Northern Andes. This was followed by two independent radiations in the Colombian and Venezuelan Andes, with a few trans-cordilleran dispersal events among low-elevation tree lineages but none among high-elevation rosettes. We demonstrate complex scenarios of morphological change in Espeletiinae, usually implying the convergent evolution of growth-forms with frequent loss/gains of various traits. For instance, caulescent rosettes evolved independently in both countries, likely as convergent adaptations to life in tropical high-elevation habitats. Tree growth-forms evolved independently three times from the repeated colonization of lower elevations by high-elevation rosette ancestors. The rate of morphological diversification increased during the early phase of the radiation, after which it decreased steadily towards the present. On the other hand, the rate of species diversification in the best-sampled Venezuelan radiation was on average very high (3.1 spp/My), with significant rate variation among growth-forms (much higher in polycarpic caulescent rosettes). Our results point out a scenario where both adaptive morphological evolution and geographical isolation due to Pleistocene climatic oscillations triggered an exceptionally rapid radiation for a continental plant group.

AB Studies of genetic adaptation in plant populations along elevation gradients in mountains have a long history, but there has until now been neither a synthesis of how frequently plant populations exhibit adaptation to elevation nor an evaluation of how consistent underlying trait differences across species are. We reviewed studies of adaptation along elevation gradients (i) from a meta-analysis of phenotypic differentiation of three traits (height, biomass and phenology) from plants growing in 70 common garden experiments; (ii) by testing elevation adaptation using three fitness proxies (survival, reproductive output and biomass) from 14 reciprocal transplant experiments; (iii) by qualitatively assessing information at the molecular level, from 10 genomewide surveys and candidate gene approaches. We found that plants originating from high elevations were generally shorter and produced less biomass, but phenology did not vary consistently. We found significant evidence for elevation adaptation in terms of survival and biomass, but not for reproductive output. Variation in phenotypic and fitness responses to elevation across species was not related to life history traits or to environmental conditions. Molecular studies, which have focussed mainly on loci related to plant physiology and phenology, also provide evidence for adaptation along elevation gradients. Together, these studies indicate that genetically based trait differentiation and adaptation to elevation are widespread in plants. We conclude that a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying adaptation, not only to elevation but also to environmental change, will require more studies combining the ecological and molecular approaches.

AB Habitat conversion is driving biodiversity loss and restructuring species assemblages across the globe. Responses to habitat conversion vary widely, however, and little is known about the degree to which shared evolutionary history underlies changes in species richness and composition. We analyzed data from 48 studies, comprising 438 species on five continents, to understand how taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of amphibian assemblages shifts in response to habitat conversion. We found that evolutionary history explains the majority of variation in species' responses to habitat conversion, with specific clades scattered across the amphibian tree of life being favored by human land uses. Habitat conversion led to an average loss of 139 million years of amphibian evolutionary history within assemblages, high species and lineage turnover at landscape scales, and phylogenetic homogenization at the global scale (despite minimal taxonomic homogenization). Lineage turnover across habitats was greatest in lowland tropical regions where large species pools and stable climates have perhaps given rise to many microclimatically specialized species. Together, our results indicate that strong phylogenetic clustering of species' responses to habitat conversion mediates nonrandom structuring of local assemblages and loss of global phylogenetic diversity. In an age of rapid global change, identifying clades that are most sensitive to habitat conversion will help prioritize use of limited conservation resources.

AB The biogeochemical and stoichiometric signature of vegetation fire may influence post-fire ecosystem characteristics and the evolution of plant 'fire traits'. Phosphorus (P), a potentially limiting nutrient in many fire-prone environments, might be particularly important in this context; however, the effects of fire on P cycling often vary widely. We conducted a global-scale meta-analysis using data from 174 soil studies and 39 litter studies, and found that fire led to significantly higherconcentrations of soil mineral P as well as significantly lower soil and litter carbon:P and nitrogen:P ratios. These results demonstrate that fire has a P-rich signature in the soil-plant system that varies with vegetation type. Further, they suggest that burning can ease P limitation and decouple the biogeochemical cycling of P, carbon and nitrogen. These effects resemble a transient reversion to an earlier stage of ecosystem development, and likely underpin at least some of fire's impacts on ecosystems and organisms.

AB Beetles, representing the majority of the insect species diversity, are characterized by thick and hard cuticle, which plays important roles for their environmental adaptation and underpins their inordinate diversity and prosperity. Here, we report a bacterial endosymbiont extremely specialized for sustaining beetle's cuticle formation. Many weevils are associated with gamma-proteobacterial endosymbiont lineage Nardonella, whose evolutionary origin is estimated as older than 100 million years, but its functional aspect has been elusive. Sequencing of Nardonella genomes from diverse weevils unveiled drastic size reduction to 0.2 Mb, in which minimal complete gene sets for bacterial replication, transcription, and translation were present but almost all of the other metabolic pathway genes were missing. Notably, the only metabolic pathway retained in the Nardonella genomes was the tyrosine synthesis pathway, identifying tyrosine provisioning as Nardonella's sole biological role. Weevils are armored with hard cuticle, tyrosine is the principal precursor for cuticle formation, and experimental suppression of Nardonella resulted in emergence of reddish and soft weevils with low tyrosine titer, confirming the importance of Nardonella-mediated tyrosine production for host's cuticle formation and hardening. Notably, Nardonella's tyrosine synthesis pathway was incomplete, lacking the final step transaminase gene. RNA sequencing identified host's aminotransferase genes up-regulated in the bacteriome. RNA interference targeting the aminotransferase genes induced reddish and soft weevils with low tyrosine titer, verifying host's final step regulation of the tyrosine synthesis pathway. Our finding highlights an impressively intimate and focused aspect of the host-symbiont metabolic integrity via streamlined evolution for a single biological function of ecological relevance.

AB Recent observations of N-2 fixation rates (NFR) and the presence of nitrogenase (nifH) genes from heterotrophic N-2-fixing (diazotrophic) prokaryotes in unusual habitats challenge the paradigm that pelagic marine N-2 fixation is constrained to cyanobacteria in warm, oligotrophic, surface waters. Here, we compare NFR and diazotrophic diversity (assessed via high-throughput nifH sequencing) from a region known to be dominated by cyanobacterial diazotrophs (the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, NPSG) to two regions dominated by heterotrophic diazotrophs: the Eastern South Pacific (ESP, from the Chilean upwelling system to the subtropical gyre) and the Pacific Northwest coastal upwelling system (PNW). We observed distinct biogeographical patterns among the three regions. Diazotrophic community structure differed strongly between the NPSG, dominated by cyanobacterium UCYN-A, and the ESP, dominated by heterotrophic nifH group 1J/1K, yet surface NFR were similar in magnitude (up to 5.1 nmol N L-1 d(-1)). However, while diverse, predominantly heterotrophic nifH genes were recovered from the PNW and the mesopelagic of the NPSG, NFR were undetectable in both of these environments (although glucose amendments stimulated low rates in the deep NPSG). Our work suggests that while diazotrophs may be nearly omnipresent in marine waters, the activity of this functional group is regionally restricted. Further, we show that the detection limits of the N-15(2) fixation assay suggest that many of the low NFR reported for the mesopelagic (often< 0.1 nmol N L-1 d(-1) in the literature) are not indicative of active diazotrophy, highlighting the challenges of assessing the ecosystem significance of heterotrophic diazotrophs.

AB 1. Drought induces changes in the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycle but most plant species have limited flexibility to take up nutrients under such variable or unbalanced N and P availability. Both the degree of flexibility in plant N:P ratio and of root symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi might control plant resistance to drought-induced changes in nutrient availability, but this has not been directly tested.
   2. Here, we examined the role of plant N:P stoichiometric status and mycorrhizal symbiosis in the drought-resistance of dominant and subordinate species in a semi-natural grassland.
   3. We reduced water availability using rainout shelters (control vs. drought) and measured how plant biomass responded for the dominant and subordinate species. We then selected a dominant (Paspalum dilatatum) and a subordinate species (Cynodon dactylon), for which we investigated the N:P stoichiometric status, mycorrhizal root colonization and water-use efficiency.
   4. The biomass of all dominant plant species, but not subordinate species, decreased under drought. Drought increased soil available nitrogen, and thus increased soil N:P ratio, due to decreasing plant N uptake. The dominant P. dilatatum showed a high degree of plant N:P homeostasis and a considerable reduction in biomass under drought. At the opposite, the more flexible subordinate species C. dactylon increased its N uptake and water-use efficiency, apparently due to stronger symbiosis with mycorrhizae, and maintained its biomass.
   5. Synthesis. We conclude that the maintenance of N:P homeostasis in dominant species, possibly because of a large root nutrient foraging capacity, becomes inefficient when water stress limits N mobility in the soil. By contrast, we demonstrate that higher stoichiometric N:P flexibility coupled with stronger mutualistic association with mycorrhizae allow subordinate species to better withstand drought perturbations. Using a stoichiometric approach in a field experiment, our study provides for the first time clear and novel understandings of the mechanisms involved in drought-resistance within the plant-mycorrhizae-soil system.

AB One of the key questions regarding the underlying mechanisms of mammalian land migrations is how animals select where to go. Most studies assume perception of resources as the navigational mechanism. The possible role of memory that would allow forecasting conditions at distant locations and times based on information about environmental conditions from previous years has been little studied. We study migrating zebra in Botswana using an individual-based simulation model, where perceptually guided individuals use currently sensed resources at different perceptual ranges, while memory guided individuals use long-term averages of past resources to forecast future conditions. We compare simulated individuals guided by perception or memory on resource landscapes of remotely sensed vegetation data to trajectories of GPS-tagged zebras. Our results show that memory provides a clear signal that best directs migrants to their destination compared to perception at even the largest perceptual ranges. Zebras modelled with memory arrived two to four times, or up to 100 km, closer to the migration destination than those using perception. We suggest that memory in addition to perception is important for directing ungulate migration. Furthermore, our findings are important for the conservation of migratory mammals, as memory informing direction suggests migration routes could be relatively inflexible.

AB Reducing chlorophyll (chl) content may improve the conversion efficiency of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation into biomass and therefore yield in dense monoculture crops by improving light penetration and distribution within the canopy. The effects of reduced chl on leaf and canopy photosynthesis and photosynthetic efficiency were studied in two reportedly robust reduced-chl soybean mutants, Y11y11 and y9y9, in comparison to the wild-type (WT) "Clark" cultivar. Both mutants were characterized during the 2012 growing season whereas only the Y11y11 mutant was characterized during the 2013 growing season. Chl deficiency led to greater rates of leaf-level photosynthesis per absorbed photon early in the growing season when mutant chl content was similar to 35% of the WT, but there was no effect on photosynthesis later in the season when mutant leaf chl approached 50% of the WT. Transient benefits of reduced chl at the leaf level did not translate to improvements in canopy-level processes. Reduced pigmentation in these mutants was linked to lower water use efficiency, which may have dampened any photosynthetic benefits of reduced chl, especially since both growing seasons experienced significant drought conditions. These results, while not confirming our hypothesis or an earlier published study in which the Y11y11 mutant significantly outyielded the WT, do demonstrate that soybean significantly overinvests in chl. Despite a > 50% chl reduction, there was little negative impact on biomass accumulation or yield, and the small negative effects present were likely due to pleiotropic effects of the mutation. This outcome points to an opportunity to reinvest nitrogen and energy resources that would otherwise be used in pigmentproteins into increasing biochemical photosynthetic capacity, thereby improving canopy photosynthesis and biomass production.

AB Long-term, high-resolution data about hydrologic fluxes and states are needed for many hydrological applications. Because continuous large-scale observations of such variables are not feasible, hydrologic or land surface models are applied to derive them. This study aims to analyze and provide a consistent high-resolution dataset of land surface variables over Germany, accounting for uncertainties caused by equifinal model parameters. The mesoscale Hydrological Model (mHM) is employed to derive an ensemble (100 members) of evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, soil moisture, and runoff generated at high spatial and temporal resolutions (4 km and daily, respectively) for the period 1951-2010. The model is cross-evaluated against the observed daily streamflow in 222 basins, which are not used for model calibration. The mean (standard deviation) of the ensemble median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency estimated for these basins is 0.68 (0.09) for daily streamflow simulations. The modeled evapotranspiration and soil moisture reasonably represent the observations from eddy covariance stations. Our analysis indicates the lowest parametric uncertainty for evapotranspiration, and the largest is observed for groundwater recharge. The uncertainty of the hydrologic variables varies over the course of a year, with the exception of evapotranspiration, which remains almost constant. This study emphasizes the role of accounting for the parametric uncertainty in modelderived hydrological datasets.

AB Insect pollinators are essential to global food production. For this reason, it is alarming that honey bee (Apis mellifera) populations across the world have recently seen increased rates of mortality. These changes in colony mortality are often ascribed to one or more factors including parasites, diseases, pesticides, nutrition, habitat dynamics, weather and/or climate. However, the effect of climate on colony mortality has never been demonstrated. Therefore, in this study, we focus on longer-term weather conditions and/or climate's influence on honey bee winter mortality rates across Austria. Statistical correlations between monthly climate variables and winter mortality rates were investigated. Our results indicate that warmer and drier weather conditions in the preceding year were accompanied by increased winter mortality. We subsequently built a statistical model to predict colony mortality using temperature and precipitation data as predictors. Our model reduces the mean absolute error between predicted and observed colony mortalities by 9% and is statistically significant at the 99.9% confidence level. This is the first study to show clear evidence of a link between climate variability and honey bee winter mortality. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Nature has provided humankind with food, fuel, and shelter throughout evolutionary history. However, in contemporary cities, many natural landscapes have become degraded and replaced with impermeable hard surfaces (e.g., roads, paving, car parks and buildings). The reversal of this trend is dynamic, complex and still in its infancy. There are many facets of urban greening initiatives involving multiple benefits, sensitivities and limitations. The aim of this paper is to develop a characterisation method of nature based solutions for designing and retrofitting in the built environment, and to facilitate knowledge transfer between disciplines and for design optimisation. Based on a review of the literature across disciplines, key characteristics could be organised into four groups: policy and community initiatives, multiple benefits assessment, topology, and design options. Challenges and opportunities for developing a characterisation framework to improve the use of nature based solutions in the built environment are discussed.

AB Exploring the link between above- and belowground biodiversity has been a major theme of recent ecological research, due in large part to the increasingly well-recognized role that soil microorganisms play in driving plant community processes. In this study, we utilized a field-based tree experiment in Minnesota, USA, to assess the effect of changes in plant species richness and phylogenetic diversity on the richness and composition of both ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungal communities. We found that ectomycorrhizal fungal species richness was significantly positively influenced by increasing plant phylogenetic diversity, while saprotrophic fungal species richness was significantly affected by plant leaf nitrogen content, specific root length and standing biomass. The increasing ectomycorrhizal fungal richness associated with increasing plant phylogenetic diversity was driven by the combined presence of ectomycorrhizal fungal specialists in plots with both gymnosperm and angiosperm hosts. Although the species composition of both the ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungal communities changed significantly in response to changes in plant species composition, the effect was much greater for ectomycorrhizal fungi. In addition, ectomycorrhizal but not saprotrophic fungal species composition was significantly influenced by both plant phylum (angiosperm, gymnosperm, both) and origin (Europe, America, both). The phylum effect was caused by differences in ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition, while the origin effect was attributable to differences in community heterogeneity. Taken together, this study emphasizes that plant-associated effects on soil fungal communities are largely guild-specific and provides a mechanistic basis for the positive link between plant phylogenetic diversity and ectomycorrhizal fungal richness.

AB Terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) are two key ecosystem fluxes in the global carbon and water cycles. As carbon and water fluxes are inherently linked, knowing one provides information for the other. However, tightly coupled and easy to use ecosystem models are rare and there are still large uncertainties in global carbon and water flux estimates. In this study, we developed a new monthly coupled carbon and water (CCW) model. GPP was estimated based on the light-use efficiency (LUE) theory that considered the effect of diffuse radiation, while ET was modeled based on GPP and water-use efficiency (WUE). We evaluated the non-linear effect of single (GPP(OR)) or combined (GPP(AND)) limitations of temperature and vapor pressure deficit on GPP. We further compared the effects of three types of WUE (i.e., WUE, inherent WUE, and underlying WUE) on ET (i.e., ETWUE, E-IWUE and ETUWUE). CCW was calibrated and validated using global eddy covariance measurement from FLUXNET and remote sensing data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 2000 to 2007. Modeled GPP(AND) and GPP(OR) explained 67.3% and 66.8% of variations of tower-derived GPP, respectively, while ETUWUE, E-IWUE and ETWUE explained 65.7%, 59.9% and 58.1% of tower-measured ET, respectively. Consequently, we chose GPPAND and ETuwuE as the best modeling framework for CCW, and estimated global GPP as 134.2 Pg Cyr(-1) and ET as 57.0 x 10(3) km(3) for vegetated areas in 2001. Global ET estimated by CCW compared favorably with MODIS ET (60.5 x 10(3) km(3)) and ET derived from global precipitation (56.5 x 10(3) km(3)). However, global GPP estimated by CCW was about 19% higher than MODIS GPP (109.0 Pg C yr(-1)). The mean global WUE value estimated by CCW (2.35 g C kg(-1) H2O) was close to the mean tower-based WUE (2.60 g C kg(-1) H2O), but was much higher than the WUE derived from MODIS products (1.80 g C kg(-1) H2O). We concluded that the new simple CCW model provided improved estimates of GPP and ET. The biome-specific parameters derived in this study allow CCW to be further linked with land use change models to project human impacts on terrestrial ecosystem functions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Measures of soil nutrient availability such as concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus ([N] and [P]) are important indicators of terrestrial productivity. Optimal plant growth and ecosystem functioning are also strongly correlated with nutrient ratios in soils. Long-term trends in soil [C], [N], [P], and their stoichiometric ratios during secondary succession in the fire-driven boreal forest remain unclear. We used replicated 7- to 209-year chronosequences to examine the influence of stand age and overstory composition on [C], [N], and [P] and their ratios in the forest floor, surface (0-15 cm), and subsurface (15-30 cm) mineral soil in the boreal forest of central Canada. In the forest floor, [C] and [N] increased rapidly during the first three decades following fire, after which they fluctuated, but remained larger than in the youngest stands. Surface soil [C] and [N] increased from young to intermediate-aged stands, but decreased in the oldest stands. Subsurface [C] and [N] followed a similar trend, but was higher in the 7-year-old stands. Forest floor [P] followed a gradual, linear increase throughout stand development but of smaller magnitude than [C] and [N]. The temporal pattern of [P] in both mineral soil layers was lower in the 33-year-old stands of all overstory types, suggesting that P resources may be outpaced by their demand during this highly competitive stage of advanced stem exclusion during forest succession. In the forest floor and surface soil, C:N differed not only with stand age but also with overstory type, due to higher C:N in intermediate-aged conifer stands. Forest floor C:P and N:P were higher in the 33- to 146-year-old stands in all overstory types and soil layers, but particularly so in the conifer stands. In the mineral layers, C:N, C: P, and N:P all followed a similar trend. Our results demonstrate the important influence of stand age, overstory composition (as influenced by succession), and soil depth on forest soil nutrient dynamics in boreal forest ecosystems.

AB Intermittent rivers are naturally dynamic ecosystems in which flow cessation and riverbed drying cause temporal fluctuations in aquatic biodiversity. We analysed datasets from intermittent rivers in different climate zones across the world to examine responses of aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages to drying, in relation to both taxonomic composition and traits of resistance and resilience. First, we compared the differences in taxonomic richness and turnover and in trait diversity, richness and redundancy before and after intermittent sites dried with the differences in concurrently sampled perennial sites. We found such high levels of variation in the before-after differences at intermittent and perennial sites that we could not detect statistical differences between them. Second, we examined the effects of climate (arid, Mediterranean, temperate) and durations of dry and post-dry (flowing) periods on responses to drying at intermittent sites. Only climate had a detectable effect; the proportion of taxa at intermittent sites that persisted through drying-rewetting phases was greatest in arid-zone rivers. Regardless of climate, the invertebrates that persisted at intermittent sites were dominated by taxa resistant to drying. By contrast, taxa that persisted at perennial sites had fewer traits conferring resistance but more conferring resilience. The contributions of resistance and resilience combined with the presence of both intermittent and perennial reaches likely supports the long-term stability and persistence of communities in intermittent rivers, despite the inherently high variation in short-term responses to drying.

AB Large carnivores inhabiting human-dominated landscapes often interact with people and their properties, leading to conflict scenarios that can mislead carnivore management and, ultimately, jeopardize conservation. In northwest Spain, brown bears Ursus arctos are strictly protected, whereas sympatric wolves Canis lupus are subject to lethal control. We explored ecological, economic and societal components of conflict scenarios involving large carnivores and damages to human properties. We analyzed the relation between complaints of depredations by bears and wolves on beehives and livestock, respectively, and bear and wolf abundance, livestock heads, number of culled wolves, amount of paid compensations, and media coverage. We also evaluated the efficiency of wolf culling to reduce depredations on livestock. Bear damages to beehives correlated positively to the number of female bears with cubs of the year. Complaints of wolf predation on livestock were unrelated to livestock numbers; instead, they correlated positively to the number of wild ungulates harvested during the previous season, the number of wolf packs, and to wolves culled during the previous season. Compensations for wolf complaints were fivefold higher than for bears, but media coverage of wolf damages was thirty-fold higher. Media coverage of wolf damages was unrelated to the actual costs of wolf damages, but the amount of news correlated positively to wolf culling. However, wolf culling was followed by an increase in compensated damages. Our results show that culling of the wolf population failed in its goal of reducing damages, and suggest that management decisions are at least partly mediated by press coverage. We suggest that our results provide insight to similar scenarios, where several species of large carnivores share the landscape with humans, and management may be reactive to perceived conflicts.

AB Wildfire activity is projected to increase in boreal forests as a result of climate warming. The consequences of increased wildfire activity for soil carbon (C) storage in boreal forests may depend on the sensitivity of soil microbes to fire severity, but microbial responses to boreal forest fire severity are not well known. Here, we combine remote sensing of fire severity and field sampling to characterize the response of soil microbial biomass per g soil, microbial respiration of CO2 per g soil, and fungal groups to fire severity in a boreal forest ecosystem. We used remote sensing measurements of differenced normalized burn ratio from Landsat as a measure of fire severity. Our results demonstrate that fire severity controls soil microbial responses to boreal forest fires. In comparison to unburned stands, burned stands had a 52% and 56% reduction in soil microbial biomass and basal respiration, respectively. Within burned stands, we found that microbial biomass and basal respiration significantly declined with increasing fire severity. In addition, mycorrhizal taxa and basidiomycetes displayed particularly low tolerances for severe fire. Although wildfires result in the immediate loss of soil C, our study provides evidence that decreases in microbial biomass and respiration following high severity fires may reduce the capacity of the soil microbial community to decompose soil C over longer time scales. Therefore, models of C cycle responses to climate warming may need to represent the sensitivity of microbial biomass and fungal community composition to fire severity in boreal forests.

AB 1. The quest for 'assembly rules', that is the processes shaping the species composition of communities, is a central issue in community ecology. Nevertheless, so far there is no general agreement on a framework to detect assembly rules in real-life data: several key elements are still missing or heavily disputed, including the choice of the appropriate test statistic (e.g. functional diversity index) and randomization strategy for each major assembly process.
   2. Simulation studies based on artificial communities can help to explore the usefulness of different approaches in detecting assembly rules. Nevertheless, the currently dominant approach to simulate artificial communities (i.e. selecting species from a pool based solely on trait values) oversimplifies the complex processes involved in community assembly and thus fails to produce realistic patterns. Consequently, its value for testing methodologies is seriously limited.
   3. In this study, we implemented a flexible, individual-based algorithm simulating real-life community processes (individuals are born, survive, compete for resources, reproduce and die), to generate artificial species composition data. With the help of this algorithm, we estimated the type I error rates and the statistical power of five different diversity indices (FRic, Rao's quadratic entropy, FEve, the variance of functional distances, and the variance of nearest-neighbour distances) in combination with three randomization strategies (randomization of trait values in the whole data set, within-plots and within the range of trait values occurring in each plot) for detecting two underlying assembly processes (habitat filtering and limiting similarity). We also tested the influence of all adjustable simulation parameters on the simulation results in a sensitivity analysis framework.
   4. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the individual-based simulation framework proposed here can be used for creating artificial community data with realistic pattern of trait values. Based on the results, Rao's quadratic entropy performed best for detecting both habitat filtering (trait convergence) and limiting similarity (trait divergence). Functional richness may also be suitable for detect traiting convergence. Functional evenness and variance of nearest-neighbour distances, however, should not be used for finding assembly rules.

AB We developed a conceptual framework for evaluating the process of ecological restoration and applied it to 10 examples of restoration projects in the northern hemisphere. We identified three major phases, planning, implementation, and monitoring, in the restoration process. We found that evaluation occurred both within and between the three phases, that it included both formal and informal components, and that it often had an impact on the performance of the projects. Most evaluations were short-term and only some parts of them were properly documented. Poor or short-term evaluation of the restoration process creates a risk that inefficient methods will continue to be used, which reduces the efficiency and effectiveness of restoration. To improve the restoration process and to transfer the knowledge to future projects, we argue for more formal, sustained evaluation procedures, involving all relevant stakeholders, and increased and improved documentation and dissemination of the results.

AB Soil is the key resource that must be managed to ensure sustainable forest productivity. Soil microbial communities mediate numerous essential ecosystem functions, and recent studies show that forest harvesting alters soil community composition. From a long-term soil productivity study site in a temperate coniferous forest in British Columbia, 21 forest soil shotgun metagenomes were generated, totaling 187 Gb. A method to analyze unassembled metagenome reads from the complex community was optimized and validated. The subsequent metagenome analysis revealed that, 12 years after forest harvesting, there were 16% and 8% reductions in relative abundances of biomass decomposition genes in the organic and mineral soil layers, respectively. Organic and mineral soil layers differed markedly in genetic potential for biomass degradation, with the organic layer having greater potential and being more strongly affected by harvesting. Gene families were disproportionately affected, and we identified 41 gene families consistently affected by harvesting, including families involved in lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin degradation. The results strongly suggest that harvesting profoundly altered below-ground cycling of carbon and other nutrients at this site, with potentially important consequences for forest regeneration. Thus, it is important to determine whether these changes foreshadow long-term changes in forest productivity or resilience and whether these changes are broadly characteristic of harvested forests.

AB Phytoplankton size structure is an important indicator of the state of the pelagic ecosystem. Stimulated by the paucity of in situ observations on size structure, and by the sampling advantages of autonomous remote platforms, new efforts are being made to infer the size-structure of the phytoplankton from oceanographic variables that may be measured at high temporal and spatial resolution, such as total chlorophyll concentration. Largescale analysis of in situ data has revealed coherent relationships between size-fractionated chlorophyll and total chlorophyll that can be quantified using the three-component model of Brewin et al. (2010). However, there are variations surrounding these general relationships. In this paper, we first revise the three-component model using a global dataset of surface phytoplankton pigment measurements. Then, using estimates of the average irradiance in the mixed-layer, we investigate the influence of ambient light on the parameters of the three-component model. We observe significant relationships between model parameters and the average irradiance in the mixed-layer, consistent with ecological knowledge. These relationships are incorporated explicitly into the three-component model to illustrate variations in the relationship between size-structure and total chlorophyll, ensuing from variations in light availability. The new model may be used as a tool to investigate modifications in size-structure in the context of a changing climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The 6-yr degree-completion rate of undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors at U.S. colleges and universities is less than 40%. Persistence among women and underrepresented minorities (URMs), including African-American, Latino/a, Native American, and Pacific Islander students, is even more troubling, as these students leave STEM majors at significantly higher rates than their non-URM peers. This study utilizes a matched comparison group design to examine the academic achievement and persistence of students enrolled in the Program for Excellence in Education and Research in the Sciences (PEERS), an academic support program at the University of California, Los Angeles, for first-and second-year science majors from underrepresented backgrounds. Results indicate that PEERS students, on average, earned higher grades in most "gatekeeper" chemistry and math courses, had a higher cumulative grade point average, completed more science courses, and persisted in a science major at significantly higher rates than the comparison group. With its holistic approach focused on academics, counseling, creating a supportive community, and exposure to research, the PEERS program serves as an excellent model for universities interested in and committed to improving persistence of underrepresented science majors and closing the achievement gap.

AB Predicting biodiversity responses to climate change remains a difficult challenge, especially in climatically complex regions where precipitation is a limiting factor. Though statistical climatic envelope models are frequently used to project future scenarios for species distributions under climate change, these models are rarely tested using empirical data. We used long-term data on bird distributions and abundance covering five states in the western US and in the Canadian province of British Columbia to test the capacity of statistical models to predict temporal changes in bird populations over a 32-year period. Using boosted regression trees, we built presence-absence and abundance models that related the presence and abundance of 132 bird species to spatial variation in climatic conditions. Presence/absence models built using 1970-1974 data forecast the distributions of the majority of species in the later time period, 1998-2002 (mean AUC=0.79 +/- 0.01). Hindcast models performed equivalently (mean AUC=0.82 +/- 0.01). Correlations between observed and predicted abundances were also statistically significant for most species (forecast mean Spearmans =0.34 +/- 0.02, hindcast=0.39 +/- 0.02). The most stringent test is to test predicted changes in geographic patterns through time. Observed changes in abundance patterns were significantly positively correlated with those predicted for 59% of species (mean Spearmans =0.28 +/- 0.02, across all species). Three precipitation variables (for the wettest month, breeding season, and driest month) and minimum temperature of the coldest month were the most important predictors of bird distributions and abundances in this region, and hence of abundance changes through time. Our results suggest that models describing associations between climatic variables and abundance patterns can predict changes through time for some species, and that changes in precipitation and winter temperature appear to have already driven shifts in the geographic patterns of abundance of bird populations in western North America.

AB 1. Two strategies are often promoted to mitigate the effects of agricultural expansion on biodiversity: one integrates wildlife-friendly habitats within farmland (land sharing), and the other intensifies farming to allow the offset of natural reserves (land sparing). Their relative merits for biodiversity protection have been subject to much debate, but no previous study has examined whether trade-offs between the two strategies depend on the proximity of farmed areas to large tracts of natural habitat.
   2. We sampled birds and dung beetles across contiguous forests and agricultural landscapes (low-intensity cattle farming) in a threatened hotspot of endemism: the Colombian Choco-Andes. We test the hypothesis that the relative biodiversity benefits of either strategy depend partially on the degree to which farmlands are isolated from large contiguous blocks of forest.
   3. We show that distance from forest mediates the occurrence of many species within farmland. For the majority of species, occurrence on farmland depends on both isolation from forest and the proportionate cover of small-scale wildlife-friendly habitats within the farm landscape, with both variables having a similar overall magnitude of effect on occurrence probabilities.
   4. Simulations suggest that the biodiversity benefits of land sharing decline significantly with increasing distance from forest, but land sparing benefits remain consistent. In farm management units situated close to large contiguous forest (<500 m), land sharing is predicted to provide equal benefits to land sparing, but land sparing becomes increasingly superior in management units situated further from forest (1500 m). The predicted biodiversity benefits of land sparing are similar across all distances, provided that sparing mechanisms genuinely deliver protection for contiguous forest tracts.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The persistence of bird and dung beetle communities in low-intensity pastoral agriculture is strongly linked to the proximity of surrounding contiguous forests. Land-sharing policies that promote the integration of small-scale wildlife-friendly habitats might be of limited benefit without simultaneous measures to protect larger blocks of natural habitat, which could be achieved via land-sparing practices. Policymakers should carefully consider the extent and distribution of remaining contiguous natural habitats when designing agri-environment schemes in the tropics.

AB Wildfires can significantly alter forest carbon (C) storage and nitrogen (N) availability, but the long-term biogeochemical legacy of wildfires is poorly understood.
   We obtained a lake-sediment record of fire and biogeochemistry from a subalpine forest in Colorado, USA, to examine the nature, magnitude, and duration of decadal-scale, fire-induced ecosystem change over the past c. 4250 yr. The high-resolution record contained 34 fires, including 13high-severity events within the watershed.
   High-severity fires were followed by increased sedimentary N stable isotope ratios (delta(15) N) and bulk density, and decreased C and N concentrations - reflecting forest floor destruction, terrestrial C and N losses, and erosion. Sustained low sediment C : N c. 20-50 yr post-fire indicates reduced terrestrial organic matter subsidies to the lake. Low sedimentary delta(15) N c. 50-70 yr post-fire, coincident with C and N recovery, suggests diminishing terrestrial N availability during stand development. The magnitude of post-fire changes generally scaled directly with inferred fire severity.
   Our results support modern studies of forest successional C and N accumulation and indicate pronounced, long-lasting biogeochemical impacts of wildfires in subalpine forests. However, even repeated high-severity fires over millennia probably did not deplete C or N stocks, because centuries between high-severity fires allowed for sufficient biomass recovery.

AB The predictive adaptive response (PAR) hypothesis proposes that animals adjust their physiology and developmental trajectory during early life in anticipation of their future environments. Accordingly, when environmental conditions in early life match environmental conditions during adulthood, individual fitness should be greater. Here, we test this hypothesis in a long-lived mammal, the roe deer, using data from two contrasting populations, intensively monitored for more than 35 years. In the highly productive site, the fitness of female roe deer increased with the quality of environment during adulthood and, contrary to predictions of PAR, individuals born in good conditions always outperformed those born under poor conditions. In the resource-limited site, the fitness of female roe deer born in poor years was better than those born in good conditions in poor years when the animals were adult, but not in good years. Although consistent with predictions of PAR, we showed that this pattern is likely to be a consequence of increased viability selection during the juvenile stage for animals born in poor years. While PARs are often advanced in evolutionary medicine, our findings suggest that detailed biological processes should be investigated before drawing conclusions about the existence of this phenomenon.

AB Phenotypes are often environmentally dependent, which requires organisms to track environmental change. The challenge for organisms is to construct phenotypes using the most accurate environmental cue.
   Here, we use a quantitative genetic model of adaptation by additive genetic variance, within- and transgenerational plasticity via linear reaction norms and indirect genetic effects respectively.
   We show how the relative influence on the eventual phenotype of these components depends on the predictability of environmental change (fast or slow, sinusoidal or stochastic) and the developmental lag tau between when the environment is perceived and when selection acts.
   We then decompose expected mean fitness into three components (variance load, adaptation and fluctuation load) to study the fitness costs of within- and transgenerational plasticity. A strongly negative maternal effect coefficient m minimizes the variance load, but a strongly positive m minimises the fluctuation load. The adaptation term is maximized closer to zero, with positive or negative m preferred under different environmental scenarios.
   Phenotypic plasticity is higher when tau is shorter and when the environment changes frequently between seasonal extremes. Expected mean population fitness is highest away from highest observed levels of phenotypic plasticity.
   Within- and transgenerational plasticity act in concert to deliver well-adapted phenotypes, which emphasizes the need to study both simultaneously when investigating phenotypic evolution.

AB There are concerns about the effect of increasing resource extraction and other human activities on the soils and vegetation of the boreal zone. The review covers published papers between 1974 and 2012 to assess the effects of natural disturbances and human activities on soils and tree nutrition and growth of the Canadian boreal zone. Changes in soil and foliar nutrients following disturbance were also analyzed by meta-analysis. When sufficient replicated studies were not available for a given disturbance or nutrient, response assessments or narrative summaries are presented. The majority of fertilization studies in the boreal zone showed a positive tree growth response to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization either individually or in combination. Large amounts of N may be lost through volatilization following fire depending on the severity and frequency of the fire. This may contribute to N limitation in the boreal zone. Available soil P and extractable calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) increased in the surface horizons following fire. In contrast, extractable P decreased following harvest. Harvesting had no effect on total or inorganic N except in mixedwoods where total N decreased in the surface organic horizon following harvest. These are potential areas of concern given tree growth responses to N and P fertilization. Potassium (K) in the forest floor did not change following fire or harvesting; thus, K availability for tree nutrition should not be at risk, since its cycle is rapidly restored. Mercury (Hg) cycling may be altered in the boreal zone as a result of flooding and if fire return intervals and intensities increase. Interactions of multiple disturbances may increase the risk of nutrient depletions, but there is currently little information on these interactions in the boreal zone. Evidence to date suggests the soils of the Canadian boreal zone have not been adversely affected except in localized areas. However, there is the risk of nutrient loss if soils are not considered in our forest management strategies, particularly where multiple disturbances may interact. The potential for off-site movement of nutrients and contaminants into the atmospheric and aquatic ecosystems, in addition to on-site environmental issues, is also a concern.

AB The evolutionary importance of hybridization as a source of new adaptive genetic variation is rapidly gaining recognition. Hybridization between coyotes and wolves may have introduced adaptive alleles into the coyote gene pool that facilitated an expansion in their geographic range and dietary niche. Furthermore, hybridization between coyotes and domestic dogs may facilitate adaptation to human-dominated environments. We genotyped 63 ancestry-informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 427 canids to examine the prevalence, spatial distribution and the ecology of admixture in eastern coyotes. Using multivariate methods and Bayesian clustering analyses, we estimated the relative contributions of western coyotes, western and eastern wolves, and domestic dogs to the admixed ancestry of Ohio and eastern coyotes. We found that eastern coyotes form an extensive hybrid swarm, with all our samples having varying levels of admixture. Ohio coyotes, previously thought to be free of admixture, are also highly admixed with wolves and dogs. Coyotes in areas of high deer density are genetically more wolf-like, suggesting that natural selection for wolf-like traits may result in local adaptation at a fine geographic scale. Our results, in light of other previously published studies of admixture in Canis, revealed a pattern of sex-biased hybridization, presumably generated by male wolves and dogs mating with female coyotes. This study is the most comprehensive genetic survey of admixture in eastern coyotes and demonstrates that the frequency and scope of hybridization can be quantified with relatively few ancestry-informative markers.

AB In 2006 the United Nations called on states to implement measures to prevent significant adverse impacts to vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) in the deep sea It has been widely recognised that a major limitation to the effective application of these measures to date is uncertainty regarding the distribution of VMEs. Conservationists, researchers, resource managers and governmental bodies are increasingly turning to predictive species distribution models (SDMs) to identify the potential presence of species in areas that have not been sampled. In particular, the development of robust 'presence-background' model algorithms has accelerated the application of these techniques for working with presence-only species data. This has allowed scientists to exploit the large amounts of species data held in global biogeographic databases. Despite improvements in model algorithms, environmental data and species presences, there are still limitations to the reliability of these techniques, especially in poorly studied areas such as the deep sea Recent studies have begun to address a key limitation, the quality of data, by using multibeam echosounder surveys and species data from video surveys to acquire high-resolution data Whilst these data are often amongst the very best that can be acquired, the surveys are highly localised, often targeted towards known VME-containing areas, are very expensive and time consuming. It is financially prohibitive to survey whole regions or ocean basins using these techniques, so alternative cost-effective approaches are required. Here, we review 'presence-background' SDMs in the context of those studies conducted in the deep sea The issues of sampling bias, spatial autocorrelation, spatial scale, model evaluation and validation are considered in detail, and reference is made to recent developments in species distribution modelling literature. Further information is provided on how these approaches are being used to influence ocean management, and best practises are outlined to aid the effective adoption of these techniques in the future.

AB In this review, we examine two new trait-based models of community assembly that predict the relative abundance of species from a regional species pool. The models use fundamentally different mathematical approaches and the predictions can differ considerably. Maxent obtains the most even probability distribution subject to community-weighted mean trait constraints. Traitspace predicts low probabilities for any species whose trait distribution does not pass through the environmental filter. Neither model maximizes functional diversity because of the emphasis on environmental filtering over limiting similarity. Traitspace can test for the effects of limiting similarity by explicitly incorporating intraspecific trait variation. The range of solutions in both models could be used to define the range of natural variability of community composition in restoration projects.

AB That competition is stronger among closely related species and leads to phylogenetic overdispersion is a common assumption in community ecology. However, tests of this assumption are rare and field-based experiments lacking. We tested the relationship between competition, the degree of relatedness, and overdispersion among plants experimentally and using a field survey in a native grassland. Relatedness did not affect competition, nor was competition associated with phylogenetic overdispersion. Further, there was only weak evidence for increased overdispersion at spatial scales where plants are likely to compete. These results challenge traditional theory, but are consistent with recent theories regarding the mechanisms of plant competition and its potential effect on phylogenetic structure. We suggest that specific conditions related to the form of competition and trait conservatism must be met for competition to cause phylogenetic overdispersion. Consequently, overdispersion as a result of competition is likely to be rare in natural communities.

AB Grass snakes (Natrix natrix) represent one of the most widely distributed snake species of the Palaearctic region, ranging from the North African Maghreb region and the Iberian Peninsula through most of Europe and western Asia eastward to the region of Lake Baikal in Central Asia. Within N.natrix, up to 14 distinct subspecies are regarded as valid. In addition, some authors recognize big-headed grass snakes from western Transcaucasia as a distinct species, N.megalocephala. Based on phylogenetic analyses of a 1984-bp-long alignment of mtDNA sequences (ND4+tRNAs, cyt b) of 410 grass snakes, a nearly range-wide phylogeography is presented for both species. Within N.natrix, 16 terminal mitochondrial clades were identified, most of which conflict with morphologically defined subspecies. These 16 clades correspond to three more inclusive clades from (i) the Iberian Peninsula plus North Africa, (ii) East Europe and Asia and (iii) West Europe including Corso-Sardinia, the Apennine Peninsula and Sicily. Hypotheses regarding glacial refugia and postglacial range expansions are presented. Refugia were most likely located in each of the southern European peninsulas, Corso-Sardinia, North Africa, Anatolia and the neighbouring Near and Middle East, where the greatest extant genetic diversity occurs. Multiple distinct microrefugia are inferred for continental Italy plus Sicily, the Balkan Peninsula, Anatolia and the Near and Middle East. Holocene range expansions led to the colonization of more northerly regions and the formation of secondary contact zones. Western Europe was invaded from a refuge within southern France, while Central Europe was reached by two distinct range expansions from the Balkan Peninsula. In Central Europe, there are two contact zones of three distinct mitochondrial clades, and one of these contact zones was theretofore completely unknown. Another contact zone is hypothesized for Eastern Europe, which was colonized, like north-western Asia, from the Caucasus region. Further contact zones were identified for southern Italy, the Balkans and Transcaucasia. In agreement with previous studies using morphological characters and allozymes, there is no evidence for the distinctiveness of N.megalocephala. Therefore, N.megalocephala is synonymized with N.natrix.

AB Use of genetic methods to estimate effective population size (N-e) is rapidly increasing, but all approaches make simplifying assumptions unlikely to be met in real populations. In particular, all assume a single, unstructured population, and none has been evaluated for use with continuously distributed species. We simulated continuous populations with local mating structure, as envisioned by Wright's concept of neighborhood size (NS), and evaluated performance of a single-sample estimator based on linkage disequilibrium (LD), which provides an estimate of the effective number of parents that produced the sample (N-b). Results illustrate the interacting effects of two phenomena, drift and mixture, that contribute to LD. Samples from areas equal to or smaller than a breeding window produced estimates close to the NS. As the sampling window increased in size to encompass multiple genetic neighborhoods, mixture LD from a two-locus Wahlund effect overwhelmed the reduction in drift LD from incorporating offspring from more parents. As a consequence, (N) over cap (b) never approached the global N-e, even when the geographic scale of sampling was large. Results indicate that caution is needed in applying standard methods for estimating effective size to continuously distributed populations.

AB In the first part of this paper, we review the extent to which various types of plant growth models incorporate ecophysiological mechanisms. Many growth models have a central role for the process of photosynthesis; and often implicitly assume C-gain to be the rate-limiting step for biomass accumulation. We subsequently explore the extent to which this assumption actually holds and under what condition constraints on growth due to a limited sink strength are likely to occur. By using generalized dose-response curves for growth with respect to light and CO2, models can be tested against a benchmark for their overall performance. In the final part, a call for a systems approach at the supra-cellular level is made. This will enable a better understanding of feedbacks and trade-offs acting on plant growth and its component processes. Mechanistic growth models form an indispensable element of such an approach and will, in the end, provide the link with the (sub-) cellular approaches that are yet developing. Improved insight will be gained if model output for the various physiological processes and morphological variables ('virtual profiling') is compared with measured correlation networks among these processes and variables. Two examples of these correlation networks are presented.

AB Aim Spatial patterns in biodiversity along environmental gradients are a central theme in ecology. However, the ways in which local assembly processes control changes in species turnover (-diversity) along broader gradients have been less well documented. In this study, we aimed to elucidate factors and processes governing the altitudinal gradients in the -diversity of woody plants and ground-dwelling oribatid mites. Location Shiretoko National Park in Hokkaido, Japan. Methods The diversity of plants and oribatids was investigated in seven plots (each containing 10 subplots) at different altitudes, and the -diversity of the two organism groups was calculated for each altitude. The dependence of -diversity on the size of the species pool (-diversity) is an issue of long-standing importance. We therefore used null modelling, which randomly shuffles individuals among subplots while preserving the -diversity, the relative abundance of each species per plot and the number of individuals per subplot. This approach enabled us to estimate how much the observed -diversity deviates from the expected -diversity under stochastic assembly processes. Environmental data were collected to evaluate the possible effects of habitat condition/heterogeneity on community processes. Results In plants, deterministic processes dominated in the low-productivity, high-altitude stands because of the finer-scale niche partitioning seen among small individuals within less-stratified stands. In the structurally developed, low-altitude stands, the community structure was more strongly affected by stochasticity, probably resulting from one-sided competition such that the canopy trees intercept the majority of light, a primary resource for plants, and therefore the small understorey individuals had limited access to light. Among the oribatids, the altitudinal gradient of -diversity was less evident than among the studied plants. However, this nonlinearity does not support the notion that local assembly processes contribute little to the spatial pattern of -diversity. Indeed, local-scale environmental heterogeneity favoured a more deterministic assembly of oribatids at a given altitude. Main conclusion The biogeographical patterns of -diversity are not independent of community processes and, in reality, are shaped by local stochastic/deterministic factors that change within a landscape.

AB A methodological approach for modelling the occurrence patterns of species for the purpose of fisheries management is proposed here. The presence/absence of the species is modelled with a hierarchical Bayesian spatial model using the geographical and environmental characteristics of each fishing location. Maps of predicted probabilities of presence are generated using Bayesian kriging. Bayesian inference on the parameters and prediction of presence/absence in new locations (Bayesian kriging) are made by considering the model as a latent Gaussian model, which allows the use of the integrated nested Laplace approximation ( INLA ) software (which has been seen to be quite a bit faster than the well-known MCMC methods). In particular, the spatial effect has been implemented with the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach. The methodology is evaluated on Mediterranean horse mackerel (Trachurus mediterraneus) in the Western Mediterranean. The analysis shows that environmental and geographical factors can play an important role in directing local distribution and variability in the occurrence of species. Although this approach is used to recognize the habitat of mackerel, it could also be for other different species and life stages in order to improve knowledge of fish populations and communities.

AB A central principle in life-history theory is that reproductive effort negatively affects survival. Costs of reproduction are thought to be physiologically based, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using female North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), we test the hypothesis that energetic investment in reproduction overwhelms investment in antioxidant protection, leading to oxidative damage. In support of this hypothesis we found that the highest levels of plasma protein oxidative damage in squirrels occurred during the energetically demanding period of lactation. Moreover, plasma protein oxidative damage was also elevated in squirrels that expended the most energy and had the lowest antioxidant protection. Finally, we found that squirrels that were food-supplemented during lactation and winter had increased antioxidant protection and reduced plasma protein oxidative damage providing the first experimental evidence in the wild that access to abundant resources can reduce this physiological cost.

AB Aim To identify the relationships between volunteer bird survey effort and motivations in order to prioritize investment in future surveying activities. Location South-west Western Australia, a global biodiversity hotspot. Methods We developed nine hypotheses for volunteer motivations to predict the probability of a bird survey being undertaken anywhere in the landscape using data from the New Atlas of Australian Birds. We then established three goals for surveying in the study region: (1) equal representation of surveys across the landscape, (2) surveys stratified by habitat type and (3) representation of surveys in protected areas. We developed a function to estimate the benefit of investing in professional surveys, given the probability of a volunteer survey taking place and the survey goal, and calculated the cost of meeting a surveying goal with and without accounting for the probability of cells not being surveyed by volunteers. Results A model combining the location of protected areas, location of previous records of threatened species and habitat diversity was the strongest predictor of the probability of a volunteer bird survey being conducted. Each surveying goal resulted in different areas being prioritized for future surveying, indicating the importance of setting clear objectives before undertaking broad-scale monitoring or surveying activities. If our primary goal is stratified protected area representation in surveys, there are huge cost savings if only protected areas with a 70% predicted probability of not being surveyed by volunteers are selected for professional surveys. Main conclusions Professional sampling in survey gaps is required to reduce bias in volunteer-collected datasets. Using models of volunteer behaviour, we can identify areas unlikely to be surveyed. If these areas are important for the project objective, then we can either provide incentives for volunteers or carry out professional surveying. These analyses are best carried out before data collection commences.

AB Disturbances induce changes on habitat proprieties that may filter organism's functional traits thereby shaping the structure and interactions of many trophic levels. We tested if communities of predators with foraging traits dependent on habitat structure respond to environmental change through cascades affecting the functional traits of plants. We monitored the response of spider and plant communities to fire in South Brazilian Grasslands using pairs of burned and unburned plots. Spiders were determined to the family level and described in feeding behavioral and morphological traits measured on each individual. Life form and morphological traits were recorded for plant species. One month after fire the abundance of vegetation hunters and the mean size of the chelicera increased due to the presence of suitable feeding sites in the regrowing vegetation, but irregular web builders decreased due to the absence of microhabitats and dense foliage into which they build their webs. Six months after fire rosette-form plants with broader leaves increased, creating a favourable habitat for orb web builders which became more abundant, while graminoids and tall plants were reduced, resulting in a decrease of proper shelters and microclimate in soil surface to ground hunters which became less abundant. Hence, fire triggered changes in vegetation structure that lead both to trait-convergence and trait-divergence assembly patterns of spiders along gradients of plant biomass and functional diversity. Spider individuals occurring in more functionally diverse plant communities were more diverse in their traits probably because increased possibility of resource exploitation, following the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis. Finally, as an indication of resilience, after twelve months spider communities did not differ from those of unburned plots. Our findings show that functional traits provide a mechanistic understanding of the response of communities to environmental change, especially when more than one trophic level is considered.

AB Landscape metrics have been widely used to characterize geographical patterns which are important for many geographical and ecological analyses. Cellular automata (CA) are attractive for simulating settlement development, landscape evolution, urban dynamics, and land-use changes. Although various methods have been developed to calibrate CA, landscape metrics have not been explicitly used to ensure the simulated pattern best fitted to the actual one. This article presents a pattern-calibrated method which is based on a number of landscape metrics for implementing CA by using genetic algorithms (GAs). A Pattern-calibrated GACA is proposed by incorporating percentage of landscape (PLAND), patch metric (LPI), and landscape division (D) into the fitness function of GA. The sensitivity analysis can allow the users to explore various combinations of weights and examine their effects. The comparison between Logistic- CA, Cell-calibrated GACA, and Pattern-calibrated GACA indicates that the last method can yield the best results for calibrating CA, according to both the training and validation data. For example, Logistic-CA has the average simulation error of 27.7%, but Pattern-calibrated GACA (the proposed method) can reduce this error to only 7.2% by using the training data set in 2003. The validation is further carried out by using new validation data in 2008 and additional landscape metrics (e.g., Landscape shape index, edge density, and aggregation index) which have not been incorporated for calibrating CA models. The comparison shows that this pattern-calibrated CA has better performance than the other two conventional models.

AB Effective communication regarding distance in the vertical dimension is critical for many ecological, climatological and broader geophysical studies of the Earth. Confusion exists regarding the definition of three English words commonly used to describe the vertical dimension: (1) elevation; (2) altitude; and (3) height. While used interchangeably in "everyday" non-technical English, here we provide explicit definitions and strongly recommend their use in scientific literature. We briefly discuss the likely origins of the sub-optimal use of these three words due to translations between languages. Finally, we provide examples of how using these terms, as explicitly defined herein, improves scientific communication.

AB Dispersal distance in mammals is a fundamental information for several ecological and conservation applications. Although dispersal can depend on many intrinsic and extrinsic factors, in recent years many studies have shown that it scales with body size and home range area. However, the role of further ecological correlates to distance travelled is still unclear and the predictive models proposed so far have suffered from small sample size and lack of error estimates. This reduces the practical relevance of the models for ecological and conservation applications. We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis on 327 studies on the dispersal of 164 mammal species, and performed linear and non-linear regression analyses to explore the relationships of body size and home range area with dispersal distance. We tested the effect of various life history traits and ecological factors on the relationships and performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of the models to sample size. The linear relationships of both home range and body size with dispersal distance were influenced by various life history traits and ecological factors. We developed allometric functions to estimate species dispersal distance based on different predictors and life history traits. Linear models representing the relationship between dispersal distance and body size or home range area received good support; however logistic models better approximates both relationships. Despite receiving less support than a logistic curve, a linear model between dispersal and home range is a good approximation for applicative purposes. Sensitivity analysis showed that our results are robust to subsampling of the original dataset until a sample of 40 species. Our empirical models have the potential to improve theoretical and applied population biology studies by extending the applicability and improving the accuracy of dispersal distance estimation to a large number of mammals.

AB Forests play a critical role in the hydrological cycle making the study of water use by trees and forest stands of prime importance in the global change context Very negative effects of increasing and more intense droughts on forest vegetation have been described over the last decades. Symptoms of disease and decline have been associated with changed precipitation patterns in many forests particularly in European temperate and Mediterranean regions. Intra- and inter-specific differences in both physiology and morphology exert a large but not well understood influence on the water balance of forest ecosystems, further affecting their vulnerability to drought. Stand structure and composition influences rainfall interception, runoff and water fluxes of the whole ecosystem. Both expanding plantations of renovated interest for biofuel industry and natural and semi-natural forests must be managed in a sustainable way on the basis of their water consumption. We review the role of key drivers on forest water use such as species composition, tree canopy status of each of them and species specific sensitivity to soil water scarcity. Specifically we discuss the role of these factors for natural forest, but with references also to forest plantations. Water scarcity is expected to be one of the largest societal problems worldwide in the near future, so water use by natural and planted forest ecosystems has become a central subject in current research agendas.

AB Many ruminant species show seasonal patterns of reproduction. Causes for this are widely debated, and include adaptations to seasonal availability of resources (with cues either from body condition in more tropical, or from photoperiodism in higher latitude habitats) and/or defence strategies against predators. Conclusions so far are limited to datasets with less than 30 species. Here, we use a dataset on 110 wild ruminant species kept in captivity in temperate-zone zoos to describe their reproductive patterns quantitatively [determining the birth peak breadth (BPB) as the number of days in which 80% of all births occur]; then we link this pattern to various biological characteristics [latitude of origin, mother-young-relationship (hider/follower), proportion of grass in the natural diet (grazer/browser), sexual size dimorphism/mating system], and compare it with reports for free-ranging animals. When comparing taxonomic subgroups, variance in BPB is highly correlated to the minimum, but not the maximum BPB, suggesting that a high BPB (i.e. an aseasonal reproductive pattern) is the plesiomorphic character in ruminants. Globally, latitude of natural origin is highly correlated to the BPB observed in captivity, supporting an overruling impact of photoperiodism on ruminant reproduction. Feeding type has no additional influence; the hider/follower dichotomy, associated with the anti-predator strategy of swamping, has additional influence in the subset of African species only. Sexual size dimorphism and mating system are marginally associated with the BPB, potentially indicating a facilitation of polygamy under seasonal conditions. The difference in the calculated Julian date of conception between captive populations and that reported for free-ranging ones corresponds to the one expected if absolute day length was the main trigger in highly seasonal species: calculated day length at the time of conception between free-ranging and captive populations followed a y = x relationship. Only 11 species (all originating from lower latitudes) were considered to change their reproductive pattern distinctively between the wild and captivity, with 10 becoming less seasonal (but not aseasonal) in human care, indicating that seasonality observed in the wild was partly resource-associated. Only one species (Antidorcas marsupialis) became more seasonal in captivity, presumably because resource availability in the wild overrules the innate photoperiodic response. Reproductive seasonality explains additional variance in the body massgestation period relationship, with more seasonal species having shorter gestation periods for their body size. We conclude that photoperiodism, and in particular absolute day length, are genetically fixed triggers for reproduction that may be malleable to some extent by body condition, and that plasticity in gestation length is an important facilitator that may partly explain the success of ruminant radiation to high latitudes. Evidence for an anti-predator strategy involving seasonal reproduction is limited to African species. Reproductive seasonality following rainfall patterns may not be an adaptation to give birth in periods of high resource availability but an adaptation to allow conception only at times of good body condition.

AB Background: Understanding the factors that shape the distribution of tropical tree species at large scales is a central issue in ecology, conservation and forest management. The aims of this study were to (i) assess the importance of environmental factors relative to historical factors for tree species distributions in the semi-evergreen forests of the northern Congo basin; and to (ii) identify potential mechanisms explaining distribution patterns through a trait-based approach.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed the distribution patterns of 31 common tree species in an area of more than 700,000 km(2) spanning the borders of Cameroon, the Central African Republic, and the Republic of Congo using forest inventory data from 56,445 0.5-ha plots. Spatial variation of environmental (climate, topography and geology) and historical factors (human disturbance) were quantified from maps and satellite records. Four key functional traits (leaf phenology, shade tolerance, wood density, and maximum growth rate) were extracted from the literature. The geological substrate was of major importance for the distribution of the focal species, while climate and past human disturbances had a significant but lesser impact. Species distribution patterns were significantly related to functional traits. Species associated with sandy soils typical of sandstone and alluvium were characterized by slow growth rates, shade tolerance, evergreen leaves, and high wood density, traits allowing persistence on resource-poor soils. In contrast, fast-growing pioneer species rarely occurred on sandy soils, except for Lophira alata.
   Conclusions/Significance: The results indicate strong environmental filtering due to differential soil resource availability across geological substrates. Additionally, long-term human disturbances in resource-rich areas may have accentuated the observed patterns of species and trait distributions. Trait differences across geological substrates imply pronounced differences in population and ecosystem processes, and call for different conservation and management strategies.

AB Symbiotic nitrogen recycling enables animals to thrive on nitrogen-poor diets and environments. It traditionally refers to the utilization of animal waste nitrogen by symbiotic micro-organisms to synthesize essential amino acids (EAAs), which are translocated back to the animal host. We applied metabolic modelling and complementary metabolite profiling to investigate nitrogen recycling in the symbiosis between the pea aphid and the intracellular bacterium Buchnera, which synthesizes EAAs. The results differ from traditional notions of nitrogen recycling in two important respects. First, aphid waste ammonia is recycled predominantly by the host cell (bacteriocyte) and not Buchnera. Host cell recycling is mediated by shared biosynthetic pathways for four EAAs, in which aphid transaminases incorporate ammonia-derived nitrogen into carbon skeletons synthesized by Buchnera to generate EAAs. Second, the ammonia substrate for nitrogen recycling is derived from bacteriocyte metabolism, such that the symbiosis is not a sink for nitrogenous waste from other aphid organs. Host cell-mediated nitrogen recycling may be general among insect symbioses with shared EAA biosynthetic pathways generated by the loss of symbiont genes mediating terminal reactions in EAA synthesis.

AB Longline fishing is the most common elasmobranch capture method around the world, yet the physiological consequences of this technique are poorly understood. To quantify the sub-lethal effects of longline capture in the commonly exploited Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi), 37 individuals were captured using standard, mid-water longlines. Hook timers provided hooking duration to the nearest minute. Once sharks were landed, blood samples were taken and used to measure a suite of physiological parameters. Control data were obtained by sampling an additional three unrestrained Caribbean reef sharks underwater at an established shark feeding site. The greatest level of physiological disruption occurred after 120-180 min of hooking, whereas sharks exposed to minimal and maximal hook durations exhibited the least disturbed blood chemistry. Significant relationships were established between hooking duration and blood pH, pCO(2), lactate, glucose, plasma calcium and plasma potassium. Longline capture appears more benign than other methods assessed to date, causing a shift in the stress response from acute at the onset of capture to a sub-acute regime as the capture event progresses, apparently facilitating a degree of physiological recovery. Continued investigation into the physiological response of elasmobranchs to longline capture is vital for the effective management of such fisheries. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB One of the fundamental assumptions underlying linear regression models is that the errors have a constant variance (i.e., homoscedastic). When this assumption is violated, standard errors from a regression can be biased and inconsistent, meaning that the associated p values and 95% confidence intervals cannot be trusted. The assumption of homoscedasticity is made for statistical reasons rather than biological reasons; in most real datasets, some form of heteroscedasticity is likely to exist. However, a survey of the behavioural ecology literature showed that only about 5% of articles explicitly mentioned heteroscedasticity, leaving 95% of articles in which heteroscedasticity was apparently absent. These results strongly indicate that the prevalence of heteroscedasticity is widely under-reported within behavioural ecology. The aim of this article is to raise awareness of heteroscedasticity amongst behavioural ecologists. Using topical examples from fields in behavioural ecology such as sexual dimorphism and animal personality, we highlight the biological importance of considering heteroscedasticity. We also emphasize that researchers should pay closer attention to the variance in their data and consider what factors could cause heteroscedasticity. In addition, we introduce some simple methods of dealing with heteroscedasticity. The two methods we focus on are: (1) incorporating variance functions within a generalised least squares (GLS) framework to model the functional form of heteroscedasticity and; (2) heteroscedasticity-consistent standard error (HCSE) estimators, which can be used when the functional form of heteroscedasticity is unknown. Using case studies, we show how both methods can influence the output from linear regression models. Finally, we hope that more researchers will consider heteroscedasticity as an important source of additional information about the particular biological process being studied, rather than an impediment to statistical analysis.

AB Recent stable isotope analyses indicate that a number of putative detritivorous soil microarthropods is not typical detritivores but rather live as predators or scavengers. Using molecular gut content analyses the present study investigates if nematodes indeed form part of the diet of oribatid mites. First, in a no-choice laboratory feeding experiment two nematode species (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita and Steinernema feltiae) were offered to eight species of oribatid mites and one gamasid mite. Second, after feeding for 4 and 48 h on each nematode species the detection time of prey DNA in the oribatid mite species Steganacarus magnus was investigated. Third, in a field experiment nematode prey (P. hermaphrodita and S. feltiae) in the diet of microarthropods was investigated distinguishing between scavenging and predation. In the no-choice laboratory experiment not only the gamasid mite but also several of the studied oribatid mite species consumed nematodes. After feeding on nematodes for 4 h prey DNA was detectable in S. magnus for only 4 h, but after feeding for 48 h prey DNA was detectable for 128 h, indicating that the duration of feeding on prey is an important determinant for prey DNA detection. The field experiment confirmed that oribatid mite species including Liacarus subterraneus, Platynothrus peltifer and S. magnus intensively prey on nematodes. Interestingly, DNA of dead P hermaphrodita was detectable to a similar degree as that of living individuals indicating that scavenging is of significant importance in decomposer food webs. Results of our study indicate that predation and scavenging on nematodes by "detritivorous" microarthropods in soil food webs need to be reconsidered. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although most mammals grow up in the company of same or different age sibs (or half sibs), surprisingly little attention has been given to how relations among them might influence the development of individual differences in morphology, physiology, and behavior. Here we review evidence from our work on domestic and wild European rabbits, and more recently on laboratory rats, mice, and domestic cats, supporting the proposition that in mammals early sibling relations contribute to the development of individual differences in these three domains and thereby to long-term behavioral differences of the kind we might consider part of an animal's behavioral style or personality. First we report a consistent and marked negative relation between litter size and individuals' body mass at birth and weaning, as well as marked within-litter differences in prenatal body mass and placental efficiency. We then report individual differences in preweaning behaviors associated with these morphological variables such as position occupied in the litter huddle and development of motor ability, as well as physiological differences in thermoregulation, immune parameters, and endocrine indicators of stress. Finally, we report first evidence from wild rabbits that early relations among littermates may have long-term consequences for individual differences in behavioral style. We conclude that in mammals, individual differences in early growth, physiology and behavior potentially important for the development of animal personality, are shaped to an appreciable extent by early sibling relations and that this little-researched field deserves closer attention.

AB Sperm competition theory predicts that under high risk of sperm competition, males will increase the number of sperm that they allocate to a female. This prediction has been supported by some experimental studies but not by others. Here, I conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether the increase in sperm allocation under high risk of sperm competition is a generalized response across taxa. I collected data from 39 studies and 37 species. Across taxa, males under a high risk of sperm competition respond by increasing their sperm allocation (mean effect size = 0.32). Number of offspring did not explain a significant portion of the variation in effect sizes. A traditional meta-analysis (i.e. without phylogenetic information) described the variation among effect sizes better than a meta-analysis that incorporates the phylogenetic relationships among species, suggesting that the increase in sperm allocation under high risk of sperm competition is similarly prevalent across taxa.

AB We investigated relationships between richness patterns of rare and common grassland species and environmental factors, focussing on comparing the degree to which the richness patterns of rare and common species are determined by simple environmental variables. Using data collected in the Machair grassland of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, we fitted spatial regression models using a suite of grazing, soil physicochemical and microtopographic covariates, to nested sub-assemblages of vascular and non-vascular species ranked according to rarity. As expected, we found that common species drive richness patterns, but rare vascular species had significantly stronger affinity for high richness areas. After correcting for the prevalence of individual species distributions, we found differences between common and rare species in 1) the amount of variation explained: richness patterns of common species were better summarised by simple environmental variables, 2) the associations of environmental variables with richness showed systematic trends between common and rare species with coefficient sign reversal for several factors, and 3) richness associations with rare environments: richness patterns of rare vascular species significantly matched rare environments but those of non-vascular species did not. Richness patterns of rare species, at least in this system, may be intrinsically less predictable than those of common species.

AB Strong topographic variation interacting with low stature alpine vegetation creates a multitude of micro-habitats poorly represented by common 2 m above the ground meteorological measurements (weather station data). However, the extent to which the actual habitat temperatures in alpine landscapes deviate from meteorological data at different spatial scales has rarely been quantified. In this study, we assessed thermal surface and soil conditions across topographically rich alpine landscapes by thermal imagery and miniature data loggers from regional (2-km(2)) to plot (1-m(2)) scale. The data were used to quantify the effects of spatial sampling resolution on current micro-habitat distributions and habitat loss due to climate warming scenarios. Soil temperatures showed substantial variation among slopes (2-3 K) dependent on slope exposure, within slopes (3-4 K) due to micro-topography and within 1-m(2) plots (1 K) as a result of plant cover effects. A reduction of spatial sampling resolution from 1 x 1 m to 100 x 100 m leads to an underestimation of current habitat diversity by 25% and predicts a six-times higher habitat loss in a 2-K warming scenario. Our results demonstrate that weather station data are unable to reflect the complex thermal patterns of aerodynamically decoupled alpine vegetation at the investigated scales. Thus, the use of interpolated weather station data to describe alpine life conditions without considering the micro-topographically induced thermal mosaic might lead to misinterpretation and inaccurate prediction.

AB Despite warm polar climates and low meridional temperature gradients, a number of different high-latitude plankton assemblages were, to varying extents, dominated by endemic species during most of the Paleogene. To better understand the evolution of Paleogene plankton endemism in the high southern latitudes, we investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of the fossil remains of dinoflagellates, i.e., organic-walled cysts (dinocysts), and their response to changes in regional sea surface temperature (SST). We show that Paleocene and early Eocene (similar to 65-50 Ma) Southern Ocean dinocyst assemblages were largely cosmopolitan in nature but that a distinct switch from cosmopolitan-dominated to endemic-dominated assemblages (the so-called "transantarctic flora") occurred around the early-middle Eocene boundary (similar to 50 Ma). The spatial distribution and relative abundance patterns of this transantarctic flora correspond well with surface water circulation patterns as reconstructed through general circulation model experiments throughout the Eocene. We quantitatively compare dinocyst assemblages with previously published TEX86-based SST reconstructions through the early and middle Eocene from a key locality in the southwest Pacific Ocean, ODP Leg 189 Site 1172 on the East Tasman Plateau. We conclude that the middle Eocene onset of the proliferation of the transantarctic flora is not linearly correlated with regional SST records and that only after the transantarctic flora became fully established later in the middle Eocene, possibly triggered by large-scale changes in surface-ocean nutrient availability, were abundances of endemic dinocysts modulated by regional SST variations.

AB Estimating past elevation not only provides evidence for vertical movements of the Earth's lithosphere, but also increases our understanding of interactions between tectonics, relief and climate in geological history. Development of biomarker hydrogen isotope-based paleoaltimetry techniques that can be applied to a wide range of sample types is therefore of continuing importance. Here we present leaf wax-derived n-alkane delta D (delta D(wax)) values along three soil attitudinal transects, at different latitudes, in the Wuyi, Shennongjia and Tianshan Mountains in China, to investigate delta D(wax) gradients and the apparent fractionation between leaf wax and precipitation (epsilon(wax-p)).
   We find that soil delta D(wax) track attitudinal variations of precipitation delta D along the three transects that span variable environment conditions and vertical vegetation spectra. An empirical delta D(wax)-altitude relation is therefore established in which the average delta D(wax) lapse rate of -2.27 +/- 0.38 parts per thousand/100 m is suitable for predicting relative paleoelevation change (relative uplift). The application of this empirical gradient is restricted to phases in the mountain uplift stage when the atmospheric circulation had not distinctly changed and to when the climate was not arid. An empirical delta D(wax)-latitude-altitude formula is also calculated: delta D(wax) = -0.483LAT -0.0227ALT -261.5, which gives the preliminary spatial distribution pattern of delta D(wax) a in modern China.
   Mean value of epsilon(wax-p) in the extreme humid Wuyi Mountains is quite negative (-154 parts per thousand), compared to the humid Shennongjia (-129%.) and the arid (but with abundant summer precipitation) Tianshan Mountains (-130 parts per thousand), which suggests aridity or water availability in the growing season is the primary factor controlling soil/sediment epsilon(wax-p). Along the Tianshan transects, values of epsilon(wax-p) are speculated to be constant with altitude; while along the Wuyi and Shennongjia transects, epsilon(wax-p) are also constant at the low-mid altitudes, but become slightly more negative at high altitudes which could be attributed to overestimates of precipitation delta D or the vegetation shift to grass/conifer.
   Additionally, a reversal of altitude effect in the vertical variation of delta D(wax) was found in the alpine zone of the Tianshan Mountains, which might be caused by atmospheric circulation change with altitude. This implies that the paleo-circulation pattern and its changes should also be evaluated when stable isotope-based paleoaltimetry is applied. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To investigate the ability of pioneer and late-successional species to adapt to a strong light environment in a reforestation area, we examined the activities of antioxidant enzymes in relation to photosystem chlorophyll a fluorescence and photosynthetic pigment concentration for eight tropical tree species grown under 100% (sun) and 10% (shade) sunlight irradiation. The pioneer (early-succession) species (PS) were Cecropia pachystachya, Croton urucurana, Croton floribundus and Schinus terebinthifolius. The non-pioneer (late succession) species (LS) were Hymenaea courbaril L var. stilbocarpa, Esenbeckia leiocarpa, Cariniana legalis and Tabebuia roseo-alba. We observed a greater decline in the ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll a fluorescence (F-v/F-m) under full sunlight irradiation in the late-successional species than in the pioneer species. The LS species most sensitive to high irradiance were C. legalis and H. courbaril. In LS species, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll concentrations were higher in the shade-grown plants than in plants that developed under full sunlight, but in the PS species C. floribundus and C. pachystachya, we did not observe significant changes in chlorophyll content when grown in the two contrasting environments. The carotenoids/total chlorophyll ratio increased significantly when plants developed under high-sunlight irradiation, but this response was not observed in the PS species S. terebinthifolius and C. pachystachya. The improved performance of the pioneer species in high sunlight was accompanied by an increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD. EC 1.15.1.1) activity, though no light-dependent increase in the activity of ascorbate peroxidase (APX. EC 1.11.1.11) was observed. The activity of catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6) was reduced by high irradiation in both pioneer and late-successional species. Our results show that pioneer species perform better under high-sunlight irradiation than late-successional species, as indicated by increased SOD activity and a higher F IF,, ratio. C. legalis was the LS species most susceptible to photoinhibition under full sunlight conditions. These results suggest that pioneer plants have more potential tolerance to photo-oxidative damage than late-successional species associated with the higher SOD activity found in pioneer species. Reduced photoinhibition in pioneer species probably results from their higher photosynthetic capacities, as has been observed in a previous survey carried out by our group. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Successfully coping with a chronic disease depends significantly on social support, particularly that of a significant other. Thus, it depends on the ways of dealing with stress within a couple (dyadic coping). In this study, the relationship between dyadic coping and well-being was investigated among couples in which one partner suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
   Methods: A total of 43 couples participated. They were mailed questionnaires on anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire-BREF), and dyadic coping (Dyadic Coping Inventory).
   Results: Low scores of positive and high scores of negative dyadic coping were associated with poorer quality of life and higher psychological distress among couples. Delegated coping (assistance with daily tasks) was higher among partners. When estimated by patients, high delegated partner coping (frequent provision of support by partners) and low delegated personal coping (low provision of support by patients) were associated with poorer quality of life for both patient and partner. COPD patients suffering from depression were supported more often and attributed deficits in dyadic coping primarily to themselves, whereas partners with higher scores of depression provided higher estimates of both their own negative coping and the negative coping of their partner.
   Conclusion: The higher the patient perceived the imbalance in delegated dyadic coping, the lower the couple's quality of life. More negative and less positive dyadic coping were associated with lower quality of life and higher psychological distress. Psychotherapeutic interventions to improve dyadic coping may lead to better quality of life and less psychological distress among COPD patients and their partners.

AB Distinguishing genetically differentiated populations within hybrid zones and determining the mechanisms by which introgression occurs are crucial for setting effective conservation policy. Extensive hybridization among grey wolves (Canis lupus), eastern wolves (C. lycaon) and coyotes (C. latrans) in eastern North America has blurred species distinctions, creating a Canis hybrid swarm. Using complementary genetic markers, we tested the hypotheses that eastern wolves have acted as a conduit of sex-biased gene flow between grey wolves and coyotes, and that eastern wolves in Algonquin Provincial Park (APP) have differentiated following a history of introgression. Mitochondrial, Y chromosome and autosomal microsatellite genetic data provided genotypes for 217 canids from three geographic regions in Ontario, Canada: northeastern Ontario, APP and southern Ontario. Coyote mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes were common across regions but coyote-specific Y chromosome haplotypes were absent; grey wolf mtDNA was absent from southern regions, whereas grey wolf Y chromosome haplotypes were present in all three regions. Genetic structuring analyses revealed three distinct clusters within a genetic cline, suggesting some gene flow among species. In APP, however, 78.4% of all breeders and 11 of 15 known breeding pairs had assignment probability of Q >= 0.8 to the Algonquin cluster, and the proportion of eastern wolf Y chromosome haplotypes in APP breeding males was higher than expected from random mating within the park (P<0.02). The data indicate that Algonquin wolves remain genetically distinct despite providing a sex-biased genetic bridge between coyotes and grey wolves. We speculate that ongoing hybridization within the park is limited by pre-mating reproductive barriers. Heredity (2010) 105, 520-531; doi:10.1038/hdy.2010.6; published online 17 February 2010

AB Spatial heterogeneities and spatial separation of hosts are often seen as key factors when developing accurate predictive models of the spread of pathogens. The question we address in this paper is how coarse the resolution of the spatial data can be for a model to be a useful tool for informing control policies. We examine this problem using the specific case of foot-and-mouth disease spreading between farms using the formulation developed during the 2001 epidemic in the United Kingdom. We show that, if our model is carefully parameterized to match epidemic behavior, then using aggregate county-scale data from the United States is sufficient to closely determine optimal control measures (specifically ring culling). This result also holds when the approach is extended to theoretical distributions of farms where the spatial clustering can be manipulated to extremes. We have therefore shown that, although spatial structure can be critically important in allowing us to predict the emergent population-scale behavior from a knowledge of the individual-level dynamics, for this specific applied question, such structure is mostly subsumed in the parameterization allowing us to make policy predictions in the absence of high-quality spatial information. We believe that this approach will be of considerable benefit across a range of disciplines where data are only available at intermediate spatial scales.

AB Background: Current molecular phylogenetic studies of Lepidoptera and most other arthropods are predominantly based on mitochondrial genes and a limited number of nuclear genes. The nuclear genes, however, generally do not provide sufficient information for young radiations. ITS2, which has proven to be an excellent nuclear marker for similarly aged radiations in other organisms like fungi and plants, is only rarely used for phylogeny estimation in arthropods, although universal primers exist. This is partly due to difficulties in the alignment of ITS2 sequences in more distant taxa. The present study uses ITS2 secondary structure information to elucidate the phylogeny of a species-rich young radiation of arthropods, the butterfly subgenus Agrodiaetus. One aim is to evaluate the efficiency of ITS2 to resolve the phylogeny of the subgenus in comparison with COI, the most important mitochondrial marker in arthropods. Furthermore, we assess the use of compensatory base changes in ITS2 for the delimitation of species and discuss the prospects of ITS2 as a nuclear marker for barcoding studies.
   Results: In the butterfly family Lycaenidae, ITS2 secondary structure enabled us to successfully align sequences of different subtribes in Polyommatini and produce a Profile Neighbour Joining tree of this tribe, the resolution of which is comparable to phylogenetic trees obtained with COI+COII. The subgenus Agrodiaetus comprises 6 major clades which are in agreement with COI analyses. A dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA) traced the origin of most Agrodiaetus clades to separate biogeographical areas in the region encompassing Eastern Anatolia, Transcaucasia and Iran.
   Conclusions: With the inclusion of secondary structure information, ITS2 appears to be a suitable nuclear marker to infer the phylogeny of young radiations, as well as more distantly related genera within a diverse arthropod family. Its phylogenetic signal is comparable to the mitochondrial marker COI. Compensatory base changes are very rare within Polyommatini and cannot be used for species delimitation. The implementation of secondary structure information into character-based phylogenetic methods is suggested to further improve the versatility of this marker in phylogenetic studies.

AB Analyses of spatial variation in multi-species weed communities together with environmental factors may be useful as a tool for developing sustainable long-term weed control and to better understand the ecology of weed species. We present an analysis of species recorded in 491 Danish fields surveyed in 2001-2004 distributed in 11 common agricultural crops. By using cluster analysis and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) we identify crops that resemble each other with respect to their associated flora. By CCA, correlation and regression analyses we illustrate how the incidences of 40 common species relate to each other and can be related to important soil factors measured in the uppermost 20 cm. Clay content, pH, phosphorous, exchangeable potassium and magnesium, total nitrogen and carbon content in the soil were estimated.
   Based on weed frequency the cluster analysis separates the perennial crop (grass leys) from the annual crops (largest distance) and further, winter from summer annual crops. The cluster and correlation analyses reveal which plants usually occur together. The regression analyses showed that P and clay were the most important of the measured factors affecting the occurrence of the species and indicated the importance of the different soil factors for the occurrence of each of the 40 species. This study highlights how crop type and some important growing conditions affect the weed communities in Danish fields. Identification of key factors for the distribution of weed species may be used to improve weed control but may also be valuable for understanding weed communities and for creating a higher biodiversity in arable land.

AB The West African monsoon interacts strongly with the land surface, yet knowledge of these interactions is severely limited by the lack of observations of surface energy fluxes. Within the framework of the AMMA project, three eddy covariance flux stations were installed to sample the three main surface types near Hombori (Mali) in the central Sahel at 15.3 degrees N, and a fourth station was installed near Bamba in the northern Sahel at 17.1 degrees N to sample semi-desert conditions. Observed land types near Hombori comprised a grassland growing on sandy soil (near the village of Agoufou), a flooded forest in a clay-soil depression (Kelma), and a bare rocky soil (Eguerit). The energy balance closure at the grassland site was satisfactory, but less so at the flooded forest site. Surface water heat storage during the flood and advection probably were responsible for most of the imbalance.
   The daily sensible heat flux (H) was fairly constant throughout the year at Bamba and Eguerit, with only a slight increase during the monsoon season corresponding to increased net radiation. By contrast, the seasonal cycle of the grassland site was marked, with H decreasing during the monsoon season from 70 W m(-2) in May to 20 W m(-2) in August. The flooded woodland exhibited the strongest contrast between the dry and wet seasons, with daily sensible heat flux close to zero during the flood. During the peak monsoon season, the two vegetated sites had the highest net radiation and the lowest sensible heat flux, as a consequence of the strong evapotranspiration rates caused by both high soil moisture availability and high leaf area index. Lateral fluxes of water were found to be strong drivers of inter-site sensible and latent heat fluxes variability, with water leaving bare rocky soils as surface runoff and ending in the clay depressions (e.g., Kelma), whereas the sandy soils were locally endorheic, with most of the rainfall being rapidly returned to the atmosphere.
   An attempt was made to scale the sensible heat flux up to the scale of the AMMA northern super-site (60 km x 60 km), following a simple scaling scheme, which accounted for the contrasting surface types and water regimes. The super-site average sensible heat flux proved to be close to the grassland sensible heat flux, in part because grassland occupies 55% of the area. A strong spatial variability was caused by the difference in water regime and vegetation type, at a scale large enough to potentially influence the atmospheric properties such as the boundary layer.

AB This paper presents the R package anacor for the computation of simple and canonical correspondence analysis with missing values. The canonical correspondence analysis is specified in a rather general way by imposing covariates on the rows and/or the columns of the two-dimensional frequency table. The package allows for scaling methods such as standard, Benzecri, centroid, and Goodman scaling. In addition, along with well-known two- and three-dimensional joint plots including confidence ellipsoids, it offers alternative plotting possibilities in terms of transformation plots, Benzecri plots, and regression plots.

   HYBRIDIZATION; ZONE; POPULATIONS
AB Background: Hybrid zones represent valuable opportunities to observe evolution in systems that are unusually dynamic and where the potential for the origin of novelty and rapid adaptation co-occur with the potential for dysfunction. Recently initiated hybrid zones are particularly exciting evolutionary experiments because ongoing natural selection on novel genetic combinations can be studied in ecological time. Moreover, when hybrid zones involve native and introduced species, complex genetic patterns present important challenges for conservation policy. To assess variation of admixture dynamics, we scored a large panel of markers in five wild hybrid populations formed when Barred Tiger Salamanders were introduced into the range of California Tiger Salamanders.
   Results: At three of 64 markers, introduced alleles have largely displaced native alleles within the hybrid populations. Another marker (GNAT1) showed consistent heterozygote deficits in the wild, and this marker was associated with embryonic mortality in laboratory F2's. Other deviations from equilibrium expectations were idiosyncratic among breeding ponds, consistent with highly stochastic demographic effects.
   Conclusion: While most markers retain native and introduced alleles in expected proportions, strong selection appears to be eliminating native alleles at a smaller set of loci. Such rapid fixation of alleles is detectable only in recently formed hybrid zones, though it might be representative of dynamics that frequently occur in nature. These results underscore the variable and mosaic nature of hybrid genomes and illustrate the potency of recombination and selection in promoting variable, and often unpredictable genetic outcomes. Introgression of a few, strongly selected introduced alleles should not necessarily affect the conservation status of California Tiger Salamanders, but suggests that genetically pure populations of this endangered species will be difficult to maintain.

AB The fitness consequences of plural breeding vary considerably among social vertebrates. We tested three hypotheses for the direct reproductive fitness consequences of group living in the degu Octodon degus, a social rodent endemic to central Chile. To test the 'benefits of communal care' hypothesis, we determined the relationship between the number of females per group, per capita direct fitness and offspring survival. To test the 'food abundance and quality' hypothesis, we determined the relationship between the biomass of preferred foods at burrow systems, group size, per capita direct fitness and offspring survival. To test the 'predation risk' hypothesis, we determined the relationship between group size, the density of burrow entrances to which social groups had access, per capita direct fitness, and survival of adults and offspring. Group size of core females (i.e. those with 50% or more nightly overlap) was negatively correlated with per capita direct fitness, but not with the number of females per group or total group size. Group living did not enhance the survival of offspring. Greater biomass of food (at 3 m and 9 m) and burrow density were not linked to larger groups and offspring survival. Our results did not support predictions of the 'benefits of communal care', 'food abundance and quality' or 'predation risk' hypothesis. Pending microsatellite analyses, we hypothesize that survival benefits linked to foraging group size and not reproductive fitness benefits may explain the evolution of sociality in degus.

AB The Pleistocene glaciations were the most significant historical event during the evolutionary life span of most extant species. However, little is known about the consequences of these climate changes for the distribution and demography of marine animals of the north-eastern Atlantic. The present study focuses on the phylogeographic and demographic patterns of the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus (Teleostei: Gobiidae), a small marine demersal fish.
   North-eastern Atlantic, Mediterranean, Irish, North and Baltic seas.
   Analysis was carried out by sequencing the mtDNA cytochrome b gene of sand gobies from 12 localities throughout the species' range, and using this information in combination with published data of allozyme markers and mtDNA control region sequences. Several phylogenetic methods and a network analysis were used to explore the phylogeographic pattern. The historical demography of P. minutus was studied through a mismatch analysis and a Bayesian skyline plot.
   Reciprocal monophyly was found between a Mediterranean Sea (MS) clade and an Atlantic Ocean (AO) clade, both with a Middle Pleistocene origin. The AO Clade contains two evolutionary significant units (ESUs): the Iberian Peninsula (IB) Group and the North Atlantic (NA) Group. These two groups diverged during Middle Pleistocene glacial cycles. For the NA Group there is evidence for geographic sorting of the ancestral haplotypes with recent radiations in the Baltic Sea, Irish Sea, North Sea and Bay of Biscay. The demographic histories of the Mediterranean Clade and the two Atlantic ESUs were influenced mainly by expansions dated as occurring during the Middle Pleistocene glaciations and post-Eem, respectively.
   The pre-LGM (Last Glacial Maximum) subdivision signals were not erased for P. minutus during the LGM. Middle Pleistocene glaciations yielded isolated and differently evolving sets of populations. In contrast to the case for most other taxa, only the northern Atlantic group contributed to the post-glacial recolonization. The historical demography of Mediterranean sand gobies was influenced mainly by Middle Pleistocene glaciations, in contrast to that of the Atlantic populations, which was shaped by Late Pleistocene expansions.

AB River flow regulation by dams for hydroelectric generation has been a common practice worldwide for centuries, with diverse ecological impacts. We studied upstream and downstream reaches of three British Columbia Hydro reservoirs on the Allouette, Coquitlam, and Cheakamus Rivers to determine if riparian plant communities were affected by the dams. We determined cover of all plants in consecutive 1 m(2) quadrats along five to six 14 m-long belt transects in each 300 m upstream and downstream sections of these rivers. We encountered 166 plant species in a total of 448 quadrats. Differences in plant communities (abundance, species richness, diversity) amongst rivers were larger than that between the upstream versus downstream of the rivers. This suggests that any difference caused by reservoir management was within the natural range of variation found across the rivers. We found significant reductions in the occurrences of red alder and western red cedar downstream of reservoirs. The lack of regeneration of these two species maybe attributable to the reduction in extremes of flow variation and lack of sediment transport due to the reservoirs. Coordinated flow management can help mitigate these downstream impacts. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Parental effects arise when either the maternal or paternal phenotype influences the phenotypes of subsequent generations. Simple analytical models assume maternal effects are a mechanism creating delayed density dependence. Such models predict that maternal effects can very easily lead to population cycles. Despite this, unambiguous maternal-effect mediated cycles have not been demonstrated in any system. Additionally, much evidence has arisen to invalidate the underlying assumption that there is a simple positive correlation between maternal performance and offspring performance. A key issue in understanding how maternal effects may affect population dynamics is determining how the expression of parental effects changes in different environments. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that maternal effects influence population dynamics in a context-dependent way. Populations of the soil mite, Sancassania berlesei, were set up at high density (500 eggs) or low density (50 eggs), with eggs that were either laid by young mothers or old mothers (a previously documented maternal effect in this system). The influence of maternal age on both population and egg and body-size dynamics was only observed in the populations initiated under low density rather than high density. This difference was attributable to the context-dependence of maternal effects at the individual level. In low-density (high food) conditions, maternal effects have an impact on offspring reproductive performance, creating an impact on the population growth rate. In high density (low food), maternal effects impact more on juvenile survival (not adult size or reproduction), creating a smaller impact on the population growth rate. This context dependence of effects at the population level means that, in fluctuating populations, maternal effects cause intermittent delayed density dependence that does not lead to persistent cycles.

AB While birdsong is a model system for animal communication studies, our knowledge is derived primarily from the study of only one sex and is therefore incomplete. The study of song in a role-reversed species would provide a unique opportunity to study selective pressures and mechanisms specific to females, and to test the robustness of current theories in an empirically novel manner. We investigated function of female song in stripe-headed sparrows (Aimophila r. ruficauda), a Neotropical, duetting passerine, and found that during simulated territorial intrusions by a female, male or duetting pair, females: (i) sang more than males to same-sex and duet playback, (ii) played a leading singing role in all contexts, and (iii) showed a longer term song response than males. These results suggest that females sing competitively against other females, and that intrasexual selection may be greater among females than among males. This is the first songbird study to show a stronger vocal role in territory defence for females than males. Stripe-headed sparrows are group-living cooperative breeders, and preliminary data suggest that polyandry and/or resource defence may explain strong female singing behaviour. Stripe-headed sparrows may be a useful study species for expanding our knowledge of vocal communication in female animals.

AB Geographical isolation and polyploidization are central concepts in plant evolution. The hierarchical organization of archipelagos in this study provides a framework for testing the evolutionary consequences for polyploid taxa and populations occurring in isolation. Using amplified fragment length polymorphism and simple sequence repeat markers, we determined the genetic diversity and differentiation patterns at three levels of geographical isolation in Olea europaea: mainland-archipelagos, islands within an archipelago, and populations within an island. At the subspecies scale, the hexaploid ssp. maroccana (southwest Morocco) exhibited higher genetic diversity than the insular counterparts. In contrast, the tetraploid ssp. cerasiformis (Madeira) displayed values similar to those obtained for the diploid ssp. guanchica (Canary Islands). Geographical isolation was associated with a high genetic differentiation at this scale. In the Canarian archipelago, the stepping-stone model of differentiation suggested in a previous study was partially supported. Within the western lineage, an east-to-west differentiation pattern was confirmed. Conversely, the easternmost populations were more related to the mainland ssp. europaea than to the western guanchica lineage. Genetic diversity across the Canarian archipelago was significantly correlated with the date of the last volcanic activity in the area/island where each population occurs. At the island scale, this pattern was not confirmed in older islands (Tenerife and Madeira), where populations were genetically homogeneous. In contrast, founder effects resulted in low genetic diversity and marked genetic differentiation among populations of the youngest island, La Palma.

AB Every species occupies a restricted geographic distribution, but it is unclear why natural selection at the range margin fails to increase tolerance to limiting environmental variables and thereby allow continual range expansion. Models indicate that the interplay of demographic asymmetries, dispersal, divergent natural selection, and adaptive trade-offs across spatially varying environments can give rise to stable range limits. Here we examine sister species of the monkeyflowers Mimulus cardinalis and M. lewisii to identify traits that might contribute to the evolution of the species' ranges and to ask whether adaptive trade-offs between environments can limit their geographic distribution. In the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California, M. cardinalis is found from low to mid elevation and M. lewisii is found from mid to high elevation. We transplanted segregating populations of interspecific hybrids to low and high elevation and cross-pollinated those that survived to flowering to create selected populations that evolved at low or high elevation. When grown in a common environment, the progeny of hybrids selected at high elevation flowered earlier compared to a greenhouse control population, whereas hybrids selected at low elevation displayed increased warm-temperature photosynthetic capacity. If adaptation to one environment entails a cost to adaptation in other environments, then selected hybrid populations should display reduced fitness, relative to an unselected control population, when grown in an environment in which they were not selected. Two such trade-offs were observed in this study, where hybrids selected at high elevation displayed reduced biomass when grown in temperatures characteristic of low elevation and hybrids selected at low elevation showed reduced resistance to freezing. These results identify traits under selection for range expansion and suggest that adaptive trade-offs can contribute to limiting the geographic distribution of species.

AB Fire, being both a natural and cultural phenomenon, presents problems in disentangling the historical effect of humans from that of climate change. Here, we investigate the potential impact of humans on boreal fire regimes from a perspective of fuels, ignitions and culture. Two ways for a low technology culture to impact the fire regime are as follows: (i) by altering the number of ignitions and their spatial distribution and timing and (ii) by hindering fire spread. Different cultures should be expected to have quite different impacts on the fire regimes. In northern Fennoscandia, there is evidence for fire regime changes associated with the following: a reindeer herding culture associated with few ignitions above the natural; an era of cattle husbandry with dramatically increased ignitions and somewhat higher fire frequency; and a timber exploitation era with decreasing fire sizes and diminishing fire frequency. In other regions of the boreal zone, such schemes can look quite different, but we suggest that a close look at the resource extraction and land use of different cultures should be part of any analysis of past fire regimes.

AB Climate change will increase the recurrence of extreme weather events such as drought and heavy rainfall. Evidence suggests that extreme weather events pose threats to ecosystem functioning, particularly to nutrient cycling and biomass production. These ecosystem functions depend strongly on below-ground biotic processes, including the activity and interactions among plants, soil fauna, and micro-organisms. Here, experimental grassland and heath communities of three phytodiversity levels were exposed either to a simulated single drought or to a heavy rainfall event. Both weather manipulations were repeated for two consecutive years. The magnitude of manipulations imitated the local 100-year extreme weather event. Heavy rainfall events increased below-ground plant biomass and stimulated soil enzyme activities as well as decomposition rates for both plant communities. In contrast, extreme drought did not reduce below-ground plant biomass and root length, soil enzyme activities, and cellulose decomposition rate. The low responsiveness of the measured ecosystem properties in face of the applied weather manipulations rendered the detection of significant interactions between weather events and phytodiversity impossible. Our data indicate on the one hand the close interaction between below ground plant parameters and microbial turnover processes in soil; on the other hand it shows that the plant-soil system can buffer against extreme drought events, at last for the period of investigation.

AB The increasing urbanization of rural areas leads to a strong development of horticultural flora, which is the main source of alien and invasive plants. In order to assess the pool of cultivated species under different urbanization pressures, the diversity and distribution of horticultural flora were studied in 120 Mediterranean gardens belonging to three housing density types. The results showed a great richness and heterogeneity of this flora, and similarities in species composition between gardens of the same housing density types. Twenty-four percent of the cultivated species are well adapted to the Mediterranean climate, and 21 species known to be invasive on the French territory have emanated from gardens. Inventorying areas adjoining gardens would be useful in identifying escaped garden plants and to assess the associated risks for biological diversity. The results also suggested a detailed analysis of the influence of social, economic and regional factors on planting practices, in order to identify the drivers of these original floral patterns.

AB The effects of habitat gaps on breeding success and parental daily energy expenditure (DEE) were investigated in great tits (Parus major) and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) in urban parkland (Cardiff, UK) compared with birds in deciduous woodland (eastern England, UK). Tree canopy height, the percentage of gap in the canopy and the percentage of oak (in the wood only) within a 30 m radius of nest boxes were obtained from airborne remote-sensed data. Breeding success was monitored and parental DEE (great tits: both habitats; blue tits: park only) was measured using doubly labelled water in birds feeding young. In the park, mean (+/- SD) tree height (7.5 +/- 4.7 m) was less than in the wood (10.6 +/- 4.5 m), but the incidence of gaps (32.7 +/- 22.6%) was greater (9.2 +/- 14.7%). Great tits and blue tits both reared fewer young in the park and chick body mass was also reduced in park-reared great tits. Park great tits had a higher DEE (86.3 +/- 12.3 kJ day(-1)) than those in the wood (78.0 +/- 11.7 kJ day(-1)) and, because of smaller brood sizes, worked about 64% harder for each chick reared. Tits in the park with more than about 35% gap around their boxes had higher DEEs than the average for the habitat. In the wood, great tits with less oak around their boxes worked harder than average. Thus structural gaps, and functional gaps generated by variation in the quality of foraging habitat, increased the costs of rearing young.

AB The recent discovery of cryptic species in marine holoplankton, organisms that 'drift' in oceanic currents throughout their life cycle, contrasts with their potential for long-distance passive dispersal and presumably high gene flow. These observations suggest that holoplankton species are adapting to surprisingly small-scale oceanographic features and imply either limited dispersal or strong selection gradients. Acartia tonsa is a widespread and numerically dominant estuarine copepod containing deep mitochondrial lineages within and among populations along the northwestern Atlantic coast. In this study, we intensively investigated A. tonsa populations in Chesapeake Bay with the goals of testing species status for the deep lineages and testing for their association with environmental features over space and time. Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences from mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (mtCOI) and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nITS) resolved two concordant monophyletic clades. Deep divergence between the two clades (13.7% uncorrected sequence divergence for mtCOI and 32.2% for nITS) and genealogical concordance within sympatric populations strongly suggest that the two clades represent reproductively isolated cryptic species. Based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms of mtCOI, representatives from the two clades were found consistently associated with contrasting salinity regimes (oligohaline vs. meso-polyhaline) with an overlap between 2 and 12 PSU in samples from 1995 to 2005. Finding these patterns in one of the best-known estuarine copepods reinforces the conclusion that marine biodiversity is underestimated, not only in terms of species numbers, but also with respect to niche partitioning and the potential importance of ecological divergence in marine holoplankton.

AB Understanding the evolution of sexual ornaments, and particularly that of female sexual ornaments, is an enduring challenge in evolutionary biology. Key to this challenge are establishing the relationship between ornament expression and female reproductive investment, and determining the genetic basis underpinning such relationship. Advances in genomics provide unprecedented opportunities to study the genetic architecture of sexual ornaments in model species. Here, we present a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of a female sexual ornament, the comb of the fowl, Gallus gallus, using a large-scale intercross between red junglefowl and a domestic line, selected for egg production. First, we demonstrate that female somatic investment in comb reflects female reproductive investment. Despite a trade-off between reproductive and skeletal investment mediated by the mobilization of skeletal minerals for egg production, females with proportionally large combs also had relatively high skeletal investment. Second, we identify a major QTL for bisexual expression of comb mass and several QTL specific to female comb mass. Importantly, QTL for comb mass were nonrandomly clustered with QTL for female reproductive and skeletal investment on chromosomes one and three. Together, these results shed light onto the physiological and genetic architecture of a female ornament.

AB Impacts of plant invasions are largely scale-dependent and responses to the same exotic species may vary among communities. Since impacts caused by individual trees could anticipate consequences of a closed canopy of an invader, we studied the response of Gala-pagos native plants to quinine (Cinchona pubescens) trees in two vegetation zones. Quinine has invaded > 11,000 ha of Santa Cruz Island, including the Miconia- and Fern-Sedge-Zones. We analysed species composition and abundance along transects radiating from the trunks of individual quinine trees. Species richness and percentage cover decreased significantly with proximity to individual trees, and these effects were more pronounced in the Fern-Sedge Zone than in the Miconia Zone. Cover of endemic and native herb species and grass species significantly declined by 57-88% in the Fern-Sedge Zone. This was not the case in the Miconia Zone, but here the dominant endemic Miconia robinsoniana decreased by 41%. Quinine is a major driver of plant community change in both vegetation zones. The greater susceptibility of species in the Fern-Sedge Zone was ascribed to the presence of a new growth form: quinine trees in a formerly treeless environment. Species of the Miconia Zone appeared to be better pre-adapted to higher shade levels created by the Miconia shrubs. Our results emphasize the need for future control of quinine to preserve the diversity of the native Galapagos flora.

AB Anoxia occurs in bottom waters of stratified estuaries when respiratory consumption of oxygen, primarily by bacteria, outpaces atmospheric and photosynthetic reoxygenation. Once water becomes anoxic, bacterioplankton must change their metabolism to some form of anaerobic respiration. Analysis of redox chemistry in water samples spanning the oxycline of Chesapeake Bay during the summer of 2004 suggested that there was a succession of respiratory metabolism following the loss of oxygen. Bacterial community doubling time, calculated from bacterial abundance (direct counts) and production (anaerobic leucine incorporation), ranged from 0.36 to 0.75 day and was always much shorter than estimates of the time that the bottom water was anoxic (18 to 44 days), indicating that there was adequate time for bacterial community composition to shift in response to changing redox conditions. However, community composition (as determined by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of 16S rRNA genes) in anoxic waters was very similar to that in surface waters in June when nitrate respiration was apparent in the water column and only partially shifted away from the composition of the surface community after nitrate was depleted. Anoxic water communities did not change dramatically until August, when sulfate respiration appeared to dominate. Surface water populations that remained dominant in anoxic waters were Synechococcus sp., Gammaproteobacteria in the SAR86 clade, and Alphaproteobacteria relatives of Pelagibacter ubique, including a putative estuarine-specific Pelagibacter cluster. Populations that developed in anoxic water were most similar (<92% similarity) to uncultivated Firmicutes, uncultivated Bacteroidetes, Gammaproteobacteria in the genus Thioalealovibrio, and the uncultivated SAR406 cluster. These results indicate that typical estuarine bacterioplankton switch to anaerobic metabolism under anoxic conditions but are ultimately replaced by different organisms under sulfidic conditions.

AB Alpine treeline ecotones can be gradual transitions, abrupt boundaries, or patchy mosaics, and these different patterns may indicate important processes and dynamic properties. We present observed spatial patterns of a wide range of tropical treelines and try to explain these patterns. Treelines were studied at seven sites in the tropical and subtropical Andes (Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela) and on a Hawaiian volcano (Haleakala, Maui). Treeline vegetation structure was described using transects perpendicular to the treeline, and air and soil temperatures were measured above and below the forest boundary. Temperature fluctuations were much larger and the average temperature was higher in alpine vegetation than in forest. Most treelines were abrupt, with surprisingly similar patterns across a wide geographical range. This abruptness could result from positive feedback processes mediated by the differences in microclimate between forest and paramo. Our data is not conclusive about the relative importance of microclimate as opposed to fire in mediating such feedbacks. However, our extensive set of comparable data from different sites in a large geographical region is an important step toward a better understanding of the nature and dynamics of tropical alpine treelines.

AB Aim To evaluate the joint and independent effects of spatial location, landscape composition and landscape structure on the distribution patterns of bird and carabid beetle assemblages in a mosaic landscape dominated by pine plantation forests.
   Location A continuous 3000-ha landscape mosaic with native maritime pine Pinus pinaster plantations of different ages, deciduous woodlands and open habitats, located in the Landes de Gascogne forest of south-western France.
   Methods We sampled breeding birds by 20-min point counts and carabid beetles by pitfall trapping using a systematic grid sampling of 200 points every 400 m over the whole landscape. Explanatory variables were composed of three data sets derived from GIS habitat mapping: (1) spatial variables (polynomial terms of geographical coordinates of samples), (2) landscape composition as the percentage cover of the six main habitats, and (3) landscape structure metrics including indices of fragmentation and spatial heterogeneity. We used canonical correspondence analysis with variance partitioning to evaluate the joint and independent effects of the three sets of variables on the ordination of species assemblages. Moran's I correlograms and Mantel tests were used to assess for spatial structure in species distribution and relationships with separate landscape attributes.
   Results Landscape composition was the main factor explaining the distribution patterns of birds and carabids at the mesoscale of 400 X 400 m. Independent effects of spatial variables and landscape structure were still significant for bird assemblages once landscape composition was controlled for, but not for carabid assemblages. Spatial distributions of birds and carabids were primarily influenced by the amount of heathlands, young pine plantations, herbaceous firebreaks and deciduous woodlands. Deciduous woodland species had positive responses to edge density, while open habitat species were positively associated with mean patch area.
   Main conclusions Forest birds were favoured by an increase in deciduous woodland cover and landscape heterogeneity, but there was no evidence for a similar effect on carabid beetles. Fragmentation of open habitats negatively affected both early-successional birds and carabids, specialist species being restricted to large heathlands and young plantations. Several birds of conservation concern were associated with mosaics of woodlands and grasslands, especially meadows and firebreaks. Conserving biodiversity in mosaic plantation landscapes could be achieved by the maintenance of a significant amount of early-successional habitats and deciduous woodland patches within a conifer plantation matrix.

AB Impressive variation in egg colouration among birds has puzzled evolutionary biologists for a long time. The most frequently studied selective forces moulding egg colouration-predation and brood parasitism-have either received little empirical support or may play a role in only a minority of species. A novel hypothesis has suggested that egg colour may be significantly influenced by sexual selection. Females may deposit a blue-green pigment biliverdin into eggshells instead of using it for themselves as a powerful antioxidant. By this handicap, females may signal their quality to males, which are then hypothesized to increase their paternal effort. We experimentally tested the hypothesis in the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis), a species laying blue-green eggs. We cross-fostered clutches between nests to disentangle effects of female/territory quality and egg colour on paternal effort and nestling quality. The results supported two assumptions of sexual signalling through egg colour hypothesis: Blue pigment seems to be a limited resource for females, and female quality is positively correlated with the intensity of the blue-green colour. However, we did not find support for the main prediction of the hypothesis, as male parental effort parameters (feeding frequencies to nestlings and intensity of nest defence) were unrelated to egg colour. We discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between our results and previous correlative analyses that supported the hypothesis that blue egg colour may be a postmating, sexually selected signal in females.

AB We examined long-term variability of the biological traits of benthic macroinvertebrate communities using data collected annually (20-, 7-, and 8-years in duration, respectively) from three study regions in northern California's mediterranean-climate region. We related temporal variability to several climatic and physical variables representing precipitation and hydrologic conditions, and assessed the stability of biological-trait composition using time-lag regression analysis. We also examined the temporal variability of trait diversity metrics and their relationship to taxa richness. Trait modalities exhibited high temporal variability (similar to 20 % of all trait modalities had a CV > 50 %) and biological-trait composition varied along a gradient from dry (extreme drought) to wet (above average) years. Traits conferring resistance or resilience to drying (e.g. desiccation resistance, aerial respiration) were more common in drought years, whereas traits conferring resistance or resilience to floods (e.g. flattened body shape, drift dispersal) were more common in wet years. Furthermore, prolonged drought and the patterns of increasing or decreasing precipitation over time in the study regions resulted in patterns of directional change in biological-trait composition. Although biological traits had high temporal variation within each region, between-region variation was higher than temporal variation in a single region. As found in other studies, trait diversity and richness metrics were relatively invariable over time despite high taxonomic turnover. However, there was considerable regional variation in trait diversity metrics along a gradient of increasing taxonomic diversity. The four functional metrics studied showed high redundancy. Taxa richness was positively correlated with three functional metrics (trait richness and two trait diversity measures), and trait richness and diversity became saturated taxa richness increased (similar to 50 taxa). In communities largely controlled by abiotic factors, such as stream invertebrates in mediterranean-climate, high redundancy may be the result of strong filtering of traits at larger spatial scales.

AB Biological soil crusts are key mediators of carbon and nitrogen inputs for arid land soils and often represent a dominant portion of the soil surface cover in and lands. Free-living soil nematode communities reflect their environment and have been used as biological indicators of soil condition. In this study, we test the hypothesis that nematode communities are successionally more mature beneath well-developed, late-successional stage crusts than immature, early-successional stage crusts. We identified and enumerated nematodes by genus from beneath early- and late-stage crusts from both the Colorado Plateau, Utah (cool, winter rain desert) and Chihuahuan Desert, New Mexico (hot, summer rain desert) at 0-10 and 10-30 cm depths. As hypothesized, nematode abundance, richness, diversity, and successional maturity were greater beneath well-developed crusts than immature crusts. The mechanism of this aboveground-belowground link between biological soil crusts and nematode community composition is likely the increased food, habitat, nutrient inputs, moisture retention, and/or environmental stability provided by late-successional crusts. Canonical correspondence analysis of nematode genera demonstrated that nematode community composition differed greatly between geographic locations that contrast in temperature, precipitation, and soil texture. We found unique assemblages of genera among combinations of location and crust type that reveal a gap in scientific knowledge regarding empirically derived characterization of dominant nematode genera in deserts soils and their functional role in a crust-associated food web.

AB Recent range expansions have probably occurred in many species, as they often happen after speciation events, after ice ages, or after the introduction of invasive species. While it has been shown that. range expansions lead to patterns of molecular diversity distinct from those of a pure demographic expansion, the fact that many species do live in heterogeneous environments has not been taken into account. We develop here a model of range expansion with a spatial heterogeneity of the environment, which is modeled as a gamma distribution of the carrying capacities of the demes. By allowing temporal variation of these carrying capacities, our model becomes a new metapopulation model linking ecological parameters to molecular diversity. We show by extensive simulations that environmental heterogeneity induces a loss of genetic diversity within demes and increases the degree of population differentiation. We find that metapopulations with low average densities are much more affected by environmental heterogeneity than metapopulations with high average densities, which are relatively insensitive to spatial and temporal variations of the environment. Spatial heterogeneity is shown to have a larger impact on genetic diversity than temporal heterogeneity. Overall, temporal heterogeneity and local extinctions are not found to leave any specific signature on molecular diversity that cannot be produced by spatial heterogeneity.

AB Stomach data were examined to assess the key factors that determine diet composition in some of the most important demersal fish species in Icelandic waters and to identify major feeding guilds. The data were collected during the groundfish surveys conducted by the Marine Research Institute in 1992. The factors examined included geographic position, depth, season, and fish size. Data were analysed using multivariate methods: canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS), and hierarchical clustering. For the CCA, important explanatory variables for the observed feeding patterns were found using forward stepwise selection. Fish size was the most important explanatory variable for most species, reflecting distinct ontogenetic shifts in diets. A large variation in diet composition was observed, and the CCA model explained 6-16% of the total variation. The spatial and seasonal variability in diets reflected, in general, patterns of prey availability. Among the main predators, the two major feeding guilds were (i) species preying mainly on echinoderms, supplemented with fish and other benthic invertebrates, and (ii) species preying mainly on crustaceans and fish.

AB Plant and animal population sizes inevitably change following habitat loss, but the mechanisms underlying these changes are poorly understood. We experimentally altered habitat volume and eliminated top trophic levels of the food web of invertebrates that inhabit rain-filled leaves of the carnivorous pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea. Path models that incorporated food-web structure better predicted population sizes of food-web constituents than did simple keystone species models, models that included only autecological responses to habitat volume, or models including both food-web structure and habitat volume. These results provide the first experimental confirmation that trophic structure can determine species abundances in the face of habitat loss.

AB Coral reef conservation management policy often focuses on larval retention and recruitment of marine fish with scant data available on important, less motile reef-building species such as corals. To evaluate the concept of population connectivity in corals, we tested whether broadcast spawning reproduction per se confers the same degree of dispersal to two sister species, Montastraea annularis (Anthozoa: Scleractinia; Ellis and Solander 1786) and M. faveolata (Ellis and Solander 1786), both dominant taxa in reefs of the northern Caribbean. Genetic analyses of ten nuclear DNA loci (seven microsatellite and three single-copy RFLP) reveal strikingly different patterns of population genetic subdivision for these closely related, sympatric species, in spite of likely identical dispersal abilities. Strong population genetic structure typified the architecture of M. annularis, whereas M. faveolata populations were principally genetically well mixed. A higher level of clonality was observed in M. annularis potentially because of a susceptibility to physical fragmentation. Clonality did not, however, significantly contribute to population genetic structure or low-level Hardy-Weinberg and linkage disequilibria observed in some populations. The lack of consistent association between reproductive mode and dispersal reinforces the perspective that population connectivity is not so much a function of predictable marine population source and sink relationships as is due to a more complex interface of oceanic currents interacting with and amplifying stochastic fluctuations in larval supply and settlement success. Our results support others promoting an overall ecosystem approach in marine protected area design.

AB Song overlapping in birds is used and perceived as a signal of aggression, and evidence suggests that eavesdropping females base their extrapair mating decisions on the performance of males in vocal contests. In our study population of nightingales a large proportion of territorial males remain unpaired throughout the breeding season. A comparison between subsequently mated males and unpaired males may reveal whether females could use singing performance during vocal interactions in their choice of a social mate. We investigated how males that differed in their subsequent pairing status overlapped a noninteractive playback during the period of mate attraction, and how males used specific structural song components in response to playback. Subsequently mated males overlapped more playback songs than did males that remained unpaired throughout the breeding season. Males also adjusted the use of specific song components and decreased song rate during playback, suggesting that the flexible use of structural song components is more important in vocal contests than increasing song output. Because song overlapping is thought to be a signal of aggression, more aggressive males seem to have greater pairing success. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Incipient species groups or young adaptive radiations such as crossbills (Aves: Loxia) present the opportunity to investigate directly the processes occurring during speciation. New World crossbills include white-winged crossbills (Loxia leucoptera), Hispaniolan crossbills (Loxia megaplaga), and red crossbills (Loxia curvirostra complex), the last of which is comprised of at least nine morphologically and vocally differentiated forms ('call types') where divergent natural selection for specialization on different conifer resources has been strongly implicated as driving diversification. Here we use amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers to investigate patterns of genetic variation across populations, call types, and species of New World crossbills. Tree-based analyses using 440 AFLP loci reveal strongly supported clustering of the formally recognized species, but did not separate individuals from the eight call types in the red crossbill complex, consistent with recent divergence and ongoing gene flow. Analyses of genetic differentiation based on inferred allele frequency variation however, reveal subtle but significant levels of genetic differentiation among the different call types of the complex and indicate that between call-type differentiation is greater than that found among different geographic locations within call types. Interpreted in light of evidence of divergent natural selection and strong premating reproductive isolation, the observed genetic differentiation suggests restricted gene flow among sympatric call types consistent with the early stages of ecological speciation.

AB Contact calls are used to maintain cohesion and coordinate movements in social animals. The amount and type of identity information provided by contact calls are linked to social organization. Socially stable species often converge on shared group-specific contact calls. In socially fluid species, contact calls tend to be individually distinctive; evidence indicates that such calls are important for mediating individual-specific interactions. Dolphins, for example, will mimic the individually distinctive contact calls of other individuals while socializing. We examined contact calls in another fission-fusion species, the orange-fronted parakeet. Free-living and temporarily captive nonbreeding pairs as well as free-living breeding pairs were recorded. In all contexts, pairs produced multiple (up to nine) discrete contact call types, but like dolphins, typically favoured one to two individually specific variants per bird. The number of dominant variants produced and their evenness of use varied with context. Captive pairs produced the fewest dominants, using them with high evenness. Free-living nonbreeding pairs produced more dominants, and showed similarly high evenness. Breeding pairs varied widely in the number of dominants produced and their evenness of use, showing both the highest and lowest values of each. Latent acoustic measures revealed greater structural variation within and among dominants for free-living compared to captive pairs, presumably reflecting the increased opportunity for social interaction available in the wild. Across contexts, calls could be accurately assigned to pair using acoustic measures; however, within-pair call clustering was not greater than that between pairs. Pairs' calls were distinctive, but in a way that preserved individual variation.

AB Attempts to understand the current distributions of plants and animals require both historical and ecological information. Phylogeography has proved highly effective in elucidating historical events such as postglacial colonisations in north temperate zones. However, interesting questions still await resolution. Lusitanian distributions of fauna and flora in western Europe, for example, have Puzzled biogeographers for more than 150 years. Lusitanian species have highly disjunct distributions in Ireland and in Iberia, often with few or no other populations inbetween. Despite Much debate, no agreed explanation for Lusitanian distributions has yet emerged. We investigated the phylogeographic Structure of one Lusitanian species, the natterjack toad Bufo calamita, using mitochondrial DNA control region sequences and allelic variation at eight rnicrosatellite loci. Our results show that this amphibian Must have survived in north European refugia, as well as in Iberia, during and since the last (Weichselian) glacial maximum around 20,000 years before present (BP). Subsequent local recolonisation after the Younger Dryas cooling around 11,000 years BP best explains the Lusitanian aspect of natterjack toad distribution. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The succession in bacterial community composition was studied over two years in the epilimnion and hypolimnion of two freshwater systems: a natural lake (Pavin Lake) and a lake-reservoir (Sep Reservoir). The bacterial community composition was determined by cloning-sequencing of 16S rRNA and by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. Despite large hydrogeological differences, in the Sep Reservoir and Pavin Lake the dominant bacteria were from the same taxonomic divisions, particularly Acrinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria. In both ecosystems, these major bacterial divisions showed temporal fluctuations that were much less marked than those occurring at a finer phylogenetic scale. Nutrient availability and mortality factors, the nature of which differed from one lake to another, covaried with the temporal variations in the bacterial community composition at all sampling depths, whereas factors related to seasonal forces (temperature and outflow for Sep Reservoir) seemed to account only for the variation of the hypolimnion bacterial community composition. No seasonal reproducibility in temporal evolution of bacterial community from one year to the next was observed.

ID MACROECOLOGICAL PATTERNS; GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE; SIZE RELATIONSHIPS;

AB Aim We analysed spatial datasets of abundance across the entirety, or near entirety, of the geographical ranges of 134 tree species to test macroecological hypotheses concerning the distribution of abundance across geographical ranges.
   Location Our abundance estimates came via the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Eastwide Database, which contains data for 134 eastern North American tree species.
   Methods We extracted measures of range size and the spatial location of abundance relative to position in the range for each species to test four hypotheses: (a) species occur in low abundance throughout most of their geographical range; (b) there is a positive interspecific relationship between abundance and range size; (c) species are more abundant in the centre of their range; and (d) there is a bimodal distribution of spatial autocorrelation in abundance across a species range.
   Results Our results demonstrate that (a) most species (85%) are abundant somewhere in their geographical range; (b) species achieving relatively high abundance tend to have larger range sizes; (c) the widely held assumption that species exhibit an 'abundant-centre distribution' is not well supported for the majority of species; we suggest 'abundant-core' as a more suitable term; and (d) there is no evidence of a bimodal distribution of spatial autocorrelation in abundance.
   Main Conclusions For many tree species, high abundance can be achieved at any position in the range, though suitable sites are found with less frequency towards range edges. Competitive relationships may be involved in the distribution of abundance across tree ranges and species with larger ranges (and possibly broader niches) may be affected more by biotic interactions than smaller ranging species.

AB As trees and shrubs approach the high elevation tree limit, it is often assumed that they fall short in photosynthate (source [imitation). Alternatively, tow temperature may restrict carbon investment (growth, sink Limitation). The content of mobile nonstructural. carbohydrates (NSC) in tissues is considered a measure of the carbon source-sink balance. To test the source vs. sink Limitation hypothesis, we compared tate-season NSC concentrations of various woody taxa. across attitudinal gradients from the subalpine forest to the treeline at the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. Since we were interested in the generality of trends, we present "community" trends across four taxa, namely Quercus aquifolioides, Abies faxoniana, Rhododendron fabri subsp. prattii and Sorbus rufopilosa. NSC concentrations increased significantly with attitude in branch wood, current-year and last-year leaves, while there were no significant trends in stem sapwood and root xylem. The sugar to starch ratio was roughly 1:1 in branches and evergreen leaves, white stems and roots showed a higher starch fraction. Analyses of total nitrogen in leaves and wood tissues indicated no change in the trees' nitrogen supply with elevation. The overall attitudinal. trends of NSC in this group of woody plant species revealed no depletion of carbon reserves near the tree Limit, suggesting that sink limitation predominates woody plant Life across this treeline ecotone community..

AB Introgression is the incorporation of alleles from one species or semispecies into the gene pool of another through hybridization and backcrossing. The rate at which this occurs depends on the frequency of hybridization and the fitness of hybrids and backcrosses compared to 'pure' individuals. The collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis) and the pied flycatcher (F. hypoleuca) co-exist and hybridize at low to moderate frequencies in a clinal hybrid zone in Central Europe and on the islands of Gotland and Oland off the Swedish east coast. Data on hatching success suggest that hybrids are less fertile in Central Europe compared to on the islands. Direct fitness estimates using molecular markers to infer paternity are consistent with the demographic data. Applying a tag-array-based minisequencing assay to genotype interspecific substitutions and single nucleotide polymorphisms we demonstrate that the amount of introgression from the pied to the collared flycatcher is higher in the two island populations (Gotland and Oland) than in two geographically distinct areas from the Central European hybrid zone (Czech Republic and Hungary). In all areas the amount of introgression from collared to pied flycatchers is very low or seemingly absent. The different patterns of introgression are consistent with regional differences in rates of hybridization and fitness of hybrids. We suggest that barriers to gene exchange may have been partly broken down on the islands due to asymmetric gene flow from allopatry. Alternatively, or in addition, more pronounced reinforcement of prezygotic isolation in Central Europe might have increased post-zygotic isolation through hitchhiking, since genes affecting pre and post-zygotic isolation are both sex-linked in these birds. One of our genetic markers appears to introgress from pied to collared flycatchers at a much higher rate than the other markers. We discuss the possibility that the introgressed marker may be linked to a gene which is under positive selection in the novel genetic background.

AB Several North American broad-leaved tree species range from the northern United States at similar to 47 degrees N to moist tropical montane forests in Mexico and Central America at 15-20 degrees N. Along this gradient the average minimum temperatures of the coldest month (T (Jan)), which characterize annual variation in temperature, increase from -10 to 12 degrees C and tree phenology changes from deciduous to leaf-exchanging or evergreen in the southern range with a year-long growing season. Between 30 and 45 degrees N, the time of bud break is highly correlated with T (Jan) and bud break can be reliably predicted for the week in which mean minimum temperature rises to 7 degrees C. Temperature-dependent deciduous phenology-and hence the validity of temperature-driven phenology models-terminates in southern North America near 30 degrees N, where T (Jan)> 7 degrees C enables growth of tropical trees and cultivation of frost-sensitive citrus fruits. In tropical climates most temperate broad-leaved species exchange old for new leaves within a few weeks in January-February, i.e., their phenology becomes similar to that of tropical leaf-exchanging species. Leaf buds of the southern ecotypes of these temperate species are therefore not winter-dormant and have no chilling requirement. As in many tropical trees, bud break of Celtis, Quercus and Fagus growing in warm climates is induced in early spring by increasing daylength. In tropical climates vegetative phenology is determined mainly by leaf longevity, seasonal variation in water stress and day length. As water stress during the dry season varies widely with soil water storage, climate-driven models cannot predict tree phenology in the tropics and tropical tree phenology does not constitute a useful indicator of global warming.

AB Observed responses of upland-oak vegetation of the eastern deciduous hardwood forest to changing CO2, temperature, precipitation and tropospheric ozone (O-3) were derived from field studies and interpreted with a stand-level model for an 11-year range of environmental variation upon which scenarios of future environmental change were imposed. Scenarios for the year 2100 included elevated [CO2] and [O-3] (+385 ppm and +20 ppb, respectively), warming (+4 degrees C), and increased winter precipitation (+20% November-March). Simulations were run with and without adjustments for experimentally observed physiological and biomass adjustments.
   Initial simplistic model runs for single-factor changes in CO2 and temperature predicted substantial increases (+191% or 508 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) or decreases (-206% or -549 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), respectively, in mean annual net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE(a)approximate to 266 +/- 23 g C m(-2) yr(-1) from 1993 to 2003). Conversely, single-factor changes in precipitation or O-3 had comparatively small effects on NEEa (0% and -35%, respectively). The combined influence of all four environmental changes yielded a 29% reduction in mean annual NEEa. These results suggested that future CO2-induced enhancements of gross photosynthesis would be largely offset by temperature-induced increases in respiration, exacerbation of water deficits, and O-3-induced reductions in photosynthesis. However, when experimentally observed physiological adjustments were included in the simulations (e.g. acclimation of leaf respiration to warming), the combined influence of the year 2100 scenario resulted in a 20% increase in NEEa not a decrease. Consistent with the annual model's predictions, simulations with a forest succession model run for gradually changing conditions from 2000 to 2100 indicated an 11% increase in stand wood biomass in the future compared with current conditions.
   These model-based analyses identify critical areas of uncertainty for multivariate predictions of future ecosystem response, and underscore the importance of long term field experiments for the evaluation of acclimation and growth under complex environmental scenarios.

AB Many specialist species are declining as a result of habitat loss and fragmentation, such that conservation actions typically aim to stem rates of decline rather than bring about genuine recovery. Here, we document the recovery of a species from former population refuges. An extensive survey of the entire British range of Hesperia comma, conducted in 2000, recorded over three times the number of tetrads (2 km x 2 km grid squares) occupied in 1982. This was accompanied by a fourfold increase in the number of populations and a 10-fold increase in the habitat area occupied. The improving status of H. comma is the product of good habitat management, recovering rabbit populations and climate warming, which have improved the quality, and increased the availability, of suitable habitat. This has enabled remnant metapopulations to expand, via distance-dependent colonisation, through large networks of habitat. Metapopulation recovery in H. comma demonstrates that landscape-scale conservation can be successful. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Diatoms were examined in three lacustrine sediment records from Alert, northern Ellesmere Island, and from Isachsen, Ellef Ringnes Island. Diatom assemblages changed markedly since the mid-19th century following relatively stable community composition that spanned centuries to millennia. Three different assemblages, primarily composed of Fragilaria pinnata, Diadesmis spp., or Pinnularia spp., dominated the pre-1850 period at the three sites, but were replaced with different, more diverse assemblages in recent sediments. These species shifts occurred in the mid- to late-19th century in the Isachsen sites, and in the mid- to late-20th century in our Alert site. This difference in timing appears to be a result of the different sensitivities of lakes and ponds to environmental change, rather than of site-specic chemical properties. Reconstructions of pH using diatom inference models indicated increases from 0.5 to 0.8 pH units at these sites over this period of assemblage change. The diatom-inferred pH record from Alert showed agreement with measured climate data from Alert over the last similar to 30 years. These marked community changes suggest that these sensitive high arctic sites have recently crossed important ecological thresholds due to environmental change, most likely related to recent warming.

AB Aim To examine relationships between life-history traits, ecological and chorological characteristics of woody plant species and patterns of genetic differentiation among populations as assessed by chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) markers, and to compare them with patterns previously described from nuclear markers.
   Location Europe.
   Methods Data on cpDNA variation were compiled for 29 temperate European broad-leaved tree and shrub species. Six qualitative and three quantitative characters of the species were tested for their relationship with two parameters of genetic population differentiation (G(ST) and N-ST). Both direct species comparisons and phylogenetically independent contrast analyses were performed.
   Results When the phylogeny was not taken into account, five characters were significantly related to levels of population differentiation. The relationship disappeared in all but two cases (distribution type and seed mass) when analyses controlled for phylogenetic relationships among species.
   Main conclusions The correlation between distribution type (boreal-temperate or temperate) and cpDNA differentiation of temperate European woody plant species suggests that their Quaternary history, in particular the location and isolation of their glacial refugia, is an important determinant of their present-day level of genetic structure. By contrast, the relationship between life-history traits and genetic differentiation at maternally inherited markers is weaker, especially when phylogenetic effects are controlled for.

AB Aim Document the biogeographical distributions of diatoms in the Canadian Arctic in relation to environmental factors.
   Location The Canadian Arctic Archipelago.
   Methods Diatoms were extracted from lake sediments and treated using standard methods. Rarefaction-estimated species richness, diatom concentrations (valves cc(-1)), and diatom abundance were mapped using a Geographic Information System. The physical and chemical parameters of the lakes were measured.
   Results A total of 326 taxa from 63 genera were found in 62 lakes of the study area. Up to 85 and as low as eight taxa were identified in any one lake, and rarefaction-estimated species richness correlated with lake size. Nearby lakes could have greatly different diatom assemblages. Many taxa showed limited distributions. Response surfaces and ordination techniques indicate that a large number of taxa prefer colder regions of the Arctic while the abundance of others was influenced by lake water chemical parameters such as TKN and SiO2.
   Main Conclusions Although many taxa were common and found across the study area, diatom assemblages showed regional differences in the Arctic. Some taxa were not found in either the northern or southern parts of the Archipelago and others were restricted to particular regions. Newly delineated genera showed interpretable geographical patterns and could be related to environmental factors, suggesting that this more natural grouping may enhance our understanding of diatom ecology. Geographical, physical, and chemical factors are needed to explain diatom distributions in the Arctic.

AB Question: What factors limit woody plant recruitment in a mosaic landscape where former agricultural lands are dominated by the invasive tree Ligustrum lucidum (Oleaceae)?
   Location: Subtropical northwestern Argentina.
   Methods: In secondary forest patches, we measured (1) tree, shrub and liana abundance in different size classes; (2) seed rain of Ligustrum and two native trees and (3) topographic, soil and light variables. We used spatial autoregressive models to test for effects of Ligustrum dominance and environment on native plant abundance in each size class. We used multiple regression on resemblance matrices to quantify the relative importance of spatial (e.g. dispersal) and environmental effects on native species composition.
   Results: Native tree abundance in the smallest size class was unrelated to Ligustrum canopy dominance, while native tree abundance in larger size classes and native liana abundance were negatively correlated with Ligustrum dominance. Native species composition was both environmentally and spatially structured, suggesting that some species are dispersal limited. Seed rain was spatially correlated with conspecific basal area for one of two native species, but not for Ligustrum.
   Conclusions: Native tree recruitment appears to be limited primarily by sapling mortality in patches dominated by the invasive Ligustrum. Ligustrum does not appear to be dispersal limited in our study area and is likely to continue spreading. Invaded patches may persist for hundreds of years.

AB Individual differences in sexual behavior have received much attention by evolutionary biologists, but relatively little is known about the proximate causes of this variation. We studied the quantitative genetics of male and female sexual behavior of captive zebra finches and found surprisingly strong maternal effects (differing between individual mothers) on the aggressiveness and song rate of sons and on the daughters' mating preferences for these male traits. We also found that daughters differed in their choosiness during mate-choice experiments depending on whether they originated from eggs produced early or late within the laying sequence of a clutch. Because this effect of laying order occurred independently of hatching order in cross-fostered broods, it must have been caused by consistent within-mother variation in maternal effects transmitted through the egg. Our findings raise the question whether these maternal effects might represent strategic programming of offspring behavior in response to the environment experienced by mothers or whether they are merely nonadaptive byproducts of developmental processes.

AB Ecology has emerged as a global science, and there is a pressing need to identify ecological rules-general principles that will improve its predictive capability for scientists and its usefulness for managers and policy makers. Ideally, the generality and limits of these ecological rules should be assessed using extensive, coordinated experiments that ensure consistency in design and comparability of data. To improve the design of these large-scale efforts, existing data should be used to test prospective ecological rules and to identify their limits and contingencies. As an example of this approach, we describe prospective rules for grassland responses to fire and rainfall gradients, identified from long-term studies of North American grasslands and tested with existing data from long-term experiments in South African savanna grasslands. Analyses indicated consistent effects of fire on the abundance of the dominant (grasses) and subdominant (forbs) flora on both continents, but no common response of grass or forb abundance across a rainfall gradient. Such analyses can inform future research designs to refine and more explicitly test ecological rules.

AB Capsule: Arrival date strongly influenced date of breeding and breeding success.
   Aim: To check our hypothesis that in years with low April temperatures, i.e. when storks started to breed, the relationship between timing of breeding and success would be absent, meaning that, migrants would have no advantage by returning early to their breeding area.
   Methods: We collected data in Poznan province, western Poland during the period 1983-2002. Based on local climatological data we selected eight cold spring years and compared them with the 12 'normal' years. We analysed how weather affected the timing and arrival pattern of White Stork.
   Results: The two groups of years did not differ significantly in population size, but in normal years the arrival date of both parents was earlier. Arrival date strongly influenced (was positively correlated with) date of breeding and (negatively correlated with) breeding success.
   Conclusion: The slopes describing the above relationships did not differ significantly between the two groups of years. Therefore, we speculate that natural selection strongly favours birds that return early from the wintering grounds.

AB Macrobenthic zonation on sandy beaches has been studied widely, whereas meiobenthic/nematofaunal species richness and zonation patterns have received little attention. We investigated community structure, intertidal zonation of nematode species and feeding structure across a macrotidal, ultra-dissipative, sandy beach (De Panne, Belgium). A total of 88 free-living marine nematode species were recorded along transects. Average nematode densities increased from the upper beach (320 +/- 45 ind/10 cm(2)) towards the low-tidal level (2784 +/- 6 ind/10 cm(2)), which corresponds well to the better-known macrobenthic patterns on sandy beaches. While macrobenthic species richness usually increases towards the low-tidal level, nematode species richness reached highest values around the mid-tidal level (34 +/- 3 sp.). This can be explained by an optimal balance between time of submergence, oxygen supply and sediment stability. Multivariate analyses indicated four different nematode assemblages that reflect the tidal zonation patterns: the upper beach, the driftline, the middle beach association and the lower beach association. The assemblages were significantly different from each other although similarities tended to increase down the beach, indicating a more gradual transition between the mid-tidal and low-tidal assemblages. Non-selective deposit feeders dominated all zones except in the driftline, where epistratum feeders were dominant. Percentage of very fine sand and percentage of shell fragments provided the best granulometric variables in determining these assemblages. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Lygodium microphyllum (Cav.) R. Br. (Lygodiaceae) is a climbing fern that is becoming one of the worst non-indigenous invasive plant species in the greater Everglades ecosystem of southern Florida, USA. We examined the fern across a range of scales including the seasonality of its spore production, its height growth within infested sites and its community ecology. These attributes, combined with a series of aerial transects that identified L. microphyllum infestations across southern Florida, were used to develop a spatial model to predict its future spread in the Everglades landscape. The model shows that this non-indigenous invader could become widely established throughout the Everglades by 2014. Although several factors, such as release from natural enemies, may help explain the invasion success of L. microphyllum, it appears likely that traits related to its reproduction, such as propagule pressure, and its ability to grow in a low-light understorey environment, may be among the most important in explaining its ability to invade both disturbed and undisturbed areas far from source populations.

AB Background and Aims Quercus petraea colonized Ireland after the last glaciation from refugia on mainland Europe. Deforestation. however. beginning in Neolithic times, has resulted in small, scattered forest fragments, now covering less than 12 000 ha.
   Methods Plastid (three fragments) and microsatellite variation (13 loci) were characterized in seven Irish populations sampled along a north-south gradient. Using Bayesian approaches and Wright's F-statistics, the effects of colonization and fragmentation on the genetic structure and mating patterns of extant oak populations were investigated.
   Key-Results All Populations possessed cytotypes common to the Iberian Peninsula. Despite the distance from the refugial core and the extensive deforestation in Ireland, nuclear genetic variation was high and comparable to mainland Europe. Low population differentiation was observed within Ireland and populations showed no evidence for isolation by distance. As expected of a marker with an effective Population size of one-quarter relative to the nuclear genome, plastid variation indicated higher differentiation. Individual inbreeding coefficients indicated high levels of outcrossing.
   Conclusions Consistent with a large effective Population size in the historical migrant gene pool and/or with high gene flow among populations, high within-population diversity and low population differentiation was observred within Ireland. It is proposed that native Q. petraea populations in Ireland share a common phylogeographic history and that the present genetic structure does not reflect founder effects.

AB While molecular and quantitative trait variation may be theoretically correlated, empirical studies using both approaches frequently reveal discordant patterns, and these discrepancies can contribute to our understanding of evolutionary processes. Here, we assessed genetic variation in six populations of the copepod Tigriopus californicus. Molecular variation was estimated using five polymorphic microsatellite loci, and quantitative variation was measured using 22-life history and morphometric characters. Within populations, no correlation was found between the levels of molecular variation (heterozygosity) and quantitative variation (heritability). Between populations, quantitative subdivision (Q(ST)) was correlated with molecular subdivision when measured as F-ST but not when measured as R-ST. Unlike most taxa studied to date, the overall level of molecular subdivision exceeded the level of quantitative subdivision (F-ST 0.80, R-ST = 0.89, R-ST = 0.30). Factors that could contribute to this pattern include stabilizing or fluctuating selection on quantitative traits or accelerated rates of molecular evolution.

AB We investigated the relations between female quality and ornamentation and between male breeding investment and female ornamentation in the rock sparrow, Petronia petronia, a passerine in which both sexes have a yellow breast patch. Breast patch size in females was positively correlated with body mass and breeding status; double-brooding and primary females of polygynous males had a larger patch, and patch size could therefore be an indicator of female phenotypic quality. We conducted a field experiment to test whether males allocate their parental effort in relation to female quality, as predicted by the differential allocation hypothesis. We increased and reduced the ornament sizes of paired females and compared the behaviour of their males before and after manipulation. Frequency of brood feeding by the male was not affected by female ornament manipulation; there was a nonsignificant trend for females with enlarged ornaments, contrary to predictions, to increase their feeding rate. Reducing female ornaments resulted in a decrease in male nest attendance, a measure of passive brood defence, whereas enlarging the ornament had no effect. Males concurrently reduced their territorial (song output) and sexual activity (courtship and copulation). The reduction in sexual activity suggests that males may have changed their nest attendance in response to their mate's renesting probability. Whatever the interpretation, these results provide some of the first evidence that not only female, but also male, birds change breeding strategy according to their mate's phenotype in the wild.

AB Periphytic diatoms are potentially powerful indicators of environmental change in climatically-sensitive high latitude regions. However, only a few studies have examined their taxonomic and ecological characteristics. We identified and enumerated diatom assemblages from sediment, rock, and moss habitats in 34 ultra-oligotrophic and highly transparent lakes and ponds on Victoria Island, Arctic Canada. The similar limnological characteristics of the sites allowed us to examine the influence of habitat, independent of water chemistry, on the diatom assemblages. As is typical in shallow arctic water bodies, benthic taxa, including species of Achnanthes , Caloneis , Cymbella , Navicula , and Nitzschia , were most widely represented. Minor gradients in our measured environmental variables did not significantly explain any variance in diatom species, but there were marked differences in diatom assemblages among sites. Pond ephemerality seems to explain some diatom variation, because aerophilic taxa such as Achnanthes kryophila Petersen and A. marginulata Grunow were dominant in shallow sites that had undergone appreciable reductions in volume. We identified several taxa that exhibited strong habitat preferences to sediment, moss, or rock substrates and also found significant differences (P<0.01) in diatom composition among the three habitats. In comparisons with three similar diatom surveys extending over 1200 km of latitude, we determined that surface sediment assemblages differed significantly (P<0.001) among all regions examined. Diatom species diversity was inversely related to latitude, a result likely explained by differences in the lengths of growing seasons. These data contribute important ecological information on diatom assemblages in arctic regions and will aid in the interpretation of environmental changes in biomonitoring and paleolimnological studies.

AB Species-habitat models are important tools in conservation and wildlife management today. Models simulating the long-term ecological consequences of forestry on biodiversity have large potential as guidance for management. In this paper, we evaluated a model, lichen biomass spatially explicit model (LIBSEM) that predicts the temporal and spatial distribution of epiphytic lichens in boreal coniferous forests. We assessed model performance by simulating the standing crop of pendulous lichens (Bryoria spp.) over a 50-year period in a managed forest landscape (Brattaker,4405 ha). We compared the simulated data with independent field data based on sampling of lichen litter in 54 plots stratified by forest age class. Simulated epiphyte standing crop was significantly related to field data but overall model performance was rather poor at the cell level (50 m x 50 m cells) with a modelling efficiency of 12%. Results suggest that the model succeeded better in predicting lichen biomass on the landscape level. We used LIBSEM to assess possible long-term consequences on epiphytes of four management scenarios differing in the length of the rotation cycle. The change in epiphyte biomass was projected over a 200-year period. Results show that an even-aged silvicultural system with a normal rotation (110 years) only can support a low amount of pendulous lichens while short rotation (60 years) is very detrimental to epiphyte communities. Thus, to enhance the abundance of epiphytic lichens it is necessary to use extended rotations, preferably in combination with forest reserves. We conclude that spatially explicit landscape models may act as a guide for managing boreal forests to improve conditions for epiphytes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

AB A large number of herbaceous and woody plants from tropical woodland, savanna, and monsoon forest were analysed to determine the impact of environmental factors (nutrient and water availability, fire) and biological factors (microbial associations, systematics) on plant delta(15)N values. Foliar delta(15)N values of herbaceous and woody species were not related to growth form or phenology, but a strong relationship existed between mycorrhizal status and plant delta(15)N. In woodland and savanna, woody species with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associations and putative N-2-fixing species with ECM/arbuscular (AM) associations had lowest foliar delta(15)N values (1.0-0.6parts per thousand), AM species had mostly intermediate delta(15)N values (average +0.6parts per thousand), while non-mycorrhizal Proteaceae had highest delta(15)N values (+2.9 to +4.1parts per thousand). Similar differences in foliar delta(15)N were observed between AM (average 0.1 and 0.2parts per thousand) and non-mycorrhizal (average +0.8 and +0.3parts per thousand) herbaceous species in woodland and savanna. Leguminous savanna species had significantly higher leaf N contents (1.8-2.5% N) than non-fixing species (0.9-1.2% N) indicating substantial N acquisition via N-2 fixation. Monsoon forest species had similar leaf N contents (average 2.4% N) and positive delta(15)N values (+0.9 to +2.4parts per thousand). Soil nitrification and plant NO3- use was substantially higher in monsoon forest than in woodland or savanna. In the studied communities, higher soil N content and nitrification rates were associated with more positive soil delta(15)N and plant delta(15)N. In support of this notion, Ficus, a high NO3- using taxa associated with NO3- rich sites in the savanna, had the highest delta(15)N values of all AM species in the savanna. delta(15)N of xylem sap was examined as a tool for studying plant delta(15)N relations. delta(15)N of xylem sap varied seasonally and between differently aged Acacia and other savanna species. Plants from annually burnt savanna had significantly higher delta(15)N values compared to plants from less frequently burnt savanna, suggesting that foliar N-15 natural abundance could be used as marker for assessing historic fire regimes. Australian woodland and savanna species had low leaf delta(15)N and N content compared to species from equivalent African communities indicating that Australian biota are the more N depauperate. The largest differences in leaf delta(15)N occurred between the dominant ECM Australian and African savanna (miombo) species, which were depleted and enriched in N-15, respectively. While the depleted delta(15)N of Australian ECM species are similar to those of previous reports on ECM species in natural plant communities, the N-15-enriched delta(15)N of African ECM species represent an anomaly.

AB Seed bank spatial pattern was studied in a secondary forest dominated by Fagus sylvatica and Betula celtiberica in the Urkiola Natural Park (N Spain). Soil samples were taken every 2 in in a regular grid (196 points) and divided into two fractions (0-3 cm and 3-10 cm deep). The viable seed bank was studied by monitoring seedling emergence for ten months. The effect of different factors on seed bank composition and patterning was analysed using constrained ordination as a hypothesis testing tool. Furthermore, the existence of spatial autocorrelation was evaluated by geostatistical analysis. Seed density was high, 7057 seed.m(-2), with a few species dominating. Species composition in the various layers were significantly correlated. The seed bank showed significant spatial structure, which was partially explainable by the spatial structure of the canopy and understorey vegetation. Spatial clumping from 0-8 in was observed in seed bank density and composition, mainly due to the pattern of two abundant taxa Juncus effusus and Ericaceae. The Ericaceae seed bank was related to the spatial distribution of dead stumps of Erica arborea. J. effusus was not present in the above-ground vegetation, which indicates that its seed bank was formed in the past. As expected, the seed bank of this forest reflects its history, which is characterized by complex man-induced perturbations. The seed bank appears to be structured as a consequence of contrasting driving forces such as canopy structure, understorey composition and structural and microhabitat features.

TI Evolutionary individual-based model for the recruitment of anchovy

   VARIABILITY; ENVIRONMENT; SUCCESS
AB Evolutionary simulations are developed to explore environmental constraints that select observed spatial and temporal spawning patterns for anchovy (Engraulis capensis) in the southern Benguela. They couple a realistic three-dimensional hydrodynamic model with an individual-based model in which an evolutionary-based reproductive strategy for adult fish and a passive transport for early life stages are implemented. The evolutionary success of spawning is quantified when patterns at the population level emerge after many generations from constraints at the individual level through a selective process. As a result, several self-sustaining populations are identified considering different sets of selective constraints. Simulated spawning patterns better match the observed mean spawning pattern when two selective environmental constraints are associated: a threshold temperature of 14degreesC, above which the development of early life stages is ensured, and the avoidance of offshore currents that constitute a loss of spawning products. Simulated recruitment patterns are more realistic when considering the constraint of reaching the nursery area. This modeling experience can help to identify, temporally and spatially, environmental factors important for fish recruitment and to establish a hierarchy of these factors. The probable coexistence in nature of several self-sustaining populations of pelagic fishes is shown to be important for recruitment studies.

AB Although fractals have been applied in ecology for some time, multifractals have, in contrast, received little attention. In this article, we apply multifractals to the species-area relationship and species abundance distributions. We highlight two results: first, species abundance distributions collected at different spatial scales may collapse into a single curve after appropriate renormalization, and second, the power-law form of the species-area relationship and the Shannon, Simpson, and Berger-Parker diversity indices belong to a family of equations relating the species number, species abundance, and area through the moments of the species abundance-probability density function. Explicit formulas for these diversity indices, as a function of area, are derived. Methods to obtain the multifractal spectra from a data set are discussed, and an example is shown with data on tree and shrub species collected in a 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Finally, we discuss the implications of the multifractal formalism to the relationship between species range and abundance and the relation between the shape of the species abundance distribution and area.

AB 1 We measured species density, biomass and shoot density for both bryophytes and vascular plants in 90 small plots in 18 calcareous fens. In addition, we recorded leaf area index and litter mass of vascular plants. Our goals were: (a) to compare the relationship between biomass and species density for the two taxonomic groups, (b) to test whether biomass and species density of bryophytes and vascular plants are related to their shoot density, and (c) to assess the degree to which biomass, shoot and species density of bryophytes are correlated with characteristics of the vascular plant layer.
   2 For bryophytes there was a positive linear relationship between biomass and species density. Vascular plant species density was not related to biomass. Furthermore, bryophyte biomass and species density were linearly and positively related to bryophyte shoot density. For vascular plants, only biomass but not species density was related to shoot density.
   3 We concluded that a bryophyte favourability gradient existed along which biomass and shoot and species density increased. This gradient was attributed to positive interactions within dense bryophyte stands, high clonal fragmentation, absence of competitive hierarchies and to the limited ability of larger bryophyte species to replace small species along this favourability gradient.
   4 Since species density for vascular plants varied independently from biomass and shoot density, there was no such favourability gradient as for bryophytes. Large size variation, predominantly negative interactions between species, and clonal integration of species (e.g. tussock-forming grasses and sedges) may be responsible for the different behaviour of the two taxonomic groups.
   5 Bryophyte favourability decreased with increasing vascular plant biomass. Concerning tight availability, we found highest bryophyte favourability at intermediate levels where the combination of radiation and moisture seems to be optimal for bryophytes. No relationship was found between bryophyte favourability and vascular plant shoot density and litter mass.
   6 The negative relationship between bryophyte favourability and vascular plant biomass is important for bryophyte conservation. Stands of low vascular plant production are those with the potential for highest species richness, and should therefore receive conservation priority.

TI An ecological classification of British butterflies: Ecological

SO JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION

DT Article
DE Lepidoptera; ecological attributes; biotope occurrence; ecological
   classification
AB We classify British butterflies using 136 non-biotope associated binary state ecological attributes describing all stages of butterfly life-cycles. Using cluster analysis we identify two groups of woodland species, a group occurring in tall open grassland, another group associated with short sward herb-rich grassland, and a ruderal group. Principal Component and Factor analyses (4 factor solution) are used to identify ecological attributes that determine species groupings. No single attribute or attribute type is responsible for the groupings, which are also insensitive to hostplant type. We use presence/absence data from Butterfly Monitoring Scheme transects in southern Britain to test our classification. On the basis of adult occurrences, similarities within two of the four groups identified from PCA are greater than between groups. Exclusivity between species pairs is also more frequent between groups than within groups. Species' ranges, distributions, biotope range, dispersal ability and recent decline in abundances differ between groups identified by their factor loadings. Ruderal species have large ranges, abundances, extensive mobilities and show little recent decline. The group associated with short sward grassland have the lowest mobilities, and the smallest distributions within their geographic ranges. True woodland species have the smallest biotope range, and the species associated with open areas have the second smallest decline in their distributions. Our ecological classification identifies characteristics of species that determine their habitat requirements and could serve to predict the response of species groups to environmental change on the basis of their ecological attributes. Our method may be of use in identifying the relative importance of ecological attributes of less-well studied taxa and be applicable in less well known geographic regions.

AB Several theoretical models have been proposed to describe population dynamics in a spatially heterogeneous environment. The source-sink model is among the most popular. Diffendorfer recently summarized its assumptions and predictions. Given the model reviewed, he argued that source-sink population dynamics arises if dispersal is somehow constrained. I offer an additional mechanism by suggesting that source-sink population dynamics can be generated by anthropogenic changes in landscapes that occur so quickly that organisms no longer make optimal habitat selection decisions. Individuals select the same habitats as their ancestors but these decisions no longer provide high fitness because of human-induced changes in habitat quality, such as increased rates of predation and/or parasitism. Provided that some of the habitats selected are turned by human-induced changes into sink habitats, source-sink population dynamics can emerge.

AB Plant communities (ground and field layer species) within a wide range of coniferous forest stands across Britain were classified using the National Vegetation Classification, and community composition and diversity related to stand structure and site characteristics. Data were collected from 12 plantation forest sites, encompassing a range of climatic conditions (uplands, foothills, and lowlands), crop types (Scots pine, Sitka spruce, Norway spruce and Corsican pine), and crop ages (pre-thicket, mid-rotation, mature and over-mature). Vegetation communities in lowland sites were poorly correlated with semi-natural woodland analogues, with 'goodness-of-fit' coefficients less than 40%. The highest coefficients were obtained for mature and over-mature pine and spruce stands in the uplands and foothills climatic zones. These stands were matched most closely to semi-natural pinewoods and oakwood communities. Principal components analysis produced four summary soil vectors and four habitat structure vectors, that described 84 and 79% of the variability in the site and stand structure data, respectively. These vectors were related to plant community composition, species richness and diversity using canonical correspondence analysis and correlation analysis. Variation in community composition was related principally to a soil fertility gradient, defined by increasing pH, exchangeable Ca, and available N in NO3- form, coupled with decreases in soil organic matter and N in NH4+ form. Vascular plant and bryophyte species diversity was inversely related to available N.
   Uplands and foothills Scots pine and Sitka spruce sites had plant communities typical of acid, infertile soils, whereas lowland Norway spruce sites had communities associated with high soil fertility.
   Plant community composition and diversity was also significantly related to measures of vertical stand structure. Pre-thicket plots, with high values for field layer vertical cover; had distinctive communities and were more diverse than mid-rotation and mature plots; which had high canopy cover values, and low shrub and field layer cover. A positive relationship was recorded between deadwood volume and bryophyte species diversity, with over-mature Sitka spruce stands in the uplands having particularly high volumes of deadwood due to windthrow. This influence of stand structure suggests that plant community diversity can be enhanced in commercial conifer forests by extending rotation lengths, introducing alternative silvicultural systems such as shelterwood, and increasing deadwood volumes.

AB 1. The chief objectives were to determine the daily energy intake and growth of piscivorous brown trout (Salmo trutta), and to compare the observed values with those expected from models developed previously for brown trout feeding on freshwater invertebrates. Energy budgets for individual fish were obtained from experiments with 40 trout (initial live weight 250-318 g) bred from wild parents, and kept at five constant temperatures (5, 10, 13, 15, 18 degrees C) and 100% oxygen saturation. Each trout was fed to satiation on freshly killed sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) over a period of 42 days.
   2. Energy intake (C-IN cal day(-1)) and growth (C-G cal day(-1)) were measured directly and energy losses (C-Q cal day(-1)) were estimated by difference (C-Q = C-IN - C-G). All three variables increased with temperature. A model previously used to predict the daily energy intake (C-IN(INV)) of trout feeding to satiation on invertebrates was adapted, by changing only one parameter, to provide an excellent model (R-2 = 0.998) for predicting the mean daily energy intake (C-IN(ST)) for the piscivorous trout. Values of C-IN(ST) were 58% (range 48-67%) higher than those for C-IN(INV). A simple model was also developed to estimate mean daily energy losses for piscivorous trout (R-2 = 0.999). Both models were combined to provide excellent estimates of the daily energy gain (growth) of the piscivorous trout, and this was about three times that for trout feeding on invertebrates. The optimum temperature for maximum growth in energy terms increased from 13.9 degrees C for trout feeding on invertebrates to 17.0 degrees C (range 16.6-17.4 degrees C) for piscivorous trout.
   3. The models are basically an extension of those developed for trout feeding on invertebrates. They show clearly how energy intake, growth, and the optimum temperature for growth increase markedly when trout change their diet from invertebrates to fish. The implications of this are discussed and it is shown that, in theory, these increases should continue if a more energy-rich diet was utilised by the trout.

AB Life-history theory predicts that parents face a trade-off between the number and viability of the progeny they produce. We found evidence for an apparent trade-off in a free-living population of American kestrels (Falco sparverius), as larger clutches produced more but lighter fledglings. However, while the body mass of fledglings has traditionally been used as a measure of survival prospect, offspring immunocompetence should also play an important role; We thus measured the T-cell-mediated immune response of fledgling kestrels in relation to brood traits and nest-rearing conditions through a cross-fostering experiment. The immune response was positively correlated with the body condition of fledglings, but was also higher in those hatched from five-egg than four-egg clutches. These results were not influenced by other brood traits, nor by current exposure to stressors and infectious agents, as measured by serological variables. Such ability to resist pathogens may account for why the probability of offspring returning to the study area in subsequent years, when controlling for brood size, was higher for five-egg than four-egg clutches. These results suggest an optimal clutch size through maternal effects on offspring immunocompetence rather than a trade-off between the number and quality of the offspring.

AB 1. Species richness and assemblages of Trichoptera from 157 'pristine' Danish lowland stream sites were analyzed, for dependence on geographical position of the sites and simple physical variables, using two way indicator species analysis and detrended correspondence analysis.
   2. A total of 106 species were recorded, representing approximate to 90% of the species pool known from Danish streams. Only seven species occurred at more than half the sites, whereas an additional 11 species were found at more than a quarter of the sites.
   3. Although sites showed significant regional differences in environmental variables (stream order, width, slope and presence/absence of riparian forest), species richness and assemblages were primarily correlated with stream order, width and slope. Maximum richness was found at the largest (5th order) stream sites.
   4. Regional differences in species assemblages were found, with several species being absent from the islands Funen and Bornholm. Species assemblages also differed between forested and non-forested stream sites.
   5. We found evidence that stream temperature may be of only minor importance in determining Trichoptera species richness and assemblage composition in Danish streams compared to other size-related physical factors.

AB Species richness in communities varies with habitat area, productivity, disturbance level, intensity of species interactions, and regional/historical effects. All of these factors influence coral richness but their effects vary with spatial scale, position on the reef, and regional location. Species richness of corals along depth gradients shows a unimodal, hump-shaped curve that peaks at intermediate depths. Moreover, the peak of the curve is higher in regions with larger species pools. This "regional enrichment" of the local community appears in line transect samples as small as 10 m in length. The pattern suggests that ecological factors operating over scales of tens of meters and regional/historical factors operating over thousands of kilometers can both affect local richness. Regional factors probably include differences in speciation relative to extinction rates among regions and proximity of local sites to richness hotspots. Plausible factors operating at the local scale are species interactions, disturbance, and productivity which combine in different ways to produce the unimodal pattern. Shallow areas support few species because extinction rates are high due to frequent disturbance or because of environmental extremes. In addition, high productivity encourages rapid growth and thus the potential for intense interspecific competition. In areas where branching acroporids are abundant, exclusion by these dominant competitors is possible. Deep areas may be depauperate because few species can tolerate the low light levels found there. Areas of intermediate depth have the richest communities because they are open for colonization by many species and because extinction rates are low. Several theories may explain this "openness" and species persistence:
   1. Occasional disturbance coupled with low growth rates results in glacially slow exclusion by the dominant competitor.
   2. Aggregation of corals creates spatial variation in the intensity of competition and thus refuges from competition within a spatial landscape. Inferior competitors persist because they are superior at dispersal and refuge colonization.
   3. Specialist predators focus on high-density juvenile populations near the parent, creating ecological space for colonization by non-prey.
   4. Coral competitive abilities are roughly equal and recruitment into the community is a probabilistic event. The community thus exhibits random drift and exclusion is an extremely lengthy process. Based upon empirical evidence, these theories are listed in order of plausibility, but still need to be rigorously tested.

AB We investigated genetic and environmental components of variance in avian T-cell-mediated immune response (CMI) through a cross-fostering experiment conducted on wild American kestrels (Falco sparverius). CMI was evaluated in vivo by an experimental challenge with phytohaemagglutinin, a T-cell mitogen, injected intradermally in fledglings. Additionally, we assessed two measures of nutritional condition (body mass and circulating plasma proteins) which could influence the variance components of CMI. A two-way nested ANOVA indicated that CMI of fledgling kestrels was explained more by the nest where the bird was reared (33% of the explained variance) than by the nest of origin (12%). Body mass was explained equally by familial and environmental components, while plasma proteins were only related to the rearing environment. CMI of fledglings was not related to their circulating plasma proteins, but was positively correlated with their body mass. Fledgling body mass seemed to be influenced by pre-hatching or post-hatching maternal effects prior to manipulation since resemblance in body mass of sibships at the age of manipulation was high (h(2)less than or equal to 0.58), and body mass at this age predicted body mass at fledging. Therefore, pre-manipulation parental effects on body mass, such as investment in egg size, could have inflated the familial effects on body mass of fledglings and then on its correlated CMI. When controlling for body mass, most of the variation in CMI of fledglings was explained by the nest where the bird was reared (36.6%), while the variance explained by the nest of origin (4%) was not significant. This means that environmental influences are major determinants of offspring CMI. The low proportion of variance explained by the familial component may have been due to the high correlation of CMI to fitness.

AB Timber harvest with retention of Live ("green") trees, snags, and logs is now a standard practice on federal "matrix" lands within the range of the northern spotted owl. Although specific guidelines have been adopted for the levels and spatial configurations of retained structures, neither the ecological assumptions that underlie these recommendations nor the outcomes of these practices have been rigorously tested. The Demonstration of Ecosystem Management Options (DEMO) study examines the responses of forest ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest to varying levels (percentage of basal area) and patterns (dispersed Versus aggregated) of green-tree retention. In this paper we describe vegetation studies that form the foundation of this long-term, interdisciplinary experiment. We review the results of retrospective analyses and simulation models which suggest that even minimal levers of retention may have important effects on forest development. We describe the characteristics of the DEMO sites, the experimental design, and the principal variables of interest (stand structure, tree regeneration and growth, and understory composition and diversity). We speculate about the silvicultural and ecological responses of forests to varying levels and patterns of retention and focus in particular on the dynamics of the forest understory. We anticipate strong contrasts among treatments in the establishment of early-seral, open-site species, and in the persistence of shade-tolerant plants associated with older forests or forest-interior environments. Short-term responses are likely to be driven by Variation in the distribution and intensity of harvest disturbance. Longer-term trends are expected to reflect the effects of contrasting patterns of canopy retention. We conclude by discussing some of the scientific challenges faced in designing and implementing large-scale, interdisciplinary experiments.

AB Patterns of habitat partitioning have been widely described, but how the patterns are formed is as yet incompletely understood To document and describe the different types of community organization that can produce patterns of partitioning, I surveyed the literature to find examples of habitat partitioning. I then identified, characterized, and tabulated occurrences of the different types of community organization. In ten years of Ecology, there were 66 instances of habitat partitioning accompanied by experimental demonstrations of how the patterns were formed. Shared preferences and distinct preferences were most commonly cited as producing patterns of partitioning (34 and 17 times, respectively), but there were also 8 examples of one-sided preferences, 4 examples of centrifugal organization, and 3 instances of niche contraction. This indicates that a variety of community organizations can produce patterns of partitioning and that shared preferences may occur more frequently in nature than generally thought. The presence of particular types of organization was influenced by the kind of study organism, with shared preferences occurring more frequently than distinct preferences among autotrophs and among different-aged individuals of the same species. Distinct preferences occurred when species were partitioned on different hosts rather than along gradients, suggesting that the kinds of resources that species use in a habitat may also influence how patterns of partitioning are formed.

AB Microsatellite markers were utilized in a study on population genetic diversity of the endemic Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile. Five nuclear and one chloroplastic microsatellite markers detected low levels of polymorphism in 6 populations sampled along the coasts of Italy and Corsica (Western Mediterranean). The number of alleles per locus ranged from 1.5 to 2.0 and homozygosity was high within populations (f = 0.314). In the 120 individuals analyzed, only 32.5 % were distinct genotypes. Although gene flow seems to exist between geographically disjunct meadows (Nm = 1.55), private alleles were found in some localities. In one population in particular (Lacco Ameno, Gulf of Naples), sampled at 2 different depths, a private allele was present only in the individuals of the shallow stand. Distance analysis identified genetic disjunction between the northern and the central-southern populations. This study indicates that (1) clonal growth is important in the maintenance of P. oceanica populations, (2) limited inbreeding occurs in P. oceanica populations, which can be composed of clonal patches of different size, (3) gene flow exists, but genetic disjunction between populations can be influenced by local forces, and (4) microsatellites are powerful markers in detecting genetic variability in clonally reproducing species.

AB An encompassing view of coral reef ecosystems needs to extend beyond the prominent and attractive hard substrata to include soft-sediment habitats associated with the reefs. Focusing on the soft-sediment assemblages within the lagoon of the Great Astrolabe Reef (Fiji), we quantified pat terns, dines and variability of community structure across space and evaluated models for marine biodiversity conservation based on the spatial distribution and rarity of benthic species. Water depth sampled ranged from 17 to 42 m over a spatial sampling scale of 18 x 11 km with 25 localities on average 2.4 km apart. Both plant diversity and biomass were poor predictors of zoobenthic diversity. In contrast to the commonly held view that sediment characteristics are the prime factors in structuring benthic assemblages, spatial variability of the benthos was overriding the generally weak relationships between sedimentary features and the biota. High spatial heterogeneity in community structure is a key feature of the benthic biota in the lagoon. Part of this pronounced spatial heterogeneity stems from the marked patchiness in individual species distributions, here operationally coined 'spot endemism', Out of a total of 211 recorded taxa, 42% were rare, being restricted to a single site. No species' range spanned the entire lagoon; in fact, the maximum species range was 16 out of 25 sites sampled. Furthermore, the number of taxa common to any 2 localities was not strongly linked to spatial distance, with adjoining sites having no more taxa in common than more distant localities. The commonness of rarity, prevalence of highly compressed species' range sizes, and patchiness in benthic diversity all combine to have profound implications for conservation strategies of these marine benthic habitats.

AB Changes in plant production, structure, and tissue composition are primary drivers for terrestrial biogeochemistry under future environmental conditions. Consequently, there is a need for process-oriented assessment of the potential global importance of vegetation controls over extended periods of C and N sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, plant litter quality (lignin content) and carbon allocation to woody tissues are used as surrogates for testing the hypothetical effects of vegetation change on C and N cycles. We tested the CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach) biosphere model, which uses global gridded (1 degrees) satellite imagery on a monthly time interval to simulate seasonal patterns in net ecosystem carbon balance and near steady-state C/N storage in detritus and soils. Under contemporary ''reference'' settings, combined organic matter storage (litter plus surface soil to ca. 30 cm depth) for C and N is estimated highest in tropical and boreal forest ecosystem zones, and in cultivated ecosystems. The worldwide C:N ratio (by weight) for standing litter plus surface soil organic matter (SOM) is estimated at 23. About 14% of the projected global pool of 1327 Pg (10(15) g) soil C resides in ''modern'' form, in the sense that this proportion is in near-steady state exchange with plant production and decomposition on time scales of several decades. Likewise, about 12% of the projected global pool of 104 Pg soil N is in modern form. Sensitivity tests treated litter quality and allocation effects independently from other direct effects of changes in climate, atmospheric CO2 levels, and primary production. For forested ecosystems, the model predicts that a hypothetical 50% decrease in litter lignin concentration would result in a long-term net loss of about 10% C from surface litter and soil organic matter pools. A 50% decrease in C allocation to woody tissues would invoke approximately the same net loss of C as a 50% decrease in litter lignin. With respect to nitrogen, the 50% downward adjustment in litter allocation to woody tissues may increase both the estimated net N mineralization rates and SLOW N pool by approximately 9% on a global basis. This pattern is consistent with an overall increase in N available for cycling, which is affected by the fraction of relatively N-poor to N-rich litter inputs. For comparison to the effects of these surrogate changes in vegetation tissue composition, model response to a globally uniform increase in surface air temperature of 1 degrees C is a net loss of 5% C from litter and SOM pools.

AB We surveyed ground-dwelling small mammals in twenty-four rainforest remnants which were virtual islands surrounded by farmland on a plateau on the east coast of Australia. We investigated the effect of island size, level of disturbance, isolation and microhabitat on the abundance and species richness of the mammals. The remnants ranged from 0.3 to 29 ha, resulting from fragmentation during 175 years of European occupation. Two rodent species (Rattus fuscipes [Waterhouse, 1839] and R. rattus [Linnaeus, 1758]) and one marsupial insectivore (Antechinus stuartii Macleay, 1841) were trapped in these remnants, with an additional species (A. swainsonii [Waterhouse, 1840]) several kilometres away in rainforest on the escarpment of the plateau. Small-mammal species richness was low, but the native species (R. fuscipes and A. stuartii) were abundant.
   Three-way analyses of variance demonstrated that species richness and abundance decreased significantly with decreasing remnant size and increasing disturbance, but showed no distance effect. The abundance and richness of native species responded even more significantly. The interaction between the first two effects is important. Small remnants are affected most detrimentally by increasing disturbance, large remnants are less affected, and medium sized remnants show intermediate effects. The introduced R, rattus which was least abundant in large remnants, but more abundant in distant than near remnants, was also more abundant in those with major disturbance.
   The single most important variable in step-wise, multiple linear regression analyses was the logarithm of remnant area not influenced by edge effects, explaining 39% of the variance in species richness, 57% for native species richness and 46% for A. stuartii abundance. Disturbance related variables additionally contributed from 12 to 30% of the variance in dependent variables, while habitat variables explained between 22 and 48% of the variance, and accounted for two thirds of the explainable variance in R. fuscipes abundance. The implications of our results for wildlife conservation on the plateau are discussed.

AB To assess the potential of the macroinvertebrate community for monitoring variation in the environmental quality of large rivers, the response of littoral macrobenthos in Lake Saint-Francois, a fluvial lake of the St Lawrence River (Quebec) are described. First, the composition of total macroinvertebrate communities and important taxonomic groups as well as the biotic ICI-SL index in Id littoral stations varying in sedimentology, water chemistry and contamination are described to define indicator species groups and environmental quality ranks. Thereafter, the relative contribution of ecological and toxicological factors in explaining the variation observed in macroinvertebrate assemblages and biotic index were quantified using partial canonical correspondence analysis. Cluster analyses based on taxonomic composition separated five groups of stations where macroinvertebrate assemblages varied in density, composition and tolerance to pollution. The ICI-SL biotic index varied from 7.2 to 27.2 with a mean value of 19 +/- 6. The ICI-SL values determined for the macroinvertebrate communities in Lake Saint-Francois did not reflect an important deterioration in environmental quality, and there was some agreement between the environmental quality ranking of the stations expressed either by the ICI-SL index or the community cluster analysis. Water conductivity and phosphorus concentration, followed by macrophyte types (Chara, Ceratophyllum) and sediment grain size, were the most significant ecological variables to explain variation in macroinvertebrate communities and derived ICI-SL index in Lake Saint-Francois. Among the toxicological factors, metals in wafer (Fe, Cr, Pb, Mn, Zn) and sediment (Mn, Pb, Se), as well as the composite indices of metal and organic contamination (water CI, sediment CI, sediment total PAHs) were the most important factors. The contamination factors selected in our models represented contaminant sorption processes rather than direct toxicological effects. The lack of clear relationships between contaminants and macroinvertebrate variables reflected the relative low level of contamination in the stations sampled in Lake Saint-Francois. There were some interactions between toxicological and ecological variables that should be considered in the planning of sampling and interpretation of biomonitoring studies. However, the large amount of unexplained variance (49.2-86.6%) in the CCA models underlined the limitations of the use of the indices of macroinvertebrate community structure that were assessed in this study for biomonitoring purposes in the absence of a contrasting pollution gradient.

AB High dispersal risks of ant queens make staying in the natal patch more attractive than long range dispersal. These alternative strategies and the mode of colony founding determine the average number of queens in the population. Increasing competition and queen predation make independent colony founding increasingly difficult and the only option for new queens to reproduce in the habitat patch may be to enter an existing colony. The effect of nest-site availability to the number of queens was studied in successional spruce-dominated taiga forests in facultatively polygynous ants Myrmica ruginodis, M. sulcinodis Leptothorax aceruorum, Formica sanguinea and F. truncorum. Decreasing relatedness among worker nestmates supports an association between increasing habitat age and polygyny to some extent. M. sulcinodis and L. aceruorum persist in this type of taiga only for a relatively short period. Relatedness varied only slightly among populations, but lower relatedness estimated in other studies suggested higher levels of polygyny in older populations. In M. ruginodis there was more variation in relatedness and it was possibly: connected to the relative proportions of the two social forms of the species. In F. sanguinea and F. truncorum the decrease in relatedness with increasing age of the habitat was dearest. Other factors favouring limited dispersal and acceptance of new queens in the colonies are, however, hard to separate. (C) 1995 The Linnean Society of London.

AB Six isoenergetic pratical diets ranging from 27% to 50% protein were fed for 12 weeks to triplicate groups of the freshwater catfish Mystus nemurus (25.4 +/- 0.89 g body weight and 12.80 +/- 0.4 cm total length). The fish were cultured in a recycling water system maintained at ambient environmental temperature. Weight pin was directly proportional to protein levels up to an incorporation rate of 42%; beyond this level no significant growth (P> 0.05) either in weight gain or protein gain was observed. Protein efficiency ratio (PER) decreased with increasing protein level. Apparent net protein utilization (ANPU) parabolically increased with increasing dietary protein level but decreased when dietary protein level exceeded 42%. Carcass fat and protein content were negatively correlated while ash content was not affected by varying dietary protein levels. Weight pin, food conversion ratio (FCR), PER and ANPU indicated that a 42% protein diet with digestible protein to energy ratio (DP/E) of 113.82 mg/kcal produced maximum growth under the experimental conditions used.

AB This study investigates spatial and temporal patterns of fish assemblage composition in Nepal's Gandaki River, which exhibits extremes of altitude and environmental conditions. Samples (n = 156) were made at 81 sites from the river's headwaters at 3100 m altitude north of the Himalaya Mountains to its lowland mainstream 50 m above sea level on the subtropical Gangetic Plain. Fourteen sites were sampled every season for two years. The ichthyofauna consisted mainly of cypriniforms and siluriforms and also included cyprinodontiforms and perciforms. Detrended canonical correspondence analysis indicated that geography, water quality, and stream hydraulics were the principal physiochemical correlates of fish assemblage structure. Monsoon rains and associated parameters had substantial secondary influence, and vegetation composition and abundance were also significant. The fish fauna showed longitudinal replacement and addition of species, as the number of species increased from one in the headwaters to a maximum of 33 in lowland sites.

AB This paper aims to explore how well numerical techniques that are commonly used at ecological scales, perform at broad biogeographical scales in detecting and explaining major distributional patterns of species within the genus Salix at the European continental scale.
   The occurrences of the sixty-five native Salix species in 484 grid squares comprising Europe, were recorded on the basis of distributional maps in Atlas Florae Europaeae.
   Distributional patterns were described numerically by means of two-way indicator species analysis and detrended correspondence analysis, and were related numerically to thirteen climatic and geographic variables recorded for each of the 484 grid squares by means of simple discriminant functions and canonical correspondence analysis. Regional climate, mainly related to summer temperature, largely accounts for the major distributional patterns of Salix in Europe.
   The number of species in each grid was related numerically to the same thirteen climatic and geographic variables. Area, regional climatic variability, and latitude were the most important predictors for the broad-scale diversity within Salix.
   An attempt was made to relate the distributional patterns to the habitat preferences and morphology of each species. The results suggest that some distributional types can be related to species occurrences in certain habitats and altitudes, possibly because of the temperature tolerances of these species.

AB Canonical analysis, a generalization of multiple regression to multiple-response variables, is widely used in ecology. Because these models often involve many parameters (one slope per response per predictor), they pose challenges to model interpretation. Among these challenges, we lack quantitative frameworks for estimating the overall importance of single predictors in multi-response regression models. Here we demonstrate that commonality analysis and hierarchical partitioning, widely used for both estimating predictor importance and improving the interpretation of single-response regression models, are related and complementary frameworks that can be expanded for the analysis of multiple-response models. In this application, we (a) demonstrate the mathematical links between commonality analysis, variation and hierarchical partitioning; (b) generalize these frameworks to allow the analysis of any number of predictor variables or groups of predictor variables as in the case of variation partitioning; and (c) introduce and demonstrate the implementation of these generalized frameworks in the R package rdacca.hp.

AB Functional diversity is increasingly recognized by microbial ecologists as the essential link between biodiversity patterns and ecosystem functioning, determining the trophic relationships and interactions between microorganisms, their participation in biogeochemical cycles, and their responses to environmental changes. Consequently, its definition and quantification have practical and theoretical implications. In this opinion paper, we present a synthesis on the concept of microbial functional diversity from its definition to its application. Initially, we revisit to the original definition of functional diversity, highlighting two fundamental aspects, the ecological unit under study and the functional traits used to characterize it. Then, we discuss how the particularities of the microbial world disallow the direct application of the concepts and tools developed for macroorganisms. Next, we provide a synthesis of the literature on the types of ecological units and functional traits available in microbial functional ecology. We also provide a list of more than 400 traits covering a wide array of environmentally relevant functions. Lastly, we provide examples of the use of functional diversity in microbial systems based on the different units and traits discussed herein. It is our hope that this paper will stimulate discussions and help the growing field of microbial functional ecology to realize a potential that thus far has only been attained in macrobial ecology.

AB Given increasing water deficits across numerous ecosystems world-wide, it is urgent to understand the sequence of failure of leaf function during dehydration. We assessed dehydration-induced losses of rehydration capacity and maximum quantum yield of the photosystem II (F-v/F-m) in the leaves of 10 diverse angiosperm species, and tested when these occurred relative to turgor loss, declines of stomatal conductance g(s), and hydraulic conductance K-leaf, including xylem and outside xylem pathways for the same study plants. We resolved the sequences of relative water content and leaf water potential psi(leaf) thresholds of functional impairment. On average, losses of leaf rehydration capacity occurred at dehydration beyond 50% declines of g(s), K-leaf and turgor loss point. Losses of F-v/F-m occurred after much stronger dehydration and were not recovered with leaf rehydration. Across species, tissue dehydration thresholds were intercorrelated, suggesting trait co-selection. Thresholds for each type of functional decline were much less variable across species in terms of relative water content than psi(leaf). The stomatal and leaf hydraulic systems show early functional declines before cell integrity is lost. Substantial damage to the photochemical apparatus occurs at extreme dehydration, after complete stomatal closure, and seems to be irreversible.

AB Calypso 480 SC (CAL) is an insecticide containing the active substance thiacloprid (480 g/L) belonging to the family of neonicotinoids. Crayfish represent an important component of aquatic ecosystems and are considered sensitive indicators of water pollution. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of acute exposure of CAL on common yabby crayfish (Cherax destructor) at concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 mg/L. Crayfish behavior and mortality were monitored daily, and the lethal concentrations (LC0, LC50, LC100) of CAL were evaluated at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h. Three concentrations of CAL (0.1, 1, 10 mg/L) were selected for assessment of oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation) and antioxidant parameters superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione Stransferase and reduced glutathione in crayfish hepatopancreas, muscle, and gill tissue at the conclusion of the acute test. Differences in behavior of exposed crayfish from controls were observed at concentration >= 5 mg/L of CAL. The 96 h LC50 value for the common yabby was 7.7 mg/L for Calypso 480 SC. The acute exposure showed reduction of the level lipid peroxidation in hepatopancreas in all experimental groups compared with control. The results of antioxidant activity showed a significant change on glutathione S-transferase in tissue of hepatopancreas while no differences were observed on the others antioxidant parameters in crayfish's tissues. The study provides valuable information on effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on a non-target organism, the crayfish, an indicator of pollution and an important element of stable aquatic ecosystems.

AB Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) occurs when the environment experienced by a parent influences the development of their offspring. In this article, we develop a framework for understanding the mechanisms and multigenerational consequences of TGP. First, we conceptualize the mechanisms of TGP in the context of communication between parents (senders) and offspring (receivers) by dissecting the steps between an environmental cue received by a parent and its resulting effects on the phenotype of one or more future generations. Breaking down the problem in this way highlights the diversity of mechanisms likely to be involved in the process. Second, we review the literature on multigenerational effects and find that the documented patterns across generations are diverse. We categorize different multigenerational patterns and explore the proximate and ultimate mechanisms that can generate them. Throughout, we highlight opportunities for future work in this dynamic and integrative area of study.

AB Macroecology is the study of the mechanisms underlying general patterns of ecology across scales. Research in microbial ecology and macroecology have long been detached. Here, we argue that it is time to bridge the gap, as they share a common currency of species and individuals, and a common goal of understanding the causes and consequences of changes in biodiversity. Microbial ecology and macroecology will mutually benefit from a unified research agenda and shared datasets that span the entirety of the biodiversity of life and the geographic expanse of the Earth.

AB Recent developments in machine learning have expanded data-driven modelling (DDM) capabilities, allowing artificial intelligence to infer the behaviour of a system by computing and exploiting correlations between observed variables within it. Machine learning algorithms may enable the use of increasingly available 'big data' and assist applying ecosystem service models across scales, analysing and predicting the flows of these services to disaggregated beneficiaries. We use the Weka and ARIES software to produce two examples of DDM: firewood use in South Africa and biodiversity value in Sicily, respectively. Our South African example demonstrates that DDM (64-91% accuracy) can identify the areas where firewood use is within the top quartile with comparable accuracy as conventional modelling techniques (54-77% accuracy). The Sicilian example highlights how DDM can be made more accessible to decision makers, who show both capacity and willingness to engage with uncertainty information. Uncertainty estimates, produced as part of the DDM process, allow decision makers to determine what level of uncertainty is acceptable to them and to use their own expertise for potentially contentious decisions. We conclude that DDM has a clear role to play when modelling ecosystem services, helping produce interdisciplinary models and holistic solutions to complex socio-ecological issues.

AB The desert steppe is a large component of the semi-arid grassland ecosystem in northern China, and provides significant resources for livestock production. However, overgrazing is regarded as one of main causes of its degradation and desertification over recent decades. Quantifying the direct and indirect effects of grazing disturbance on plant community productivity in the desert steppe ecosystem can provide insights into appropriate measures for the restoration of degraded grassland and biodiversity conservation. Here, we examine the effects of four grazing intensity treatments: no grazing (control), light grazing (LG), moderate grazing (MG) and heavy grazing (HG) on the plant community and soil nutrients with sheep grazing over 12 years in a desert steppe in Inner Mongolia, northern China. The results showed that increasing grazing intensity resulted in decreased species richness, Shannon-Wiener and Pielou's index, as well as above- and belowground biomass. Soil moisture, nitrogen, available potassium and soil organic carbon were not affected (P > 0.05) by grazing disturbance. In addition, grazing disturbance had a greater indirect effect on aboveground biomass via plant diversity. Consequently, plant diversity is a key indirect factor that determines community productivity in response to grazing disturbance. Reducing grazing pressure can contribute to maintaining relatively high species diversity and productivity in the desert steppe of northern China.

AB Remote sensing of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been suggested as a promising approach for probing changes in global terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). To date, however, most studies were conducted in situations when/where changes in both SIF and GPP were driven by large changes in the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and phenology. Here we quantified SIF and GPP during a short-term intense heat wave at a Mediterranean pine forest, during which changes in APAR were negligible. GPP decreased linearly during the course of the heat wave, while SIF declined slightly initially and then dropped dramatically during the peak of the heat wave, temporally coinciding with a biochemical impairment of photosynthesis inferred from the increase in the uptake ratio of carbonyl sulfide to carbon dioxide. SIF thus accounted for less than 35% of the variability in GPP and, even though it responded to the impairment of photosynthesis, appears to offer limited potential for quantitatively monitoring GPP during heat waves in the absence of large changes in APAR.

AB There is growing recognition that interdisciplinary approaches that account for both ecological and social processes are necessary to successfully address human-wildlife interactions. However, such approaches are hindered by challenges in aligning data types, communicating across disciplines, and applying social science information to conservation actions. To meet these challenges, we propose a conceptual model that adopts a social-ecological systems approach and integrates social and ecological theory to identify the multiple, nested levels of influence on both human and animal behavior. By accounting for a diverse array of influences and feedback mechanisms between social and ecological systems, this model fulfills a need for approaches that treat social and ecological processes with equal depth and facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the drivers of human and animal behaviors that perpetuate human-wildlife interactions. We apply this conceptual model to our work on human-black bear conflicts in Colorado, USA to demonstrate its utility. Using this example, we identify key lessons and offer guidance to researchers and conservation practitioners for applying integrated approaches to other human-wildlife systems.

AB Of all ecosystems, freshwaters support the most dynamic and highly concentrated biodiversity on Earth. These attributes of freshwater biodiversity along with increasing demand for water mean that these systems serve as significant models to understand drivers of global biodiversity change. Freshwater biodiversity changes are often attributed to hydrological alteration by water-resource development and climate change owing to the role of the hydrological regime of rivers, wetlands and floodplains affecting patterns of biodiversity. However, a major gap remains in conceptualising how the hydrological regime determines patterns in biodiversity's multiple spatial components and facets (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic). We synthesised primary evidence of freshwater biodiversity responses to natural hydrological regimes to determine how distinct ecohydrological mechanisms affect freshwater biodiversity at local, landscape and regional spatial scales. Hydrological connectivity influences local and landscape biodiversity, yet responses vary depending on spatial scale. Biodiversity at local scales is generally positively associated with increasing connectivity whereas landscape-scale biodiversity is greater with increasing fragmentation among locations. The effects of hydrological disturbance on freshwater biodiversity are variable at separate spatial scales and depend on disturbance frequency and history and organism characteristics. The role of hydrology in determining habitat for freshwater biodiversity also depends on spatial scaling. At local scales, persistence, stability and size of habitat each contribute to patterns of freshwater biodiversity yet the responses are variable across the organism groups that constitute overall freshwater biodiversity. We present a conceptual model to unite the effects of different ecohydrological mechanisms on freshwater biodiversity across spatial scales, and develop four principles for applying a multi-scaled understanding of freshwater biodiversity responses to hydrological regimes. The protection and restoration of freshwater biodiversity is both a fundamental justification and a central goal of environmental water allocation worldwide. Clearer integration of concepts of spatial scaling in the context of understanding impacts of hydrological regimes on biodiversity will increase uptake of evidence into environmental flow implementation, identify suitable biodiversity targets responsive to hydrological change or restoration, and identify and manage risks of environmental flows contributing to biodiversity decline.

AB Solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) observations from space have resulted in major advancements in estimating gross primary productivity (GPP). However, current SIF observations remain spatially coarse, infrequent, and noisy. Here we develop a machine learning approach using surface reflectances from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) channels to reproduce SIF normalized by clear sky surface irradiance from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). The resulting product is a proxy for ecosystem photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by chlorophyll (fAPARCh). Multiplying this new product with a MODIS estimate of photosynthetically active radiation provides a new MODIS-only reconstruction of SIF called Reconstructed SIF (RSIF). RSIF exhibits much higher seasonal and interannual correlation than the original SIF when compared with eddy covariance estimates of GPP and two reference global GPP products, especially in dry and cold regions. RSIF also reproduces intense productivity regions such as the U.S. Corn Belt contrary to typical vegetation indices and similarly to SIF.
   Plain Language Summary A new proxy for photosynthesis is developed using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer observations and a machine learning approach. The new product is able to effectively reproduce observations from eddy covariance towers and more sophisticated photosynthesis models that rely on more information (such as weather information).

AB Species coexistence in diverse communities likely results from multiple interacting factors. Mechanisms such as conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) and varying life-history strategies related to resource partitioning are known to influence plant fitness, and thereby community composition and diversity. However, we have little understanding of how these mechanisms interact and how they vary across life stages. Here, we document the interaction between CNDD and life-history strategy, based on growth-mortality trade-offs, from seedling to adult tree for 47 species in a tropical forest. Species' life-history strategies remained consistent across stages: fast-growing species had higher mortality than slow-growing species at all stages. In contrast, mean CNDD was strongest at early life stages (i.e. seedling, sapling). Fast-growing species tended to suffer greater CNDD than slow-growing species at several, but not all life stages. Overall, our results demonstrate that coexistence mechanisms interact across multiple life stages to shape diverse tree communities.

AB In this review, we show how climate affects species, communities, and ecosystems, and why many responses from the species to the biome level originate from the interaction between the species' ecological niche and changes in the environmental regime in both space and time. We describe a theory that allows us to understand and predict how marine species react to climate-induced changes in ecological conditions, how communities form and are reconfigured, and so how biodiversity is arranged and may respond to climate change. Our study shows that the responses of species to climate change are therefore intelligible-that is, they have a strong deterministic component and can be predicted.

AB Stomata control carbon and water vapour exchange between leaves and the atmosphere, thus it can influence water use efficiency (WUE) and reflect plant adaptation to climate. However, the spatial patterns of leaf stomatal traits and relationships between stomatal trait and WUE across natural communities remain unclear. We measured stomatal density, stomatal size and stomatal area fraction for 737 plant species from nine forests ranging from tropical to cold temperate forests. Stomatal density, stomatal size and stomatal area fraction were all log-normally distributed, and different across species, plant functional groups (trees, shrubs, and herbs), and communities. At the regional scale, variation in stomatal traits was primarily related to species, followed by climate and soil types. The community-weighted mean of stomatal size increased linearly with latitude, whereas those of stomatal density and stomatal area fraction showed humpbacked relationship. The community-weighted mean of stomatal area fraction was correlated with climatic aridity, consistent with the adaptation strategies of plant species to achieve high maximum rates of gas exchange in arid regions when water is available. Further, community-weighted mean of stomatal area fraction was positively correlated with WUE in natural forest communities, indicating that plants have lower stomatal conductance in order to adapt greater aridity conditions. These findings highlight the strong associations of stomatal traits with plant functional group and climate at a regional scale, representing the adaptation strategies of stomatal traits across natural forest communities to climate.

AB Insect invasions, the establishment and spread of nonnative insects in new regions, can have extensive economic and environmental consequences. Increased global connectivity accelerates rates of introductions, while climate change may decrease the barriers to invader species' spread. We follow an individual-level insect-and arachnid-centered perspective to assess how the process of invasion is influenced by phenotypic heterogeneity associated with dispersal and stress resistance, and their coupling, across the multiple steps of the invasion process. We also provide an overview and synthesis on the importance of environmental filters during the entire invasion process for the facilitation or inhibition of invasive insect population spread. Finally, we highlight important research gaps and the relevance and applicability of ongoing natural range expansions in the context of climate change to gain essential mechanistic insights into insect invasions.

AB Colonization and expansion into novel landscapes determine the distribution and abundance of species in our rapidly changing ecosystems worldwide. Colonization events are crucibles for rapid evolution, but it is not known whether evolutionary changes arise mainly after successful colonization has occurred, or if evolution plays an immediate role, governing the growth and expansion speed of colonizing populations. There is evidence that spatial evolutionary processes can speed range expansion within a few generations because dispersal tendencies may evolve upwards at range edges. Additionally, rapid adaptation to a novel environment can increase population growth rates, which also promotes spread. However, the role of adaptive evolution and the relative contributions of spatial evolution and adaptation to expansion are unclear. Using a model system, red flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum), we either allowed or constrained evolution of populations colonizing a novel environment and measured population growth and spread. At the end of the experiment we assessed the fitness and dispersal tendency of individuals originating either from the core or edge of evolving populations or from nonevolving populations in a common garden. Within six generations, evolving populations grew three times larger and spread 46% faster than populations in which evolution was constrained. Increased size and expansion speed were strongly driven by adaptation, whereas spatial evolutionary processes acting on edge subpopulations contributed less. This experimental evidence demonstrates that rapid evolution drives both population growth and expansion speed and is thus crucial to consider for managing biological invasions and successfully introducing or reintroducing species for management and conservation.

AB Ecological mechanisms influence relationships among microbial communities, which in turn impact biogeochemistry. In particular, microbial communities are assembled by deterministic (e.g., selection) and stochastic (e.g., dispersal) processes, and the relative balance of these two process types is hypothesized to alter the influence of microbial communities over biogeochemical function. We used an ecological simulation model to evaluate this hypothesis, defining biogeochemical function generically to represent any biogeochemical reaction of interest. We assembled receiving communities under different levels of dispersal from a source community that was assembled purely by selection. The dispersal scenarios ranged from no dispersal (i.e., selection-only) to dispersal rates high enough to overwhelm selection (i.e., homogenizing dispersal). We used an aggregate measure of community fitness to infer a given community's biogeochemical function relative to other communities. We also used ecological null models to further link the relative influence of deterministic assembly to function. We found that increasing rates of dispersal decrease biogeochemical function by increasing the proportion of maladapted taxa in a local community. Niche breadth was also a key determinant of biogeochemical function, suggesting a tradeoff between the function of generalist and specialist species. Finally, we show that microbial assembly processes exert greater influence over biogeochemical function when there is variation in the relative contributions of dispersal and selection among communities. Taken together, our results highlight the influence of spatial processes on biogeochemical function and indicate the need to account for such effects in models that aim to predict biogeochemical function under future environmental scenarios.

AB Phosphorus cycling exerts significant influence upon soil fertility and productivity - processes largely controlled by microbial activity. We adopted phenotypic and metagenomic approaches to investigate phosphatase genes within soils. Microbial communities in bare fallowed soil showed a marked capacity to utilise phytate for growth compared with arable or grassland soil communities. Bare fallowed soil contained lowest concentrations of orthophosphate. Analysis of metagenomes indicated phoA, phoD and phoX, and histidine acid and cysteine phytase genes were most abundant in grassland soil which contained the greatest amount of NaOH-EDTA extractable orthophosphate. Beta-propeller phytase genes were most abundant in bare fallowed soil. Phylogenetic analysis of metagenome sequences indicated the phenotypic shift observed in the capacity to mineralise phytate in bare fallow soil was accompanied by an increase in phoD, phoX and beta-propeller phytase genes coding for exoenzymes. However, there was a remarkable degree of genetic similarity across the soils despite the differences in land-use. Predicted extracellular ecotypes were distributed across a greater range of soil structure than predicted intracellular ecotypes, suggesting that microbial communities subject to the dual stresses of low nutrient availability and reduced access to organic material in bare fallowed soils rely upon the action of exoenzymes.

AB Point counts are one of the most commonly used methods for assessing bird abundance. Autonomous recording units (ARUs) are increasingly being used as a replacement for human-based point counts. Previous studies have compared the relative benefits of human versus ARU-based point count methods, primarily with the goal of understanding differences in species richness and the abundance of individuals over an unlimited distance. What has not been done is an evaluation of how to standardize these two types of data so that they can be compared in the same analysis, especially when there are differences in the area sampled. We compared detection distances between human observers in the field and four commercially available recording devices (Wildlife Acoustics SM2, SM3, RiverForks, and Zoom H1) by simulating vocalizations of various avian species at different distances and amplitudes. We also investigated the relationship between sound amplitude and detection to simplify ARU calibration. We used these data to calculate correction factors that can be used to standardize detection distances of ARUs relative to each other and human observers. In general, humans in the field could detect sounds at greater distances than an ARU although detectability varied depending on species song characteristics. We provide correction factors for four commonly used ARUs and propose methods for calibrating ARUs relative to each other and human observers.

AB Insects that use ephemeral resources must rapidly digest nutrients and simultaneously protect them from competitors. Here we use burying beetles (Nicrophorus vespilloides), which feed their offspring on vertebrate carrion, to investigate the digestive and defensive basis of carrion utilization. We characterize gene expression and microbiota composition in the gut, anal secretions, and on carcasses used by the beetles. We find a strict functional compartmentalization of the gut involving differential expression of immune effectors (antimicrobial peptides and lysozymes), as well as digestive and detoxifying enzymes. A distinct microbial community composed of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and a clade of ascomycetous yeasts (genus Yarrowia) is present in larval and adult guts, and is transmitted to the carcass via anal secretions, where the yeasts express extracellular digestive enzymes and produce antimicrobial compounds. Our results provide evidence of potential metabolic cooperation between the host and its microbiota for digestion, detoxification and defence that extends from the beetle's gut to its nutritional resource.

AB As part of a national research program studying the sources, distribution, and effects of litter entering the ocean, we established a national citizen science program engaging nearly 7000 primary and secondary students, teachers and corporate participants in collecting marine debris data around Australia's coastline. Citizen scientists undertook a one-day training program, which addressed data collection skills and academic topics in the national science curriculum. A subset of teachers and corporate sponsor staff participated in an intensive multi-day training program with researchers before venturing into the field. Data collected by citizen scientists were compared with data collected by researchers at nearby locations. We found the citizen science data were of equivalent quality to those collected by researchers, but there were differences among students. Primary school students detected more debris than did older secondary students. Students detected small items (<1 cm(2)), and were as accurate as researchers in identifying debris type and size categories. However, sampling approach was important students detected more debris during quadrat searches than during strip transects. Comparing researcher effort to volunteer-collected data, citizen scientists were often more efficient (per m(2)) than researchers, at collecting marine debris, but the results varied among methods. Researchers made more surveys within a given day (0.8 surveys/person-day). However, participants of one day programs working with secondary students or adults were nearly as efficient (0.6 surveys/personday). This study shows that engaging with citizen scientists can broaden the coverage and increase the sampling power of coastal litter and other ecological survey assessments without compromising the data.

AB Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) are currently the most widely used tools in ecology for evaluating the suitability of environments for biodiversity in the face of future environmental change. In this study we seek to provide an assessment of the predictive performance of SDMs over time. How well do SDMs predict for future time periods and what factors influence predictive performance?
   Innovation We used a historical spatially explicit database of 1.8 million occurrence records for 318 tetrapod species from across continental Australia over the period 1950-2013. We fitted distribution models for each species to data from four multi-decadal time slices and used these to predict the species distributions up to 60 years after the data collection period for the fitted models. We evaluated predictions against observed data from the relevant time period. Predictions were made assuming either complete knowledge of changes in climatic and environmental conditions or assuming the environment and climate remained unchanged between the fitting and evaluation time periods. We used generalized linear mixed models to model variation in the predictive performance of SDMs over time in relation to a variety of factors, including the length of time between fitting and evaluation, species traits, taxonomic group and attributes of the dataset used to fit models.
   Main conclusions We found that most models provided useful predictions even when the period between model fitting and evaluation was 60 years (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve >0.7 in 80% of the species evaluated). Variation in predictive performance over time was strongly related to the species range breadth (models for species with broad geographical ranges tended to perform worse than models for locally restricted species) and to the environmental coverage of occupancy data. Conversely, taxonomic group, habitat preferences and body size were not highly influential in describing the variation in predictive performance over time.

TI Decreasing net primary production due to drought and slight decreases in

AB Terrestrial ecosystems have continued to provide the critical service of slowing the atmospheric CO2 growth rate. Terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP) is thought to be a major contributing factor to this trend. Yet our ability to estimate NPP at the regional scale remains limited due to large uncertainties in the response of NPP to multiple interacting climate factors and uncertainties in the driver data sets needed to estimate NPP. In this study, we introduced an improved NPP algorithm that used local driver data sets and parameters in China. We found that bias decreased by 30% for gross primary production (GPP) and 17% for NPP compared with the widely used global GPP and NPP products, respectively. From 2000 to 2012, a pixel-level analysis of our improved NPP for the region of China showed an overall decreasing NPP trend of 4.65TgCa(-1). Reductions in NPP were largest for the southern forests of China (-5.38TgCa(-1)), whereas minor increases in NPP were found for North China (0.65TgCa(-1)). Surprisingly, reductions in NPP were largely due to decreases in solar radiation (82%), rather than the more commonly expected effects of drought (18%). This was because for southern China, the interannual variability of NPP was more sensitive to solar radiation (R-2 in 0.29-0.59) relative to precipitation (R-2<0.13). These findings update our previous knowledge of carbon uptake responses to climate change in terrestrial ecosystems of China and highlight the importance of shortwave radiation in driving vegetation productivity for the region, especially for tropical forests.

AB Accurate species identification is fundamental when recording ecological data. However, the ability to correctly identify organisms visually is rarely questioned. We investigated how experts and non-experts compared in the identification of bumblebees, a group of insects of considerable conservation concern. Experts and non-experts were asked whether two concurrent bumblebee images depicted the same or two different species. Overall accuracy was below 60% and comparable for experts and non-experts. However, experts were more consistent in their answers when the same images were repeated, and more cautious in committing to a definitive answer. Our findings demonstrate the difficulty of correctly identifying bumblebees using images from field guides. Such error rates need to be accounted for when interpreting species data, whether or not they have been collected by experts. We suggest that investigation of how experts and non-experts make observations should be incorporated into study design, and could be used to improve training in species identification.

AB Anthropogenic noise has been shown to alter the transmission environment and distort acoustic signals, prompting vocalizing species to use compensatory mechanisms. Through a meta-analysis we investigated the relative importance of biological and contextual factors predisposing species to shift their singing/calling frequencies in response to anthropogenic noise. We gathered data from 36 studies, synthesizing information on more than 160 experiments and 60 bird and anuran species. To estimate the breadth of frequency shift, we calculated a standardized effect size using Hedges' g. We fitted a multilevel linear mixed-effect model on g as the dependent variable weighted by its inverse variance, with typical frequency, body mass, experimental condition, and noise source type as independent terms. Our results reveal broader shifts in smaller bird species when compared with bigger species, an effect that was emphasized in the low-frequency component of the song spectrum. Birds increased their dominant frequencies when confronted to anthropogenic noise, whereas anurans were less prone to such shifts. Human-altered acoustic environments can be considered a novel selective force impelling change to the communication patterns of many vocalizing species.

AB By depicting who eats whom, food webs offer descriptions of how groupings in nature (typically species or populations) are linked to each other. For asking questions on how food webs are built and work, we need descriptions of food webs at different levels of resolution. DNA techniques provide opportunities for highly resolved webs. In this paper, we offer an expose of how DNA-based techniques, and DNA barcodes in particular, have recently been used to construct food web structure in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. We highlight how such techniques can be applied to simultaneously improve the taxonomic resolution of the nodes of the web (i.e., the species), and the links between them (i.e., who eats whom). We end by proposing how DNA barcodes and DNA information may allow new approaches to the construction of larger interaction webs, and overcome some hurdles to achieving adequate sample size. Most importantly, we propose that the joint adoption and development of these techniques may serve to unite approaches to food web studies in aquatic and terrestrial systems-revealing the extent to which food webs in these environments are structured similarly to or differently from each other, and how they are linked by dispersal.

AB Land-use change and intensification threaten bee populations worldwide, imperilling pollination services. Global models are needed to better characterise, project, and mitigate bees' responses to these human impacts. The available data are, however, geographically and taxonomically unrepresentative; most data are from North America and Western Europe, overrepresenting bumblebees and raising concerns that model results may not be generalizable to other regions and taxa. To assess whether the geographic and taxonomic biases of data could undermine effectiveness of models for conservation policy, we have collated from the published literature a global dataset of bee diversity at sites facing land-use change and intensification, and assess whether bee responses to these pressures vary across 11 regions (Western, Northern, Eastern and Southern Europe; North, Central and South America; Australia and New Zealand; South East Asia; Middle and Southern Africa) and between bumblebees and other bees. Our analyses highlight strong regionally-based responses of total abundance, species richness and Simpson's diversity to land use, caused by variation in the sensitivity of species and potentially in the nature of threats. These results suggest that global extrapolation of models based on geographically and taxonomically restricted data may underestimate the true uncertainty, increasing the risk of ecological surprises.

AB Evidence from toxicological studies has demonstrated that phthalates can lead to reduced fertility through effects on folliculogenesis, oocyte maturation and embryonic development, but human data are limited. Concentrations of eight phthalate metabolites in 110 follicular fluid (FF) and urine samples collected from 112 women attending an infertility clinic in Wuhan, China were quantified, and correlations between paired matrices were explored. Associations between metabolite concentrations and in vitro fertilization (IVF) parameters were evaluated with multivariable models. Six metabolites were detected in >72.73% of the FF samples. MEHP and MBP were the dominant metabolites with a median level of 2.80 and 2.05 ng/mL, respectively. Significant correlations between the two matrices, urine and FF, were found for MEP (rs = 0.44), and MBP (rs = 0.22). FF and urinary metabolite concentrations were not associated with any IVF parameters. However, given the prevalence of phthalates exposure, further work is needed to elucidate the potential hazard on female reproduction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Multispecies Outcomes of Sympatric Speciation after Admixture with the
   Source Population in Two Radiations of Nicaraguan Crater Lake Cichlids

AB The formation of species in the absence of geographic barriers (i.e. sympatric speciation) remains one of the most controversial topics in evolutionary biology. While theoretical models have shown that this most extreme case of primary divergence-with-gene-flow is possible, only a handful of accepted empirical examples exist. And even for the most convincing examples uncertainties remain; complex histories of isolation and secondary contact can make species falsely appear to have originated by sympatric speciation. This alternative scenario is notoriously difficult to rule out. Midas cichlids inhabiting small and remote crater lakes in Nicaragua are traditionally considered to be one of the best examples of sympatric speciation and lend themselves to test the different evolutionary scenarios that could lead to apparent sympatric speciation since the system is relatively small and the source populations known. Here we reconstruct the evolutionary history of two small-scale radiations of Midas cichlids inhabiting crater lakes Apoyo and Xiloa through a comprehensive genomic data set. We find no signs of differential admixture of any of the sympatric species in the respective radiations. Together with coalescent simulations of different demographic models our results support a scenario of speciation that was initiated in sympatry and does not result from secondary contact of already partly diverged populations. Furthermore, several species seem to have diverged simultaneously, making Midas cichlids an empirical example of multispecies outcomes of sympatric speciation. Importantly, however, the demographic models strongly support an admixture event from the source population into both crater lakes shortly before the onset of the radiations within the lakes. This opens the possibility that the formation of reproductive barriers involved in sympatric speciation was facilitated by genetic variants that evolved in a period of isolation between the initial founding population and the secondary migrants that came from the same source population. Thus, the exact mechanisms by which these species arose might be different from what had been thought before.

AB Changes to global climate patterns have the potential to alter the structure of soil microbial communities which are key components of terrestrial ecosystems. High altitude ecosystems are both temperature and Nitrogen-limited and the biota therein is sensitive to these conditions. Temperatures and nitrogen (N) depositions in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are predicted to sharp rise by the end of this century. This study aimed to better understand the effects of warming and N addition treatments alone and in combination on an alpine meadow ecosystem near the timberline zone in the eastern region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The field experiment included replicated plots with an ambient treatment alone or with low N (5 g N m(-2) a(-1)), intermediate N (15 g N m(-2) a(-1)), and high N (30 g N m(-2) a(-1)) (Control, LN, MN, HN) and open top chambers warming treatment alone, or LN and HN additions (W, WLN, WHN) to study the interactive effects of the warming and N additions on the soil microbial community as determined by phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). Microbial communities and their allied soil and plant properties were examined after 3 years of the treatments. The strength of the relationship between the treatments and their direct and indirect effects on the microbial communities, soil and plant properties were determined using a structural equation model (SEqM). The results indicated that N addition significantly changed surface soil microbial communities, in particular, decreased the fungi: bacteria ratio (F: B) (p < 0.01). The warming differentially influenced some specific microbial biomarkers, such as fungal PLFAs which decreased, and actinobacterial PLFAs, which increased, under warming (p < 0.05). The combination of the warming and N addition showed significantly positive interactive effects (p < 0.001) on soil microorganisms (i.e. the biomass of general bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, fungi and etc.) in these alpine soils. The SEqM results show the direct effects of the warming treatment on soil microorganisms were less than those from the N additions. Moreover, warming and N addition had stronger indirect, than direct, effects on the soil microbial community via induced changes in soil properties and plant community. The total effect of warming on the soil microbial community was stronger than that of the N additions. The results suggested interactive effects of the warming and N addition on soil microorganisms in an near timberline alpine ecosystem in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB 1. Long-term soil chronosequences provide natural soil fertility gradients that can be used to explore linkages between soils and plant community composition and diversity. Well-studied forested soil chronosequences have revealed that local (a) plant diversity increases with greater soil age and declining fertility, but corresponding changes in species turnover and beta (b) diversity have not been explored, particularly in extremely species-rich regions.
   2. We quantified changes in plant species diversity and community composition, and identified the edaphic drivers of these changes, along a >2-million year retrogressive dune chronosequence in the south-west Australia biodiversity hotspot.
   3. We found greater plant species diversity across all growth forms as soil development proceeded and concentrations of soil nutrients, particularly phosphorus (P), diminished to extremely low levels (surface soil total P concentrations of 6 mg P kg(-1)). Despite the high plant a diversity on older nutrient-impoverished soils, species turnover across the chronosequence was exceptionally high when all growth forms were considered (mean of 1% of species shared between the youngest and oldest soils), and there was complete turnover of woody species along the chronosequence. Such extreme species turnover across the chronosequence reflected large changes in soil chemical properties. In addition, b diversity within individual chronosequence stages increased with declining soil fertility. Shrubs remained the dominant and most speciose growth form throughout the chronosequence.
   4. Synthesis. The large increase in plant a diversity and the extreme species turnover associated with declining soil fertility highlight the central role of soil properties in driving plant community assembly during long-term ecosystem development, previously only reported from comparatively species-poor regions. Our finding that plant b diversity increased with declining soil fertility points to a novel mechanism whereby extremely low soil fertility, rather than high productivity, promotes high b diversity. These results suggest that the interaction of an exceptionally diverse plant species pool and nutrient-impoverished soils provides the basis for the maintenance of such high b diversity at extremely low soil fertility.

AB AimThe relative contribution of community functional diversity and composition to ecosystem functioning is a critical question in ecology in order to enable better predictions of how ecosystems may respond to a changing climate. However, there is little consensus about which modes of functional biodiversity are most important for tree growth at large spatial scales. Here we assessed the relative importance of climate, functional diversity and functional identity (i.e. the community mean values of four key functional traits) for tree growth across the European continent, spanning the northern boreal to the southern Mediterranean forests.
   LocationFinland, Germany, Sweden, Spain and Wallonia (Belgium).
   MethodsUsing data from five European national forest inventories we applied a hierarchical linear model to estimate the sensitivity of tree growth to changes in climate, functional diversity and functional identity along a latitudinal gradient.
   ResultsFunctional diversity was weakly related to tree growth in the temperate and boreal regions and more strongly in the Mediterranean region. In the temperate region, where climate was the most important predictor, functional diversity and identity had a similar importance for tree growth. Functional identity was strongest at the latitudinal extremes of the continent, largely driven by strong changes in the importance of maximum height along the latitudinal gradient.
   Main conclusionsFunctional diversity is an important driver of tree growth in the Mediterranean region, providing evidence that niche complementarity may be more important for tree growth in water-limited forests. The strong influence of functional identity at the latitudinal extremes indicates the importance of a particular trait composition for tree growth in harsh climates. Furthermore, we speculate that this functional identity signal may reflect a trait-based differentiation of successional stages rather than abiotic filtering due to water or energy limitation.

AB Geographic patterns of genetic variation within modern populations, produced by complex histories of migration, can be difficult to infer and visually summarize. A general consequence of geographically limited dispersal is that samples from nearby locations tend to be more closely related than samples from distant locations, and so genetic covariance often recapitulates geographic proximity. We use genome-wide polymorphism data to build "geogenetic maps," which, when applied to stationary populations, produces a map of the geographic positions of the populations, but with distances distorted to reflect historical rates of gene flow. In the underlying model, allele frequency covariance is a decreasing function of geogenetic distance, and nonlocal gene flow such as admixture can be identified as anomalously strong covariance over long distances. This admixture is explicitly co-estimated and depicted as arrows, from the source of admixture to the recipient, on the geogenetic map. We demonstrate the utility of this method on a circum-Tibetan sampling of the greenish warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides), in which we find evidence for gene flow between the adjacent, terminal populations of the ring species. We also analyze a global sampling of human populations, for which we largely recover the geography of the sampling, with support for significant histories of admixture in many samples. This new tool for understanding and visualizing patterns of population structure is implemented in a Bayesian framework in the program SpaceMix.

AB Soil carbon (C) storage is a key ecosystem service. Soil C stocks play a vital role in soil fertility and climate regulation, but the factors that control these stocks at regional and national scales are unknown, particularly when their composition and stability are considered. As a result, their mapping relies on either unreliable proxy measures or laborious direct measurements. Using data from an extensive national survey of English grasslands, we show that surface soil (0-7cm) C stocks in size fractions of varying stability can be predicted at both regional and national scales from plant traits and simple measures of soil and climatic conditions. Soil C stocks in the largest pool, of intermediate particle size (50-250m), were best explained by mean annual temperature (MAT), soil pH and soil moisture content. The second largest C pool, highly stable physically and biochemically protected particles (045-50m), was explained by soil pH and the community abundance-weighted mean (CWM) leaf nitrogen (N) content, with the highest soil C stocks under N-rich vegetation. The C stock in the small active fraction (250-4000m) was explained by a wide range of variables: MAT, mean annual precipitation, mean growing season length, soil pH and CWM specific leaf area; stocks were higher under vegetation with thick and/or dense leaves. Testing the models describing these fractions against data from an independent English region indicated moderately strong correlation between predicted and actual values and no systematic bias, with the exception of the active fraction, for which predictions were inaccurate.Synthesis and applications. Validation indicates that readily available climate, soils and plant survey data can be effective in making local- to landscape-scale (1-100000km(2)) soil C stock predictions. Such predictions are a crucial component of effective management strategies to protect C stocks and enhance soil C sequestration.

AB Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs) inhabit regions rich in biodiversity that play an important role in the local and regional water cycle. Canopy plants such as epiphytes and hemiepiphytes are an important component of the biodiversity in the TMCF and therefore play a significant role in the carbon, nutrient, and water cycles. With only partial or no access to resources on the ground, canopy plants may be vulnerable to changes in climate that increase canopy temperatures and decrease atmospheric humidity or precipitation inputs. Despite their importance in the TMCF, little is known about variation in functional strategies relating to drought avoidance or drought tolerance of canopy plants. In this study, we quantified variation in a number of functional traits in 11 species of epiphytes and hemiepiphytes in a Costa Rican TMCF. We also generated pressure-volume and xylem vulnerability curves that we used as indicators of drought tolerance. In addition, we hand-sectioned fresh leaves and examined cross sections under a microscope to quantify leaf thickness, mesophyll thickness and the thickness of water storage cell layers (i.e., hydrenchyma), if present. Lastly, we determined the capacity for foliar water uptake in the laboratory and measured whole-plant transpiration in the field.
   A trade-off was found between traits that confer relative drought resistance and foliar water uptake capacity vs. traits that confer leaf capacitance and relative drought avoidance. This trade-off may represent an additional axis of the leaf economics spectrum that is unique to epiphytes. We also found that all species had the capacity for foliar uptake of water and that this process contributed substantially to their water balance. On average, foliar uptake of water contributed to the reabsorption of 70% of the water transpired over a relatively wet, 34-day study period. Our results indicate that canopy plants can mitigate water loss substantially via internal water storage or that they can directly utilize cloud water to offset losses. Our results indicate that species that rely on foliar uptake of water may be more vulnerable to projected changes in climate than species that buffer the effects of drought via internal water storage.

AB Xenobiotics such as the neonicotinoid pesticide, imidacloprid, are used globally, but their effects on native bee species are poorly understood. We studied the effects of sublethal doses of imidacloprid on olfactory learning in the native honey bee species, Apis cerana, an important pollinator of agricultural and native plants throughout Asia. We provide the first evidence that imidacloprid can impair learning in A. cerana workers exposed as adults or as larvae. Adults that ingested a single imidacloprid dose as low as 0.1 ng/bee had significantly reduced olfactory learning acquisition, which was 1.6-fold higher in control bees. Longer-term learning (1-17 h after the last learning trial) was also impaired. Bees exposed as larvae to a total dose of 0.24 ng/bee did not have reduced survival to adulthood. However, these larval-treated bees had significantly impaired olfactory learning when tested as adults: control bees exhibited up to 4.8-fold better short-term learning acquisition, though longer-term learning was not affected. Thus, sublethal cognitive deficits elicited by neonicotinoids on a broad range of native bee species deserve further study.

AB Beta diversity describes changes in species composition among sites in a region and has particular relevance for explaining ecological patterns in fragmented habitats. However, it is difficult to reveal the mechanisms if broad sense beta-diversity indices (i.e. yielding identical values under nestedness and species replacement) are used. Partitioning beta diversity into turnover (caused by species replacement from site to site) and nestedness-resultant components (caused by nested species losses) could provide a unique way to understand the variation of species composition in fragmented habitats. Here, we collected occupancy data of breeding birds and lizards on land-bridge islands in an inundated lake in eastern China. We decomposed beta diversity of breeding bird and lizard communities into spatial turnover and nestedness-resultant components to assess their relative contributions and respective relationships to differences in island area, isolation, and habitat richness. Our results showed that spatial turnover contributed more to beta diversity than the nestedness-resultant component. The degree of isolation had no significant effect on overall beta diversity or its components, neither for breeding birds nor for lizards. In turn, in both groups the nestedness-resultant component increased with larger differences in island area and habitat richness, respectively, while turnover component decreased with them. The major difference among birds and lizards was a higher relevance of nestedness-resultant dissimilarity in lizards, suggesting that they are more prone to local extinctions derived from habitat fragmentation. The dominance of the spatial turnover component of beta diversity suggests that all islands have potential conservation value for breeding bird and lizard communities.

AB Butachlor, one of the most widely used herbicides in agriculture, has been reported with high ecotoxicity to aquatic plants and animals. In this study, a H-1 NMR based metabolomics approach combined with histopathological examination and biochemical assays was applied to comprehensively investigate the toxic effects of butachlor on four important organs (gill, brain, liver and kidney) of goldfish (Carassius auratus) for the first time. After 10 days' butachlor exposure at two dosages of 3.2 and 0.64 mu mol/L, fish tissues (gill, brain, liver and kidney) and serum were collected. Histopathological inspection revealed severe impairment of gill filaments and obvious, cellular edema in livers and kidneys. The increase of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in gill and methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) level in four tissues reflected the disturbance of antioxidative system in the intoxicated goldfish. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and creatinine (CRE) level were increased in butachlor exposure groups, suggesting liver and kidney injuries induced by butachlor. Orthogonal signal correction partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OSC-PLS-DA) of NMR profiles disclosed metabolic changes that were related to the toxic effects of butachlor including oxidative stress, disorder of energy metabolism and amino acids metabolism, and disturbance of neurotransmitter balance in butachlor exposed goldfish. This integrated metabolomics approach provided a molecular basis underlying the toxicity of butachlor and demonstrated that metabolomics was a powerful and highly effective approach to elucidate the toxicity and underlying mechanisms of herbicides and pesticides, applicable for their risk assessment.

AB Tree internal carbon (C) fluxes between compound and compartment pools are difficult to measure directly. Here we used a C mass balance approach to decipher these fluxes and provide a full description of tree C allocation dynamics. We collected independent measurements of tree C sinks, source and pools in Pinus halepensis in a semi-arid forest, and converted all fluxes to g C per tree d(-1). Using this data set, a process flowchart was created to describe and quantify the tree C allocation on diurnal to annual time-scales. The annual C source of 24.5kg C per tree yr(-1) was balanced by C sinks of 23.5kg C per tree yr(-1), which partitioned into 70%, 17% and 13% between respiration, growth, and litter (plus export to soil), respectively. Large imbalances (up to 57g C per tree d(-1)) were observed as C excess during the wet season, and as C deficit during the dry season. Concurrent changes in C reserves (starch) were sufficient to buffer these transient C imbalances. The C pool dynamics calculated using the flowchart were in general agreement with the observed pool sizes, providing confidence regarding our estimations of the timing, magnitude, and direction of the internal C fluxes.

AB Land-use change has transformed large areas of tropical peatland into globally significant carbon sources. Associated changes in the properties of peat are important for soil processes including decomposition and nutrient cycling. To characterise the changes induced by stabilised land uses, we studied the physical and chemical properties of peat from four land management conditions (undrained and drained forest, degraded land, and managed agricultural land). Peat was sampled from depths of 10-15 cm, 40-45 cm, 80-85 cm and 110-115 cm then partitioned into woody (empty set > 1.5 mm), fibric (empty set 0.15-1.5 mm) and amorphic (empty set < 0.15 mm) fractions. Bulk density and total concentrations of ash, C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Zn, Na, Al, Fe, S and Si were determined. There were clear differences between land uses in the characteristics of surface peat down to the 40-45 cm layer, the primary differences being between forested and open sites. Due to smaller particle sizes, the bulk density of peat was higher at the open sites, where Ca and Mg concentrations were also higher but N and P concentrations were lower. Changes in drainage and vegetation cover had resulted in differing outcomes from decomposition processes, and the properties of fire-impacted peats on the open sites had undergone extreme changes.

AB Soils are living environments in which particularly abundant and diverse microbiome and fauna are evolving. The resulting biological functioning has a direct impact not only on soil fertility but also on a series of ecosystems services. Thus, microbial communities are involved in geochemical cycles in which microbial enzymes catalyse the different steps. Modulation of the corresponding activities is essential as these affect plant growth and environmental quality. In general, biodiversity affects both the productivity and stability of agroecosystems. It is therefore of paramount importance to take soil biodiversity and biological functioning into account when designing cropping systems and evaluating their impacts. The progress achieved in soil microbiology in recent years now makes it possible to propose analyses of soil biology, as has been feasible for many years for soil physicochemistry. These analyses obviously require the use of standardized procedures for soil sampling, measuring the abundance and diversity of the microbial communities, as well as the identification of bioindicators. Similarly, referential systems need to be established to interpret these analyses and diagnose the biological status of soils, and, more especially, to determine whether the obtained values are within the range of variations normal for a given soil type and land use. Great progress to standardize such procedures and establish referential systems has been achieved during large-scale research programmes carried out to characterize biodiversity on national and European scales. These diagnostic elements need to be accompanied by recommendations. The aim of ongoing research is thus to propose aids for decision-making, based on the results of biological analyses, so attempts can be made to monitor and manage biodiversity to satisfy soil fertility requirements and ensure the ecosystem services expected of soils.

AB The effects of land abandonment on biodiversity have received considerable attention by scholars, but results are far from conclusive. Different cultural traditions of scientists seem to underlie the contrasting ways in which land abandonment is understood. Although the forest transition (FT) framework considers land abandonment as an opportunity for biodiversity conservation, European landscape ecologists characterize it as a threat. We use insights from both traditions to analyze the effects of land abandonment on landscape and biodiversity in a mountain area of metropolitan Barcelona. We do so through an in-depth historical case study covering a period of 160 years. A set of landscape metrics was applied to land-cover maps derived from cadastral cartography to characterize the landscape ecological changes brought about by land abandonment. Cadastral data on land uses were used to understand how landscape ecological changes could be explained by changing socioeconomic activities. Information on past land-management practices from semistructured interviews was used to shed light on how peasants shaped the capacity of landscape to host biodiversity. Our results point to a remarkable landscape deterioration along with the disappearance of the peasant land-use mosaics and the ensuing forest expansion. By using insights from landscape ecology in a historically informed manner, we (1) question the alleged relationship between land abandonment and ecosystem recovery; (2) show that the assumed restorative character of the FT is based on the underestimation of the ecological importance of nonforest habitats; and (3) point at a remarkable trade-off between FT and biodiversity in the Mediterranean. Finally, the case study also serves to illustrate some of the strengths and challenges of using historical approaches to land abandonment.

AB Given that soaring birds travel faster with supportive winds or in good thermal soaring conditions, we expect weather conditions en route of migration to explain commonly observed regional and seasonal patterns in the performance of soaring migrants. We used GPS-loggers to track 13 honey buzzards and four Montagu's harriers for two to six migrations each. We determined how tailwinds, crosswinds, boundary layer height (a proxy for thermal convection) and precipitation affected hourly speeds, daily distances and daily mean speeds with linear regression models. Honey buzzards mostly travel by soaring while Montagu's harriers supplement soaring with flapping. Therefore, we expect that performance of harriers will be less affected by weather than for buzzards. Weather conditions explained between 30 and 50% of variation in migration performance of both species. Tailwind had the largest effect on hourly speeds, daily mean speeds and daily travel distances. Honey buzzards travelled significantly faster and farther, and Montagu's harriers non-significantly faster, under better convective conditions. Honey buzzards travelled at slower speeds and shorter distances in crosswinds, whereas harriers maintained high speeds in crosswinds. Weather conditions varied between regions and seasons, and this variation accounted for nearly all regional and seasonal variation in flight performance. Hourly performance was higher than predicted at times when we suspect birds had switched to intermittent or continuous flapping flight, for example during sea-crossings. The daily travel distance of Montagu's harriers was determined to a significant extent by their daily travel time, which differed between regions, possibly also due to weather conditions. We conclude with the implications of our work for studies on migration phenology and we suggest an important role for high-resolution telemetry in understanding migratory behavior across entire migratory journeys.

AB The changes in species composition between habitat patches (beta diversity) are likely related to a number of factors, including environmental heterogeneity, connectivity, disturbance and productivity. Here, we used data from aquatic environments in five Brazilian regions over two years and two seasons (rainy and dry seasons or high and low water level periods in floodplain lakes) in each year to test hypotheses underlying zooplankton beta diversity variation. The regions present different levels of hydrological connectivity, where three regions present lakes that are permanent and connected with the main river, while the water bodies of the other two regions consist of permanent lakes and temporary ponds, with no hydrological connections between them. We tested for relationships between zooplankton beta diversity and environmental heterogeneity, spatial extent, hydrological connectivity, seasonality, disturbance and productivity. Negative relationships were detected between zooplankton beta diversity and both hydrological connectivity and disturbance (periodic dry-outs). Hydrological connectivity is likely to affect beta diversity by facilitating dispersal between habitats. In addition, the harsh environmental filter imposed by disturbance selected for only a small portion of the species from the regional pool that were able to cope with periodic dry-outs (e.g., those with a high production of resting eggs). In summary, this study suggests that faunal exchange and disturbance play important roles in structuring local zooplankton communities.

AB Soy isoflavones and their metabolism by intestinal microbiota have gained attention because of potential health benefits, such as the alleviation of estrogen/hormone-related conditions in postmenopausal women, associated with some of these compounds. However, overall changes in gut bacterial community structure and composition in response to addition of soy isoflavones to diets and their association with excreted isoflavone metabolites in postmenopausal women has not been studied. The aim of this study was to determine fecal bacterial community changes in 17 postmenopausal women after a week of diet supplementation with soy bars containing isoflavones, and to determine correlations between microbial community changes and excreted isoflavone metabolites. Using DGGE profiles of PCR amplified 16S rRNA genes (V3 region) to compare microbial communities in fecal samples collected one week before and one week during soy supplementation revealed significant differences (ANOSIM p<0.03) before and after soy supplementation in all subjects. However, between subjects comparisons showed high inter-individual variation that resulted in clustering of profiles by subjects. Urinary excretion of isoflavone ( daidzein) metabolites indicated four subjects were equol producers and all subjects produced O-desmethylangolensin (ODMA). Comparison of relative proportions of 16S rRNA genes from 454 pyrosequencing of the last fecal samples of each treatment session revealed significant increases in average proportions of Bifidobacterium after soy consumption, and Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium were significantly greater in equol vs non-S-(-) equol producers. This is the first in vivo study using pyrosequencing to characterize significant differences in fecal community structure and composition in postmenopausal women after a week of soy diet-supplementation, and relate these changes to differences in soy isoflavones and isoflavone metabolites.

AB 1. In the past, insect diversity in grasslands showed a severe decline due to management intensification or abandonment. In this study, we investigate the long-term influence of grazing and the potential for spatial patterns created by different grazing intensities to enhance insect diversity.
   2. In a long-term experiment (2002-2011), three grazing intensities were applied to 1-ha paddocks in a triplicate block design: moderate grazing (MC), lenient grazing (LC) and very lenient grazing (VLC, since 2005). The experiment was conducted in a moderately species-rich grassland at the edge of the Solling Uplands in Lower Saxony, Germany. Orthoptera (grasshoppers) and Lepidoptera (butterflies) on three 50-m transects per paddock were counted in 2002-2004 and again in 2010 and 2011. Statistics were performed using linear mixed modelling.
   3. Grasshopper diversity measures (species richness and abundance) were significantly affected by grazing intensity; abundance increased from 2002 to 2011 more strongly in the LC than in the MC treatment. Butterfly species richness response to grazing intensity varied among years. Data from 2010 and 2011 did not reveal any advantage of the lowest grazing intensity (VLC) compared to the intermediate grazing intensity treatment (LC) in either insect group.
   4. Multiple regressions were used to investigate diversity patterns. Along with compressed sward height, spatial patchiness was important for grasshopper species richness and abundance as well as for butterfly species numbers. Butterfly abundance was mainly influenced by vertical sward height heterogeneity in addition to the significant effects of thistle abundance and number of nectar plant species.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Cattle grazing intensity affects the proportions and spatial heterogeneity of short and tall sward patches on pastures. The less mobile grasshoppers particularly benefitted from the structural modifications created by cattle at lenient grazing levels (stocking rate 1.14 SLU ha(-1), standard livestock unit (SLU) = 500 kg). In the final study years, areas with intermediate grazing intensity revealed high diversity indices and the most distinct patchiness, therefore a further reduction in grazing intensity is not recommended. This indicates that commercial livestock production may be compatible with conservation targets.

AB Global change phenomena, such as forest disturbance and land-use change, significantly affect elemental balances as well as the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the importance of shifts in soil nutrient stoichiometry for the regulation of belowground biota and soil food webs have not been intensively studied for tropical ecosystems. In the present account, we examine the effects of land-use change and soil depth on soil and microbial stoichiometry along a land-use sequence (natural forest, pastures of different ages, secondary succession) in the tropical mountain rainforest region of southern Ecuador. Furthermore, we analyzed (PLFA-method) whether shifts in the microbial community structure were related to alterations in soil and microbial stoichiometry. Soil and microbial stoichiometry were affected by both land-use change and soil depth. After forest disturbance, significant decreases of soil C:N:P ratios at the pastures were followed by increases during secondary succession. Microbial C:N ratios varied slightly in response to land-use change, whereas no fixed microbial C:P and N:P ratios were observed. Shifts in microbial community composition were associated with soil and microbial stoichiometry. Strong positive relationships between PLFA-markers 18:2n6,9c (saprotrophic fungi) and 20:4 (animals) and negative associations between 20:4 and microbial N:P point to land-use change affecting the structure of soil food webs. Significant deviations from global soil and microbial C:N:P ratios indicated a major force of land-use change to alter stoichiometric relationships and to structure biological systems. Our results support the idea that soil biotic communities are stoichiometrically flexible in order to adapt to alterations in resource stoichiometry.

AB Aim To compare macroecological patterns between bird communities of European cities and regional species assemblages in the surrounding landscape, and to reveal geographical trends in the urbanization of native avifauna. Location Forty-one towns and cities in continental Europe. Methods We compiled data on the species richness and community composition of urban avifauna from 41 European city breeding bird atlases, and of species assemblages comprising nine grid cells (each about 50 km x 50 km) from the EBCC Atlas of European Breeding Birds (hereafter regional assemblages). Species-area relationships (SARs), latitudinal trends in diversity and the distance decay of community similarity were compared using regression models (generalized linear models). Observed urban communities were compared with randomly assembled ones to reveal systematic effects of the urban environment on native bird communities across Europe. We employed variance partitioning to quantify the relative effect of environmental parameters and the spatial position of cities on species richness. Results The species-area relationships did not differ significantly between cities and regional assemblages. Species richness of both types of communities increased towards higher latitudes, although the relationship was unimodal for regional assemblages, in contrast to cities. The increase in beta diversity with distance was on average less pronounced in cities than in regional assemblages, and was lower between individual cities than between communities of the same size randomly drawn from regional species assemblages. Moreover, average beta diversity was lower in northern cities, which are characterized by a relatively higher proportion of species from regional species pools. Main conclusions The species-area relationship and latitudinal trends are largely congruent between cities and the regional assemblages. However, city avifaunas tend to be relatively more uniform across space, revealing biotic homogenization. Urban communities in northern cities are more uniform as a higher proportion of bird species breeds in cities.

AB Considerable uncertainties remain about magnitude and character, if not general direction of anthropogenic climate change. Global mean temperature could increase by 1.5-4.5 degrees C or more over historic levels, and extreme weather eventsdrought, storms, and floodingare likely to increase greatly in frequency. Although ecologists and foresters agree that the practice of forestry will be transformed under climate change, these uncertainties compound the challenge of achieving sustainable, adaptive forest management. In this aritcle, we (i) present a multidisciplinary synthesis of current knowledge of responses of temperate and boreal tree species and forest communities to climate change, and (ii) outline silvicultural strategies for adapting temperate and boreal forests to confront climate change. Our knowledge synthesis proceeds through critical appraisals of efforts to model future tree distributions and responses to climate change, and reviews physiological, phenological, acclimation, and epigenetic responses to climate. As is the case of climate change itself, there are numerous uncertainties about tree species and provenance responses to climate change. For example, acclimation of respiration and epigenetic conditioning of seed embryos has the potential to buffer species against limited warming. Provenances within species also display idiosyncratic responses to altered climates, implying that soemm varieties will be more resilient or resistant to climate change than others. Genetically determined limits to climatic tolerance, and the limits of tree community resistance and resilience (speed of recovery from disturbance) in the face of climate-related disturbances are largely unknown. These unknowns require managers to adopt a portfolio of silvicultural strategies, which may range from minor modifications of current practices to design of novel multi-species stands that may have no historical analogue. Forest managers must be prepared to respond nimbly as they develop, incorporate new insights about climate change and species responses to warming into their practices. Marshalling all strategies and sources of knowledge should enable forest managers to mount (at least) a partially successful response to the challenges of climate change.

AB Premise of the study: Darwin first proposed that species with larger ecological breadth have greater phenotypic variation. We tested this hypothesis by comparing intraspecific variation in specific leaf area (SLA) to species' local elevational range and by assessing how external (abiotic) filters may influence observed differences in ecological breadth among species. Understanding the patterns of individual variation within and between populations will help evaluate differing hypotheses for structuring of communities and distribution of species.
   Methods: We selected 21 species with varying elevational ranges and compared the coefficient of variation of SLA for each species against its local elevational range. We examined the influence of external filters on local trait composition by determining if intraspecific changes in SLA with elevation have the same direction and similar rates of change as the change in community mean SLA value.
   Key results: In support of Darwin's hypothesis, we found a positive relationship between species' coefficient of variation for SLA with species' local elevational range. Intraspecific changes in SLA had the same sign, but generally lower magnitude than the community mean SLA.
   Conclusions: The results indicate that wide-ranging species are indeed characterized by greater intraspecific variation and that species' phenotypes shift along environmental gradients in the same direction as the community phenotypes. However, across species, the rate of intraspecific trait change, reflecting plastic and/or adaptive changes across populations, is limited and prevents species from adjusting to environmental gradients as quickly as interspecific changes resulting from community assembly.

AB Global climate change is a major threat to biodiversity. The most common methods for predicting the response of biodiversity to changing climate do not explicitly incorporate fundamental evolutionary and ecological processes that determine species responses to changing climate, such as reproduction, dispersal, and adaptation. We provide an overview of an emerging mechanistic spatial theory of species range shifts under climate change. This theoretical framework explicitly defines the ecological processes that contribute to species range shifts via biologically meaningful dispersal, reproductive, and climate envelope parameters. We present methods for estimating the parameters of the model with widely available species occurrence and abundance data and then apply these methods to empirical data for 12 North American butterfly species to illustrate the potential use of the theory for global change biology. The model predicts species persistence in light of current climate change and habitat loss. On average, we estimate that the climate envelopes of our study species are shifting north at a rate of 3.25 +/- 1.36 km/yr (mean +/- SD) and that our study species produce 3.46 +/- 1.39 (mean +/- SD) viable offspring per individual per year. Based on our parameter estimates, we are able to predict the relative risk of our 12 study species for lagging behind changing climate. This theoretical framework improves predictions of global change outcomes by facilitating the development and testing of hypotheses, providing mechanistic predictions of current and future range dynamics, and encouraging the adaptive integration of theory and data. The theory is ripe for future developments such as the incorporation of biotic interactions and evolution of adaptations to novel climatic conditions, and it has the potential to be a catalyst for the development of more effective conservation strategies to mitigate losses of biodiversity from global climate change.

AB Understanding how genetic variation at individual loci contributes to adaptation of populations to different local environments is an important topic in modern evolutionary biology. To date, most evidence has pointed to conditionally neutral quantitative trait loci (QTL) showing fitness effects only in some environments, while there has been less evidence for single-locus fitness trade-offs. At QTL underlying local adaptation, alleles from the local population are expected to show a fitness advantage. Cytoplasmic genomes also can have a role in local adaptation, but the role of cytonuclear interactions in adaptive differentiation has remained largely unknown. We mapped genomic regions underlying adaptive differentiation in multiple fitness components and flowering time in diverged populations of a perennial plant Arabidopsis lyrata. Experimental hybrids for this purpose were grown in natural field conditions of the parental populations in Norway and North Carolina (NC), USA, and in the greenhouse. We found QTL where high fitness and early flowering were associated with local alleles, indicating a role of different selection pressures in phenotypic differentiation. At two QTL regions, a fitness component showing local adaptation between the parental populations also showed signs of putative fitness trade-offs. Beneficial dominance effects of conditionally neutral QTL for different fitness components resulted in hybrid vigour at the Norwegian site in the F2 hybrids. We also found that cytoplasmic genomes contributed to local adaptation and hybrid vigour by interacting with nuclear QTL, but these interactions did not show evidence for cytonuclear coadaptation (high fitness of local alleles combined with the local cytoplasm).

Guidelines and selection of different methods presented are, at least partly, based on experience. This article can be used: to identify the most suitable analysis for the type of data collected; to optimise one's experimental design based on the experimental factors to be investigated, samples to be analysed, and the type of data produced; to determine how, where, and when to sample bees from colonies; or just to inspire. Also included are guidelines on presentation and reporting of data, as well as where to find help and which types of software could be useful.

AB Environmental issues are best handled with the participation of all concerned citizens at the relevant level. Engaging citizen scientists to survey local biota and detect non-native marine species incursions is expected to result in the collection of significant data sets, which could potentially be used for an early-warning system inter alia. Our results suggest that such citizen support is beginning to develop in Greece, for invasive species such as the pufferfish Lagocephalus sceleratus; local newspapers often run a frontpage headline on the subject. Approximately 86 observations of 28 alien species (validated by taxonomic experts) were reported in 2012. Special mention is given to the following species, which until now had a very restricted distribution: Atherinomorus forskalii, Callionymus filamentosus, Smaragdia souverbiana and Cylichnina girardi. Concerned and informed citizens can participate personally in identifying incipient invaders and preventing them from spreading.

AB The challenges of integrated, adaptive and ecosystem management are leading government agencies to adopt participatory modes of engagement. Collaborative governance is a form of participation in which stakeholders co-produce goals and strategies and share responsibilities and resources. We assess the potential and challenges of collaborative governance as a mechanism to provide an integrated, ecosystem approach to natural resource management, using red deer in Scotland as a case study. Collaborative Deer Management Groups offer a well-established example of a 'bridging organisation', intended to reduce costs and facilitate decision making and learning across institutions and scales. We examine who initiates collaborative processes and why, what roles different actors adopt and how these factors influence the outcomes, particularly at a time of changing values, management and legislative priorities. Our findings demonstrate the need for careful consideration of where and how shared responsibility might be best implemented and sustained as state agencies often remain key to the process, despite the partnership intention. Differing interpretations between agencies and landowners of the degree of autonomy and division of responsibilities involved in 'collaboration' can create tension, while the diversity of landowner priorities brings additional challenges for defining shared goals in red deer management and in other cases. Effective maintenance depends on appropriate role allocation and adoption of responsibilities, definition of convergent values and goals, and establishing communication and trust in institutional networks. Options that may help private stakeholders offset the costs of accepting responsibility for delivering public benefits need to be explicitly addressed to build capacity and support adaptation. This study indicates that collaborative governance has the potential to help reconcile statutory obligations with stakeholder empowerment. The potential of collaboration to reduce the costs of sustainable management remains contentious and, in times of increasing resource constraints, the potential mismatch between resource investment and anticipated goals is likely to become a critical issue, which may challenge the goals and capacity of the state and existing managers.

AB The social and ecological contexts for rangeland management are changing rapidly, prompting a reevaluation of science, management, and their relationship. We argue that progression from steady-state management to ecosystem management has served the rangeland profession well, but that further development toward resilience-based management is required to ensure that ecosystem services are sustained in an era of rapid change. Resilience-based management embraces the inevitability of change and emphasizes that management should seek to guide change to benefit society. The objectives of this forum are to: 1) justify the need for adopting resilience-based management, 2) identify the challenges that will be encountered in its development and implementation, and 3) highlight approaches to overcoming these challenges. Five grand challenges confronting the adoption of resilience-based management, based upon the insights of 56 rangeland researchers who have contributed to this special issue, were identified as: 1) development of knowledge systems to support resilience-based management, 2) improvement of ecological models supporting science and management, 3) protocols to assess and manage tradeoffs among ecosystem services, 4) use of social-ecological system models to integrate diverse knowledge sources, and 5) reorganization of institutions to support resilience-based management. Resolving the challenges presented here will require the creation of stronger partnerships between ecosystem managers, science organizations, management agencies, and policymakers at local, regional, and national scales. A realistic near-term goal for achieving such partnerships is to initiate and support collaborative landscape projects. The creation of multiscaled social learning institutions linked to evolving knowledge systems may be the best approach to guide adaptation and transformation in rangelands in the coming century.

AB Although previous studies have related variations in environmental noise levels with alterations in communication behaviors of birds, little work has investigated the potential long-term implications of living or breeding in noisy habitats. However, noise has the potential to reduce fitness, both directly (because it is a physiological stressor) and indirectly (by masking important vocalizations and/or leading to behavioral changes). Here, we quantified acoustic conditions in active breeding territories of male Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis). Simultaneously, we measured four fitness indicators: cuckoldry rates, brood growth rate and condition, and number of fledglings produced (i.e., productivity). Increases in environmental noise tended to be associated with smaller brood sizes and were more strongly related to reductions in productivity. Although the mechanism responsible for these patterns is not yet clear, the breeding depression experienced by this otherwise disturbance-tolerant species indicates that anthropogenic noise may have damaging effects on individual fitness and, by extraction, the persistence of populations in noisy habitats. We suggest that managers might protect avian residents from potentially harmful noise by keeping acoustically dominant anthropogenic habitat features as far as possible from favored songbird breeding habitats, limiting noisy human activities, and/or altering habitat structure in order to minimize the propagation of noise pollution.

AB Understanding the impacts of climate on migratory species is complicated by the fact that these species travel through several climates that may be changing in diverse ways throughout their complete migratory cycle. Most studies are not designed to tease out the direct and indirect effects of climate at various stages along the migration route. We assess the impacts of spring and summer climate conditions on breeding monarch butterflies, a species that completes its annual migration cycle over several generations. No single, broad-scale climate metric can explain summer breeding phenology or the substantial year-to-year fluctuations observed in population abundances. As such, we built a Poisson regression model to help explain annual arrival times and abundances in the Midwestern United States. We incorporated the climate conditions experienced both during a spring migration/breeding phase in Texas as well as during subsequent arrival and breeding during the main recruitment period in Ohio. Using data from a state-wide butterfly monitoring network in Ohio, our results suggest that climate acts in conflicting ways during the spring and summer seasons. High spring precipitation in Texas is associated with the largest annual population growth in Ohio and the earliest arrival to the summer breeding ground, as are intermediate spring temperatures in Texas. On the other hand, the timing of monarch arrivals to the summer breeding grounds is not affected by climate conditions within Ohio. Once in Ohio for summer breeding, precipitation has minimal impacts on overall abundances, whereas warmer summer temperatures are generally associated with the highest expected abundances, yet this effect is mitigated by the average seasonal temperature of each location in that the warmest sites receive no benefit of above average summer temperatures. Our results highlight the complex relationship between climate and performance for a migrating species and suggest that attempts to understand how monarchs will be affected by future climate conditions will be challenging.

AB Motivated by the question "how equal is the distribution of wealth within a given human population?" economics devised an impressive toolbox of quantitative measures of societal egalitarianism including the Lorenz curve and the following indices: Gini, Pietra, Hoover, Amato, Hirschman, Theil and Atkinson. These quantitative measures - considered in the broader context of general data-sets with positive values - are, in effect, general gauges of statistical evenness. While the application of Gini's index grew beyond economics and reached diverse fields of science, the aforementioned "evenness toolbox" has largely remained within the confines of the social sciences. The aim of this Paper is to expose this "evenness toolbox" to the physics community by presenting a comprehensive evenness-based approach to a fundamental problem in science the measurement of statistical heterogeneity.

AB Questions: Does facilitation among plants increase with elevation in a humid tropical alpine system in which climatic and ecological conditions differ from other alpine environments? Whatmechanisms are involved in the interactions? Location: Volcano Antisana, Eastern Cordillera of the Ecuadorian Andes ( 00 28' S, 78 09' W). Methods: We selected the cushion-forming Azorella aretioides as a potential nurse plant along an altitudinal gradient ( 4400, 4550 and 4700 m) in the high tropical Andes. We quantified its effects on other plants at species and community levels by comparing the product vegetation cover 9 number of individuals of every vascular species found inside and outside 265 cushions, using the relative interaction index. We inferred potential mechanisms behind the interactions through analysis of microclimate, soil moisture and soil nutrient measurements inside and outside cushions. Results: Predictions of the stress gradient hypothesis ( SGH) were corroborated at community level, with transition from competitive or neutral effects of A. aretioides at 4400 and 4550 m to facilitative effects at 4700 m. Strong speciesspecific effects were observed along the altitudinal gradient, with a substantial effect of local habitat disturbance on the outcome of plant-plant interactions. Surprisingly, cushions lowered air and soil temperatures and air humidity, which reduced at higher elevations. Facilitation appeared to be caused by higher soilmoisture and nutrient content beneath cushions. Conclusions: Our data extend the framework of the SGH by corroborating it for the first time in a tropical alpine system. However, the mechanisms underlying plant-plant interactions differed fromthose generally reported fromalpine environments, with facilitation varying according to resource-mediated stress ( nutrients). It remains to be tested whether this is specific to tropical alpine systems.

AB 1. Data on the occurrence of species in grid cells are collected by biological recording schemes, typically with the intention of publishing an atlas. Interpretation of such data is often hampered by the lack of information on the effort that went into collecting them. This is the recorder effort problem.
   2. One measure of recorder effort is the proportion of a suite of common species ('benchmark species') found at a given location and time. Benchmark species have in the past been taken as a uniform set across a territory. However, if records are available from a neighbourhood surrounding a given location, then a local set benchmark species can be defined by pooling records from the neighbourhood and selecting the commonest species in the pooled set.
   3. Neighbourhoods differ in species richness, so that the list of species that 'ought' to be found in one location may be longer than that for another. If the richness of a neighbourhood can be estimated, then a suite of benchmark species can be standardized to be the commonest of a fixed proportion of the total expected for the neighbourhood. Recording effort is then defined as the proportion of benchmark species that were found.
   4. A method of estimating species richness is proposed here, based on the local frequencies f(j) of species in neighbouring grid cells. Species discovery is modelled as a Poisson process. It is argued that then a neighbourhood is well sampled, the frequency-weighted mean frequency Sigma f(j)(2)/Sigma f(j) of species in the neighbourhood will assume a standard value.
   5. The method was applied to a data set of 2 000 000 records detailing the occurrence of bryophytes in 3695 out of the total 3854 hectads (10-km squares) in Great Britain, Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.
   6. Three main applications are outlined: estimation of recording effort, scanning data for unexpected presences or absences and measurement of species trends over time. An explicit statistical model was used to estimate trends, modelling the probability of species j being found at location i and time t as the outcome of Poisson process with intensity Q(ijt) x(jt), where x(jt) is a time factor for species j, and Q(ijt) depends on recording effort at location i and time t and on the time-independent probability of species j being found in hectad i.

AB Our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms generating variation within the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes remains incomplete. Assessing MHC variation across multiple populations, of recent and ancient divergence, may facilitate understanding of geographical and temporal aspects of variation. Here, we applied 454 sequencing to perform a large-scale, comprehensive analysis of MHC class II in the closely related, hybridizing newts, Lissotriton vulgaris (Lv) and Lissotriton montandoni (Lm). Our study revealed an extensive (299 alleles) geographically structured polymorphism. Populations at the southern margin of the Lv distribution, inhabited by old and distinct lineages (southern Lv), exhibited moderate MHC variation and strong population structure, indicating little gene flow or extensive local adaptation. Lissotriton vulgaris in central Europe and the northern Balkans (northern Lv) and almost all Lm populations had a high MHC variation. A much higher proportion of MHC alleles was shared between Lm and northern Lv than between Lm and southern Lv. Strikingly, the average pairwise FST between northern Lv and Lm was significantly lower than between northern and southern Lv for MHC, but not for microsatellites. Thus, high MHC variation in Lm and northern Lv may result from gene flow between species. We hypothesize that the interspecific exchange of MHC genes may be facilitated by frequency-dependent selection. A marginally significant correlation between the MHC and microsatellite allelic richness indicates that demographic factors may have contributed to the present-day pattern of MHC variation, but unequivocal signatures of adaptive evolution in MHC class II sequences emphasize the role of selection on a longer timescale.

AB Background: Understanding diversity patterns and the mechanisms underlying those patterns along elevational gradients is critically important for conservation efforts in montane ecosystems, especially those that are biodiversity hotspots. Despite recent advances, consensus on the underlying causes, or even the relative influence of a suite of factors on elevational diversity patterns has remained elusive.
   Methods and Principal Findings: We examined patterns of species richness, density and range size distribution of birds, and the suite of biotic and abiotic factors (primary productivity, habitat variables, climatic factors and geometric constraints) that governs diversity along a 4500-m elevational gradient in the Eastern Himalayan region, a biodiversity hotspot within the world's tallest mountains. We used point count methods for sampling birds and quadrats for estimating vegetation at 22 sites along the elevational gradient. We found that species richness increased to approximately 2000 m, then declined. We found no evidence that geometric constraints influenced this pattern, whereas actual evapotranspiration (a surrogate for primary productivity) and various habitat variables (plant species richness, shrub density and basal area of trees) accounted for most of the variation in bird species richness. We also observed that ranges of most bird species were narrow along the elevation gradient. We find little evidence to support Rapoport's rule for the birds of Sikkim region of the Himalaya.
   Conclusions and Significance: This study in the Eastern Himalaya indicates that species richness of birds is highest at intermediate elevations along one of the most extensive elevational gradients ever examined. Additionally, primary productivity and factors associated with habitat accounted for most of the variation in avian species richness. The diversity peak at intermediate elevations and the narrow elevational ranges of most species suggest important conservation implications: not only should mid-elevation areas be conserved, but the entire gradient requires equal conservation attention.

AB Elevational gradients are increasingly recognized as a valuable tool for understanding how community and ecosystem properties respond to climatic factors, but little is known about how plant traits and their effects on ecosystem processes respond to elevation. We studied the response of plant leaf and litter traits, and litter decomposability across a gradient of elevation, and thus temperature, in subarctic tundra in northern Sweden for each of two contrasting vegetation types, heath and meadow, dominated by dwarf shrubs and herbaceous plants respectively. This was done at each of three levels; across species, within individual species, and the plant community using a community weighted average approach. Several leaf and litter traits shifted with increasing elevation in a manner consistent with greater conservation of nutrients at all three levels, and the most consistent response was an increase in tissue N to P ratio. However, litter decomposition was less directly responsive to elevation because the leaf and litter traits which were most responsive to elevation were not necessarily those responsible for driving decomposition. At the community level, the response to elevation of foliar and litter traits, and decomposability, varied greatly among the two vegetation types, highlighting the importance of vegetation type in determining ecological responses to climatic factors such as temperature. Finally our results highlight how understanding the responses of leaf and litter characteristics of functionally distinct vegetation types, and the processes that they drive, to temperature helps provide insights about how future climate change could affect tundra ecosystems.

AB The soil microbial biomass (SMB) is known to participate in key soil processes such as the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). However, its contribution to the isotopic composition of the SOM is not clear yet. Shifts in the C-13 and N-15 natural abundances of the SMB and SOM fractions (mineralised, water soluble and non-extractable) were investigated by incubating an unamended arable soil for 6 months. Microbial communities were also studied using Fatty Acid Methyl Ester specific isotope analysis. The SMB was significantly C-13 and N-15-enriched relative to other fractions throughout the incubation. However, significant isotopic variations with time were also observed due to the rapid consumption of relatively C-13-enriched water soluble compounds. The increase in the difference in SMB and water soluble N-15 compositions as the water soluble C/N ratio decreased, indicated a shift from N assimilation to N dissimilation during the incubation. These changes also induced modifications of the microbial community structure. Once the system reached a steady-state (after 1 month), the isotopic trends appeared to corroborate those obtained in long term experiments in the field in that there was a constant microbial isotopic fractionation leading to a C-13 and N-15 enrichment of the SOM over the long-term. This work also suggests that caution must be exercised when interpreting short term incubation studies since perturbations associated with experimental set-up can have an important effect on C and N dynamics, microbial fractionation of C-13 and N-15 and microbial community structure.

AB Question: How can nearest-neighbour (NN) imputation be used to develop maps of multiple species and plant communities?
   Location: Western and central Oregon, USA, but methods are applicable anywhere.
   Methods: We demonstrate NN imputation by mapping woody plant communities for > 100 000 km(2) of diverse forests and woodlands. Species abundances on similar to 25 000 plots were related to spatial predictors (rasters) describing climate, topography, soil and geographic location using constrained ordination (CCA). Species data from the nearest plot in multi-dimensional CCA space were imputed to each map pixel. Maps of multiple individual species and community types were constructed from the single imputed surface. We computed a variety of diagnostics to characterize different qualities of the imputed (mapped) community data.
   Results: Community composition gradients were strongly associated with climate and elevation, and less so with topography and soil. Accuracy of the imputation model for presence/absence of 150 species varied widely (kappa 0.00 to 0.80). Omission error rates were higher than commission rates due to low species prevalence, and areal representation of species was only slightly inflated. A map of 78 community types was 41% correct and 78% fuzzy correct. Errors of omission and commission were balanced, and areal representation of both rare and abundant communities was accurate. Map accuracy may be lower for some species than with other methods, but areal representation of species and communities across large landscapes is preserved. Because imputed vegetation surfaces are developed for all species simultaneously, map units contain suites of species known to co-occur in nature. Maps of individual species, and of community types derived from them, will be internally consistent at map locations.
   Conclusions: NN imputation is a useful modelling approach where maps of multiple species and plant communities are needed, such as in natural resource management and conservation planning or models that project landscape change under alternative disturbance or climate scenarios. More research is needed to evaluate other ordination methods for NN imputation of plant communities.

AB Comparative methods are widely used in ecology and evolution. The most frequently used comparative methods are based on an explicit evolutionary model. However, recent approaches have been popularized that are without an evolutionary basis or an underlying null model. Here we highlight the limitations of such techniques in comparative analyses by using simulations to compare two commonly used comparative methods with and without evolutionary basis, respectively: generalized least squares (GLS) and phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR). We find that GLS methods are more efficient at estimating model parameters and produce lower variance in parameter estimates, lower phylogenetic signal in residuals, and lower Type I error rates than PVR methods. These results can very likely be generalized to eigenvector methods that control for space and both space and phylogeny. We highlight that GLS methods can be adapted in numerous ways and that the variance structure used in these models can be flexibly optimized to each data set.

AB Adaptive female coloration is likely to occur when males largely invest into reproduction or variance of quality between potential mating partners is high. Although recent studies have shown male choosiness of female traits, little is known about the extent to which female ornamentation signals benefits to males. Female ornamentation might signal individual quality information and thus might be sexually selected by males or play a role in female-female competition. Here, we investigate the role of the female ventral coloration in sexual selection of Pelvicachromis taeniatus, a biparental African cichlid with mutual mate choice. We show that the female ornament 1) is sexually selected by males, who preferred females that showed a larger extent of the nuptially colored area. Female purple coloration, which consists of blue and red color components, 2) transmits information about female quality and ripeness. The magnitude of the red area predicted female readiness to spawn, whereas the extent of the blue area female fecundity, maternal quality, and offspring fitness. Ornamentation 3) is important in female-female competition. Dominance tests conducted under different illumination conditions that maintained or abolished the differences in nuptial coloration suggest that female coloration functions as a threat signal. These results support that female ornamentation may evolve as an indicator of quality through male choice, female-female competition, or both, in a species with mutual mate choice.

AB A total of 215 rhizobial strains were isolated and analyzed with 16S rRNA gene, 16S-23S intergenic spacer, housekeeping genes atpD, recA, and glnII, and symbiotic genes nifH and nodC to understand the genetic diversity of soybean rhizobia in Hebei province, China. All the strains except one were symbiotic bacteria classified into nine genospecies in the genera of Bradyrhizobium and Sinorhizobium. Surveys on the distribution of these rhizobia in different regions showed that Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Bradyrhizobium elkanii strains were found only in neutral to slightly alkaline soils whereas Bradyrhizobium yuanmingense, Bradyrhizobium liaoningense-related strains and strains of five Sinorhizobium genospecies were found in alkaline-saline soils. Correspondence and canonical correspondence analyses on the relationship of rhizobial distribution and their soil characteristics reveal that high soil pH, electrical conductivity, and potassium content favor distribution of the B. yuanmingense and the five Sinorhizobium species but inhibit B. japonicum and B. elkanii. High contents of available phosphorus and organic matters benefit Sinorhizobium fredii and B. liaoningense-related strains and inhibit the others groups mentioned above. The symbiotic gene (nifH and nodC) lineages among B. elkanii, B. japonicum, B. yuanmingense, and Sinorhizobium spp. were observed in the strains, signifying that vertical gene transfer was the main mechanism to maintain these genes in the soybean rhizobia. However, lateral transfer of symbiotic genes commonly in Sinorhizobium spp. and rarely in Bradyrhizobium spp. was also detected. These results showed the genetic diversity, the biogeography, and the soil determinant factors of soybean rhizobia in Hebei province of China.

AB The scale of seed and pollen movement in plants has a critical influence on population dynamics and interspecific interactions, as well as on their capacity to respond to environmental change through migration or local adaptation. However, dispersal can be challenging to quantify. Here, we present a Bayesian model that integrates genetic and ecological data to simultaneously estimate effective seed and pollen dispersal parameters and the parentage of sampled seedlings. This model is the first developed for monoecious plants that accounts for genotyping error and treats dispersal from within and beyond a plot in a fully consistent manner. The flexible Bayesian framework allows the incorporation of a variety of ecological variables, including individual variation in seed production, as well as multiple sources of uncertainty. We illustrate the method using data from a mixed population of red oak (Quercus rubra, Q. velutina, Q. falcata) in the NC piedmont. For simulated test data sets, the model successfully recovered the simulated dispersal parameters and pedigrees. Pollen dispersal in the example population was extensive, with an average father-mother distance of 178 m. Estimated seed dispersal distances at the piedmont site were substantially longer than previous estimates based on seed-trap data (average 128 m vs. 9.3 m), suggesting that, under some circumstances, oaks may be less dispersal-limited than is commonly thought, with a greater potential for range shifts in response to climate change.

AB Photosynthetic gas exchange, vegetative growth, water relations and fluorescence parameters as well as leaf anatomical characteristics were investigated on young plants of two Olea europaea L. cultivars (Chemlali and Zalmati), submitted to contrasting water availability regimes. Two-year-old olive trees, grown in pots in greenhouse, were not watered for 2 months. Relative growth rate (RGR), leaf water potential (I-LW) and the leaf relative water content (LWC) of the two cultivars decreased with increasing water stress. Zalmati showed higher values of RGR and LWC and lower decreased values of I-LW than Chemlali, in response to water deficit, particularly during severe drought stress. Water stress also caused a marked decline on photosynthetic capacity and chlorophyll fluorescence. The net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, the maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (F (v)/F (m)) and the intrinsic efficiency of open PSII reaction centres (F' (v)/F' (m)) decreased as drought stress developed. In addition, drought conditions, reduced leaf chlorophyll and carotenoids contents especially at severe water stress. However, Zalmati plants were the less affected when compared with Chemlali. In both cultivars, stomatal control was the major factor affecting photosynthesis under moderate drought stress. At severe drought-stress levels, the non-stomatal component of photosynthesis is inhibited and inactivation of the photosystem II occurs. Leaf anatomical parameters show that drought stress resulted in an increase of the upper epidermis and palisade mesophyll thickness as well as an increase of the stomata and trichomes density. These changes were more characteristic in cv. 'Zalmati'. Zalmati leaves also revealed lower specific leaf area and had higher density of foliar tissue. From the behaviour of Zalmati plants, with a smaller reduction in relative growth rate, net assimilation rate and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and with a thicker palisade parenchyma, and a higher stomatal and trichome density, we consider this cultivar more drought-tolerant than cv. Chemlali and therefore, very promising for cultivation in arid areas.

AB Tropical nearshore regions provide habitat for a diverse assemblage of shark species, and although a range of age classes may use these environments, ontogenetic shifts in movement and habitat use remain relatively unclear. The hypothesis of this study was that home range size and range of depths used by juvenile sharks in a tropical nearshore region will increase with age. An array of 58 acoustic receivers deployed in Cleveland Bay, north Queensland, Australia, passively tracked 43 juvenile pigeye sharks Carcharhinus amboinensis of 3 age classes from 2008 to 2010. Individuals were present in the study site for long periods, ranging from 4 to 587 d (median = 134). Juvenile C. amboinensis associated strongly with shallow turbid habitats, and core home ranges of all monitored individuals consistently remained in areas adjacent to creek and river mouths. Significant differences in minimum convex polygon measures of home range revealed that older juveniles used larger areas and undertook excursions from core ranges more frequently than younger juveniles. Movements of all C. amboinensis were related to the tidal cycle, but changes in water depth associated with the tide had the strongest influence on the youngest juveniles. Young-of-the-year individuals constrained their movements to shallower depths than older (2-yr-old) individuals (medians = 205 and 283 cm, respectively), presumably as a refuging strategy and to decrease intraspecific competition. By defining transitions in habitat use behaviour among juvenile sharks, this study provides a better understanding of the implications associated with coastal shark species of multiple age classes using a shared environment.

AB The reproductive system of hybrids is an important factor shaping introgression dynamics within species complexes. We combined paternity and parentage analyses with previous species characterization by genetic assignment, to directly identify reproductive events that occurred within a stand comprising four European white oak species. Comparing species status of parent pairs provided a precise quantification of hybridization rate, backcrosses, and intraspecific matings in two life stages. The detailed mating system analysis revealed new findings on the dynamics of interspecific gene flow. First, hybrids acted successfully as both male and female during reproduction. They produced acorns and seedlings that were as viable as those sired by purebreds. Second, species maintenance could be due to a relatively low level of interspecific mating contrasting with a large proportion of intraspecific crosses and backcrosses. Despite a high proportion of hybrids and extensive interspecific gene flow, partial species integrity is maintained by genetically controlled pollen discrimination, ensuring preferential matings within purebreds and high parental species fidelity in hybrid reproduction, which impedes complete collapse into a continuous hybrid swarm. Finally, we showed that pollen from the different species had unequal contributions to reproduction suggesting that introgression processes could ultimately lead to extirpation or expansion of some species.

TI Adaptation strategies for reducing vulnerability to future environmental
   change

AB Many adaptation strategies focus on improving short-term capacities to cope with environmental change, but ignore the possibility that they might inadvertently increase vulnerability to unforeseen changes in the future. To help develop more effective long-term strategies, we present a conceptual framework of adaptation. The framework emphasizes that in order to ensure that existing problems are not exacerbated, adaptation must: (1) address both human-induced and biophysical drivers of undesired ecological change; (2) maintain a diversity of future response options; and (3) nurture the kinds of human capacities that enable the uptake of those response options. These requirements are often not met when adaptation strategies rely on technological fixes, which tend to concentrate on coping with the biophysical symptoms of problems rather than addressing human behavioral causes. Furthermore, to develop effective, long-term adaptation, greater emphasis is needed on strategies that enhance, rather than erode, the human values, skills, and behaviors conducive to sustainable activities. Participatory approaches to environmental stewardship are part of the solution to this problem.

AB There is mounting evidence that some European temperate species did not respond to the last (Weichselian) glaciation by simply shifting their distributions to the Mediterranean region but also survived at higher latitudes previously considered inhospitable. However, it remains to be determined to what extent such high-latitude glacial refugia contributed to post-glacial colonization of Europe. The bank vole Myodes glareolus apparently survived in a high-latitude glacial refugium in the Carpathian Mountains. Here, we used 144 new mitochondrial DNA sequences (largely obtained from museum skins), together with relevant previous data, to investigate whether the phylogeography of bank voles currently living in deglaciated areas north of the Carpathians reflects colonization from this or other refugia. Phylogenetic reconstruction resolved the newly identified haplotypes into three major clades. The majority of voles sampled in Poland carried haplotypes of the Carpathian clade, previously only known from the Carpathians and their immediate vicinity. Voles from eastern Poland and northern Germany carried haplotypes of the Eastern clade, also found in eastern Europe and Siberia, and six voles from scattered localities carried haplotypes of the Western clade, which has a west European distribution. Therefore, the results suggest the contribution of multiple glacial refugia. However, the occurrence of the Carpathian clade over a large area north of the Carpathians up to the Baltic Sea coast indicates a particular importance of the Carpathian refugium. Thus, a substantial involvement of a high-latitude refugium in the post-glacial colonization of Europe by bank voles is inferred. Likely as the consequence of the high-latitude survival, the Carpathian clade lacks evidence of the severe demographic bottleneck during the Last Glacial Maximum that is observed in the Eastern clade. The contact zone between the expanding populations of the Carpathian and Eastern clades coincides with subdivisions in other species and may represent a new post-glacial suture zone.

AB Question
   What is the relative importance of seed mass and abiotic factors in species-specific seedling growth and morphology during the first and the second growing season? How do oak species respond along gradients of these factors?
   Location
   Mediterranean oak forest in southern Spain.
   Methods
   We analysed seedling growth components and morphology of three co-occurring Quercus species (two deciduous and one evergreen). Oak seeds with a wide variety of sizes were sown along broad gradients of abiotic conditions. Intra- and inter-specific differences were evaluated by calibrating maximum likelihood estimators of seedling growth during the first two years of life.
   Results
   We found multiple resources and conditions affecting seedling morphology and biomass allocation. However, the integrative variables of seedling growth - total aboveground biomass and relative growth rate (RGR) - were affected by two main factors: seed mass and light conditions. The relative contribution of these two factors depended strongly on seedling age. Seed mass explained most of the growth and morphological variables during the first year, while light conditions were the best predictor in the second growing season. In contrast, soil factors did not play an important role in seedling growth. We found some evidence of regeneration niche partitioning between oak species along the light gradient, a reflection of their distribution patterns as adults at the study site.
   Conclusions
   We conclude that inter-specific differences in seedling growth, arising from seed size variability and microsite heterogeneity, could be of paramount importance in oak species niche segregation, driving stand dynamics and composition along environmental gradients.

AB Ponds are among the most diverse and yet threatened components of freshwater biodiversity. The conservation of ponds would greatly benefit from the identification of surrogate taxa in preliminary assessments aimed at detecting ponds of potentially high biodiversity value. Here, we used predictive co-correspondence analysis (Co-CA) to quantify the strength of plant species composition and plant community types in predicting multivariate patterns in water beetle assemblages, based on data from 54 farmland ponds in Ireland. The predictive accuracy of a number of environmental variables as well as that of plant diversity (species richness and evenness) was calculated using predictive canonical correspondence analysis (CCA-PLS). The study ponds supported over 30% of the Irish water beetle fauna (76 species), with five species having some form of IUCN Red List Status in Ireland, as well as 67 wetland plant species, including a nationally rare one. Co-CA showed that plant species composition had a positive predictive accuracy, which was significantly higher compared to that of data at the plant community type level. Although environmental variables showed a higher predictive capacity compared to that of plant species composition, the difference was not significant. Explanatory CCA analyses showed that plants and beetles both responded to the same subset of environmental conditions, which explained approximately 18% of the variation in both plant and beetle species composition. Regional differences as well as permanency, substratum, and grazing intensity affected the composition of both plant and beetle assemblages. These findings have important implications in conservation planning. First, wetland plants can be effectively used as a surrogate taxon in the identification of conservation-priority ponds. Second, conservation strategies aimed at maintaining and enhancing pond biodiversity should be based on considerations on plant species composition. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   AMPLIFICATION
AB Rhododendron (Ericaceae) is a large woody genus in which hybridization is thought to play an important role in evolution and speciation, particularly in the Sino-Himalaya region where many interfertile species often occur sympatrically. Rhododendron agastum, a putative hybrid species, occurs in China, western Yunnan Province, in mixed populations with R. irroratum and R. delavayi.
   Material of these taxa from two sites 400 km apart (ZhuJianYuan, ZJY and HuaDianBa, HDB) was examined using cpDNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci, to test the possibility that R. agastum was in fact a hybrid between two of the other species. Chloroplast trnL-F and trnS-trnG sequences together distinguished R. irroratum, R. delavayi and some material of R. decorum, which is also considered a putative parent of R. agastum.
   All 14 R. agastum plants from the HDB site had the delavayi cpDNA haplotype, whereas at the ZJY site 17 R. agastum plants had this haplotype and four had the R. irroratum haplotype. R. irroratum and R. delavayi are distinguished by five unequivocal point mutations in their ITS sequences; every R. agastum accession had an additive pattern (double peaks) at each of these sites. Data from AFLP loci were acquired for between ten and 21 plants of each taxon from each site, and were analysed using a Bayesian approach implemented by the program NewHybrids. The program confirmed the identity of all accessions of R. delavayi, and all R. irroratum except one, which was probably a backcross. All R. agastum from HDB and 19 of 21 from ZJY were classified as F-1 hybrids; the other two could not be assigned a class.
   Rhododendron agastum represents populations of hybrids between R. irroratum and R. delavayi, which comprise mostly or only F(1)s, at the two sites examined. The sites differ in that at HDB there was no detected variation in cpDNA type or hybrid class, whereas at ZJY there was variation in both.

AB Continuing advances in genomics are revealing substantial differences between genomes of major eukaryotic lineages. Because most data (in terms of depth and phylogenetic breadth) are available for angiosperms and mammals, we explore differences between these groups and show that angiosperms have less highly compartmentalized and more diverse genomes than mammals. In considering the causes of these differences, four mechanisms are highlighted: polyploidy, recombination, retrotransposition and genome silencing, which have different modes and time scales of activity. Angiosperm genomes are evolutionarily more dynamic and labile, whereas mammalian genomes are more stable at both the sequence and chromosome level. We suggest that fundamentally different life strategies and development feedback on the genome exist, influencing dynamics and evolutionary trajectories at all levels from the gene to the genome.

TI Self-Sustaining Smoldering Combustion: A Novel Remediation Process for

AB Smoldering combustion, the slow burning process associated typically with porous solids (e.g., charcoal), is here proposed as a novel remediation approach for nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) embedded in porous media. Several one-dimensional vertical smoldering experiments are conducted on quartz sand containing fresh coal tar at an initial concentration of 71000 mg/kg (approximately 25% saturation) and employing an upward darcy air flux of 4.25 cm/s. Following a short-duration energy input to achieve ignition at the lower boundary, a self-sustaining combustion front is observed to propagate upward at 1.3 x 10(-2) cm/s. The process is self-sustaining because the energy released during NAPL smoldering is efficiently trapped and recirculated by the soil matrix, preheating the NAPL ahead of the reaction front The smoldering process is observed to self-terminate when all of the NAPL is destroyed or when the oxygen source is removed. Pre- and post-soil analysis revealed that NAPL smoldering reduced the concentration of total extractable petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) from 38 000 mg/kg to below detection limits (<0.1 mg/kg) throughout the majority of the column. A comparable experiment in which conductive heating is applied in the absence of smoldering demonstrates a 6-fold reduction in the net energy in the system and residual TPH values of 2000-35 000 mg/kg. A further repeat in which the air supply is prematurely terminated demonstrated that the NAPL smoldering process can be extinguished via external control. A suite of 23 demonstration experiments shows that NAPL smoldering is successful across a range of soil types (including simple layered systems) and contaminants (including laboratory mixtures of dodecane, DCA/grease, TCE/oil, vegetable oil, crude oil, and mineral oil) as well as field-obtained samples of materials containing coal tar, oil drill cutting waste, and oil sands.

AB The genetic diversity and population genetic structure of the small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) were investigated. One hundred and fourteen individuals were sampled from 8 localities of the Yellow Sea and the northern East China Sea. Genetic variation in DNA sequences were examined from the first hypervariable region (HVR-1) of the mitochondrial DNA control region. High levels of haplotype diversity (h = 0.98 +/- 0.87%) in the HVR-1 region were detected, indicating a high level of genetic diverstiy. A total of 84 polymorphic sites were found, and 87 haplotypes were defined. The pairwise nucleotide differences between samples ranged from 3.83 +/- 2.19 to 6.56 +/- 3.25. The demographic history of L. polyactis was examined by using neutrality tests and mismatch distribution analysis, which indicated a Pleistocene population expansion at about 49,300-197,000 years. The star burst structure of the minimum spanning tree also suggestted a very recent origin for most haplotypes. Hierarchical molecular variance analysis (AMOVA) and conventional population Fst comparisons revealed no significant genetic structure throughout the examined range, which is inconsistent with previous findings based on the morphological and ecological studies. Long-term dispersal and high gene flow likely have contributed to the genetically homogeneous population structure of the species. The knowledge on genetic diversity and genetic structure will be crucial to establish appropriate fishery management stocks for the species.

TI Oxygen and carbon stable isotopes of modern land snail shells as
   environmental indicators from a low-latitude oceanic island
SO GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
LA English
DT Article
ID SOUTHERN GREAT-PLAINS; DELTA-C-13; PLANTS; DISCRIMINATION; TENERIFE;
   ALTITUDE; RECORD; DIET; USA
AB Land snails provide a unique opportunity to study terrestrial paleoenvironments because their shells, which are generally highly abundant and well-preserved in the fossil record, contain a temporal record of environmental change in the form of isotope codes. To evaluate the utility of this approach for a low-latitude oceanic setting, 207 modern shells of 18 species of land snail were analyzed for their oxygen and carbon isotope composition along a north and south facing altitudinal gradient (10-2160 m a.s.l.) in Tenerife Island (similar to 28 degrees N) of the Canary Archipelago.
   Shells collected at each locality showed a relatively large range in isotope composition which was greater along the south facing transect (drier and hotter), suggesting that the variance in shell isotope values may be related to water-stress. Although pooled isotope values did not generally show strong relationships with environmental variables (i.e., altitude, temperature and precipitation), mean isotope values were strongly associated with some climatic factors when grouped by site. The mean delta O-18 value of the shell (delta O-18(shell)) by site displayed a negative correlation with elevation, which is consistent with the positive relationship observed between temperature and the delta O-18 value of rain (delta O-18(rain)). Calculated delta O-18 values of the snail body water (delta O-18(body)) derived from observed temperatures and delta O-18(shell) values (using the equation of Grossman and Ku [Grossman E. L. and Ku T. L. (1986) Oxygen and carbon isotope fractionation in biogenic aragonite. Chen?. Geol. (Isotope Geosci. Sec.) 59, 59-74]) displayed a trend with respect to altitude that was similar to measured and hypothetical delta O-18 values for local rain water. The calculated delta O-18(body) values from the shell declined 0.17 parts per thousand (VSMOW) per 100 m, which is consistent with the "altitude effect" observed for tropical rains in Western Africa, and it correlated negatively with rainfall amount. Accordingly, lower delta O-18(shell) values indicate lower temperatures, lower delta O-18(rain) values and possibly, higher rainfall totals. A positive correlation between the mean delta C-13 values of shells (delta C-13(shell)) and plants by site suggests that shells potentially record information about the surrounding vegetation. The delta C-13(shell) values varied between -15.7 and -0.67 parts per thousand (VPDB), indicating that snails consumed C-3 and C-4/CAM plants, where more negative delta C-13(shell) values probably reflects the preferential consumption of C-3 plants which are favored under wetter conditions. Individuals with more positive delta O-13(shell) values consumed a larger percentage of C-4 plants (other potential factors such as carbonate ingestion or atmospheric CO2 contribution were unlikely) that were more common at lower elevations of the hotter and drier south facing transect. The relatively wide range of shell isotope values within a single site requires the analysis of numerous shells for meaningful paleoclimatic studies. Although small differences were observed in isotope composition among snail species collected at a single sampling site, they were not significant, suggesting that isotope signatures extracted from multi-taxa snail data sets may be used to infer environmental conditions over a broad range of habitats.

AB Identifying maternal effects on offspring is critical to interpreting population dynamics, but the duration of maternal effects and which life-history traits they influence is not well understood. We quantified growth and development of male white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) originating from the Black Hills in southwestern South Dakota and from eastern South Dakota in a controlled environment with high-quality nutrition. Despite being in good nutritional condition, males from the Black Hills ceased rapid growth 41 days earlier, were 29% smaller at asymptotic body mass, and grew significantly smaller antlers than males from eastern South Dakota. Females from eastern South Dakota were 14.9 kg larger than females from the Black Hills, yet birth mass of male offspring was similar for females from the 2 regions. Male offspring of 1st-generation deer from the Black Hills attained a 30% larger asymptotic body mass and grew significantly larger antlers than their sires. Body mass and antler size of 2nd-generation males of Black Hills origin approached that of 1st-generation males from eastern South Dakota at maturity. Suppression in growth of 1st-generation males of the Black Hills and increased growth by their offspring supported an influence of maternal and grandmaternal condition during gestation on subsequent growth of offspring and highlighted the significance of nutrition during gestation. These intergenerational effects indicate that measures of animal condition and population performance might reflect past rather than current conditions, and illustrate the potential for time lags in responses of populations to improved environmental conditions.

AB Growth, photosynthesis, and photoacclimation properties of batch cultures of Pelagomonas calceolata (Pelagophyceae) were compared for 1 week under three different fluctuating light regimes with the same total daily amount of light. Treatments consisted of a sinusoidal diurnal light cycle or a high-frequency fluctuating light simulating two different regimes of vertical mixing (highly fluctuating light [HFL] or fluctuating light [FL]). Three to five samples were taken every day for analysis of pigments, absorption spectrum, variable fluorescence, nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ), electron transport rate vs. light curves, and cell concentration. Pelagomonas achieved the same growth rate during the exponential growth phase under all three light conditions, revealing a high degree of acclimation to light and also suggesting that the daily light dose is the main factor regulating growth and division. Photophysiological adjustments occurred in the cells in response to the three light regimes. Pelagomonas seems to adopt the n-type photoacclimation in HFL, whereas the s-type photoacclimation is applied in FL. The cells rapidly trigger photoprotective mechanisms such as the xanthophyll cycle and NPQ, even though these do not appear to be able to fully prevent photoinhibition. The enhanced costs for maintenance and repair associated with HFL may have limited the allocation of energy to growth, thus explaining the shorter duration of the exponential growth phase in this regime with respect to the two others.

AB Increasing human populations along marine coastlines has lead to increasing urbanization of the marine environment. Despite decades of investigations on terrestrial ecosystems, the effect of urbanization on marine life is not well understood. Riprap is the rocky rubble used to build jetties, breakwaters, and armored shorelines. Roughly 30% of the southern California shoreline supports some form of riprap, while 29% of the shoreline is natural rocky substrate. Astonishingly few studies have investigated this anthropogenic rocky habitat even though it rivals a natural habitat in area on a regional scale along a coastline that has been extensively studied. In this study, I compared the diversity and community structure of exposed rocky intertidal communities on four riprap and four natural sites in southern California. I ask the following questions: (1) does diversity or community composition differ between intertidal communities on riprap and natural rocky habitats in southern California, (2) if so, which organisms contribute to those differences, (3) which physical factors are contributing to these differences, and (4) do riprap habitats support higher abundances of invasive species than natural habitats? On average, riprap and natural rocky habitats in wave exposed environments in southern California did not differ from each other in diversity or community composition when considering the entire assemblage. However, when only mobile species were considered, they occurred in greater diversity on natural shores. These differences appear to be driven by wave exposure. The presence of invasive species was negligible in both natural and riprap habitats.

AB Seahorses, sea dragons and pipefishes of the teleost family Syngnathidae are unique in that embryos develop within specialized brooding structures of the male. We enriched brooding Syngnathus fuscus and Syngnathus floridae males with injections of L-lysine-[(15)N(2)] and 16:0-palmitic acid 1-[(13)C] to demonstrate embryonic uptake of paternally-derived nutrients. While all embryos demonstrated amino acid enrichment, late stages showed significantly higher [(15)N], indicating greater utilization of paternal resources as yolk reserves diminished and embryonic energy demands increased. Limited embryonic [(13)C] uptake, defined as less than 10% of adult enrichment, in 75 and 81% of S. floridae and S. fuscus respectively signified rapid lipid metabolism and thus the need for greater enrichment. Interspecific differences in embryonic uptake of paternally-derived nutrients were not demonstrated. However, interspecific differences in egg nutrient reserves and fry size but comparable fry nutrient levels along with data from a published paternal exposure study indicate paternal transfer in S. fuscus most likely compensates for the comparative egg nutrient deficiency. This study is the first to our knowledge to provide direct evidence for the functional significance of the brood pouch in nutrient provisioning. These results add comparative information on the diversity of Syngnathid paternal care and further our understanding of paternal influence on development.

AB Polyploidy and gametophytic apomixis are two important and associated processes in plants. Many hawthorn species are polyploids and can reproduce both sexually and apomictically. However, the population genetic structure of these species is poorly understood. Crataegus douglasii is represented exclusively by self-compatible tetraploid pseudogamous apomicts across North America, whereas Crataegus suksdorfii found in the Pacific Northwest is known to include self-incompatible diploid sexuals as well as polyploid apomicts. We compare population structure and genetic variability in these two closely related taxa using microsatellite and chloroplast sequence markers. Using 13 microsatellite loci located on four linkage groups, 251 alleles were detected in 239 individuals sampled from 15 localities. Within-population multilocus genotypic variation and molecular diversity are greatest in diploid sexuals and lowest in triploid apomicts. Apart from the isolation of eastern North American populations of C. douglasii, there is little evidence of isolation by distance in this taxon. Genetic diversity in western populations of C. douglasii suggests that gene flow is frequent, and that colonization and establishment are often successful. In contrast, local populations of C. suksdorfii are more markedly differentiated. Gene flow appears to be limited primarily by distance in diploids and by apomixis and self-compatibility in polyploids. We infer that apomixis and reproductive barriers between cytotypes are factors that reduce the frequency of gene flow among populations, and may ultimately lead to allopatric speciation in C. suksdorfii. Our findings shed light on evolution in woody plants that show heterogeneous ploidy levels and reproductive systems.

AB Since the early 1990s, an increasing proportion of barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, bound for breeding sites in the Russian Arctic delay their departure from the wintering quarters in the Wadden Sea by 4 weeks. These late-migrating geese skip spring stopover sites in the Baltic traditionally used by the entire population.
   Individual geese from an arctic colony tracked by satellite or light-level geolocators during spring migration in 2004 and 2005 predominantly followed the new strategy, but a minority still maintained the traditional pattern. Despite a spread of more than 50 days in departure date from the Wadden Sea, both early and late departing females laid their eggs within the short time-window conferring breeding success.
   The spread of these new migration routines coincided with a strong increase of overall numbers and the exploitation of new spring staging resources in the Wadden Sea. Counts from Estonia demonstrate that numbers have levelled off recently at the Baltic staging sites, suggesting that the capacity of these staging sites in spring has been reached. Although onset of spring affects migratory timing in barnacle geese, it cannot explain the observed delay in departure from the wintering grounds.
   We hypothesize that the new migratory strategy has evolved in response to increased competition for food at spring staging sites in the Baltic. According to an analytical model of optimal migration, the geese should skip the Baltic whenever the energy deposition rate falls below 88% of the Wadden Sea value.

AB This study investigated the levels of genetic diversity and variation exhibited by red and sika deer in Ireland, along with the extent and regional location of hybridisation between these two species. Bi-parental (microsatellites) and maternally-inherited (mitochondrial DNA) genetic markers were utilised that allowed comparisons between 85 red deer from six localities and 47 sika deer from 3 localities in Ireland. Population genetic structure was assessed using Bayesian analysis, indicating the existence of two genetic clusters in sika deer and three clusters in red deer. Levels of genetic diversity were low in both red and sika deer. These genetic data presented herein indicate a recent introduction of sika deer and subsequent translocations in agreement with historical data. The origins of the current red deer populations found in Ireland, based on genetic data presented in this study, still remain obscure. All hybrid deer (red/sika) found in this Study were found in Wicklow, Galway and Mayo where the 'red-like' deer exhibited sika deer alleles/haplotypes, and vice versa in the case of Wicklow. Molecular methods proved invaluable in the identification of the hybrid deer because identification of hybrids based on phenotypic external appearances (pelage and body proportions) can be misleading. Areas where red and sika deer are sympatric need to be assessed for the level and extent of hybridisation occurring and thus need to be managed in order to protect the genetic integrity of 'pure' red deer populations.

AB Roads have large impacts on wildlife, as they form one of the principal causes of mortality, and disturbance and fragmentation of habitat. These impacts are mainly studied and mitigated on major roads. It is, however, a widespread misconception that most animals are killed oil major roads. In this paper, we argue that minor roads have a larger impact on wildlife with respect to habitat destruction, noise load and traffic mortality. We use data on traffic related deaths in badgers (Meles meles) in The Netherlands to illustrate that traffic mortality is higher on minor roads. We ask for a more extensive investigation of the environmental impacts of minor roads. Moreover, we argue that the success of mitigation oil roads drastically increases when both major and minor roads are integrated in the planning of traffic flows. Therefore, we propose a strategy based oil the concept of a "traffic-calmed area". Traffic-calmed areas create opportunities for wildlife by decreasing limitations for animal movement. We ask for further Studies to estimate what size traffic-calmed areas should be to maintain minimum viable animal Populations. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background and Aims Studies on xylogenesis focus essentially on the stem, whereas there is basically no information about the intra-annual growth of other parts of the tree. As roots strongly influence carbon allocation and tree development, knowledge of the dynamics of xylem production and maturation in roots at a short time scale is required for a better understanding of the phenomenon of tree growth. This study compared cambial activity and xylem formation in stem and roots in two conifers of the boreal forest in Canada.
   Methods Wood microcores were collected weekly in stem and roots of ten Abies balsamea and ten Picea mariana during the 2004-2006 growing seasons. Cross-sections were cut using a rotary microtome, stained with cresyl violet acetate and observed under visible and polarized light. The number of cells in the cambial zone and in differentiation, plus the number of mature cells, was counted along the developing xylem.
   Key Results Xylem formation lasted from the end of May to the end of September, with no difference between stem and roots in 2004-2005. On the contrary, in 2006 a 1-week earlier beginning of cell differentiation was observed in the stem, with cell wall thickening and lignification in roots ending up to 22 d later than in the stem. Cell production in the stem was concentrated early in the season, in June, while most cell divisions in roots occurred 1 month later.
   Conclusions The intra-annual dynamics of growth observed in stem and roots could be related to the different amount of cells produced by the cambium and the patterns of air and soil temperature occurring in spring.

AB A growing number of ecologists are using molecular gut content assays to qualitatively measure predation. The two most popular gut content assays are immunoassays employing pest-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays employing pest-specific DNA. Here, we present results from the first study to simultaneously use both methods to identify predators of the glassy winged sharpshooter (GWSS), Homalodisca vitripennis (Germar) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae). A total of 1,229 arthropod predators, representing 30 taxa, were collected from urban landscapes in central California and assayed first by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a GWSS egg-specific mAb and then by PCR using a GWSS-specific DNA marker that amplifies a 197-base pair fragment of its cytochrome oxidase gene (subunit I). The gut content analyses revealed that GWSS remains were present in 15.5% of the predators examined, with 18% of the spiders and 11% of the insect predators testing positive. Common spider predators included members of the Salticidae, Clubionidae, Anyphaenidae, Miturgidae, and Corinnidae families. Common insect predators included lacewings (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), praying mantis (Mantodea: Mantidae), ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), assassin bugs (Hemiptera: Reduviidae), and damsel bugs (Hemiptera: Nabidae). Comparison of the two assays indicated that they were not equally effective at detecting GWSS remains in predator guts. The advantages of combining the attributes of both types of assays to more precisely assess field predation and the pros and cons of each assay for mass-screening predators are discussed.

AB Sea spiders are conspicuous, and often abundant, members of the Antarctic benthic community. Nymphonidae (Pycnogonida) in Southern Ocean waters comprise over 240 species which are often difficult to assign due to their intraspecific 'highly variable' morphology. In particular, Nymphon australe, the numerically dominant species in Antarctic waters is known to have a high level of phenotypic variation in external morphology and is also reported to have a circumpolar distribution. Circumpolarity seems contradictory to the pycnogonid's brooding lifestyle and presumably limited dispersal. Here we examine the genetic diversity of several Nymphon species collected in the Antarctic Peninsular region. Concomitantly, we assess the genetic structure of N. australe to gain insight into Nymphon dispersal capacity. Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S ribosomal gene data suggest a recent common history and/or recent gene-flow of N. australe populations across nearly 800 km of the Antarctic Peninsula. Furthermore, these data support that the Antarctic Peninsula region may hold two previously unrecognized species of Nymphon.

AB 1. Recent work shows that large leaves tend to require higher biomass investments per unit leaf area than small leaves. As a consequence, specific leaf area (SLA), which is a focus trait for a bulk of physiological and ecological research programs, is dependent on leaf size variation. Here, we address whether size dependency alters the outcome of research dealing with SLA responses to environmental or developmental change.
   2. We compiled lamina mass (M) and surface area (A) data for 2158 leaves of 26 species, coming from studies investigating the reaction of SLA to variation in rainfall, growth-season length, light intensity, atmospheric CO2, fire frequency, type of branch and leaf and plant age. We fitted the function M = alpha A(beta) to the data of each experimental situation separately, and implemented a method to split SLA response as measured in the original study (SLA Delta(m)) into response due to leaf size dependency (SLA Delta(a)), and response due to treatment effects, after controlling for leaf size dependency (SLA Delta(t)).
   3. The sign of the reaction did not differ between SLA(Delta m) and SLA(Delta t). However, the magnitude of that response changed for most contrasts, though in variable ways.
   4. Conclusions of past experiments hold, for the most part, after re-analysis including size dependency. However, given the large heterogeneity found here, we advise that future work investigating SLA be prepared to account for leaf size dependency when the factors under focus are suspected to alter leaf size.

AB Processes that affect the evolution of female preferences or male display traits involved in mating decisions in different geographic areas have the potential to result in within-species divergence. This could occur via reinforcement of mate recognition in species using the same traits for species recognition and sexual selection. Sympatric individuals experience reinforcement of female preferences and male display traits, whereas allopatric individuals do not, creating the potential for divergent sexual selection in sympatric and allopatric populations. Sexual selection operates on the cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) of Drosophila serrata, and reinforcement on the CHCs of populations sympatric with D. birchii. Here, we manipulate sexual selection in D. serrata populations generated by hybridizing natural sympatric and allopatric populations. Under the influence of sexual selection, male CHCs evolved from an intermediate phenotype to resemble an allopatric phenotype, which was driven by female choice. Additionally, female choice resulted in evolution of an allopatric female preference, so that allopatric males were preferred to sympatric males. Allopatric CHCs and preferences represent a sexual selection optimum via female choice. Sympatric populations display suboptimal phenotypes relative to their allopatric conspecifics. The combination of reinforcement and sexual selection can therefore generate divergence in female preferences and male display traits.

AB Heavy infestations of a non-indigenous shrub, Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) are frequently linked to poor individual performance and reduced species diversity. We used chronosequence methods and analysis of forest strata to investigate potential impacts of L. maackii on 1) species richness, 2) density of sub-canopy recruitment layers, 3) indicator species affinity, and 4) within- and among-strata compositional similarities. We compared sites ranging from 12 to 26 years since initial invasion as well as non-invaded, control sites. When assessing non-invaded versus long-invaded sites, we found significantly (P <= 0.05) reduced densities in the herb (-57%), seedling (-58%), and sapling layers (-90%), and also reduced species richness in the seedling (-34%), and sapling (-58%), and herbaceous layers (-4%). Interestingly, the germinable seed bank density showed significant increases among non-invaded and long-invaded sites (+78%), while the species richness of the seed bank demonstrated a marked decrease (-41%). Indicator species analysis found that most species had greater frequencies and abundances in non-invaded sites, and nearly all species had greater affinities for the non-invaded sites, especially in the seedling, sapling, and seed bank layers. Responses were species-specific in the herbaceous layer. Within-layer species similarity decreased with increased time of L. maackii occupancy in all sub-canopy strata. This pattern was also found with reductions in between-layer compositional similarity for the long-invaded (r = 0.16) versus the recently-invaded (r = 0.37) and non-invaded (r = 0.51) sites. Our data suggest that in many invaded sites, habitats are experiencing wholesale alterations in species composition, structure, and successional trajectory, and invasion may also change competitive interactions in forest understories as well as alter between-layer species linkages. These results validate the candidacy of L. maackii sites for increased removal and restoration efforts.

AB The Prestige oil spill in November 2002 is considered the biggest large-scale catastrophe of its type in Europe, thousands of seabirds dying in the subsequent months. Here, the total concentration of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (TPAH) was measured in the blood cell fraction of adult and chick yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) from unoiled and oiled coastal areas in North Western Spain. In addition, hematocrit, plasma metabolites, electrolytes and enzymes, as well as body mass were determined in the same individuals. Our results strongly suggest the presence of health damages of sublethal nature in adult gulls breeding in oiled colonies 17 months after the Prestige oil spill. This is supported by the following evidences: (1) gulls sampled in unoiled and oiled colonies differed in blood TPAH levels, (2) gulls sampled in unoiled and oiled colonies differed in several blood parameters indicative of physiological disorders, and (3) TPAH in blood was significantly related to several of these parameters. Differences in the level of asparatate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), total protein, glucose and inorganic phosphorus suggest damages on some vital organs (i.e. liver and kidney) in adult birds from oiled areas. Meanwhile, chicks presented weaker effects than adults, showing only between-area differences in hematocrit. Since TPAH levels in blood did not differ between both age-groups, the stronger effects on adults should be due to their longer exposure to these pollutants and/or to severe exposure in the months following the spill. The presence of PAHs in chicks indicates that these pollutants were incorporated into the food chain because nestlings would have been only exposed to contaminated organisms in the diet (e.g. fishes and crustaceans). Our findings support the view that PAHs may deeply alter the physiology of seabirds, and emphasize the necessity of quantifying the circulating levels of these compounds in order to evaluate the sublethal effects associated to large oil spills.

AB A key question in ecology is how biological traits of species determine their locations within an ecosystem. Identifying associations between species traits and environmental variables can help us to understand the causes of disturbance and predict whether species with given traits will persist under changing environmental conditions. To this end corals and environmental variables were sampled in 20 patch reefs of Pulau Seribu, located to the northwest of Jakarta, Indonesia. RLQ analysis, a multivariate ordination approach was subsequently used to relate species traits (colony shape, colony form, corallite size, reproductive mode and adaptive strategy) to environmental variables (e.g., heavy metal concentration in seawater and sediment, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and the cover of sand, dead coral, algae, sponges and soft corals). Using RLQ analysis, we identified environmental gradients associated with significant variation in species traits. Stress tolerant species with a massive morphology, meandroid shape and large corallites were associated with sites with a high abundance of algae and a relatively high concentration of potentially toxic heavy metals in seawater including Cu and Cd, whereas ruderal species and species with a branching morphology and very small corallites were linked to midshore sites. Competitively dominant species with a laminar or free-living morphology, phaceloid shape, very large corallites and brooding reproductive mode were linked to offshore sites with abundant Ca and Sr in the sediment and a high cover of Halimeda algae and sponges. Results of this study indicate that disturbance has differentially affected the marine environment of the Pulau Seribu system, which in turn interacts with coral species traits to determine local species composition.

AB The decline of over-hunted red-legged (Alectoris rufa) and rock (A. graeca) partridge populations has been contrasted with massive releases of captive-reared birds, often hybrids with non-indigenous A. chukar. Released interspecific hybrids raise the risks of introgressive hybridisation, and can contribute to further depress the fitness of native populations. Aiming to assess the extent of hybridisation, we genotyped the mtDNA control-region and eight nuclear microsatellites in 671 red-legged, rock and chukar partridges and hybrids, identified by phenotypic traits. Results reveal a diffuse occurrence of hybridisation: (1) 39 samples (6.2%) show mtDNA haplotypes discordant with their phenotypes, indicating red-legged and chukar mtDNA introgression in native rock partridges; (2) admixture analyses of the microsatellite genotypes identified 32 additional rock partridges (5.1%) hybridised mainly with chukars. We analysed also 39 samples collected from a presumed natural red-legged x rock partridge hybrid zone in the French Alps. Surprisingly, 28% birds showed typical chukar mtDNAs, indicating hybridisation with introduced chukars or hybrids. This hybrid zone led to an introgression cline of chukar alleles into neighbouring Alpine rock partridges detectable up to 100 km, which was shorter than expected by neutral genetic theory, and that suggested natural selection against hybrids. These findings indicate that introgressive hybridisation may disrupt local adaptations in natural red-legged partridge and rock partridge populations, and call for strict control of farming and restocking operations.

AB The interrelationship between broadband solar components, global (R-s) and diffuse (R-d) and the photosynthetic photon flux density components, global (Q(p)) and diffuse (Q(Pd)), is investigated using a 2-year data archive obtained at Athens, Greece. These data are used to determine temporal variability of the ratios (Q(p)/R-s) and (Q(Pd)/R-d) and their dependence on sky conditions. The seasonal variation of the ratios obtained from hourly data ranges from 2.006 +/- 0.032 (winter) to 1.989 +/- 0.028 mu mol J(-1) (summer) with an annual mean of 1.995 +/- 0.032 mu mol J(-1) for (Q(p)/R-s) and from 2.298 +/- 0.27 (winter) to 2.538 +/- 0.22 mu mol J(-1) (summer) with an annual mean of 2.434 +/- 0.26 mu mol J(-1) for (Q(Pd)/R-d). The hourly ratio (Q(p)/R-s) increased from 1.982 +/- 0.025 to 2.106 +/- 0.029 mu mol.J(-1) as sky conditions changed from clear to overcast; whereas the ratio (Q(Pd)/R-d) decreased from 2.556 +/- 0.27 to 2.422 +/- 0.24 mu mol J(-1) as sky conditions changed from clear to overcast skies. The seasonal daily ratio patterns are presented and discussed through clearness index k(1) (the ratio of the global-to-extraterrestrial solar radiation). Finally, the relationship between the spectral diffuse fraction k(dP) (the ratio of diffuse PAR-to-global PAR radiation) and the clearness index k(tp) (the ratio of global PAR-to-extraterrestrial solar PAR) is established for the Athens atmosphere.

AB Background: Populations may be bound by contemporary gene flow, selective sweeps, and extinction-recolonization processes. Indeed, existing molecular estimates indicate that species with low levels of gene flow are rare. However, strong priority effects and local selective regimes may hinder gene flow ( despite dispersal) sending populations on independent evolutionary trajectories. In this scenario ( the monopolization hypothesis), population differentiation will increase with time and genealogical evidence should yield ample private haplotypes. Cyclical parthenogens ( e. g. rotifers and cladocerans such as Daphnia) have an increased capacity for rapid local adaptation and priority effects because sexual reproduction is followed by multiple generations of clonal selection and massive egg bank formation. We aimed to better understand the history of population differentiation and ongoing gene flow in Daphnia rosea s. l., by comparing population and regional divergences in mature unglaciated areas and younger previously glaciated areas. We also examined the timing and paths of colonization of previously-glaciated areas to assess the dispersal limitations of D. rosea s. l. We used DNA sequence variation ( 84 populations and > 400 individuals) at the mitochondrial ND2 and nuclear HSP90 loci from Holarctic populations for our genetic analyses.
   Results: The genetic evidence indicated pronounced historical structure. Holarctic mtDNA phylogenies of D. rosea s. l. revealed three geographically restricted and divergent clades: European, Siberian and Japanese/American. The Japanese/ American clade showed marked population genetic structure (F-ST > 0.8) that was weakly associated with geographic distance, and a high proportion of private haplotypes. Populations from older unglaciated habitats (i.e., Japan) showed higher DNA sequence divergences than populations from presumed younger habitats (i.e. non-Beringian North America) with nDNA and with mtDNA. Mismatch analyses of mtDNA and nDNA were consistent with a single rapid post-glacial expansion of D. rosea that covered most of the New World.
   Conclusion: Our evidence agrees with negligible gene flow after founding, and the accumulation of genetic divergence with habitat age. Existing direct evidence and our mismatch analyses indicate that the pronounced population differentiation is unlikely to be due to dispersal limitation. Instead, priority effects and local selection regimes may play a role in limiting gene flow. The results challenge the notion that lacustrine populations of cladocerans are generally unified by contemporary gene flow.

ID SPRING MIGRATION; FARMLAND BIRDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ARRIVAL DATE;
   CONSEQUENCES; TRENDS; AGE
AB The phenology of avian migration appears to be changing in response to climate change. Seemingly contradictory differences in the timing of these annual cycles have been reported in published studies. We show that differences between studies in the choice of songbird species, as well as in the measurements of migration phenology, can explain most of the reported differences. Furthermore, while earlier spring arrival is evident across these studies, trends in timing of departure show large variation between species and according to individual timing of migration (early-arriving vs. late-departing individuals). Much of the variation in departure between species could be explained by each species' migratory status. We present a detailed analysis of migrants recorded at a Danish migration site, and reveal that although shifts in migration timing can be demonstrated for almost all species, these shifts are either most pronounced in the early arriving/late departing individuals or the changes are similar. Thus most individuals do not seem to change their breeding-area residence time (BART). As BART is likely to reflect ecologically important factors, e.g. number of clutches, we expect that only small effects have been exerted on the breeding ecology of the studied species in the time period investigated.

AB In both animal and human societies, individuals may forego personal reproduction and provide care to the offspring of others. Studies aimed at investigating the adaptive nature of such cooperative breeding systems in vertebrates typically calculate helper 'fitness' from relationships of helper numbers and offspring survival to independence. The aim of this study is to use observations and supplemental feeding experiments in cooperatively breeding meerkats, Suricata suricatta, to investigate whether helpers influence the long-term reproductive potential of offspring during adulthood. We show that helpers have a significant and positive influence on the probability that offspring gain direct reproductive success in their lifetimes. This effect arises because helpers both reduce the age at which offspring begin to reproduce as subordinates and increase the probability that they will compete successfully for alpha rank. Supplemental feeding experiments confirm the causality of these results. Our results suggest that one can neither discount the significance of helper effects when none is found nor necessarily estimate accurately the fitness benefit that helpers accrue, unless their effects on offspring are considered in the long term.

AB 1. Treeless mountainous areas at high altitudes have increased in value as wildlife habitat, but they are affected and increasingly threatened by ski-resort developments, in particular by the construction and enlargement of ski-pistes. To assess the extent of this threat, we compared bird diversity and community composition in circular plots centred on (i) ski-runs of recent construction, (ii) grassland habitats adjacent to ski-runs and (iii) natural grassland habitats far from the ski-runs.
   2. Plots located in natural grasslands supported the greatest bird species richness and diversity and the greatest grassland species density, whereas those set in ski-pistes presented the lowest values. Plots located beside ski-runs did not support smaller numbers of bird species and diversity than plots of natural areas, but they supported a significantly lower bird density. This suggests that ski-pistes, besides exerting a negative direct effect on the structure of local bird communities, may also exert an indirect, detrimental effect on bird density in nearby patches.
   3. Generalized linear models showed that species richness and diversity, and abundance of grassland species were best modelled by combinations of factors, including habitat type (the three categories defined above) and altitude. The category ski-run, in particular, was negatively correlated with species richness, diversity and abundance, and altitude was negatively associated with richness and diversity.
   4. Richness and abundance of arthropods were significantly lower in ski-pistes than in the other plot types. Given that many invertebrates were preyed upon by birds, low food availability on ski-runs may be one of the factors reducing the attractiveness of these patches to birds.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Retaining the avifauna around ski-resorts is likely to involve developing new, environmentally friendly ways of constructing pistes, such as only removing rocks and/or levelling the roughest ground surfaces, to preserve as much soil and natural vegetation as possible. Restoration of ski-pistes should promote the recovery and maintenance of local vegetation to enhance invertebrate and bird assemblages. In order to not compromise the safety of the ski-runs, it may be necessary to control encroaching shrubs through pruning and/or cattle grazing.

AB Mitochondrial control region (HVR-1) sequences were used to identify patterns of genetic structure and diversity in Naso vlamingii, a widespread coral reef fish with a long evolutionary history. We examined 113 individuals from eight locations across the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Our aims were to determine the spatial scale at which population partitioning occurred and then to evaluate the extent to which either vicariance and/or dispersal events have shaped the population structure of N. vlamingii. The analysis produced several unexpected findings. Firstly, the genetic structure of this species was temporal rather than spatial. Secondly, there was no evidence of a barrier to dispersal throughout the vast distribution range. Apparently larvae of this species traverse vicariance barriers that inhibit inter-oceanic migration of other widespread reef fish taxa. Thirdly, an unusual life history and long evolutionary history was associated with a population structure that was unique amongst coral reef fishes in terms of the magnitude and pattern of genetic diversity (haplotype diversity, h = 1.0 and nucleotide diversity pi = 13.6%). In addition to these unique characteristics, there was no evidence of isolation by distance (r = 0.458, R-2 = 0.210, P = 0.078) as has also been shown for some other widespread reef species. However, some reductions in gene flow were observed among and within Ocean basins [Indian-Pacific analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), Phi(st) = 0.0766, P < 0.05; West Indian-East Indian-Pacific AMOVA Phi(st) = 0.079, P < 0.05]. These findings are contrasted with recent studies of coral reef fishes that imply a greater degree of spatial structuring in coral reef fish populations than would be expected from the dispersive nature of their life cycles. We conclude that increased taxon sampling of coral reef fishes for phylogeographic analysis will provide an extended view of the ecological and evolutionary processes shaping coral reef fish diversity at both ends of the life history spectrum.

AB Despite the importance of proximate mechanisms for understanding costs and functions of signals, relatively little is known about physiological processes underlying colorful plumage production. We investigated yellow carotenoid-based breast plumage and ultraviolet (UV)/blue structural color of tail feathers in nestling blue tits. At peak plumage production and at fledging, we examined plasma concentration of protein, the substance of feathers, and levels of carotenoids, which are deposited in yellow plumage and also required for support of growth and immune development. Males showed more UV-shifted hue and higher chroma and UV chroma of the tail feathers. In males only, tail chroma and UV chroma were strongly but negatively related to circulating plasma protein at the period of peak feather production. Breast plumage was more chromatic in males, and yellow coloration was strongly condition dependent in males only. Production of more chromatic plumage appeared to deplete carotenoids from plasma, since male fledglings had less circulating carotenoids than females. This had no obvious consequences for these males, since coloration was unrelated to cell-mediated immune responses, humoral immune status, stress, and parasitism. Nonetheless, the pronounced sex specificity of condition dependence of structural and carotenoid-based coloration is suggestive of a signaling function of the fledgling plumage.

AB Global warming has led to earlier spring arrival of migratory birds, but the extent of this advancement varies greatly among species, and it remains uncertain to what degree these changes are phenotypically plastic responses or microevolutionary adaptations to changing environmental conditions. We suggest that sexual selection could help to understand this variation, since early spring arrival of males is favoured by female choice. Climate change could weaken the strength of natural selection opposing sexual selection for early migration, which would predict greatest advancement in species with stronger female choice. We test this hypothesis comparatively by investigating the degree of long-term change in spring passage at two ringing stations in northern Europe in relation to a synthetic estimate of the strength of female choice, composed of degree of extra-pair paternity, relative testes size and degree of sexually dichromatic plumage colouration. We found that species with a stronger index of sexual selection have indeed advanced their date of spring passage to a greater extent. This relationship was stronger for the changes in the median passage date of the whole population than for changes in the timing of first-arriving individuals, suggesting that selection has not only acted on protandrous males. These results suggest that sexual selection may have an impact on the responses of organisms to climate change, and knowledge of a species' mating system might help to inform attempts at predicting these.

AB A basic challenge in evolutionary biology is to establish links between ecology and evolution of species. One important link is the habitat template. It has been hypothesized, that the spatial and temporal settings of a habitat strongly influence the evolution of species dispersal propensity. Here, we evaluate the importance of the habitat type on genetic population differentiation of species using freshwater habitats as a model system. Freshwater habitats are either lentic (standing) or lotic (running). On average, lotic habitats are more stable and predictable over space and time than lentic habitats. Therefore, lentic habitats should favour the evolution of higher dispersal propensity which ensures population survival of lentic species. To test for such a relationship, we used extensive data on species' genetic population differentiation of lentic and lotic freshwater invertebrates retrieved from published allozyme studies. Overall, we analysed more than 150 species from all over the world. Controlling for several experimental, biological and geographical confounding effects, we always found that lentic invertebrates exhibit, on average, lower genetic population differentiation than lotic species. This pattern was consistent across insects, crustaceans and molluscs. Our results imply fundamental differences in genetic population differentiation among species adapted to either lentic or lotic habitats. We propose that such differences should occur in a number of other habitat types that differ in spatio-temporal stability. Furthermore, our results highlight the important role of lotic habitats as reservoirs for evolutionary processes and the potential for rapid speciation.

AB Although arctic lakes rank among the most pristine ecosystems remaining on Earth, widespread paleoecological analyses have revealed rapid recent changes in lake ecology that largely surpass Holocene natural variability and that are generally attributed to climate warming since the end of the Little Ice Age. However, the possibility that climate is only one dimension of these unprecedented ecological shifts remains an untested possibility, especially given that current warming may not yet exceed maximum, naturally mediated, postgJacial warmth. In this paper, we assess whether increased anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition from distant sources is contributing to directional changes in the biogeochemistry and ecology of two remote lakes on Baffin Island in the eastern Canadian Arctic. Paleolimnological analyses, including diatom assemblages and a suite of biogeochemical proxies (total organic matter, biogenic silica, Organic N and C contents, and stable isotopic ratios) reveal a complex suite of progressive changes that are coherently expressed in both lakes. Diatom assemblages began to change as early as the mid-19th century, but major inflections in the biogeochemical proxies occurred significantly later, being most pronounced after 1950. Among these changes are increases in sediment organic matter, depletions of 2 parts per thousand in sediment delta N-15, and decoupling of delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures. It seems likely that climate warming, subsequently coupled to anthropogenic N deposition, is synergistically driving these ecosystems towards states for which no prior natural analogs exist.

AB Aim Climate is an important determinant of species distributions. We assess different aspects of risk arising from future climate change by quantifying changes in the spatial distribution of future climatic conditions compared with the recent past.
   Location Europe.
   Methods A 10' x 10' resolution gridded data set of five climate variables was used to calculate expected changes to the area, distance and direction of 1931-60 climatic conditions under the HadCM3 climate model for four future climate scenarios based on different rates of greenhouse gas emissions (SRES scenarios). Three levels of tolerance ranges determined the thresholds for which future conditions are considered analogous to 1931-60 (pre-warming) conditions.
   Results For many parts of Europe, areas with pre-warming analogous climate conditions will be smaller and further away in the future than they arc now. For any location in Europe, areas with pre-warming analogous mean annual temperature conditions will, on average, be reduced between 23.7% (B1 scenario) and 49.7% (A1FI scenario) by 2100 when assuming a medium tolerance range. The mean distance to these areas will, on average, increase between 272 km (B1) and 645 km (A1FI). These changes are more pronounced for temperature than for water availability variables and also for narrow tolerance ranges compared to wide tolerance ranges. Using a combined measure of both temperature and precipitation variables, areas with pre-warming analogous conditions are predicted to be in a more northeasterly direction in the future, but there are considerable regional differences within Europe.
   Main conclusions The results suggest that, for some parts of Europe, the loss of area with any suitable climatic conditions represents the greatest risk to biodiversity, but in other regions the distances that species may have to move to reach suitable climatic conditions may be a greater problem. Quantifying the distance and direction in analyses of change of climatically suitable areas can add additional information for climate change risk assessments.

AB The decrease in temperature with increasing elevation may determine the altitudinal tree distribution in different ways: affecting survival through freezing temperatures, by a negative carbon balance produced by lower photosynthetic rates, or by limiting growth activity. Here we assessed the relative importance of these direct and indirect effects of altitudinal decrease in temperature in determining the treeline in central Chile (33 degrees S) dominated by Kageneckia angustifolia. We selected two altitudes (2000 and 2200 m a.s.l.) along the treeline ecotone. At each elevation, leaf non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) and gas exchange parameters were measured on five individuals during the growing season. We also determined the cold resistance of K. angustifolia, by measuring temperatures that cause 50% seedling mortality (LT50) and ice nucleation (IN). No differences in net photosynthesis were found between altitudes. Although no differences were detected on NSC concentration on a dry matter basis between 2000 and 2200 m, when NSC concentration was expressed on a leaf area basis, higher contents were found at the higher elevation. Thus, carbon sink limitations may occur at the K. angustifolia's upper altitudinal limit. For seedlings derived from seeds collected at the 2200 m, LT50 of cold-acclimated and non-acclimated plants were -9.5 and -7 degrees C, respectively. However, temperatures as low as -10 degrees C can frequently occur at this altitude during the end of winter. Therefore, low temperature injury of seedlings seems also be involved in the treeline formation in this species. Hence, a confluence of global (carbon sink limitation) and regional (freezing tolerance) mechanisms explains the treeline formation in the Mediterranean-type climate zone of central Chile.

AB Dispersal is a major factor regulating the number of coexisting species, but the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem processes has mainly been analysed for communities closed to dispersal. We experimentally investigated how initial local diversity and dispersal frequency affect local diversity and biomass production in open benthic microalgal metacommunities. Final local species richness and local biomass production were strongly influenced by dispersal frequency but not by initial local diversity. Both final local richness and final local biomass showed a hump-shaped pattern with increasing dispersal frequency, with a maximum at intermediate dispersal frequencies. Consequently, final local biomass increased linearly with increasing final richness. We conclude that the general relationship between richness and ecosystem functioning remains valid in open systems, but the maintenance of ecosystem processes significantly depends on the effects of dispersal on species richness and local interactions.

AB Mangroves are prone to bearing frequently the full brunt of hurricanes and tropical storms. The extent of destruction and early regeneration are widely studied. The purpose of this study was to add a long-term view of mangrove regeneration and assess the potential effects on mangrove horizontal zonation patterns of catastrophic destruction. Hattie, a category five hurricane, hit the Belizean coast in 1961. It passed directly over the Turneffe Atoll where our study area, Calabash Cay, is located. At four sites on this island, we analyzed mangrove forest structure along transects parallel to the shoreline within zones delineated by species dominance and tree height. We propose an index based on the Simpson index of diversity to express changes in the heterogeneity of the species dominance. Physical-chemical parameters and nutrient availability were also measured. The destruction levels were estimated by analysis of the distribution of diameter at breast heights of the bigger trees in the inland zones. Variations in species dominance among sites and zones could be explained by interactions of various factors. Further, different levels of destruction between the two sides of the island had a significant effect on current patterns of species and structural zonation at Calabash. We conclude that disturbance regime in general should be considered as a factor potentially influencing mangrove horizontal zonation patterns.

AB Ecological work carried out on the Antarctic and Magellan shelves since the first IBMANT conference held at the UMAG, Punta Arenas in 1997 is summarized to identify areas where progress has been made and others, where important gaps have remained in understanding past and present interaction between the Antarctic and the southern tip of South America. This information is complementary to a review on shallow-water work along the Scotia Arc (Barnes, 2005) and recent work done in the deep sea (Brandt and Hilbig, 2004). While principally referring to shipboard work in deeper water, above all during the recent international EASIZ and LAMPOS campaigns, relevant work from shore stations is also included. Six years after the first IBMANT symposium, significant progress has been made along the latitudinal gradient from the Magellan region to the high Antarctic in the fields of biodiversity, biogeography and community structure, life strategies and adaptations, the role of disturbance and its significance for biodiversity, and trophic coupling of the benthic realm with the water column and sea ice. A better understanding has developed of the role of evolutionary and ecological factors in shaping past and present-day environmental conditions, species composition and distribution, and ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, the science community engaged in unravelling Antarctic-Magellan interactions has advanced in methodological aspects such as new analytical approaches for comparing biodiversity derived from visual methods, growth and age determination, trophic modelling using stable isotope ratios, and molecular approaches for taxonomic and phylogenetic purposes. At the same time, much effort has been invested to complement the species inventory of the two adjacent regions. However, much work remains to be done to fill the numerous gaps. Some perspectives are outlined in this review, and sugestions are made where particular emphasis should be placed in future work, much of which will be developed in the frame of SCAR'S EBA (Evolution and Biodiversity in the Antarctic) programme.

Leaf photosynthetic capacity (maximum rate of carboxylation and maximum rate of electron transport) was estimated by fitting a biochemical model of photosynthesis to response curves of net CO2 assimilation rate versus intercellular CO2 mole fraction. Leaf morphology described by leaf mass per unit leaf area (LMA), density and thickness, as well as area- and mass-based nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) concentrations, were recorded on the same leaves. Large interspecific variability was detected in photosynthetic capacity as well as in leaf structure and leaf N and C concentrations. No correlation was found between leaf thickness and density. The correlations between area- and mass-based leaf N concentration and photosynthetic capacity were poor. Conversely, the species differed greatly in relative N allocation to carboxylation and bioenergetics. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that, of the recorded traits, only the computed fraction of total leaf N invested in photosynthesis was tightly correlated to photosynthetic capacity. We also used PCA to test to what extent species with similar shade tolerances displayed converging leaf traits related to photosynthesis. No clear-cut ranking could be detected among the shade-tolerant groups, as confirmed by a one-way ANOVA. We conclude that the large interspecific diversity in photosynthetic capacity was mostly explained by differences in the relative allocation of N to photosynthesis and not by leaf N concentration, and that leaf traits related to photosynthetic capacity did not discriminate shade-tolerance ranking of these tropical tree species.

AB Evolutionary ecologists have long sought to understand the conditions under which perennial (iteroparous) versus annual (semelparous) plant life histories are favored. We evaluated the idea that aridity and variation in the length of droughts should favor the evolution of an annual life history, both by decreasing adult survival and by increasing the potential for high seedling survival via reduced plant cover. We calculated phylogenetically independent contrasts of climate with respect to life history in a clade of winter-establishing evening primroses (sections Anogra and Kleinia; Oenothera; Onagraceae), which includes seven annuals, 12 perennials, and two variable taxa. Climate variables were quantified from long-term records at weather stations near collection localities. To explicitly account for phylogenetic uncertainty, contrasts were calculated on a random sample of phylogenetic trees from the posterior distribution of a Bayesian analysis of DNA sequence data. Statements of association are based on comparing the pertree mean contrast, which has a null expectation of zero, to a set of per-tree mean contrasts calculated on the same trees, after randomizing the climate data. As predicted, increased annual aridity, increased annual potential evapotranspiration, and decreased annual precipitation were associated with transitions to the annual habit, but these trends were not significantly different from the null pattern. Transitions to the annual habit were not significantly associated with increases in one measure of aridity in summer nor with increased summer drought, but they were associated with significantly increased maximum summer temperatures. In winter, increased aridity and decreased precipitation were significantly associated with transitions to the annual habit. Changes in life history were not significantly associated with changes in the coefficient of variation of precipitation, either on an annual or seasonal (summer vs. winter) basis. Though we cannot attribute causality on the basis of a correlational, historical study, our results are consistent with the idea that increased heat and drought at certain times of the year favor the evolution of the annual habit. Increased heat in summer may cause adult survival to decline, while increased aridity and decreased precipitation in the season of seedling recruitment (winter) may favor a drought-avoiding, short-lived annual strategy. Not all of the predicted patterns were observed: the capability for drought-induced dormancy may preclude change in habit in response to summer drought in our study group.

AB 1. Birds respond to unpredictable events in the environment by releasing corticosterone, which triggers alternate responses to overcome stressful situations. However, it has been questioned whether altricial nestlings perceive and respond to ecological stressors. Although some studies show adrenal responsiveness in non-precocial species, others report a hyporesponsive period postulated to avoid deleterious effects of corticosterone.
   2. To test whether the environmental surroundings of nestlings modulate their stress levels we used a multi-tier comparative approach of plasma corticosterone: (1) within an individual, (2) among nestlings within a brood hierarchy, (3) among broods within a colony and (4) among individuals from different colonies.
   3. Nestlings reacted to our protocol by elevating their corticosterone. Baseline levels differed between colonies, and were higher in singleton nestlings compared with two- and three-chick broods, but there were no differences related to within-brood hierarchies, age or condition index.
   4. Acute levels were higher in older birds, suggesting a developmental change in adrenal responsiveness. Body condition also explained acute levels but only in singleton nestlings, with higher concentrations in heavier birds.
   5. Overall our results indicate that altricial nestlings do respond to a variety of environmental stressors, and variation in aspects of environmental quality (e.g. food supply, parental care) may be associated with the differences in stress.

AB Commonness of organisms typically fluctuates through time, and understanding such fluctuations has long been an important part of ecological research. Studies at paleontological timescales provide a perspective on how changes in population size might affect community structure over millions of years. To overcome the obstacle that population size parameters such as abundance are difficult to detect in the fossil record, we here used fossil locality coverage to approximate changes in site occupancy in the Neogene of Europe over the course of 20 million years. Our aim was to examine whether the trophic structure of mammalian communities is maintained through time despite continuing environmental change. Ecomorphological grouping of fossils indicates that herbivore genera have low taxon resilience in that each genus has predominantly only one locality coverage peak before disappearance. Despite this continuous replacement of the most prevalent herbivore genera, the herbivore trophic group as a whole remains the largest and maintains a roughly constant share of locality coverage throughout the Neogene. The successive herbivore genera, however, show increasing adaptations to harshening environments, indicating shifting properties of niches while the overall trophic structure is conserved. Carnivores, dependent on primary productivity for food indirectly through their prey, show moderate lack of resilience. In contrast, in omnivores changes in locality coverage are close to random fluctuations.

AB Faces and Designs (N = 102) from the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) were scored using five different consensual-scoring methods: proportion, mode, lenient mode, distance, and adjusted distance. The aim was to determine which scoring methods were superior in terms of reliability, discriminability (distribution shape), and validity. Where possible, the Method of Reciprocal Averages (MRA)-used previously on dichotomously scored aptitude tests (to improve reliability)-was applied to consensus scores. Psychometric analyses suggested that the most promising techniques were proportion and mode scoring, with MRA scaling ameliorating some potential weaknesses apparent with these forms of consensual-scoring. Faces and Designs showed weak correlations with pro-social personality dimensions, with crystallized intelligence, and with visualization abilities. The study concludes with suggested remedies for addressing measurement problems endemic to El research. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Gazi Bay, Kenya, covers an area of 18 km(2), and its mangroves are degraded. We present a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the degradation of vegetation structure and dynamics of mangrove communities over a period of 25 yr, using aerial photography in a geographical information system (GIS), combined with ground-truth data for different vegetation layers, and with faunal and environmental factors. Retrospective analysis and understanding of current practices were aided by interviews with Gazi village elders and by field observations of mangrove tree stumps. GIS-based vegetation maps were combined with data obtained using the point-centred quarter method (PCQM), an accuracy analysis was performed, and forestry parameters were derived from the resultant PCQM data. In addition to general human-induced degradation of vegetation structure and floristic composition of the seaward mangrove zone, a particular sandy beach is expanding at the expense of mangrove, whereas the back mangrove zone has undergone minor changes. Aerial photographs of 1992 and current field data show an apparent zonation of 6 different monospecific or mixed mangrove communities, with a high importance of Rhizophora mucronata in each community and each vegetation layer. Retrospective vegetation structure was combined with correspondence analyses on the PCQM data derived for adult, young and juvenile trees in order to make predictions. Present dynamics initiated by anthropogenic degradation of mangroves continues, even though human impact has diminished. We predict that under a 'no impact scenario', the sandy ridge will continue to expand, that this will speed up under a 'mangrove cutting scenario', and that a scenario altering the complex topography will lead to a major re-organisation of the mangrove and terrestrial vegetation structure.

AB Most studies on the causes of animal dispersal focus on species of birds or small mammals, but there are few such studies on solitary carnivores. A complete picture of the causes of animal dispersal is not possible without considering cases on a representative set of animals. The Iberian lynx is a medium-size, solitary carnivore that inhabits metapopulations, where dispersal plays a prominent role. Between 1983 and 1998 we studied the proximate and ultimate causes of dispersal in Iberian lynx in the Donana metapopulation (southwestern Spain), based on radio-tracking of 49 individuals. Saturation of limited breeding areas in this small population leads to high dispersal rates in both sexes. Most lynxes dispersed from their natal area between 12 and 24 months of age. Males younger than I year old tended to disperse in a higher proportion than females of the same age. However, high dispersal rates for both sexes by the age of 2 years and the lack of differences in the dispersal distances do not support inbreeding avoidance as an ultimate cause of dispersal. Dispersal mainly started between January and June (24/29 cases), when most social interactions occur, which supports the social subordination hypothesis. Lynxes left the natal range at an earlier age from the local population with higher density, which supports intraspecific competition for resources as a cause for dispersal. However, prey seems not to be the limiting resource because dispersal mostly started during the season of increasing prey density, and individual probability of dispersal increases with prey density in the natal area. Dispersers suffered higher mortality than nondispersing lynxes of the same age, due mostly to anthropogenic causes. About half of the dispersers successfully settled in a territory at distances that differed between areas of origin, but not between sexes. Distances reached, shorter than those reported for other similar-size solitary felids, are limited by anthropogenic barriers that prevent connection, with closer metapopulations.

AB While biological invasions have been the subject of considerable attention both historically and recently. the factors controlling the susceptibility of communities to plant invasions remain controversial. We surveyed 44 sites in southeastern New York State to examine the relationships between plant community characteristics, soil characteristics, and normative plant invasion. Soil nitrogen mineralization and nitrification rates were strongly related to the degree of site invasion (F = 30.2, P < 0.0001 and F = 11.8, P < 0.005, respectively), and leaf C : N ratios were negatively correlated with invasion (R-2 = 0.22, P < 0.0001). More surprisingly, there was a strong positive relationship between soil calcium levels and the degree of site invasion (partial r = 0.70, P < 0.01), and there were also positive relationships between invasion and soil magnesium and phosphorus. We found, in addition, a positive factor-ceiling relationship between native species diversity and invasive species diversity. This positive relationship between native and invasive diversity contradicts earlier hypotheses concerning the relationships between species diversity and invasion, but supports some recent findings. Cluster analysis distinguished two broad forest community types at our sites: pine barrens and mixed hardwood communities. Invaders were significantly more abundant in mixed hardwood than in pine barrens communities (Mann-Whitney U = 682.5, P < 0.0001). Even when evaluating the mixed hardwood communities alone, invasion remained significantly positively correlated with soil fertility (calcium. magnesium, and net nitrogen mineralization rates). Soil texture and pH were not useful predictors of the degree to which forests were invaded. Nitrogen and calcium are critical components of plant development. and species better able to take advantage of increased nutrient availability may out-perform others at sites with higher nutrient levels.These results have implications for areas such as the eastern United States, where anthropogenic changes in the availability of nitrogen and calcium are affecting many plant communities.

AB We have studied the origin of salt adaptation in wild sunflower hybrids (Helianthus annuus x H. petiolaris), the precursors of the diploid hybrid species H. paradoxus, at the level of phenotypic traits and quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Here, we review this work and present new results on candidate gene polymorphisms.
   Salt tolerance candidate genes were identified in expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries of sunflower, based on homology to genes with known function, and on previous QTL results. EST polymorphisms were assayed by denaturing HPLC and genetically mapped in an interspecific BC2 for which fitness estimates in the wild were available.
   Out of 11 genes studied, one mapped to a salt tolerance QTL. This EST codes for a Ca-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) and stems from stress-induced root tissue of Helianthus annuus. Two additional stress-induced genes exhibited a significant fitness effect in the wild: an ER-type calcium ATPase, and a transcriptional regulator.
   Our results suggest a possible adaptive role for Ca-dependent salt tolerance genes in wild sunflower hybrids. Also, transgressive segregation appears to be sufficient to explain the origin of adaptive genetic variation in hybrids.

AB We examine the effects of matrix type on forest bird species richness in historically fragmented forests of the KwaZulu-Natal midlands, South Africa. Bird species-area relationships for forest fragments within natural grassland were compared with those surrounded by plantation forestry (Pinus spp.). While fragments in grasslands displayed a species-area effect, no such effect (slope similar to0) was detected for fragments in plantations. The critical fragment size to avoid an island effect on species richness was 302 ha for fragments in grasslands, and contained 51 of the 61 forest bird species encountered. Small forest fragments (<50 ha) within grasslands were less species-rich than those surrounded by plantation, while the reverse was true for forests larger than 50 ha. Bird density was significantly lower in larger forest patches within plantation when compared to those in grassland. However, a slight decline in species density with increasing species richness in a patch (i.e. weak density compensation) characterised only those bird assemblages surrounded by a grassland matrix, suggesting these are approaching species saturation. Commercial plantations may increase the likelihood of colonisation of, and immigration from, small forest fragments by birds, reducing the incidence of area-dependent extinction in small fragments, but may also result in lower species richness in larger fragments. The latter is likely a consequence of the promotion by plantations of a wider distribution of generalist species in, and the loss of some specialised or rare species from, large patches. Management options are to avoid planting plantations near large forest patches and to increase the size of small patches where possible. Where afforestation is unavoidable, placing plantations in the vicinity of small forest patches rather than large forest patches may be preferable. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID EVOLUTION
AB Global climate fluctuated considerably throughout the Pliocene and Pleistocene, influencing the evolutionary history of a wide range of species. Using both mitochondrial sequences and microsatellites, we have investigated the evolutionary consequences of such environmental fluctuation for the patterns of genetic variation in the common warthog, sampled from 24 localities in Africa. In the sample of 181 individuals, 70 mitochondrial DNA haplotypes were identified and an overall nucleotide diversity of 4.0% was observed. The haplotypes cluster in three well-differentiated clades ( estimated net sequence divergence of 3.1 - 6.6%) corresponding to the geographical origins of individuals (i.e. eastern, western and southern African clades). At the microsatellite loci, high polymorphism was observed both in the number of alleles per locus ( 6 - 21), and in the gene diversity ( in each population 0.59 - 0.80). Analysis of population differentiation indicates greater subdivision at the mitochondrial loci (F-ST = 0.85) than at nuclear loci (F-ST = 0.20), but both mitochondrial and nuclear loci support the existence of the three warthog lineages. We interpret our results in terms of the large-scale climatic fluctuations of the Pleistocene.

AB Soil samples were taken under four tree species in various forest sites located in southern France. For each sampled A horizon of the soil profile, pH, organic matter content, C:N ratio and amounts of exchangeable cations (K, Ca, Mg) were measured, and collembolan fauna was extracted using Berlese-Tullgren funnels. A total of 78 species representing 11 families and 47 genera were identified. The relationships between Collembola and soil parameters were determined by co-inertia analysis which corresponds to the simultaneous Correspondence Analysis of the collembolan data table and the Multiple Correspondence Analysis of the environmental data table. The analysis revealed that the distribution of 10 species was related to pH, organic matter content via C and N and to base cations (K, Ca, Mg). Samples, linking these collembolan species and chemical parameters, were clustered according to humus forms. Collembola seem to be linked closer to the physical structure of humus than to its chemical parameters. Their specific contribution to pedogenetic processes as yet remains to be clarified.

AB We investigated the genetic outcome of successful invasion by an alien species, the marsh frog Rana ridibunda , in Britain. Twelve adults translocated from Hungary into Kent (Romney) in 1935 resulted rapidly in a large localized population. A further successful translocation in 1973 from Romney to Sussex (Lewes), together with other range extensions, provided an opportunity to test bottleneck effects during colonization events. Romney and Lewes frogs had similar genetic diversities to those in Hungary at 14 random amplified polymorphic DNA marker (RAPD) and five microsatellite loci. The introduced populations were, however, differentiated genetically from each other and from a reference population in Hungary. Fitness assessments (larval growth and survival) revealed no differences between the Lewes and Romney populations. Despite starting with few founders, significant bottleneck effects on R. ridibunda in Britain were therefore undetectable, presumably because population expansions were rapid immediately after the translocations.

AB Australia is a very dry continent, with low levels of rainfall and high temperatures and evaporative demand for much of the continent for much of the year. Net primary productivity (NPP) of Australia is also low. These two observations are presumably related, and, at a catchment scale, correlations between ecosystem water balance and NPP surely exist. This paper shows that these assumptions are probably correct, and then reviews the mechanisms by which ecosystem water balance may determine NPP.
   The measurement and quantification of ecosystem water balance is not always easy, and several measures, involving various ratios of rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, soil water content and related parameters, have been used. This topic is briefly discussed.
   Ecosystem water balance influences NPP through effects at several scales. Ecosystem water balance influences several leaf attributes, especially specific leaf area and foliar nitrogen content. In addition, carbon and nitrogen partitioning between photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues, rates of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance are affected. At the larger scale, whole-tree hydraulic conductance and allocation of biomass to root, stem and leaf mass are affected by ecosystem water balance and influence NPP. Respiration rates and the relative contributions of root, stem and leaf respiration vary with ecosystem water balance and therefore influence NPP. Finally, attributes at the canopy and stand scales also respond to catchment water balance and influence NPP. These mechanisms are discussed in relation to woody ecosystems. In addition, I propose that stands of young trees on xeric sites behave functionally and mechanistically the same as old stands on mesic sites.

AB Biodiversity conservation "area-selection" strategies include not only trade-offs among society's needs in land-use allocation, but also allocation of economic instruments such as incentives, levies, and biodiversity credits. For these applications, the key property of an area is its "complementarity"-the context-dependent, marginal gain in biodiversity provided by the area. Given that there has been little implementation of whole-sets of areas generated by the popular computer-based selection methods, we suggest that analogous "policy-based algorithms" would be a more effective real-world application of complementarity. Areas would be "selected" for conservation over time as a consequence of policies in which dynamic complementarity values influence application of economic instruments. These integrated biodiversity/economic strategies can use an extended form of complementarity reflecting marginal changes in regional probability of persistence of biodiversity. While probabilistic measures of biodiversity viability have been explored in area-selection for some time, it remains difficult to make viability statements about "all of biodiversity." New approaches that use biodiversity surrogate information for "biodiversity viability analysis" (BVA) can take advantage of a general quantitative biodiversity framework in which pattern-based relationships among areas allow predictions at the species level. A standard assumption of "unimodal" species responses to environmental gradients yields an expected distribution of species in an ordination pattern, and allows sampling of inferred species. Based on environmental correlates, inferred species can be mapped in geographic space, forming distribution fragments. This information, when linked to species persistence models, may allow ongoing calculation of areas' complementarity values. An example illustrates application of these ordination models to museum collection data for lizards from New South Wales (NSW), Australia. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The influence of latitude, substrate type, tidal level, and host shell size on trematode species-richness and prevalence were assessed using published data on 255 samples from 54 species of marine intertidal gastropods. The analyses were performed at different levels of statistical independence: among all samples, across snail species, and using phylogenetically independent contrasts. Repeatability analysis showed that both trematode species richness and prevalence could be considered as snail species traits. Although there was much within-species variation among values obtained from different samples, the among-species variation was much higher. After removing the confounding effect of sample size, positive relationships between trematode prevalence and species richness were observed at all levels of analysis, highlighting the additive nature of trematode infections in snails. The latitude at which samples were collected had a significant effect on trematode species richness across all samples, but this influence disappeared at higher levels of analyses. There was no evidence that host shell size (as well as life-span and population density) was associated with either trematode species richness or prevalence. Tidal level and substrate type (rocky versus soft-sediment) where samples were collected had significant effects on trematode species richness across all samples. These effects could not be verified at higher levels of analyses. Overall, the results point toward an important role of local, small-scale factors in determining the number of trematode species infecting snails and the proportion of infected snails in a population.

AB Aim This paper aims at determining how different floristic elements (e.g. cosmopolitan, tropical, and temperate) change with latitude and major climate factors, and how latitude affects the floristic relationships between East Asia and the other parts of the world.
   Location East Asia from the Arctic to tropical regions, an area crossing over 50degrees of latitudes and covering the eastern part of China, Korea, Japan and the eastern part of Russia.
   Methods East Asia is divided into forty-five geographical regions. Based on the similarity of their world-wide distributional patterns, a total of 2808 indigenous genera of seed plants found in East Asia were grouped into fourteen geographical elements, belonging to three major categories (cosmopolitan, tropical and temperate). The 50degrees-long latitudinal gradient of East Asia was divided into five latitudinal zones, each of c. 10degrees. Phytogeographical relationships of East Asia to latitude and climatic variables were examined based on the forty-five regional floras.
   Results Among all geographical and climatic variables considered, latitude showed the strongest relationship to phytogeographical composition. Tropical genera (with pantropical, amphi-Pacific tropical, palaeotropical, tropical Asia-tropical Australia, tropical Asia-tropical Africa and tropical Asia geographical elements combined) accounted for c. 80% of the total genera at latitude 20degreesN and for c. 0% at latitude 55-60degreesN. In contrast, temperate genera (including holarctic, eastern Asia-North America, temperate Eurasia, temperate Asia, Mediterranean, western Asia to central Asia, central Asia and eastern Asia geographical elements) accounted for 15.5% in the southernmost latitude and for 80% at 55-60degreesN, from where northward the percentage tended to level off. The proportion of cosmopolitan genera increased gradually with latitude from 5% at the southernmost latitude to 21% at 55-60degreesN, where it levelled off northward. In general, the genera present in a more northerly flora are a subset of the genera present in a more southerly flora.
   Main conclusions The large-scale patterns of phytogeography in East Asia are strongly related to latitude, which covaries with several climatic variables such as temperature. Evolutionary processes such as the adaptation of plants to cold climates and current and past land connections are likely responsible for the observed latitudinal patterns.

AB We studied soil and forest floor conditions, regeneration patterns of trees, and forest structure and floristic composition along a gradient of dominance by Pinus spp. in disturbed stands in the highlands of Chiapas, southern Mexico. Seedlings, saplings, and adults of tree species were counted and measured in 2-3 circular plots (1000 m(2) each) in 36 forest stands (a total of 38 tree species). Dominance of broadleaved trees other than Quercus spp. was negatively correlated with basal area of Pinus spp. (P < 0.001). Soils of pine-dominated stands were more compacted, less acidic, and less fertile (lower C. E. C., nitrogen, and organic matter content). Numerous broadleaved trees may depend on an oak-dominated canopy to regenerate, and changes associated to pinelands expansion may compromise their long-term persistence. However, seedlings and saplings of Quercus spp. were abundant in stands with both an oak- or pine-dominated canopy. The results suggest that a plan for sustainable forest utilization in the study region, and in other similar populated tropical highlands, could take advantage of the abundant oak regeneration and coexistence with pines in the canopy.

AB Using a wide range of conditions and plant community types, species diversity was investigated in relation to edaphic and non-edaphic site conditions, management, and biomass characteristics. Both standing biomass and aboveground production were investigated, and their effects compared. Three taxonomic assemblages were studied: (1) vascular plants only, (2) bryophytes also included, (3) terrestrial lichens included as well. Using a multivariate approach, both species richness and evenness could best be explained when only vascular plants were considered, emphasizing the role of taxonomic restrictions. The models best explaining species richness merely required abiotic conditions. This supports recent theories emphasizing the importance of an environmental regulation of the pool of (adapted) species from which the actual species are recruited. Explanatory soil properties were moisture and pH (both unimodal), and the soil available N:P ratio. Plots with large perimeter:area ratios had significantly more species than those with low ratios, indicating the importance of consistency in quadrat shape. Hump-shaped species richness relationships could be identified for both standing biomass and productivity, but they explained only a small part of the variation and were apparent only if soil and management effects were not accounted for. Unimodality (and notably the decreasing phase) was most pronounced when using maximum standing biomass, suggesting that the key factor is competition for light. At intermediate levels of standing biomass, the positive effects of habitat productivity and the negative effects of standing biomass itself are in balance, and high species numbers may be expected. When soil or management variables were allowed in the models, hump-shaped biomass relationships were no longer confirmed, suggesting that such relationships may arise from the covariation of biomass with other factors. Management explained a much larger part of the variation than the hump-shaped biomass relationship, suggesting that mowing and hay removal (both showing independent positive effects) regulate species richness in ways other than solely through the control of maximum standing biomass. Significantly higher evenness values were obtained at sites with low maximum biomass values, but only for the vascular plants. In addition, species evenness was positively related to the frequency of mowing. The numbers of both rare and endangered species were strongly curtailed by high standing biomass values, suggesting that these species are more susceptible to competitive exclusion than others. Through direct as well as indirect effects, management is confirmed to be beneficial not only for general species richness, but also for the occurrence of rare and endangered species.

AB We survey recent results in one-dimensional dynamics and, as an application, we derive rigorous basic dynamical facts for two standard models in population dynamics, the Ricker and the Hassell families. We also informally discuss the concept of chaos in the context of one-dimensional discrete time models.
   First we use the model case of the quadratic family for an informal exposition. We then review precise generic results before turning to the population models.
   Our focus is on typical asymptotic behavior, seen for most initial conditions and for large sets of maps. Parameter sets corresponding to different types of attractors are described. In particular it is shown that maps with strong chaotic properties appear with positive frequency in parameter space in our population models. Natural measures (asymptotic distributions) and their stability properties are considered.

AB Sexual size dimorphism of adults proximately results from a combination of sexually dimorphic growth patterns and selection on growing individuals. Yet, most studies of the evolution of dimorphism have focused on correlates of only adult morphologies. Here we examined the ontogeny of sexual size dimorphism in an isolated population of the house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus). Sexes differed in growth rates and growth duration; in most traits, females grew faster than males, but males grew for a longer period. Sexual dimorphism in bill traits (bill length, width, depth) and in body traits (wing, tarsus, and tail length; mass) developed during different periods of ontogeny. Growth of bill traits was most different between sexes during the juvenile period (after leaving the nest), whereas growth of body traits was most sexually dimorphic during the first few days after hatching. Postgrowth selection on juveniles strongly influenced sexual dimorphism in all traits; in some traits, this selection canceled or reversed dimorphism patterns produced by growth differences between sexes. The net result was that adult sexual dimorphism, to a large degree, was an outcome of selection for survival during juvenile stages. We suggest that previously documented fast and extensive divergence of house finch populations in sexual size dimorphism may be partially produced by distinct environmental conditions during growth in these populations.

AB The distributions of Picea abies (L.) Karst. and other European forest trees have continuously changed since the last glaciation. Static and dynamic bioclimatic simulation models are used to estimate the degree of climatic control operating on the southern Scandinavian range limits of Picea during the last 1000 years. The results show that the range limit has begun to track climate change more closely than in the past, and a future projection predicts a rapid northward contraction of the present limit. Contracting ranges track climate change more closely than do expanding ranges that are limited by seed dispersal. The physiological mechanism of the climatic control is unclear, but Picea planted beyond its current climatic range limit was seriously damaged during a recent storm. Planting trees beyond their natural climatic range limits can only be advised in areas that become suitable for colonization under a changed climate.

AB In this study, data from dry temperate grassland vegetation in Denmark are used to compare the predictive power of gradients obtained by ordination. One of the problems of ordination methods based on weighted averaging, namely the assumption of symmetric, unimodal response curves, is investigated by smoothing species responses to simple and complex gradients respectively.
   It was found that species response types to a pH gradient are diverse and often deviate from a unimodal, symmetrical shape, Bimodal responses were also found, but they disappeared when more influential gradients were considered. Many species showed truncated responses with optima near gradient ends.
   In order to assess the impact of unrealistic response assumptions and reported problems with instability on the performance of DCA, the predictive potentials of measured variables and coenoclines extracted by DCA were compared. Despite field data violating the assumption of unimodal response, DCA was found to extract gradients predicting species abundance better than the environmental variables available. Shortcomings and advantages of indirect and direct methods in plant ecology are discussed.

AB Our purpose was to characterize the relative competitive and phytotoxic potential of two closely related dwarf-shrub species, Empetrum nigrum and E. hermaphroditum, which form clones in a mosaic pattern in post-fire successions of the boreal Forest of northern Sweden. We determined morphological and growth parameters of both species, performed bioassays and chemical analysis, and established field experiments to explore possible differing interference effects entrees by the two species. Both Empetrum species had very similar morphological and growth characteristics. E. hermaphroditum exerted considerably greater negative effects than E. nigrum against Pinus sylvestris and Populus tremula seed and seedlings. These negative effects were related to the different substitution of a bibenzyl in the two species. The effect on seed germination of the two bibenzyls isolated from E. nigrum and E. hermaphroditum was compared with that of other simple phenolics; the latter were found to be inactive, indicating a specific phytotoxic component in the bibenzyls. P. sylvestris seeds planted into clones of both species in he Field revealed that E. hermaphroditum had much stronger inhibitory effects than did E. nigrum and the addition of activated carbon partially reversed these effects. Seed germination, biomass and survival of P. sylvestris after four seasons were significantly lower in E. hermaphroditum- than in E. nigrum-dominated plots. We conclude that while both Empetrum species are superficially very similar morphologically, they have vastly different effects on tree seed germination, seedling establishment and growth. These effects appear to be due, at least in part, to the different chemical profile of the two species.

AB The Australian ghost bat is a large, opportunistic carnivorous species that has undergone a marked range contraction toward more mesic, tropical sites over the past century. Comparison of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences and six nuclear microsatellite loci in 217 ghost bats from nine populations across subtropical and tropical Australia revealed strong population subdivision (mtDNA phi(ST) = 0.80; microsatellites URST = 0.337). Low-latitude (tropical) populations had higher heterozygosity and less marked phylogeographic structure and lower subdivision among sites within regions (within Northern Territory [NT] and within North Queensland [NQ]) than did populations at higher latitudes (subtropical sites; central Queensland [CQ]), although sampling of geographically proximal breeding sites is unavoidably restricted for the latter. Gene flow among populations within each of the northern regions appears to be male biased in that the difference in population subdivision for mtDNA and microsatellites (NT phi(ST) = 0.39, URST = 0.02; NQ phi(ST) = 0.60, URST = -0.03) is greater than expected from differences in the effective population size of haploid versus diploid loci. The high level of population subdivision across the range of the ghost bat contrasts with evidence for high gene flow in other chiropteran species and may be due to narrow physiological tolerances and consequent limited availability of roosts for ghost bats, particularly across the subtropical and relatively arid regions. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that the contraction of the species' range is associated with late Holocene climate change. The extreme isolation among higher-latitude populations may predispose them to additional local extinctions if the processes responsible for the range contraction continue to operate.

AB This study investigates the effects of habitat structure on the ground beetle (Coleoptera, Carabidae) community composition of a regenerating native forest in the Deeside region of northeast Scotland. The composition of the carabid communities of the different habitats ranging from open heather moor to mature stages of pine and birch regeneration was strongly influenced by vegetation composition and structure; specifically,, tree height and density, amount of moss, Calluna + Erica cover, vegetation depth, and soil organic matter content. Two separate communities were apparent in this study, comprising species of woodland and/or shady habitats with dense vegetation, and species of dryer open habitats. Carabid species richness was highest in the open habitats and lowest in the woodland habitats; the presence of young pine trees had Little effect on diversity, but as tree size increased, diversity fell whilst mean catch size increased. It is suggested that to preserve the conservation value of Scottish uplands for carabid beetles whilst restoring native Scottish forests, a mosaic of the different stages of regeneration interspersed with tracts of open moorland is required.

AB 1. The effect of habitat fragmentation was investigated in two adjacent, yet separate, intertidal Zostera marina beds in the Salcombe Estuary, Devon, UK. The seagrass bed on the west bank comprised a continuous meadow of ca. 2.3 ha, whilst the bed on the east bank of the estuary was fragmented into patches of 6-9 m(2).
   2. Three 10 cm diameter core samples for infaunal macroinvertebrates were taken from three stations within each bed. No significant difference was found in univariate community parameters between beds, or in measured seagrass parameters. However, multivariate analysis revealed a significant difference in community composition, due mainly to small changes in species abundance rather than differences in the species present.
   3. The species contributing most to the dissimilarity between the two communities were polychaetes generally associated with unvegetated habitats (e.g. Magelona mirabilis) and found to be more common in the fragmented bed.
   4. A significant difference in median grain size and sorting coefficient was recorded between the two beds, and median grain size was found to be the variable best explaining multivariate community patterns.
   5. The results of the study provide evidence for the effects of habitat fragmentation on the communities associated with seagrass beds, habitats which are of high conservation importance. As the infaunal community is perhaps intuitively the component least likely to be affected by fragmentation at the scale observed, the significant difference in community composition recorded has consequences for more sensitive and high-profile parts of the biota (e.g. fish), and thus for the conservation of seagrass habitats and their associated communities.

AB We present a method for deducing paleoaltitudes that incorporates basic physical principles of atmospheric science and inferences of paleoclimates from plant leaf physiognomy. We exploit the average west-to-east now of the atmosphere at mid-latitudes and a thermodynamically conserved variable in the atmosphere-moist static energy (the combined internal, latent heat, and gravitational potential energy of moist air)-to develop a method that relies on a parameter that varies with height in the atmosphere in a predictable fashion. Because the surface distribution of moist static energy is constrained by atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics, the combined internal and latent heat energies, also known as the moist enthalpy, should only vary with altitude provided we know the distribution of moist static energy. Thus, we avoid having to make assumptions about the mean annual temperature lapse rate, which varies spatially and temporally owing to unpredictable variations in atmospheric water vapor. To estimate a paleoaltitude, therefore, we require (1) a priori knowledge of the spatial distribution of moist static energy for the paleoclimate and (2) the ability to estimate paleoenthalpy for two isochronous locations: one at sea level, the other at some unknown elevation: To achieve this, we investigated the spatial distribution of moist static energy for the present-day climate of North America to estimate the deviations in moist static energy from zonal invariance. In parallel, we quantified the relation between moist enthalpy and plant leaf physiognomy of modern forests. Assuming that such deviations from zonal invariance and such relationships between physiognomy and enthalpy apply to ancient climates and fossil leaves, these investigations yield an uncertainty estimate of +/-910 m in the paleoaltitude difference between two isochronous fossil assemblage locations.

AB The butterfly assemblages of pairs of forest habitats, differing in disturbance level, within the Victoria Mayaro reserve of South-East Trinidad, are described using walk-and-count transects and canopy and understorey fruit traps. The concurrent use of these two butterfly censusing techniques, revealed major but conflicting differences in species accumulation rates under different disturbance conditions. The disturbed evergreen habitat had the significantly highest accumulation rate from walk-and-count data but the significantly lowest from fruit trap data. This reflects the specificity of much of the fruit-feeding guild for closed canopy forest. Disturbed habitats were found to lack a distinct canopy fauna. These results are discussed In light of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Within a region of forest, butterflies were found to be more characteristic of a disturbance level than of a particular forest type, lending weight to the belief that butterfly faunas can be used as bioindicators of forest disturbance. Several restricted geographic range species were not adversely affected by forest disturbance, at these levels of disturbance. The butterfly censuses in this study suggest that the optimal strategy for safeguarding butterfly species richness under natural forest management regimes would be to maintain a mosaic of habitats that included areas of undisturbed primary forest and a network of other forest patches, that varied in management regime and level of disturbance.

AB The effects of temperature and diet on the specific growth rate and food consumption of 1-summer-old Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus were studied. Fish were reared singly in aquaria ;It six different constant temperatures (5, 9, 13, 16, 18 and 20 degrees C). They were fed Neomysis integer or commercial pelleted food for 2 weeks and growth and food consumption were measured. In both experiments, growth rate increased to an optimum at 15 degrees C. Growth rates were high in the range 13-18 degrees C, with no significant (P>0.05) differences between temperatures. No significant (P>0.05) differences in growth were found between fish at 9 and 20 degrees C. There were no effects of diet on size-adjusted growth rates. The growth efficiency decreased with increasing temperature in both treatments. but the decrease was faster in the Neomysis treatment. Charr seemed to compensate for the high water content (79.5%) of Neomysis by having a higher food intake. (C) 1998 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

AB 1. Self-thinning, the reduction in density (N) as a consequence of the increase in the mean weight (W) of individuals, occurs widely in populations of plants when their growth is constrained at high densities, but has only recently been reported to occur within populations of wild mobile animals. It has been suggested that a self-thinning relationship in which the gradient (Delta log(W)/Delta log(N)) approximates to -1.33 describes concomitant changes in W and N within cohorts of a population of anadromous brown trout (sea trout) Salmo trutta throughout their lives as juveniles in fresh water. This apparent self-thinning occurs with no evidence of density-dependent growth or mortality (as measured by key-factor analysis) after the critical period.
   2. Here, the relationship between weights and densities of trout has been examined further. A linear model incorporating log(N), year class and time of year explained 99.5% of the variation in log(W), giving a significantly better fit than incorporating only log(N) and year class. Variation in log(N) explained 85% of the variation in log(W); the addition of year class increased this value by 6% and the addition of monitoring period increased it by a further 8.5%.
   3. The gradients for the relationships between log(W) and log(N) within years varied significantly with time of the year. pooled thinning trajectories for the first winter of the life of trout differed significantly from a gradient of -1.33, while those for the second summer were highly variable and sometimes positive (suggesting that immigration could exceed mortality). Thinning trajectories over the first summer of life were related inversely to the densities of trout at the start of the monitoring period in that summer (N-s), but this relation appeared to approach an asymptote at high values of N-s. The mean of the thinning trajectories for cohorts with high N-s (exceeding 300 fish 60 m(-2)) was not significantly different from -1.33. However, these slopes were shown to result primarily from the presence of high numbers of failed nonterritorial fish early in the summer rather than true thinning throughout the summer.
   4. The apparent absence of a simple consistent thinning relationship after a critical period in the first couple of months of the lives of cohorts can be explained by three factors. First, the total availability of limiting resources, such as space and food, is not constant but changes with the mean size of the trout. Secondly, there is a winter cessation of growth. Thirdly, trout switch to use different habitats during their development. The implications for interpreting thinning relationships for salmonid fishes in general are discussed.

AB Bryophytes and lichens associated with soil crusts were sampled over 500,000 km(2) of rangelands in semi-arid eastern Australia. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to examine the relationships between a range of environmental variables and the distributions of these species from a subset of 130 samples from 87 sites. CCA revealed that bryophytes were related to total annual rainfall, soil pH, calcium carbonate levels, plant cover, texture, organic carbon, and soil texture. Lichens were related to annual rainfall, pH, calcium carbonate levels, plant cover, sheet erosion, organic carbon, and crust cover. Rainfall is a primary determinant of plant cover, which in turn affects light, nutrient availability and litter levels, and therefore bryophyte and lichen distribution. On the basis of the first two ordination axes, bryophytes and lichens clustered infer loose arrangements of species, based on their responses to the environmental variables.

AB Fish assemblages and environmental variables were evaluated from 37 least-disturbed, 1st- through 6th-order streams and springs in the upper Snake River basin, western USA. Data were collected as part of the efforts by the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Quality Assessment Program and the Idaho State University Stream Ecology Center to characterize aquatic biota and associated habitats in least-disturbed coldwater streams. Geographically, the basin comprises four ecoregions. Environmental variables constituting various spatial scales, from watershed characteristics to instream habitat measures, were used to examine distribution patterns in fish assemblages. Nineteen fish species in the families Salmonidae, Cottidae, Cyprinidae, and Catostomidae were collected. Multivariate analyses showed high overlap in stream fish assemblages among the ecoregions. Major environmental factors determining species distributions in the basin were stream gradient, watershed size, conductivity, and percentage of the watershed covered by forest. Lowland streams (below 1,600 m in elevation), located mostly in the Snake River Basin/High Desert ecoregion, displayed different fish assemblages than upland streams (above 2,000 m elevation) in the Northern Rockies, Middle Rockies, and Northern Basin and Range ecoregions. For example, cottids were not found in streams above 2,000 m in elevation. In addition, distinct fish assemblages were found in tributaries upstream and downstream from the large waterfall, Shoshone Falls, on the Snake River. Fish metrics explaining most of the variation among sites included the total number of species, number of native species, number of salmonid species, percent introduced species, percent cottids, and percent salmonids. Springs also exhibited different habitat conditions and fish assemblages than streams. The data suggest that the evolutionary consequences of geographic features and fish species introductions transcend the importance of ecoregion boundaries on fish distributions in the upper Snake River basin.

AB We address effects of large-scale forestry on landscape structure and the structure and composition of boreal bird communities in North Sweden. Specifically, we ask: after controlling for the effect of patch size, forest age and tree species composition, is there any residual effect attributable to the reduction in area of old forest? Pairs of landscape blocks (25 by 25 km) were selected to maximize area difference in human-induced disturbance, clear-cut as opposed to semi-natural old forest.
   Median distance to natural edge (wetlands, open water) from randomly selected points in forest was 250 and 200 m in high and low impact landscapes, respectively, indicating a high degree of 'natural' fragmentation of the pristine boreal landscape in the area. By contrast, median distance to clear-cut in uncut forest was 750 and 100 m, respectively. Clear-cuts in high impact landscapes were disproportionally more common in areas with contiguous forest land than in areas with spatially disjunct forest, implicating that forestry increases natural fragmentation of the landscape by subdividing larger forest tracts.
   Point counts along forestry roads showed that species richness and relative abundance of forest birds were higher in landscapes with low forestry impact. These differences can partly be explained by differences in age composition of forest and composition of tree species. After controlling for patch size, forest age and tree species composition, a significant effect of forestry impact remained for Sibirian species and the Tree pipit Anthus trivialis. Our results thus imply that this group of species and the Tree pipit may be sensitive to forest fragmentation.
   In contrast to previous Finnish studies, we found relatively small negative effects on relative abundance of species hypothesized to be negatively affected by large-scale clear-cutting forestry. However, our picture of the present does not contradict results from Finnish long-term population studies. Five factors may account for this: 1) clear-cut areas are not permanently transformed into other land use types, 2) planted forests are not completely inhabitable for species preferring older forest, 3) the majority of species in the regional pool are habitat generalists, 4) the region studied is still extensively covered with semi-natural forest, and 5) our study area is relatively close to contiguous boreal forest in Russia, a potential source area for taiga species.

AB The diatom composition in surface sediments from 119 northern Swedish lakes was studied to examine the relationship with lake-water pH, alkalinity, and colour. Diatom-based predictive models, using weighted-averaging (WA) regression and calibration, partial least squares (PLS) regression and calibration, and weighted-averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) regression and calibration, were developed for inferences of water chemistry conditions. The non-linear response between the diatom assemblages and pH and alkalinity was best modelled by weighted-averaging methods. The lowest prediction error for pH was obtained using weighted averaging, with or without tolerance downweighting. For alkalinity there was still some information in the residual structure after extracting the first weighted-averaging component, which resulted in a slight improvement of predictions when using a two component WA-PLS model. The best colour predictions were obtained using a two component PLS model. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the prediction errors, with some characteristics of the training set included as passive variables, was performed to compare the results for the different alkalinity predictive models. The results indicate that calibration techniques utilizing more than one component (PLS and WA-PLS) can improve the predictions for lakes with diatom taxa that have broad tolerances. Furthermore, we show that WA-PLS performs best compared with the other techniques for those lakes that have a high relative abundance of the most dominant taxa and a corresponding low sample heterogeneity.

AB The relationship between the weed communities and environmental variables such as soil, crop. and management was investigated in two provinces of Canada. The frequencies of weed species were recorded in cereal and oilseed fields in Saskatchewan (2244 fields over 4 years) and Manitoba (864 fields over 3 years), Canada. Information on some of the physical characteristics of the fields and on the management practices imposed on them was also collected, in part by questionnaire. The two kinds of data were ordinated together using canonical correspondence analysis to assess the relationships between the species and the environmental variables. In the Saskatchewan data. there was a clear and consistent separation of the species into groups along an axis correlated with soil zone and the associated climatic gradient. In the Manitoba data. the same groups of species did not separate as clearly or as consistently. although geographic region was a major determinant of the weed communities. The greater variability may be due to the fact that the gradient of soil types is much more restricted in Manitoba and not as closely correlated with climatic conditions. In both provinces, culture practices were less important as correlates of the weed community composition than soil type or, to a certain extent, the previous crop.

AB Ecological niche models (ENMs) are widely used statistical methods to estimate various types of species niches. After lecturing several editions of introductory courses on ENMs and reviewing numerous manuscripts on this subject, we frequently faced some recurrent mistakes: 1) presence-background modelling methods, such as Maxent or ENFA, are used as if they were pseudo-absence methods; 2) spatial autocorrelation is confused with clustering of species records; 3) environmental variables are used with a higher spatial resolution than species records; 4) correlations between variables are not taken into account; 5) machine-learning models are not replicated; 6) topographical variables are calculated from unprojected coordinate systems, and; 7) environmental variables are downscaled by resampling. Some of these mistakes correspond to student misunderstandings and are corrected before publication. However, other errors can be found in published papers. We explain here why these approaches are erroneous and we propose ways to improve them.

AB One of the greatest challenges humanity faces is feeding the world's human population in a sustainable, nutritious, equitable and ethical way under a changing climate. Urgent transformations are needed that allow farmers to adapt and develop while also being climate resilient and contributing minimal emissions. This paper identifies several illustrative adaptation and development pathways, recognising the variety of starting points of different types of farmers and the ways their activities intersect with global trends, such as population growth, climate change, rapid urbanisation dietary changes, competing land uses and the emergence of new technologies. The feasibility of some pathways depends on factors such as farm size and land consolidation. For other pathways, particular infrastructure, technology, access to credit and market access or collective action are required. The most viable pathway for some farmers may be to exit agriculture altogether, which itself requires careful management and planning. While technology offers hope and opportunity, as a disruptor, it also risks maladaptations and can create tradeoffs and exacerbate inequalities, especially in the context of an uncertain future. For both the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2015 Paris Agreement to be achieved, a mix of levers that combine policy, technology, education and awareness-raising, dietary shifts and financial/economic mechanisms is required, attending to multiple time dimensions, to assist farmers along different pathways. Vulnerable groups such as women and the youth must not be left behind. Overall, strong good governance is needed at multiple levels, combining top-down and bottom-up processes.

AB Understanding and predicting the ecological consequences of different management alternatives is becoming increasingly important to support environmental management decisions. Ecological models could contribute to such predictions, but in the past this was often not the case. Ecological models are often developed within research projects but are rarely used for practical applications. In this synthesis paper, we discuss how to strengthen the role of ecological modeling in supporting environmental management decisions with a focus on methodological aspects. We address mainly ecological modellers but also potential users of modeling results. Various modeling approaches can be used to predict the response of ecosystems to anthropogenic interventions, including mechanistic models, statistical models, and machine learning approaches. Regardless of the chosen approach, we outline how to better align the modeling to the decision making process, and identify six requirements that we believe are important to increase the usefulness of ecological models for management support, especially if management decisions need to be justified to the public. These cover: (i) a mechanistic understanding regarding causality, (ii) alignment of model input and output with the management decision, (iii) appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions, (iv) uncertainty quantification, (v) sufficient predictive performance, and (vi) transparent communication. We discuss challenges and synthesize suggestions for addressing these points.

AB While biodiversity loss continues globally, assessments of regional and local change over time have been equivocal. Here, we assess changes in plant species richness and beta diversity over 140 years at the level of regions within a country. Using 19th-century flora censuses for 14 Danish regions as a baseline, we overcome previous criticisms concerning short time series and neglect of completely altered habitats. We find that species composition has changed dramatically and directionally across all regions. Substantial species losses were more than offset by large gains, resulting in a net increase in species richness in all regions. The occupancy of initially widespread species increased, while initially rare species lost terrain. These changes were accompanied by strong biotic homogenization; i.e. regions are more similar now than they were 140 years ago. Species declining in Denmark were found to be in similar decline all over Northern Europe.

AB Identifying which ecological and life history traits influence a species' tolerance to urbanization is critical to understanding the trajectory of biodiversity in an increasingly urbanizing world. There is evidence for a wide array of contrasting patterns for single trait associations with urbanization. In a continental-scale analysis, incorporating 477 species and >5 000 000 bird observations, we developed a novel and scalable methodology that evaluated the ecological and life history traits which most influence a species' adaptability to persist in urban environments. Specifically, we assigned species-specific scores based on continuous measures of response to urbanization, using VIIRS night-time light values (i.e. radiance) as a proxy for urbanization. We identified generalized, phylogenetically controlled patterns: bird species which are generalists (i.e. large niche breadth), with large clutch size, and large residual brain size are among the most urban-tolerant bird species. Conversely, specialized feeding strategies (i.e. insectivores and granivores) were negatively associated with urbanization. Enhancement and persistence of avian biodiversity in urban environments probably relies on protecting, maintaining and restoring diverse habitats serving a range of life history strategies.

AB Poor conditions during early development can initiate trade-offs that favour current survival at the expense of somatic maintenance and subsequently, future reproduction. However, the mechanisms that link early and late life-history are largely unknown. Recently it has been suggested that telomeres, the nucleoprotein structures at the terminal end of chromosomes, could link early-life conditions to lifespan and fitness. In wild purple-crowned fairy-wrens, we combined measurements of nestling telomere length (TL) with detailed life-history data to investigate whether early-life TL predicts fitness prospects. Our study differs from previous studies in the completeness of our fitness estimates in a highly philopatric population. The association between TL and survival was age-dependent with early-life TL having a positive effect on lifespan only among individuals that survived their first year. Early-life TL was not associated with the probability or age of gaining a breeding position. Interestingly, early-life TL was positively related to breeding duration, contribution to population growth and lifetime reproductive success because of their association with lifespan. Thus, early-life TL, which reflects growth, accumulated early-life stress and inherited TL, predicted fitness in birds that reached adulthood but not noticeably among fledglings. These findings suggest that a lack of investment in somatic maintenance during development particularly affects late life performance. This study demonstrates that factors in early-life are related to fitness prospects through lifespan, and suggests that the study of telomeres may provide insight into the underlying physiological mechanisms linking early- and late-life performance and trade-offs across a lifetime.

AB Allopatric speciation requiring an unbroken period of geographical isolation has been the standard model of neo-Darwinism. While doubts have been repeatedly raised, strict allopatry without any gene flow remains a plausible mechanism in most cases. To rigorously reject strict allopatry, genomic sequences superimposed on the geological records of a well-delineated geographical barrier are necessary. The Strait of Malacca, narrowly connecting the Pacific and Indian Ocean coasts, serves at different times either as a geographical barrier or a conduit of gene flow for coastal/marine species. We surveyed 1700 plants from 29 populations of 5 common mangrove species by large-scale DNA sequencing and added several whole-genome assemblies. Speciation between the two oceans is driven by cycles of isolation and gene flow due to the fluctuations in sea level leading to the opening/closing of the Strait to ocean currents. Because the time required for speciation in mangroves is longer than the isolation phases, speciation in these mangroves has proceeded through many cycles of mixing-isolation-mixing, or MIM, cycles. The MIM mechanism, by relaxing the condition of no gene flow, can promote speciation in many more geographical features than strict allopatry can. Finally, the MIM mechanism of speciation is also efficient, potentially yielding m(n) (m > 1) species after n cycles.

AB Biodiversity extinction thresholds are abrupt declines in biological diversity that occur with habitat loss, associated with a decline in habitat connectivity. Matrix quality should influence the location of thresholds along habitat loss gradients through its effects on connectivity; however these relationships have seldom been explored empirically. Using field data from 23 independent 1254 ha landscapes in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we evaluated how tropical avian biodiversity responds to native forest loss within habitat patches embedded either in homogeneous pasture matrix context (with a high proportion of cattle pastures), and heterogeneous coffee matrix context (with high abundance of sun coffee plantations). We considered taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity, and tested if matrix type and choice of diversity metric influenced the location of biodiversity thresholds along the forest cover gradient. We found that matrix type postponed the abrupt loss of taxonomic diversity, from a threshold of 35% of forest cover in homogeneous pasture matrix to 19% in heterogeneous coffee matrix. Phylogenetic diversity responded similarly, with thresholds at 30 and 24% in homogeneous-pasture and heterogeneous-coffee matrices, respectively, but no relationship with forest cover was detected when corrected for richness correlation. Despite the absence of a threshold for functional diversity in either matrix types, a strong decline below 20% of habitat amount was detected. Finally, below 20% native habitat loss, all diversity indices demonstrated abrupt declines, indicating that even higher-quality matrices cannot postpone diversity loss below this critical threshold. These results highlight that taxonomic diversity is a more sensitive index of biodiversity loss in fragmented landscapes, which may be used as a benchmark to prevent subsequent functional and phylogenetic losses. Furthermore, increasing matrix quality appears an efficient conservation strategy to maintain higher biodiversity levels in fragmented landscapes over a larger range of habitat loss.

AB The genetic basis of parallel evolution of similar species is of great interest in evolutionary biology. In the adaptive radiation of Lake Victoria cichlid fishes, sister species with either blue or red -back male nuptial coloration have evolved repeatedly, often associated with shallower and deeper water, respectively. One such case is blue and red -backed Pundamilia species, for which we recently showed that a young species pair may have evolved through "hybrid parallel speciation". Coalescent simulations su: lested that the older species P. pundamilia (blue) and P. nyererei (red -back) admixed in the Mwanza Gulf and that new "nyererei-like" and "pundamilia-like" species evolved from the admixed population. Here, we use genome scans to study the genomic architecture of differentiation, and assess the influence of hybridization on the evolution of the younger species pair. For each of the two species pairs, we find over 300 genomic regions, widespread across the genome, which are highly differentiated. A subset of the most strongly differentiated regions of the older pair are also differentiated in the younger pair. These shared differentiated regions often show parallel allele frequency differences, consistent with the hypothesis that admixture -derived alleles were targeted by divergent selection in the hybrid population. However, two-thirds of the genomic regions that are highly differentiated between the younger species are not highly differentiated between the older species, sul:esting independent evolutionary responses to selection pressures. Our analyses reveal how divergent selection on admixture -derived genetic variation can facilitate new speciation events.

AB Over the past 15 years, 3 million hectares of forests have been converted into shrublands or grasslands in the Mediterranean countries of the European Union. Fire and drought are the main drivers underlying this deforestation. Here we present a conceptual framework for the process of fire-induced deforestation based on the interactive effects of fire and drought across three hierarchical scales: resistance in individuals, resilience in populations, and transitions to a new state. At the individual plant level, we review the traits that confer structural and physiological resistance, as well as allow for resprouting capacity: deforestation can be initiated when established individuals succumb to fire. After individuals perish, the second step toward deforestation requires a limited resilience from the population, that is, a reduced ability of that species to regenerate after fire. If individuals die after fire and the population fails to recover, then a transition to a new state will occur. We document trade-offs between drought survival and fire survival, as embolism resistance is negatively correlated with fire tolerance in conifers and leaf shedding or drought deciduousness, a process that decreases water consumption at the peak of the dry season, temporally increases crown flammability. Propagule availability and establishment control resilience after mortality, but different hypotheses make contrasting predictions on the drivers of post-fire establishment. Mycorrhizae play an additional role in modulating the response by favoring recovery through amelioration of the nutritional and water status of resprouts and new germinants. So far, resprouter species such as oaks have provided a buffer against deforestation in forests dominated by obligate seeder trees, when present in high enough density in the understory. While diversifying stands with resprouters is often reported as advantageous for building resilience, important knowledge gaps exist on how floristic composition interacts with stand flammability and on the "resprouter exhaustion syndrome," a condition where pre-fire drought stress, or short fire return intervals, seriously restrict post-fire resprouting. Additional attention should be paid to the onset of novel fire environments in previously fire-free environments, such as high altitude forests, and management actions need to accommodate this complexity to sustain Mediterranean forests under a changing climate.

AB Biochar (BC) amendments may be suitable to increase the ecosystems resistance to drought due to their positive effects on soil water retention and availability. We investigated the effect of BC in situ ageing on water availability and microbial parameters of a grassland soil. We used soil containing C-13 labeled BC and determined its water holding capacity, microbial biomass and activity during a 3 months incubation under optimum and drought conditions. Our incubation experiment comprised three treatments: soil without BC (Control), soil containing aged BC (BCaged) and soil containing fresh BC (BCfresh), under optimum soil water (pF 1.8) and drought conditions (pF 3.5). Under optimum water as well as drought conditions, soils containing BC showed higher soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization as compared to control soil. Moreover, BC effects on the soil water regime increase upon in situ aging. Native SOC mineralization increased most for soils containing BCaged. The BCaged led to improved C use under drought as compared to the other treatments. We conclude that BC addition to soils can ameliorate their water regime, especially under drought conditions. This beneficial effect of BC increases upon its aging, which also improved native substrate availability.

AB The multispecies network coalescent (MSNC) is a stochastic process that captures how gene trees grow within the branches of a phylogenetic network. Coupling the MSNC with a stochastic mutational process that operates along the branches of the gene trees gives rise to a generative model of how multiple loci from within and across species evolve in the presence of both incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and reticulation (e.g., hybridization). We report on a Bayesian method for sampling the parameters of this generative model, including the species phylogeny, gene trees, divergence times, and population sizes, from DNA sequences of multiple independent loci. We demonstrate the utility of our method by analyzing simulated data and reanalyzing an empirical data set. Our results demonstrate the significance of not only coestimating species phylogenies and gene trees, but also accounting for reticulation and ILS simultaneously. In particular, we show that when gene flow occurs, our method accurately estimates the evolutionary histories, coalescence times, and divergence times. Tree inference methods, on the other hand, underestimate divergence times and overestimate coalescence times when the evolutionary history is reticulate. While the MSNC corresponds to an abstract model of "intermixture," we study the performance of the model and method on simulated data generated under a gene flow model. We show that the method accurately infers the most recent time at which gene flowoccurs. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the new method to a 106-locus yeast data set.

AB Humanity is causing dramatic changes to the Earth, and we may be entering a human-dominated era referred to as the Anthropocene. Mapping the human footprint and assessing the spatial layout and effectiveness of protected areas facilitate sustainable development. As the core region of the third pole, Tibet is an important area for biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services. In this study, five categories of human pressure were summed cumulatively to map the human footprint in Tibet for 1990 and 2010, and the spatial relationship between the human footprint and national and provincial nature reserves (NRs) in Tibet was analyzed. In addition, the human footprint map was also used to evaluate the effectiveness of national and provincial NRs for reducing the impact of human activities. A comprehensive assessment was undertaken for the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon (YZGC) NR. There were several key findings from this study. First, the human footprint scores (HFS) in Tibet for 1990 and 2010 were low, and increased by 32.35% during 1990-2010, which was greater than the global value of 9% for 1993-2009, indicating that Tibet is seriously threatened by human pressure. Grazing intensity and road disturbance intensity contributed significantly to the increase in the HFS. Second, the average HFS for 1990 in NRs was lower than that for the entire Tibet, but the spatial layout and extent of some reserves (e.g., the Qomolangma NR) needs to be optimized further. Third, the establishment of NRs in Tibet was effective in reducing human activities. No leakage phenomena were identified in the regions surrounding the YZGC reserve. However, the management of NRs in Tibet is still challenging in terms of reducing human activities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aims
   Plant invasions represent a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying community assembly rules and species distribution patterns. While a superior competitive ability has often been proposed as a major driver of successful plant invasions, its significance depends crucially on the timing of any competitive interaction. We assess whether a mismatch in germination phenology can favor the establishment of alien species, allowing them to exploit vacant niches where competition is low. As well as having important effects on the survival, growth and fitness of a species, asymmetric competition and potential soil legacies resulting from early or late germination can also impact on species recruitment. However, early or late germination comes at a cost, increases the risks of exposure to unfavorable conditions and requires an enhanced abiotic resistance if it is to lead to successful establishment.
   Important Findings
   While there are several anecdotal accounts of early and late germination for invasive species, there are limited comparative data with resident species growing under natural conditions. Available evidence from grassland communities indicates that a short-term germination advantage or priority (few days/weeks) provides invasive species with a strong competitive advantage over native species and is a critical factor in many invasions. While the exploitation of periods of low competition is a plausible mechanism for the successful establishment of many invasive plants, direct evidence for this strategy is still scarce. This is particularly true with regard to the exploitation of late germination niches. Consequently, long-term comparative monitoring of the germination phenology of invasive and native plants in situ is needed to assess its significance in a range of ecosystems and its impact on community dynamics.

AB Dietary polyphenols are associated with a wide range of health benefits, protecting against chronic diseases and promoting healthy aging. Dietary polyphenols offer a complementary approach to the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), a group of common chronic intestinal inflammation syndromes for which there is no cure. Tomato is widely consumed but its content of polyphenols is low. We developed a tomato variety, Bronze, enriched in three distinct classes of polyphenols: flavonols, anthocyanins, and stilbenoids. Using Bronze tomatoes as a dietary supplement as well as Indigo (high anthocyanins and flavonols), ResTom (high stilbenoids) and wild-type tomatoes, we examined the effects of the different polyphenols on the host gut microbiota, inflammatory responses, and the symptoms of chronic IBD, in a mouse model. Bronze tomatoes significantly impacted the symptoms of IBD. A similar result was observed using diets supplemented with red grape skin containing flavonols, anthocyanins, and stilbenoids, suggesting that effective protection is provided by different classes of polyphenols acting synergistically.

AB The high tropical Andes host one of the richest alpine floras of the world, with exceptionally high levels of endemism and turnover rates. Yet, little is known about the patterns and processes that structure altitudinal and latitudinal variation in plant community diversity. Herein we present the first continental-scale comparative study of plant community diversity on summits of the tropical Andes. Data were obtained from 792 permanent vegetation plots (1 m(2)) within 50 summits, distributed along a 4200 km transect; summit elevations ranged between 3220 and 5498 m a.s.l. We analyzed the plant community data to assess: 1) differences in species abundance patterns in summits across the region, 2) the role of geographic distance in explaining floristic similarity and 3) the importance of altitudinal and latitudinal environmental gradients in explaining plant community composition and richness. On the basis of species abundance patterns, our summit communities were separated into two major groups: Puna and Paramo. Floristic similarity declined with increasing geographic distance between study-sites, the correlation being stronger in the more insular Paramo than in the Puna (corresponding to higher species turnover rates within the Paramo). Ordination analysis (CCA) showed that precipitation, maximum temperature and rock cover were the strongest predictors of community similarity across all summits. Generalized linear model (GLM) quasi-Poisson regression indicated that across all summits species richness increased with maximum air temperature and above-ground necromass and decreased on summits where scree was the dominant substrate. Our results point to different environmental variables as key factors for explaining vertical and latitudinal species turnover and species richness patterns on high Andean summits, offering a powerful tool to detect contrasting latitudinal and altitudinal effects of climate change across the tropical Andes.

AB Globalisation has resulted in the movement of organisms outside their natural range, often with negative ecological and economic consequences. As cities are hubs of anthropogenic activities, with both highly transformed and disturbed environments, these areas are often the first point of entry for alien species. We compiled a global database of cities with more than one million inhabitants that data had on alien species occurrence. We then identified the most prominent pathways of introduction and vectors of spread of alien species in these cities. Most species were intentionally introduced to cities and were released or escaped from confinement. The majority of alien species then spread within cities through natural means (primarily unaided dispersal). Pathway prominence varied across the taxonomic groups of alien species: the most prominent pathway for plants and vertebrates was the escape pathway; for invertebrates the stowaway and contaminant pathways were most likely to facilitate introductions. For some organisms, pathway prominence varied with the geographical and climatic characteristics of the city. The characteristics of the cities also influenced the prominence of vectors of spread for alien species. Preventing the natural spread of alien species within cities, and into adjacent natural environments will be, at best, difficult. To prevent invasions, both the intentional and unintentional introduction of potentially harmful alien species to cities must be prevented. The pathways of introduction and vectors of spread identified here should be prioritised for management.

AB Given that plant growth is often water-limited in grasslands, it has been proposed that projected increases in precipitation could increase plant productivity and carbon sequestration. However, the existing evidence for this hypothesis comes primarily from observational studies along natural precipitation gradients or from short-term manipulative experiments. It remains unclear whether long-term increased precipitation persistently stimulates grassland productivity. In the world's largest remaining temperate grassland, we found that experimentally increased precipitation enhanced net primary production, soil-available nitrogen and foliar nitrogen concentrations during the first six years, but it ceased to do so in the following four years, unless nitrogen was simultaneously added with water. The N-15 enrichment of plant and soil nitrogen pools in later years indicates increased nitrogen losses, which exacerbated nitrogen limitation and ended the stimulation of productivity by increased precipitation. Changes in species abundance might have contributed little to the changes in water treatment effects. Our study demonstrates that the long-term response of grassland ecosystems to increased precipitation will be mediated by nitrogen availability. Our results also point to a shift from co-limitation by water and nitrogen early to perhaps limitation by nitrogen only later in this temperate grassland, highlighting significant variations in the type of resource limitation induced by climate change.

AB An increasing proportion of the world's poor is rearing livestock today, and the global livestock population is growing. Livestock predation by large carnivores and their retaliatory killing is becoming an economic and conservation concern. A common recommendation for carnivore conservation and for reducing predation on livestock is to increase wild prey populations based on the assumption that the carnivores will consume this alternative food. Livestock predation, however, could either reduce or intensify with increases in wild prey depending on prey choice and trends in carnivore abundance. We show that the extent of livestock predation by the endangered snow leopard Panthera uncia intensifies with increases in the density of wild ungulate prey, and subsequently stabilizes. We found that snow leopard density, estimated at seven sites, was a positive linear function of the density of wild ungulates-the preferred prey-and showed no discernible relationship with livestock density. We also found that modelled livestock predation increased with livestock density. Our results suggest that snow leopard conservation would benefit from an increase in wild ungulates, but that would intensify the problem of livestock predation for pastoralists. The potential benefits of increased wild prey abundance in reducing livestock predation can be overwhelmed by a resultant increase in snow leopard populations. Snow leopard conservation efforts aimed at facilitating increases in wild prey must be accompanied by greater assistance for better livestock protection and offsetting the economic damage caused by carnivores.

AB According to the habitat amount hypothesis the species richness in a sample site should increase with the habitat amount in the local landscape around the sample site. On the other hand, size and isolation of the patch containing the sample site should have no effect on species richness if the habitat amount in the local landscape remains constant. We tested these predictions using a small mammal dataset recorded in 100 transects in a savanna region of Brazil. We used generalized linear models considering the predictors - habitat amount, patch size, and patch isolation - together and singly, using subsets of data to control for correlations between them. We measured the habitat amount in 10 nested circles ranging in radius from 250 m to 6000 m around each transect. The scale of effect was the radius with the strongest estimated correlation between habitat amount and species richness. Our results indicate that habitat amount is the most important single predictor of species richness. The habitat amount effect was always positive and large. In general, patch size and patch isolation had no effect on species richness after controlling for the effect of habitat amount. The results are consistent with the habitat amount hypothesis, and suggest that habitat amount can be used in place of patch size and isolation in predicting small mammal species richness. This simplifies information needs by landscape managers as it replaces two predictors with one. Our results also support the use of estimated dispersal distance as a way of determining the appropriate landscape scale of effect. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many conservation strategies identify a narrow subset of genotypes, species, or geographic locations that are predicted to be favored under different sce-narios of future climate change. However, a focus on predicted winners, which might not prove to be correct, risks undervaluing the balance of biological diversity from which climate-change winners could otherwise emerge. Drawing on ecology, evolutionary biology, and portfolio theory, we propose a conservation approach designed to promote adaptation that is less dependent on uncertain predictions about the identity of winners and losers. By designing actions to facilitate numerous opportunities for selection across biological and environmental conditions, we can allow nature to pick the winners and increase the probability that ecosystems continue to provide services to humans and other species.

AB Aim Plant distributions and vegetation dynamics underpin key global phenomena, including biogeochemical cycling, ecosystem productivity and terrestrial biodiversity patterns. Aggregated and remotely collected 'big data' are required to forecast the effects of global change on plant communities. We synthesize advances in developing and exploiting big data in global change plant ecology, and identify challenges to their effective use in global change studies.
   Location Global.
   Methods We explored databases, catalogues and registries with respect to their accessibility, geographical and taxonomic extent, sample bias and other types of uncertainty, from the perspective both users and contributors. We identified four kinds of big data needed to predict the impacts of global change on plant populations and communities using spatially explicit models: remotely sensed and other environmental maps, species occurrence records, community composition (plots) and species traits, especially demographics.
   Results Digital environmental maps, including remotely sensed data, are the most mature class of big data discussed herein whereby protocols for archiving, discovering and analysing them have developed over three decades. Species locality records are being aggregated into databases that are easy to search and access, and while methods for addressing uncertainties are a major research focus, better spatial representation is still needed. Plot data from inventories have tremendous potential for monitoring and modelling the impacts of global change on plant communities but tend to be restricted to forests or concentrated in certain geographical areas. Ongoing efforts to aggregate plot and trait data from multiple sources are challenged by their heterogeneous coverage, attributes and protocols and a lack of data standards.
   Main conclusions Future goals include developing systematic frameworks for selecting geospatial data, improving tools for assessing the quality of species occurrence records and increased aggregation and discoverability of plot and trait data. Aggregated data collected by scientists, not sensors, provide more meaningful insights when data collectors are involved in analysis.

AB Aims: Phytosociological classification of fen vegetation (Scheuchzerio palustris-Caricetea fuscae class) differs among European countries. Here we propose a unified vegetation classification of European fens at the alliance level, provide unequivocal assignment rules for individual vegetation plots, identify diagnostic species of fen alliances, and map their distribution.
   Location: Europe, western Siberia and SE Greenland.
   Methods: 29 049 vegetation-plot records of fens were selected from databases using a list of specialist fen species. Formal definitions of alliances were created using the presence, absence and abundance of Cocktail-based species groups and indicator species. DCA visualized the similarities among the alliances in an ordination space. The ISOPAM classification algorithm was applied to regional subsets with homogeneous plot size to check whether the classification based on formal definitions matches the results of unsupervised classifications.
   Results: The following alliances were defined: Caricion viridulo-trinervis (sub-halophytic Atlantic dune-slack fens), Caricion davallianae (temperate calcareous fens), Caricion atrofusco-saxatilis (arcto-alpine calcareous fens), Stygio-Caricion limosae (boreal topogenic brown-moss fens), Sphagno warnstorfii-Tomentypnion nitentis (Sphagnum-brown-moss rich fens), Saxifrago-Tomentypnion (continental to boreo-continental nitrogen-limited brown-moss rich fens), Narthecion scardici (alpine fens with Balkan endemics), Caricion stantis (arctic brown-moss rich fens), Anagallido tenellae-Juncion bulbosi (Ibero-Atlantic moderately rich fens), Drepanocladion exannulati (arcto-boreal-alpine non-calcareous fens), Caricion fuscae (temperate moderately rich fens), Sphagno-Caricion canescentis (poor fens) and Scheuchzerion palustris (dystrophic hollows). The main variation in the species composition of European fens reflected site chemistry (pH, mineral richness) and sorted the plots from calcareous and extremely rich fens, through rich and moderately rich fens, to poor fens and dystrophic hollows. ISOPAM classified regional subsets according to this gradient, supporting the ecological meaningfulness of this classification concept on both the regional and continental scale. Geographic/macroclimatic variation was reflected in the second most important gradient.
   Conclusions: The pan-European classification of fen vegetation was proposed and supported by the data for the first time. Formal definitions developed here allow consistent and unequivocal assignment of individual vegetation plots to fen alliances at the continental scale.

AB Background and Aims It is frequently assumed that phenotypic plasticity can be very advantageous for plants, because it may increase environmental tolerance (fitness homeostasis). This should, however, only hold for plastic responses that are adaptive, i. e. increase fitness. Numerous studies have shown shade-induced increases in specific leaf area (SLA), and there is wide consensus that this plastic response optimizes light capture and thus has to be adaptive. However, it has rarely been tested whether this is really the case.
   Methods In order to identify whether SLA plasticity does contribute to the maintenance of high biomass of plant species under shaded conditions, a meta-analytical approach was employed. The data set included 280 species and 467 individual studies from 32 publications and two unpublished experiments.
   Key Results Plants increased their SLA by 55.4 % on average when shaded, while they decreased their biomass by 59.9 %. Species with a high SLA under high-light control conditions showed a significantly greater ability to maintain biomass production under shade overall. However, in contrast to the expectation of a positive relationship between SLA plasticity and maintenance of plant biomass, the results indicated that species with greater SLA plasticity were less able to maintain biomass under shade.
   Conclusions Although a high SLA per se contributes to biomass homeostasis, there was no evidence that plasticity in SLA contributes to this. Therefore, it is argued that some of the plastic changes that are frequently thought to be adaptive might simply reflect passive responses to the environment, or result as by-products of adaptive plastic responses in other traits.

AB Eutrophication can initiate sudden ecosystem state change either by slowly pushing lakes toward a catastrophic tipping point beyond which self-reinforcing mechanisms establish an alternate stable state, or through rapid but persistent changes in external forcing mechanisms. In principle, these processes can be distinguished by determining whether historical changes in focal parameters (phytoplankton) exhibit transient (rising then declining) or continuously-elevated variability characteristic of alternate stable states or a paradox of enrichment, respectively. We tested this hypothesis in the south basin of Lake Winnipeg, Canada, a site with intense blooms of N-2-fixing cyanobacteria since 1990, but for which little is known of earlier limnological conditions, causes of eutrophication, or whether modern conditions represent a alternate stable state. Paleolimnological analysis revealed that the basin was naturally mesotrophic (approximate to 15-20 g P L-1) with diazotrophic cyanobacteria, productive diatoms, and phosphorus-rich sediments. Eutrophication accelerated during ca.1900-ca.1990, when sedimentary nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon contents increased 10-50%, N-15 enriched 3-4 parts per thousand, and concentrations of many fossil pigments increased 300-500%. Nearly 75% of 20(th) century variability was explained by concomitant increases in production of livestock and crops, but not by climate. After ca.1990, the basin exhibited a rapid threefold increase in akinetes from Aphanizomenon and Anabaena spp. and 50% declines in pigments from chlorophytes and cyanobacteria because of sudden socio-economic reorganization of agriculture. Phytoplankton variability quantified using Gaussian generalized additive models increased continuously since the onset of agriculture for bloom-forming taxa, did not decline after state change, and suggested that recovery should not be affected by stable-state hysteresis.

AB Public opposition is one of the main political, and less predictable, risks of large-scale energy infrastructure projects. External stakeholder management has become indispensable to the governance of risk in such projects. We integrate insights on public engagement from policy and planning studies with the field of project management to contribute to the governance of risk. We present Q methodology as a congruent method for stakeholder analysis that allows for anticipation of unforeseen stakeholder issues or concerns and to kick-off a participatory procedure with external stakeholders. We present an illustration of Q methodology results of a Dutch shale gas exploration project. If used in the stakeholder management process, this method can help reveal perspectives beneficial for both the governance of risks and the identification of opportunities to create socially valued, successful projects.

AB In coastal habitats artificial structures typically support lower biodiversity and can support greater numbers of non-native and opportunistic species than natural rocky reefs. Eco-engineering experiments are typically trialed to succeed; but arguably as much is learnt from failure than from success. Our goal was to trial a generic, cost effective, eco-engineering technique that could be incorporated into rock armouring anywhere in the world. Artificial rock pools were created from manipulated concrete between boulders on the exposed and sheltered sides of a causeway. Experimental treatments were installed in locations where they were expected to fail and compared to controls installed in locations in which they were expected to succeed. Control pools were created lower on the structure where they were immersed on every tidal cycle; experimental pools were created above mean high water spring tide which were only immersed on spring tides. We hypothesised that lower and exposed pools would support significantly higher taxon and functional diversity than upper and sheltered pools. The concrete pools survived the severe winter storms of 2013/14. After 12 months, non-destructive sampling revealed significantly higher mean taxon and functional richness in lower pools than upper pools on the exposed side only. After 24 months the sheltered pools had become inundated with sediments, thus failing to function as rock pools as intended. Destructive sampling on the exposed side revealed significantly higher mean functional richness in lower than upper pools. However, a surprisingly high number of taxa colonised the upper pools leading to no significant difference in mean taxon richness among shore heights. A high number of rare taxa in the lower pools led to total taxon richness being almost twice that of upper pools. These findings highlight that even when expected to fail concrete pools supported diverse assemblages, thus representing an affordable, replicable means of enhancing biodiversity on a variety of artificial structures.

AB Accurately assessing terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) is crucial for characterizing the climate-carbon cycle. Remotely sensing the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) across vegetation functional types and spatiotemporal scales has received increasing attention for monitoring photosynthetic performance and simulating GPP over the last two decades. The factors confounding PRI variation, especially on long timescales, however, require the improvement of PRI understanding to generalize its use for estimating carbon uptake. In this review, we summarize the most recent publications that have reported the factors affecting PRI variation across diurnal and seasonal scales at foliar, canopy and ecosystemic levels; synthesize the reported correlations between PRI and ecophysiological variables, particularly with radiation-use efficiency (RUE) and net carbon uptake; and analyze the improvements in PRI implementation. Long-term variation of PRI could be attributed to changes in the size of constitutive pigment pools instead of xanthophyll de-epoxidation, which controls the facultative short-term changes in PRI. Structural changes at canopy and ecosystemic levels can also affect PRI variation. Our review of the scientific literature on PRI suggests that PRI is a good proxy of photosynthetic efficiency at different spatial and temporal scales. Correcting PRI by decreasing the influence of physical or physiological factors on PRI greatly strengthens the relationships between PRI and RUE and GPP. Combining PRI with solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) and optical indices for green biomass offers additional prospects.

AB Mutant spectrum dynamics (changes in the related mutants that compose viral populations) has a decisive impact on virus behavior. The several platforms of next generation sequencing (NGS) to study viral quasispecies offer a magnifying glass to study viral quasispecies complexity. Several parameters are available to quantify the complexity of mutant spectra, but they have limitations. Here we critically evaluate the information provided by several population diversity indices, and we propose the introduction of some new ones used in ecology. In particular we make a distinction between incidence, abundance and function measures of viral quasispecies composition. We suggest a multidimensional approach (complementary information contributed by adequately chosen indices), propose some guidelines, and illustrate the use of indices with a simple example. We apply the indices to three clinical samples of hepatitis C virus that display different population heterogeneity. Areas of virus biology in which population complexity plays a role are discussed.

AB Since the estimate of moisture stress coefficients (MSC) in the current Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach (CASA) model still requires considerable inputs from ground meteorological data and many soil parameters, here we present a modified CASA model by introducing the land-surface water index (LSWI) and scaled precipitation to model the vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) in the arid and semiarid climate of the Mongolian Plateau. The field-observed NPP data and a previously proposed model (the Yu-CASA model) were used to evaluate the performance of our LSWI-based CASA model. The results show that the NPP predicted by both the LSWI-based CASA model and the Yu-CASA model showed good agreement with the observed NPP in the grassland ecosystems in the study area, with coefficients of determination of 0.717 and 0.714, respectively. The LSWI-based CASA model also performed comparably with the Yu-CASA model at both biome and per-pixel scales when keeping other inputs unchanged, with a difference of approximately 16 g C in the growing-season total NPP and an average value of 2.3 gC bias for each month. This indicates that, unlike an earlier method that estimated MSC based entirely on climatic variables or a soil moisture model, the method proposed here simplifies the model structure, reduces the need for ground measurements, and can provide results comparable with those from earlier models. The LSWI-based CASA model is potentially an alternative method for modelling NPP for a wide range of vegetation types in the Mongolian Plateau. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The impact of long-term nitrogen (N) deposition is under-studied in phosphorus (P)-limited subtropical forests. We exploited historically collected herbarium specimens to investigate potential physiological responses of trees in three subtropical forests representing an urban-to-rural gradient, across which N deposition has probably varied over the past six decades. We measured foliar [N] and [P] and stable carbon (C-13), oxygen (O-18) and nitrogen (N-15) isotopic compositions in tissue from herbarium specimens of plant species collected from 1947 to 2014. Foliar [N] and N:P increased, and N-15 and [P] decreased in the two forests close to urban centers. Consistent with recent studies demonstrating that N deposition in the region is N-15-depleted, these data suggest that the increased foliar [N] and N:P, and decreased [P], may be attributable to atmospheric deposition and associated enhancement of P limitation. Estimates of intrinsic water use efficiency calculated from foliar C-13 decreased by c. 30% from the 1950s to 2014, contrasting with multiple studies investigating similar parameters in N-limited forests. This effect may reflect decreased photosynthesis, as suggested by a conceptual model of foliar C-13 and O-18. Long-term N deposition may exacerbate P limitation and mitigate projected increases in carbon stocks driven by elevated CO2 in forests on P-limited soils.

AB Light use efficiency (LUE) models are widely used to simulate gross primary production (GPP). However, the treatment of the plant canopy as a big leaf by these models can introduce large uncertainties in simulated GPP. Recently, a two-leaf light use efficiency (TL-LUE) model was developed to simulate GPP separately for sunlit and shaded leaves and has been shown to outperform the big-leaf MOD17 model at six FLUX sites in China. In this study we investigated the performance of the TL-LUE model for a wider range of biomes. For this we optimized the parameters and tested the TL-LUE model using data from 98 FLUXNET sites which are distributed across the globe. The results showed that the TL-LUE model performed in general better than the MOD17 model in simulating 8 day GPP. Optimized maximum light use efficiency of shaded leaves (epsilon(msh)) was 2.63 to 4.59 times that of sunlit leaves (epsilon(msu)). Generally, the relationships of epsilon(msh) and epsilon(msu) with epsilon(max) were well described by linear equations, indicating the existence of general patterns across biomes. GPP simulated by the TL-LUE model was much less sensitive to biases in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) input than the MOD17 model. The results of this study suggest that the proposed TL-LUE model has the potential for simulating regional and global GPP of terrestrial ecosystems, and it is more robust with regard to usual biases in input data than existing approaches which neglect the bimodal within-canopy distribution of PAR.

AB Functional diversity (FD) is an important component of biodiversity that quantifies the difference in functional traits between organisms. However, FD studies are often limited by the availability of trait data and FD indices are sensitive to data gaps. The distribution of species abundance and trait data, and its transformation, may further affect the accuracy of indices when data is incomplete. Using an existing approach, we simulated the effects of missing trait data by gradually removing data from a plant, an ant and a bird community dataset (12, 59, and 8 plots containing 62, 297 and 238 species respectively). We ranked plots by FD values calculated from full datasets and then from our increasingly incomplete datasets and compared the ranking between the original and virtually reduced datasets to assess the accuracy of FD indices when used on datasets with increasingly missing data. Finally, we tested the accuracy of FD indices with and without data transformation, and the effect of missing trait data per plot or per the whole pool of species. FD indices became less accurate as the amount of missing data increased, with the loss of accuracy depending on the index. But, where transformation improved the normality of the trait data, FD values from incomplete datasets were more accurate than before transformation. The distribution of data and its transformation are therefore as important as data completeness and can even mitigate the effect of missing data. Since the effect of missing trait values pool-wise or plot-wise depends on the data distribution, the method should be decided case by case. Data distribution and data transformation should be given more careful consideration when designing, analysing and interpreting FD studies, especially where trait data are missing. To this end, we provide the R package "traitor" to facilitate assessments of missing trait data.

AB Among the most popular reasons that people feed wild birds is that they want to help birds. The extent to which supplemental food helps birds, however, is not well established. From spring 2011 to spring 2014, we examined how feeding of wild birds influences the health of individual birds at forested sites in central Illinois, USA. Specifically, we compared three forested sites where we provided supplemental food with three forested sites for which no supplemental food was available and monitored changes in the individual health of birds. In addition, we determined whether any changes in bird health had occurred after feeders had been removed from sites 10 months before. Generally, the individual health of birds improved with supplemental feeding, including increased antioxidant levels, reduced stress (heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio) and more rapid feather growth. In some species, we also found improved body condition index scores and innate immune defense. The difference among sites was not present 10 months after feeders were removed, suggesting that the impact on health was indeed related to supplemental feeding. Potential negative effects of supplemental feeding were also found, including an increase in infectious disease prevalence among individual birds at forested sites where supplemental food was offered. Birds with clear signs of pathology showed deficits in most of the physiological metrics in which birds at feeder sites typically showed improved health condition. At the peak of prevalence of infectious disease, 8.3% of all birds at feeders exhibited symptoms of conjunctivitis, pox, dermal disease or cloacal disease. We found both positive and negative impacts of wild bird feeding, and that, in general, birds that had access to supplemental food were in better physiological condition. Moreover, the negative effects we found may be mitigated by hobbyists engaging in safer bird-feeding practices.

AB By linking iterative learning and knowledge generation with power-sharing, adaptive co-management (ACM) provides a potential solution to resolving complex social-ecological problems. In this paper we evaluate ACM as a mechanism for resolving conservation conflict using a case study in Scotland, where seal and salmon fishery stakeholders have opposing and entrenched objectives. ACM emerged in 2002, successfully resolving this long-standing conflict. Applying evaluation approaches from the literature, in 2011 we interviewed stakeholders to characterise the evolution of ACM, and factors associated with its success over 10 years. In common with other ACM cases, triggers for the process were shifts in slow variables controlling the system (seal and salmon abundance, public perceptions of seal shooting), and exogenous shocks (changes in legal mandates, a seal disease outbreak). Also typical of ACM, three phases of evolution were evident: emerging local leadership preparing the system for change, a policy window of opportunity, and stakeholder partnerships building the resilience of the system. Parameters maintaining ACM were legal mechanisms and structures, legal power held by government, and the willingness of all stakeholders to reach a compromise and experiment with an alternative governance approach. Results highlighted the critical role of government power and support in resolving conservation conflict, which may constrain the extent of local stakeholder-driven ACM. The evaluation also demonstrated how, following perceived success, the trajectory of ACM has shifted to a 'stakeholder apathy' phase, with declining leadership, knowledge exchange, stakeholder engagement, and system resilience. We discuss remedial actions required to revive the process, and the importance of long term government resourcing and alternative financing schemes for successful conflict resolution. Based on the results we present a generic indicator framework and participatory method for the longitudinal evaluation of ACM applied to conservation conflict resolution.

AB Given expectations for a booming usage of thiamethoxam and increasing availability of the promising biological agent Serangium japonicum for the control of Bemisia tabaci in China, an evaluation of their compatibility is crucial for integrated pest management (IPM). This study examined the lethal and sublethal effects of thiamethoxam on S. japonicum through three exposure routes. An acute toxicity bioassay showed that LC50 values of thiamethoxam for S. japonicum through residue contact, egg-dip, and systemic treatment were 6.65, 4.37, and 2.43 mg Al L-1, respectively. The prey consumption of S. japonicum given different densities of B. tabaci eggs under control, discontinuous, egg-dip and systemic exposure scenarios showed a good fit to a Type II functional response. Predation of S. japonicum was most affected under systemic exposure, followed by egg-dip, and discontinuous, which was only slightly affected. In all cases tested, however, predators recovered their predation capacity rapidly, either after 24 h of exposure or 24 h after the end of exposure. Thiamethoxam was highly toxic to S. japonicum regardless of exposure routes. Sublethal effects of thiamethoxam applied systemically or foliar both impaired the biological control of S. japonicum on B. tabaci. Therefore, thiamethoxam should be used with caution in IPM of B. tabaci. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mass-flowering crops may affect long-term population dynamics, but effects on pollinators have never been studied across several years. We monitored wild bees in oilseed rape fields in 16 landscapes in Germany in two consecutive years. Effects on bee densities of landscape oilseed rape cover in the years of monitoring and in the previous years were evaluated with landscape data from three consecutive years. We fit empirical data to a mechanistic model to provide estimates for oilseed rape attractiveness and its effect on bee productivity in comparison to the rest of the landscape, and we evaluated consequences for pollinator densities in consecutive years. Our results show that high oilseed rape cover in the previous year enhances current densities of wild bees (except for bumble bees). Moreover, we show a strong attractiveness of and dilution on (i.e., decreasing bee densities with increasing landscape oilseed rape cover) oilseed rape for bees during flowering in the current year, modifying the effect of the previous year's oilseed rape cover in the case ofwild bees (excluding Bombus). As long as other factors such as nesting sites or natural enemies do not limit bee reproduction, our findings suggest long-term positive effects of mass-flowering crops on bee populations, at least for non-Bombus generalists, which possibly help to maintain crop pollination services even when crop area increases. Similar effects are conceivable for other organisms providing ecosystem services in annual crops and should be considered in future studies.

AB Host-symbiont dynamics are known to influence host phenotype, but their role in social behavior has yet to be investigated. Variation in life history across honey bee (Apis mellifera) castes may influence community composition of gut symbionts, which may in turn influence caste phenotypes. We investigated the relationship between host-symbiont dynamics and social behavior by characterizing the hindgut microbiome among distinct honey bee castes: queens, males and two types of workers, nurses and foragers. Despite a shared hive environment and mouth-to-mouth food transfer among nestmates, we detected separation among gut microbiomes of queens, workers, and males. Gut microbiomes of nurses and foragers were similar to previously characterized honey bee worker microbiomes and to each other, despite differences in diet, activity, and exposure to the external environment. Queen microbiomes were enriched for bacteria that may enhance metabolic conversion of energy from food to egg production. We propose that the two types of workers, which have the highest diversity of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of bacteria, are central to the maintenance of the colony microbiome. Foragers may introduce new strains of bacteria to the colony from the environment and transfer them to nurses, who filter and distribute them to the rest of the colony. Our results support the idea that host-symbiont dynamics influence microbiome composition and, reciprocally, host social behavior.

AB Background
   Elevated heavy metals and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels were both associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, studies on the associations of heavy metals and essential elements with altered FPG and diabetes risk were limited or conflicting. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential associations of heavy metals and essential trace elements with FPG and diabetes risk among general Chinese population.
   Methods
   We conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate the associations of urinary concentrations of 23 metals with FPG, impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and diabetes among 2242 community-based Chinese adults in Wuhan. We used the false discovery rate (FDR) method to correct for multiple hypothesis tests.
   Results
   After adjusting for potential confounders, urinary aluminum, titanium, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, selenium, rubidium, strontium, molybdenum, cadmium, antimony, barium, tungsten and lead were associated with altered FPG, IFG or diabetes risk (all P < 0.05); arsenic was only dose-dependently related to diabetes (P < 0.05). After additional adjustment for multiple testing, titanium, copper, zinc, selenium, rubidium, tungsten and lead were still significantly associated with one or more outcomes (all FDR-adjusted P < 0.05).
   Conclusions
   Our results suggest that multiple metals in urine are associated with FPG, IFG or diabetes risk. Because the cross-sectional design precludes inferences about causality, further prospective studies are warranted to validate our findings.

AB Much work has shown that the environment can induce non-genetic changes in phenotype that span multiple generations. Theory predicts that predictable environmental variation selects for both increased within-and across-generation responses. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, there are no empirical tests of this prediction. We explored the relationship between within-versus across-generation plasticity by evaluating the influence of predator cues on the life-history traits of Daphnia ambigua. We measured the duration of predator-induced transgenerational effects, determined when transgenerational responses are induced, and quantified the cues that activate transgenerational plasticity. We show that predator exposure during embryonic development causes earlier maturation and increased reproductive output. Such effects are detectable two generations removed from predator exposure and are similar in magnitude in response to exposure to cues emitted by injured conspecifics. Moreover, all experimental contexts and traits yielded a negative correlation between within-versus across-generation responses. That is, responses to predator cues within- and across-generations were opposite in sign and magnitude. Although many models address transgenerational plasticity, none of them explain this apparent negative relationship between within- and across-generation plasticities. Our results highlight the need to refine the theory of transgenerational plasticity.

AB Wetlands provide multiple ecosystem services, the sustainable use of which requires knowledge of the underlying ecological mechanisms. Functional traits, particularly the community-weighted mean trait (CWMT), provide a strong link between species communities and ecosystem functioning. We here combine species distribution modeling and plant functional traits to estimate the direction of change of ecosystem processes under climate change. We model changes in CWMT values for traits relevant to three key services, focusing on the regional species pool in the Norrstrom area (central Sweden) and three main wetland types. Our method predicts proportional shifts toward faster growing, more productive and taller species, which tend to increase CWMT values of specific leaf area and canopy height, whereas changes in root depth vary. The predicted changes in CWMT values suggest a potential increase in flood attenuation services, a potential increase in short (but not long)-term nutrient retention, and ambiguous outcomes for carbon sequestration.

AB In this study, we analysed the impact of study design and life history traits on genetic variation of plants determined with amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), a technique widely applied in all fields of molecular plant ecology. For the proper interpretation and comparison of genetic variation based upon AFLPs, a meta-analysis based upon a large number of studies of the relationship between study design and plant life history traits on the one hand and of AFLP variation on the other hand is needed but is lacking. To bridge this gap, we extracted data on study design and genetic variation from 115 AFLP studies comprising a total of 152 species. Subsequently, we ascribed the life history traits taxonomic status, life span, frequency, mating system and pollination vector to each of the species. Then, we used linear models to analyse the impact of study design and life history traits on genetic variation. In our data set genetic variation within and among populations depended neither on the number of analysed populations nor the number of analysed individuals per population. However, maximum geographic distance between populations strongly affected genetic variation. Variation within populations decreased while variation among populations increased with maximum geographic distance. Concerning the impact of life history traits, both genetic variation within and among populations depended with increasing strength on the life span, the frequency and the mating system of the species. Following the results of this study, the number of analysed populations or individuals per population is not necessarily a problem when comparing results of different studies, at least when not very low sample sizes are used. However, corresponding study ranges would be highly recommendable, since the maximum geographic distance between populations strongly affects genetic variation.

AB The domestication of crops is among the most important innovations in human history. Here, we test the hypothesis that cultivation and artificial selection for increased productivity of crops reduced plant defenses against herbivores. We compared the performance of two economically important generalist herbivores - the leaf-chewing beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) and the phloem-feeding green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) - across 29 crop species and their closely related wild relatives. We also measured putative morphological and chemical defensive traits and correlated them with herbivore performance. We show that, on average, domestication significantly reduced resistance to S.exigua, but not M.persicae, and that most independent domestication events did not cause differences in resistance to either herbivore. In addition, we found that multiple plant traits predicted resistance to S.exigua and M.persicae, and that domestication frequently altered the strength and direction of correlations between these traits and herbivore performance. Our results show that domestication can alter plant defenses, but does not cause strong allocation tradeoffs as predicted by plant defense theory. These results have important implications for understanding the evolutionary ecology of species interactions and for the search for potential resistance traits to be targeted in crop breeding.

AB 1. The link between species' functional traits and competitive abilities has been described as a major factor structuring plant communities. However, two diverging hypotheses have been proposed to explain this process: competition-trait similarity and competition-trait hierarchy.
   2. We performed a greenhouse experiment to determine whether grasses' root foraging strategies, from acquisitive or conservative functional groups, are linked to plant competitive ability and to test which hypothesis better explains interactions during the early stage of grass establishment under contrasting growth conditions.
   3. Two grass species of each functional group were grown with and without a neighbour under two levels of water and phosphorus supplies. Three functional traits related to plant competitive ability were measured on all plants grown without neighbours: specific root length (SRL), root phosphorus use efficiency and root length density. Above-ground biomass was measured on plants grown with and without neighbours to evaluate the intensity of plant interaction.
   4. We demonstrated that for the three traits the intensity of interaction is driven mainly by hierarchical trait distance, that is, trait distance between target and neighbour, and not by trait similarity. Growth conditions strongly affected the significance of the relation between hierarchical distances and competition intensity. For the SRL hierarchical distance, this effect may be due to the most competitive species (with high SRL) being strongly impacted by water shortage, which modified the competitive hierarchy. Trait plasticity in response to stresses also appeared an important factor influencing the competitive ability of species, that is, species with the most plastic SRL in response to P stress were also the most competitive under P stress.
   5. A strong hierarchy exists among grasses' competitive abilities in non-limiting growth conditions that is linked to their root functional traits and investment in the root system. Consequently, our results support the trait hierarchy hypothesis in its ability to describe competitive interaction among grasses during early stages of establishment.
   6. Our study provides evidence that root functional hierarchical trait distance and plasticity explain how grasses interact with their neighbours. This distance enables species to be ranked according to their competitive ability; however, this ranking may be influenced by the growth conditions and traits considered.

AB Increasing levels of anthropogenic noise have the potential to mask signals of acoustically communicating species in their natural habitats. Animals in noise-polluted habitats typically adjust their signals away from high background noise levels to ensure successful signal transmission under challenging environmental conditions. Earlier we demonstrated that male Chorthippus biguttulus grasshoppers from roadside habitats produce courtship signals with elevated frequency components compared to conspecifics from non-roadside habitats.
   Here, we use a common garden approach to study the mechanisms underlying this response. We transferred grasshopper nymphs from seven roadside as well as five non-roadside habitats to the laboratory to rear half of them under noisy and the other half under quiet conditions in a full factorial two-by-two design. Courtship songs of adult males were later recorded under standardized quiet conditions.
   Males exposed to road noise as nymphs produced signals with higher frequency components compared to males reared under quiet conditions, indicating developmental plasticity as a mechanism underlying the signal adjustment to anthropogenic noise in grasshoppers.
   In addition, males originating from roadside habitats produced signals with higher frequency components and an increased syllable to pause ratio - a sexually selected signal trait - compared to males from non-roadside habitats.
   Our results demonstrate for the first time that developmental plasticity may play an important role in song trait modifications in response to anthropogenic noise. Furthermore, they suggest that multiple roadside populations may have diverged in parallel, possibly in response to selection for minimizing signal masking by road noise.

AB Natural selection on photosynthetic performance is a primary factor determining leaf phenotypes. The complex CO2 diffusion path from substomatal cavities to the chloroplasts - the mesophyll conductance (g(m)) - limits photosynthetic rate in many species and hence shapes variation in leaf morphology and anatomy. Among sclerophyllous and succulent taxa, structural investment in leaves, measured as the leaf dry mass per area (LMA), has been implicated in decreased g(m). However, in herbaceous taxa with high g(m), it is less certain how LMA impacts CO2 diffusion and whether it significantly affects photosynthetic performance. We addressed these questions in the context of understanding the ecophysiological significance of leaf trait variation in wild tomatoes, a closely related group of herbaceous perennials. Although g(m) was high in wild tomatoes, variation in g(m) significantly affected photosynthesis. Even in these tender-leaved herbaceous species, greater LMA led to reduced g(m). This relationship between g(m) and LMA is partially mediated by cell packing and leaf thickness, although amphistomy (equal distribution of stomata on both sides of the leaf) mitigates the effect of leaf thickness. Understanding the costs of increased LMA will inform future work on the adaptive significance of leaf trait variation across ecological gradients in wild tomatoes and other systems.
   Leaf anatomy varies widely, even between closely related species, but is nevertheless constrained by fundamental physics. We are interested in understanding the physiological costs and benefits of different leaf anatomies and how that might affect their evolution. In the wild tomato species we study, we find that increased investment in leaf structure hinders one component of photosynthetic performance, specifically, how rapidly carbon dioxide can reach chloroplasts. Even in tender, herbaceous leaves of tomatoes, moderate investment in tougher leaf structure adversely affects fundamental physiological processes.

AB The oxidative dissolution of sulfide minerals (principally pyrite) is responsible for the majority of acid metalliferous drainage from mine sites, which represents a significant environmental problem worldwide. Understanding the complex biogeochemical processes governing natural pyrite oxidation is critical not only for solving this problem but also for understanding the industrial bioleaching of sulfide minerals. To this end, we conducted a simulated experiment of natural pyrite oxidative dissolution. Pyrosequencing analysis of the microbial community revealed a distinct succession across three stages. At the early stage, a newly proposed genus, Tumebacillus (which can use sodium thiosulfate and sulfite as the sole electron donors), dominated the microbial community. At the midstage, Alicyclobacillus (the fifth most abundant genus at the early stage) became the most dominant genus, whereas Tumebacillus was still ranked as the second most abundant. At the final stage, the microbial community was dominated by Ferroplasma (the tenth most abundant genus at the early stage). Our geochemical and mineralogical analyses indicated that exchangeable heavy metals increased as the oxidation progressed and that some secondary sulfate minerals (including jarosite and magnesiocopiapite) were formed at the final stage of the oxidation sequence. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive model of biogeochemical processes governing the oxidation of sulfide minerals.

AB Here we presented a high-resolution 5350-year pollen record from a maar annually laminated lake in East Asia (EA). Pollen record reflected the dynamics of vertical vegetation zones and temperature change. Spectral analysis on pollen percentages/concentrations of Pinus and Quercus, and a temperature proxy, revealed similar to 500-year quasi-periodic cold-warm fluctuations during the past 5350 years. This similar to 500-year cyclic climate change occurred in EA during the mid-late Holocene and even the last 150 years dominated by anthropogenic forcing. It was almost in phase with a similar to 500-year periodic change in solar activity and Greenland temperature change, suggesting that similar to 500-year small variations in solar output played a prominent role in the mid-late Holocene climate dynamics in EA, linked to high latitude climate system. Its last warm phase might terminate in the next several decades to enter another similar to 250-year cool phase, and thus this future centennial cyclic temperature minimum could partially slow down man-made global warming.

AB Natural hybridization may result in the exchange of genetic material between divergent lineages and even the formation of new taxa. Many of the Neo-Darwinian architects argued that, particularly for animal clades, natural hybridization was maladaptive. Recent evidence, however, has falsified this hypothesis, instead indicating that this process may lead to increased biodiversity through the formation of new species. Although such cases of hybrid speciation have been described in plants, fish and insects, they are considered exceptionally rare in mammals. Here we present evidence for a marine mammal, Stenella clymene, arising through natural hybridization. We found phylogenetic discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear markers, which, coupled with a pattern of transgressive segregation seen in the morphometric variation of some characters, support a case of hybrid speciation. S. clymene is currently genetically differentiated from its putative parental species, Stenella coerueloalba and Stenella longisrostris, although low levels of introgressive hybridization may be occurring. Although non-reticulate forms of evolution, such as incomplete lineage sorting, could explain our genetic results, we consider that the genetic and morphological evidence taken together argue more convincingly towards a case of hybrid speciation. We anticipate that our study will bring attention to this important aspect of reticulate evolution in non-model mammal species. The study of speciation through hybridization is an excellent opportunity to understand the mechanisms leading to speciation in the context of gene flow.

TI Plants, Birds and Butterflies: Short-Term Responses of Species

AB As a consequence of climate warming, species usually shift their distribution towards higher latitudes or altitudes. Yet, it is unclear how different taxonomic groups may respond to climate warming over larger altitudinal ranges. Here, we used data from the national biodiversity monitoring program of Switzerland, collected over an altitudinal range of 2500 m. Within the short period of eight years (2003-2010), we found significant shifts in communities of vascular plants, butterflies and birds. At low altitudes, communities of all species groups changed towards warm-dwelling species, corresponding to an average uphill shift of 8 m, 38 m and 42 m in plant, butterfly and bird communities, respectively. However, rates of community changes decreased with altitude in plants and butterflies, while bird communities changed towards warm-dwelling species at all altitudes. We found no decrease in community variation with respect to temperature niches of species, suggesting that climate warming has not led to more homogenous communities. The different community changes depending on altitude could not be explained by different changes of air temperatures, since during the 16 years between 1995 and 2010, summer temperatures in Switzerland rose by about 0.07 degrees C per year at all altitudes. We discuss that land-use changes or increased disturbances may have prevented alpine plant and butterfly communities from changing towards warm-dwelling species. However, the findings are also consistent with the hypothesis that unlike birds, many alpine plant species in a warming climate could find suitable habitats within just a few metres, due to the highly varied surface of alpine landscapes. Our results may thus support the idea that for plants and butterflies and on a short temporal scale, alpine landscapes are safer places than lowlands in a warming world.

AB Species inhabit complex environments and respond to selection imposed by numerous abiotic and biotic conditions that vary in both space and time. Environmental heterogeneity strongly influences trait evolution and patterns of adaptive population differentiation. For example, heterogeneity can favor local adaptation, or can promote the evolution of plastic genotypes that alter their phenotypes based on the conditions they encounter. Different abiotic and biotic agents of selection can act synergistically to either accelerate or constrain trait evolution. The environmental context has profound effects on quantitative genetic parameters. For instance, heritabilities measured in controlled conditions often exceed those measured in the field; thus, laboratory experiments could overestimate the potential for a population to respond to selection. Nevertheless, most studies of the genetic basis of ecologically relevant traits are conducted in simplified laboratory environments, which do not reflect the complexity of nature. Here, we advocate for manipulative field experiments in the native ranges of plant species that differ in mating system, life-history strategy and growth form. Field studies are vital to evaluate the roles of disparate agents of selection, to elucidate the targets of selection and to develop a nuanced perspective on the evolution of quantitative traits. Quantitative genetics field studies will also shed light on the potential for natural populations to adapt to novel climates in highly fragmented landscapes. Drawing from our experience with the ecological model system Boechera (Brassicaceae), we discuss advancements possible through dedicated field studies, highlight future research directions and examine the challenges associated with field studies.

AB In agroforestry systems (AFS), quantifying the competition for light is a prerequisite toward understanding the impact of shade trees on the productivity of the under-crop. Models for homogeneous canopies and shade/full-sun approaches do not address the intra-plot heterogeneity, typical of AFS. For the first time, MAESTRA, a 3D light absorption model, was fully parameterized in a heterogeneous 2-canopy layers AFS. We quantified competition for photosynthetic photon flux density (Q) between shade trees (Erythrine poepiggiana) and coffee (Coffea arabica), with a spatial resolution from the plant to the plot (2.7 ha) and a temporal resolution from half-hour to one full year. The predicted transmittance through the 2-canopy layers was verified against field measurements. The goodness of fit (R-2 > 0.75, RRMSE < 26%) was comparable to the predictions from 10 other studies using 3D light models and mostly verified in one-layered systems (mean R-2 = 0.89 and mean RRMSE = 17%). Maps of absorbed Q showed that despite their low density in the plot (5.2 trees ha(-1)), the tall Erythrina trees reduced Q available for the coffee layer by 14% annually. Annual pruning of the oldest unproductive coffee resprouts maintained a large horizontal heterogeneity in coffee LAI, with direct impact on the Q absorption map. This management practice had a strong impact on seasonal variations of absorbed Q by the coffee canopy. We proposed also a simple approach to estimate Q absorbed yearly by the coffee plants in AFS of variable tree density, requiring only few measurements in the field. An extrapolation indicated that the amount of Q absorbed by the coffee canopy would display a negative exponential relationship (k = -0.34) when increasing shade tree density (from nil to 29 trees ha(-1)). The estimated k was similar to the shade tree extinction coefficient of diffuse radiation measured with a plant canopy analyzer. We showed that the presence of shade trees tends to reverse the diurnal time course of the fraction of Q(a) when compared to a plantation in the open.
   Overall, MAESTRA proved to successfully unlock the question of intra-plot heterogeneity for light absorption and to provide defensible light budgets as a continuous and mapped covariable, a crucial step for many field experimentations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Snow environments can occupy over a third of land surface area, but little is known about the dynamics of snowpack bacteria. The effect of snow melt on bacterial community structure and diversity of surface environments of a Svalbard glacier was examined using analyses of 16S rRNA genes via T-RFLP, qPCR and 454 pyrosequencing. Distinct community structures were found in different habitat types, with changes over 1 week apparent, in particular for the dominant bacterial class present, Betaproteobacteria. The differences observed were consistent with influences from depositional mode (snowfall vs aeolian dusts), contrasting snow with dust-rich snow layers and near-surface ice. Contrary to that, slush as the decompositional product of snow harboured distinct lineages of bacteria, further implying post-depositional changes in community structure. Taxa affiliated to the betaproteobacterial genus Polaromonas were particularly dynamic, and evidence for the presence of betaproteobacterial ammonia-oxidizing bacteria was uncovered, inviting the prospect that the dynamic bacterial communities associated with snowpacks may be active in supraglacial nitrogen cycling and capable of rapid responses to changes induced by snowmelt. Furthermore the potential of supraglacial snowpack ecosystems to respond to transient yet spatially extensive melting episodes such as that observed across most of Greenland's ice sheet in 2012 merits further investigation.

AB One significant unanswered question about biotic responses to climate change is how plant communities within topographically complex landscapes will respond to climate change. Alpine plant communities are strongly influenced by topographic microclimates which can either buffer or compound the effects of more regional climatic changes. Here, we analyzed species changes over 20_ years in a complex alpine landscape with pronounced gradients in microtopography and consequently large variation in temperatures, snow depths, and nitrogen availability across small (10 m) scales. Using data from long-term monitoring plots from six community types, we asked how species composition and functional diversity changed over time in these different areas of the landscape, and whether fine-scale heterogeneity allowed species to move in response to temporal changes in the environment. We found sitewide patterns of increasing species and functional diversity. However, the majority of variability in composition over time was non-directional, both within and between community types. Within community types, Carex-dominated snow banks and wet meadow communities were the most variable in composition over time, while Sibbaldia-dominated snow banks, fellfield, dry meadow and moist meadow exhibited moderate change. Over forty percent of the plots also transitioned between community types during the census intervals, but these also were largely transient, with a shift occurring in one time interval and then shifting back in the next interval. Thus, even with evidence of directional change over time in climate, N deposition, and release from grazing, vegetation is tracking finer-scale variability both in time and space. Environmental heterogeneity may allow vegetation to track this finer-scale variability and enhance resilience to underlying directional changes in alpine and other topographically-complex environments.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Susceptibility to chronic inflammatory diseases is determined by immunogenetic and environmental risk factors. Resident microbial communities often differ between healthy and diseased states, but whether these differences are of primary aetiological importance or secondary to the altered inflammatory environment remains largely unknown. Here we provide evidence for host gene-microbiota interactions contributing to disease risk in a mouse model of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, an autoantibody-induced inflammatory skin disease. Using an advanced intercross, we identify genetic loci contributing to skin microbiota variability, susceptibility to skin blistering and their overlap. Furthermore, by treating bacterial species abundances as covariates with disease we reveal a novel disease locus. The majority of the identified covariate taxa are characterized by reduced abundance being associated with increased disease risk, providing evidence of a primary role in protection from disease. Further characterization of these putative probiotic species or species assemblages offers promising potential for preventative and therapeutic treatment development.

AB Biotic interactions play an important role on the organization and persistence of biodiversity. Unnatural modifications of landscape structure such as habitat loss and fragmentation can isolate populations and disrupt biological communities, affecting species survival and altering the complex set of relationships between plants and pollinators. Plant-pollinator interaction networks have characteristics such asymmetry and nestedness that may influence the stability and robustness of networks to landscape changes. Species in mutualistic networks might respond to landscape modifications with a sudden collapse at critical habitat destruction thresholds. In this work we review general trends in the scientific literature related to the effects of landscape changes on plant-pollinator networks. For this, a survey in Scopus and Web of Knowledge databases was conducted in May 2011 using all seven possible combinations of the terms "pollinat*" with the terms "landscape", "habitat loss" and "network". We found 155 papers and 92% of those showed significant effects of landscape changes on pollinator diversity and plant reproductive success. Approximately 50% of all analyzed papers showed effects of agriculture intensification as a result of increases in the conversion of natural areas into agricultural crops on plant-pollinator interactions. Landscape modifications affected cross-pollination and the sexual reproduction of plants largely because of reduced diversity and availability of pollinators due to increased habitat isolation and reduction of floral resources and nesting areas in the remaining available habitat. An integrated approach concerning the effects of modified landscapes on natural ecosystems regarding how these variations can affect the stability and robustness of pollination networks can be extremely useful for conservation of plant-pollinators interactions, with positive overall consequences for conservation of plant, pollinators and pollination services in natural and agricultural ecosystems.

AB Prolonged exposure to stress during development can have long-term detrimental effects on health and wellbeing. However, the environmental matching hypothesis proposes that developmental stress programs physiology and behaviour in an adaptive way that can enhance fitness if early environments match those experienced later in life. Most research has focused on the harmful effects that stress during a single period in early life may exert in adulthood. In this study, we tested the potential additive and beneficial effects that stress experienced during both pre- and post-hatching development may have on adult physiology and behaviour. Japanese quail experienced different stress-related treatments across two developmental life stages: pre-hatching corticosterone (CORT) injection, post-hatching unpredictable food availability, both pre- and post-hatching treatments, or control. In adulthood, we determined quails' acute stress response, neophobia and novel environment exploration. The pre-hatching CORT treatment resulted in attenuated physiological responses to an acute stressor, increased activity levels and exploration in a novel environment. Post-hatching unpredictable food availability decreased adults' latency to feed. Furthermore, there were cumulative effects of these treatments across the two developmental stages: quail subjected to both pre- and post-hatching treatments were the most explorative and risk-taking of all treatment groups. Such responses to novel environments could enhance survival in unpredictable environments in later life. Our data also suggest that these behavioural responses may have been mediated by long-term physiological programming of the adrenocortical stress response, creating phenotypes that could exhibit fitness-enhancing behaviours in a changing environment.

AB Background and aims Conversion of natural forests to plantations often results in a considerable loss of plant species and thus likely a reduction in quantity and quality of plant debris entering the soil. Larch plantation is widespread in northeastern China, but its ecological impacts receive little attention. This study aimed to assess soil quality under larch stands against the secondary forest stands using a suite of soil chemical and microbiological properties.
   Methods Four pairs of larch plantations and secondary forests were randomly selected from a mountainous area and mineral soils of top 15 cm were collected from each field.
   Results Soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations, microbial biomass, C and N mineralization and the activities of hydrolytic enzymes were significantly lower in the larch plantations than those in the secondary forests. However, light fraction C as a proportion of soil C was greater in the larch plantations, suggesting less accumulation and stabilization of soil C to heavy fraction in the larch plantations compared to the secondary forests. We also used delta N-15 records in light and heavy fractions to derive the relative stability of soil C and found that soil C stability was lower in the larch plantations. This was supported by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis because carboxylate stretching, which might result from microbial oxidation, was less abundant in the larch plantations.
   Conclusions The differences in soil organic matter quality between the larch plantations and the secondary forests were reliably reflected in soil microbial properties and microbially-mediated processes. Our results indicated that the larch plantations reduced soil quality as well as nutrient cycling rate.

AB A family of empirically based ecological rules', collectively known as temperature-size rules, predicts larger body size in colder environments. This prediction is based on studies demonstrating that a wide range of ectotherms show increased body size, cell size or genome size in low-temperature habitats, or that individuals raised at low temperature become larger than conspecifics raised at higher temperature. There is thus a potential for reduction in size with global warming, affecting all levels from cell volume to body size, community composition and food webs. Increased body size may be obtained either by increasing the size or number of cells. Processes leading to changed cell size are of great interest from an ecological, physiological and evolutionary perspective. Cell size scales with fundamental properties such as genome size, growth rate, protein synthesis rates and metabolic activity, although the causal directions of these correlations are not clear. Changes in genome size will thus, in many cases, not only affect cell or body size, but also life-cycle strategies. Symmetrically, evolutionary drivers of life-history strategies may impact growth rate and thus cell size, genome size and metabolic rates. Although this goes to the core of many ecological processes, it is hard to move from correlations to causations. To the extent that temperature-driven changes in genome size result in significant differences among populations in body size, allometry or life-cycle events such as mating season, it could serve as a fast route to speciation. We offer here a novel perspective on the temperature-size rules from a bottom-up' perspective: how temperature may induce changes in genome size, and thus implicitly in cell size and body size of metazoans. Alternatively: how temperature-driven enlargement of cells also dictates genome-size expansion to maintain the genome-size to cell-volume ratio. We then discuss the different evolutionary drivers in aquatic versus terrestrial systems, and whether it is possible to arrive at a unifying theory that also may serve as a predictive tool related to temperature changes. This, we believe, will offer an updated review of a basic concept in ecology, and novel perspectives on the basic biological responses to temperature changes from a genomic perspective.

AB Black rats are major invasive vertebrate pests with severe ecological, economic and health impacts. Remarkably, their evolutionary history has received little attention, and there is no firm agreement on how many species should be recognized within the black rat complex. This species complex is native to India and Southeast Asia. According to current taxonomic classification, there are three taxa living in sympatry in several parts of Thailand, Cambodia and Lao People's Democratic Republic, where this study was conducted: two accepted species (Rattus tanezumi, Rattus sakeratensis) and an additional mitochondrial lineage of unclear taxonomic status referred to here as Rattus R3. We used extensive sampling, morphological data and diverse genetic markers differing in rates of evolution and parental inheritance (two mitochondrial DNA genes, one nuclear gene and eight microsatellite loci) to assess the reproductive isolation of these three taxa. Two close Asian relatives, Rattus argentiventer and Rattus exulans, were also included in the genetic analyses. Genetic analyses revealed discordance between the mitochondrial and nuclear data. Mitochondrial phylogeny studies identified three reciprocally monophyletic clades in the black rat complex. However, studies of the phylogeny of the nuclear exon interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein gene and clustering and assignation analyses with eight microsatellites failed to separate R. tanezumi and R3. Morphometric analyses were consistent with nuclear data. The incongruence between mitochondrial and nuclear (and morphological) data rendered R. tanezumi/R3 paraphyletic for mitochondrial lineages with respect to R. sakeratensis. Various evolutionary processes, such as shared ancestral polymorphism and incomplete lineage sorting or hybridization with massive mitochondrial introgression between species, may account for this unusual genetic pattern in mammals.

AB Seed production that varies greatly from year to year, known as "masting'' or "mast-fruiting'' behavior, is a population-level phenomenon known to exhibit geographic synchrony extending, at least in some cases, hundreds of kilometers. The two main nonexclusive hypotheses for the driver of such geographically extensive synchrony are (1) environmental factors (the Moran effect), and (2) the mutual dependence of trees on outcrossed pollen (pollen coupling). We tested 10 predictions relevant to these two hypotheses using 18 years of acorn production data on two species of California oaks. Data were obtained across the entire ranges of the two species at 12 sites (10 for each species) separated by up to 745 km. In general, our results provided strong support for the importance of the Moran effect as a driver of spatial synchrony in and between these two species. Particularly compelling was evidence of close concordance between spatial synchrony in acorn production and key environmental factors extending over the range of both species and significant spatial cross-synchrony between the two species, despite considerable differences in their geographical ecology. Because oaks are monoecious, female flowers are not necessarily related to pollen production, and thus, our tests do not address the role of pollen coupling in bisexual species where pollen and flower production are necessarily correlated. For the oak species considered here, however, the Moran effect is a key driver of large-scale spatial synchrony in acorn production.

AB Color polymorphisms are common in lizards, which provide an excellent model system to study their evolution and adaptive function. The lacertid genus Podarcis is particularly interesting because it comprises several polymorphic species. Previous studies with lacertid lizards have tried to explain the maintenance of color polymorphisms by correlational selection between color morphs and several phenotypic traits. Particular attention has been paid to their putative role as signals reflecting alternative reproductive strategies under frequency-dependent selection, but the relationship between mating patterns and color polymorphism has not been previously considered. In this study, we use longitudinal behavioral data obtained during six consecutive breeding seasons (2006-2011) in a free-ranging polymorphic population of Podarcis muralis lizards to examine the hypothesis that lizards mate assortatively by color. We provide spectrophotometric data that confirm the existence of discrete color morphs and show that morphs are ontogenetically stable once they develop fully in sexually mature individuals. We also present data on the year-to-year variation of relative morph frequencies. Finally, we provide evidence that, over a 6-year period, homomorphic male female pairs in the wild were significantly more common than heteromorphic pairs. Taken together, our results suggest that color assortative mating may be involved in the maintenance of discrete color morphs in this and other lacertid species.

AB Conserving threatened carnivore species increasingly depends on the capacity of local people to cohabit with those species. To examine such capacity we developed a novel psychological framework for conservation in regions of the world where there are human-carnivore conflicts, and used the Endangered tiger Panthera tigris to explore the utility of this framework. Specifically, we tested three hypotheses in Chitwan National Park, Nepal, where increasing human-tiger conflicts potentially jeopardize long-term coexistence. We administered a survey to 499 individuals living,2 km from the Park and in nearby multiple-use forest, to record preferred future tiger population size and factors that may influence preferences, including past interactions with tigers (e. g. livestock predation) and beliefs and perceptions about tigers. Over 17% of respondents reported that a tiger had attacked their livestock or threatened them directly. Results from a structural equation model indicated that respondents who preferred fewer tigers in the future were less likely to associate tigers with beneficial attributes, more likely to associate tigers with undesirable attributes, and more likely to believe that government officials poorly manage tiger-related risks and that people are vulnerable to risks from tigers. Our framework can help address current and future conservation challenges because it (1) integrates an expansive and generalized set of psychological concepts, (2) enables the identification of conservation interventions that foster coexistence between people and carnivores, and (3) is suitable for broad application.

AB Background: Climatic warming predicts that species move their entire distribution poleward. Poleward movement of the 'cold' side of the distribution of species is empirically supported, but evidence of poleward movement at the 'warm' distributional side is relatively scarce.
   Methodology/Principal Finding: Finland has, as the first country in the world, completed three national atlas surveys of breeding birds, which we here use to calculate the sizes and weighted mean latitudes of the national range of 114 southern and 34 northern bird species during three periods (1974-1979; 1986-1989; 2006-2010), each denoting species presence in approximately 3 800 10610 km(2) squares. We find strong evidence that southern species (breeding predominantly in central Europe) showed a latitudinal shift of 1.1-1.3 km/year poleward during all three pairwise comparisons between these atlases (covering 11, 20.5 and 31.5 years respectively). We find evidence of a latitudinal shift of 0.7-0.8 km/year poleward of northern boreal and Arctic species, but this shift was not found in all study periods and may have been influenced by increased effort put into the more recent surveys. Species showed no significant correlation in changes in range size and weighted mean latitude between the first (11 year) and second (20.5 year) period covered by consecutive atlases, suggesting weak phylogenetic signal and little scope of species characteristics in explaining latitudinal avian range changes.
   Conclusions: Extinction-driven avian range changes (at the 'warm' side) of a species' distribution occur at approximately half the rate of colonisation-driven range changes (at the 'cold' side), and its quantification therefore requires long-term monitoring data, possibly explaining why evidence for such changes is currently rare. A clear latitudinal shift in an assemblage of species may still harbour considerable temporal inconsistency in latitudinal movement on the species level. Understanding this inconsistency is important for predictive modelling of species composition in a changing world.

AB False positive errors are a significant component of many ecological data sets, which in combination with false negative errors, can lead to severe biases in conclusions about ecological systems. We present results of a field experiment where observers recorded observations for known combinations of electronically broadcast calling anurans under conditions mimicking field surveys to determine species occurrence. Our objectives were to characterize false positive error probabilities for auditory methods based on a large number of observers, to determine if targeted instruction could be used to reduce false positive error rates, and to establish useful predictors of among-observer and among-species differences in error rates. We recruited 31 observers, ranging in abilities from novice to expert, who recorded detections for 12 species during 180 calling trials (66 960 total observations). All observers made multiple false positive errors, and on average 8.1% of recorded detections in the experiment were false positive errors. Additional instruction had only minor effects on error rates. After instruction, false positive error probabilities decreased by 16% for treatment individuals compared to controls with broad confidence interval overlap of 0 (95% CI: -46 to 30%). This coincided with an increase in false negative errors due to the treatment (26%; -3 to 61%). Differences among observers in false positive and in false negative error rates were best predicted by scores from an online test and a self-assessment of observer ability completed prior to the field experiment. In contrast, years of experience conducting call surveys was a weak predictor of error rates. False positive errors were also more common for species that were played more frequently but were not related to the dominant spectral frequency of the call. Our results corroborate other work that demonstrates false positives are a significant component of species occurrence data collected by auditory methods. Instructing observers to only report detections they are completely certain are correct is not sufficient to eliminate errors. As a result, analytical methods that account for false positive errors will be needed, and independent testing of observer ability is a useful predictor for among-observer variation in observation error rates.

AB Aim To identify hypotheses for how climate change affects long-term population persistence that can be used as a framework for future syntheses of ecological responses to climate change. Location Global. Methods We surveyed ecological and evolutionary concepts related to how a changing climate might alter population persistence. We organized established concepts into a two-stage framework that relates abiotic change to population persistence via changes in the rates or outcomes of ecological and evolutionary processes. We surveyed reviews of climate change responses, and evaluated patterns in light of our conceptual framework. Results We classified hypotheses for population responses to climate change as one of two types: (1) hypotheses that relate rates of ecological and evolutionary processes (plasticity, dispersal, population growth and evolution) to abiotic change, and (2) hypotheses that relate changes in these processes to four fundamental population-level responses (colonization, acclimatization, adaptation or extinction). We found that a disproportionate emphasis on response in the climate change literature is difficult to reconcile with ecological and evolutionary theories that emphasize processes. We discuss a set of 24 hypotheses that represent gaps in the literature that limit our ability determine whether observed climate change responses are sufficient to facilitate persistence through future climate change. Main conclusions Though theory relates environmental change to fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes and population-level responses, clear hypotheses based on theory have not been systematically formulated and tested in the context of climate change. Stronger links between basic theory and observed impacts of climate change are required to assess which responses are common, likely or able to facilitate population persistence despite ongoing environmental change. We anticipate that a hypothesis-testing framework will reveal that indirect effects of climate change responses are more pervasive than previously thought and related to a few general processes, even though the patterns they create are incredibly diverse.

AB Background: The mucus layer covering the human intestinal epithelium forms a dynamic surface for host-microbial interactions. In addition to the environmental factors affecting the intestinal equilibrium, such as diet, it is well established that the microbiota composition is individually driven, but the host factors determining the composition have remained unresolved.
   Results: In this study, we show that ABO blood group is involved in differences in relative proportion and overall profiles of intestinal microbiota. Specifically, the microbiota from the individuals harbouring the B antigen (secretor B and AB) differed from the non-B antigen groups and also showed higher diversity of the Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides (EREC) and Clostridium leptum (CLEPT) -groups in comparison with other blood groups.
   Conclusions: Our novel finding indicates that the ABO blood group is one of the genetically determined host factors modulating the composition of the human intestinal microbiota, thus enabling new applications in the field of personalized nutrition and medicine.

AB 1. Environmental variables are often used as indirect surrogates for mapping biodiversity because species survey data are scant at regional scales, especially in the marine realm. However, environmental variables are measured on arbitrary scales unlikely to have simple, direct relationships with biological patterns. Instead, biodiversity may respond nonlinearly and to interactions between environmental variables. 2. To investigate the role of the environment in driving patterns of biodiversity composition in large marine regions, we collated multiple biological survey and environmental data sets from tropical NE Australia, the deep Gulf of Mexico and the temperate Gulf of Maine. We then quantified the shape and magnitude of multispecies responses along >30 environmental gradients and the extent to which these variables predicted regional distributions. To do this, we applied a new statistical approach, Gradient Forest, an extension of Random Forest, capable of modelling nonlinear and threshold responses. 3. The regional-scale environmental variables predicted an average of 1335% (up to 5085% for individual species) of the variation in species abundance distributions. Important predictors differed among regions and biota and included depth, salinity, temperature, sediment composition and current stress. The shapes of responses along gradients also differed and were nonlinear, often with thresholds indicative of step changes in composition. These differing regional responses were partly due to differing environmental indicators of bioregional boundaries and, given the results to date, may indicate limited scope for extrapolating bio-physical relationships beyond the region of source data sets. 4. Synthesis and applications. Gradient Forest offers a new capability for exploring relationships between biodiversity and environmental gradients, generating new information on multispecies responses at a detail not available previously. Importantly, given the scarcity of data, Gradient Forest enables the combined use of information from disparate data sets. The gradient response curves provide biologically informed transformations of environmental layers to predict and map expected patterns of biodiversity composition that represent sampled composition better than uninformed variables. The approach can be applied to support marine spatial planning and management and has similar applicability in terrestrial realms.

AB Seedling recruitment limitations create a demographic bottleneck that largely determines the viability and structure of plant populations and communities, and pose a core restriction on the colonization of novel habitat. We use a shade-tolerant, invasive grass, Microstegium vimineum, to examine the interplay between seed and establishment limitations phenomena that together determine recruitment success but usually are investigated individually. We add increasing amounts of seed to microhabitats containing variable levels of leaf litter thickness with reduced leaf litter simulating disturbance to investigate whether reduced seed limitation overcomes the establishment limitation posed by litter cover. We do this across gradients in understory light, moisture and temperature, and quantify germination, survival, and then per capita adult biomass and reproduction in order to understand the implications for invasion across the landscape. We find that the combined effects of seed and establishment limitation influence recruitment; however, propagule pressure overwhelms the inhibitory effects of leaf litter thickness. Leaf litter reduces germination by 2257% and seedling survival by 1315% from that observed on bare soil. However, density-dependent reproduction compensates as 13 plants can produce far more seeds (approx. 525) than are required for persistence. As such, just a few plants may establish in understory forest habitat and subsequently overwhelm establishment barriers with copious propagule production. These results, for a widespread, invasive plant, are consistent with the emerging perspective for native plants that seed and establishment limitation jointly influence recruitment. The ability for an exotic plant species to compensate for low population densities with high per capita seed production, that then overrides establishment limitations, makes its invasive potential daunting. Further work is required to test if this is a common mechanism underlying plant invasions.

AB Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) depend on frequency-modulated whistles for many aspects of their social behavior, including group cohesion and recognition of familiar individuals. Vocalization amplitude and frequency influences communication range and may be shaped by many ecological and physiological factors including energetic costs. Here, a calibrated GPS-synchronized hydrophone array was used to record the whistles of bottlenose dolphins in a tropical shallow-water environment with high ambient noise levels. Acoustic localization techniques were used to estimate the source levels and energy content of individual whistles. Bottlenose dolphins produced whistles with mean source levels of 146.7 +/- 6.2 dB re. 1 mu Pa(RMS). These were lower than source levels estimated for a population inhabiting the quieter Moray Firth, indicating that dolphins do not necessarily compensate for the high noise levels found in noisy tropical habitats by increasing their source level. Combined with measured transmission loss and noise levels, these source levels provided estimated median communication ranges of 750 m and maximum communication ranges up to 5740 m. Whistles contained less than 17 mJ of acoustic energy, showing that the energetic cost of whistling is small compared to the high metabolic rate of these aquatic mammals, and unlikely to limit the vocal activity of toothed whales.

AB Boreal ecosystems store 10-20% of global soil carbon and may warm by 4-7 degrees C over the next century. Higher temperatures could increase the activity of boreal decomposers and indirectly affect decomposition through other ecosystem feedbacks. For example, permafrost melting will likely alleviate constraints on microbial decomposition and lead to greater soil CO2 emissions. However, wet boreal ecosystems underlain by permafrost are often CH4 sources, and permafrost thaw could ultimately result in drier soils that consume CH4, thereby offsetting some of the greenhouse warming potential of soil CO2 emissions. Climate change is also likely to increase winter precipitation and snow depth in boreal regions, which may stimulate decomposition by moderating soil temperatures under the snowpack. As temperatures and evapotranspiration increase in the boreal zone, fires may become more frequent, leading to additional permafrost loss from burned ecosystems. Although post-fire decomposition could also increase due to higher soil temperatures, reductions in microbial biomass and activity may attenuate this response. Other feedbacks such as soil drying, increased nutrient mineralization, and plant species shifts are either weak or uncertain. We conclude that strong positive feedbacks to decomposition will likely depend on permafrost thaw, and that climate feedbacks will probably be weak or negative in boreal ecosystems without permafrost. However, warming manipulations should be conducted in a broader range of boreal systems to validate these predictions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.

AB The response of boreal forests to anthropogenic climate change remains uncertain, with potentially significant impacts for the global carbon cycle, albedo, canopy evapotranspiration and feedbacks into further climate change. Here, we focus on tree-ring data from the Firth River site at treeline in northeastern Alaska, in a tundra-forest transition region where pronounced warming has already occurred. Both tree-ring width (TRW) and maximum latewood density (MXD) chronologies were developed to identify the nature of tree growth and density responses to climatic and environmental changes in white spruce (Picea glauca), a dominant Arctic treeline species. Good agreement was found between the interannual fluctuations in the TRW chronology and summer temperatures from 1901 to 1950, whereas no significant relationships were found from 1951 to 2001, supporting evidence of significant divergence between TRW and summer temperature in the second half of the 20th century. In contrast to this unstable climatic response in the TRW record, the high frequency July-August temperature signal in the MXD series seems reasonably stable through the 20th century. Wider and denser rings were more frequent during the 20th century, particularly after 1950, than in previous centuries. Finally, comparison between the tree-ring proxies and a satellite-derived vegetation index suggests that TRW and MXD correlate with vegetation productivity at the landscape level at different times of the growing season.

AB Postcopulatory sexual selection, either in the form of sperm competition or cryptic female choice, is an important selective force that is thought to have generated the enormous variation in sperm morphology observed interspecifically. However, the evolutionary significance of intraspecific variation in sperm morphology, and the role that postcopulatory sexual selection plays in influencing this variation, remains poorly investigated in invertebrates. Here, we tested the hypothesis that postcopulatory sexual selection reduces variation in sperm morphology, both between and within males, in 27 species of eusocial ants and bees. These eusocial species offer an unusual opportunity to assess how selection acts on variance in sperm morphology, as haploid males produce clonal, haploid sperm that does not experience haploid-diploid conflict. We provide solid evidence that males of polyandrous ant and bee species indeed produce less-variable sperm, indicating that sperm competition selected for sperm of superior quality. Our results offer a mechanistic explanation for the evolution of high-quality sperm and provide comprehensive evidence that sperm morphology of social insects is influenced by sexual selection.

TI Changes in Plant Species Richness Induce Functional Shifts in Soil
   Nematode Communities in Experimental Grassland

AB Background: Changes in plant diversity may induce distinct changes in soil food web structure and accompanying soil feedbacks to plants. However, knowledge of the long-term consequences of plant community simplification for soil animal food webs and functioning is scarce. Nematodes, the most abundant and diverse soil Metazoa, represent the complexity of soil food webs as they comprise all major trophic groups and allow calculation of a number of functional indices.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied the functional composition of nematode communities three and five years after establishment of a grassland plant diversity experiment (Jena Experiment). In response to plant community simplification common nematode species disappeared and pronounced functional shifts in community structure occurred. The relevance of the fungal energy channel was higher in spring 2007 than in autumn 2005, particularly in species-rich plant assemblages. This resulted in a significant positive relationship between plant species richness and the ratio of fungal-to-bacterial feeders. Moreover, the density of predators increased significantly with plant diversity after five years, pointing to increased soil food web complexity in species-rich plant assemblages. Remarkably, in complex plant communities the nematode community shifted in favour of microbivores and predators, thereby reducing the relative abundance of plant feeders after five years.
   Conclusions/Significance: The results suggest that species-poor plant assemblages may suffer from nematode communities detrimental to plants, whereas species-rich plant assemblages support a higher proportion of microbivorous nematodes stimulating nutrient cycling and hence plant performance; i.e. effects of nematodes on plants may switch from negative to positive. Overall, food web complexity is likely to decrease in response to plant community simplification and results of this study suggest that this results mainly from the loss of common species which likely alter plant - nematode interactions.

AB Purpose: VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) plays a crucial role in mediating angiogenic endothelial cell responses via the VEGF pathway, and angiogenesis inhibitors targeting VEGFR-2 are in clinical use. As angiogenesis is a host-driven process, functional heritable variation in KDR, the gene encoding VEGFR-2, may affect VEGFR-2 function and, ultimately, the extent of tumor angiogenesis.
   Experimental Design: We resequenced KDR using 24 DNAs each from healthy Caucasian, African American, and Asian groups. Nonsynonymous genetic variants were assessed for function by phosphorylation assays. Luciferase reporter gene assays were used to examine effects of variants on gene expression. KDR mRNA and protein expression and microvessel density (MVD) were measured in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumor samples, and matching patient DNA samples were genotyped to test for associations with variants of interest.
   Results: KDR resequencing led to the discovery of 120 genetic variants, of which 25 had not been previously reported. Q472H had increased VEGFR-2 protein phosphorylation and associated with increased MVD in NSCLC tumor samples. -2854C and -2455A increased luciferase expression and associated with higher KDR mRNA levels in NSCLC samples. -271A reduced luciferase expression and associated with lower VEGFR-2 levels in NSCLC samples. -906C and 23408G associated with higher KDR mRNA levels in NSCLC samples.
   Conclusions: This study has defined KDR genetic variation in 3 populations and identified common variants that impact on tumoral KDR expression and vascularization. These findings may have important implications for understanding the molecular basis of genetic associations between KDR variation and clinical phenotypes related to VEGFR-2 function.

AB Fire regimes influence and are influenced by the structure and composition of plant communities. This complex reciprocal relationship has implications for the success of plant invasions and the subsequent impact of invasive species on native biota. Although much attention has been given to the role of invasive grasses in transforming fire regimes and native plant communities, little is known about the relationship between woody invasive species and fire regime. Despite this, prescribed burning is frequently used for managing invasive woody species. In this study we review relationships between woody exotic plant invasions and fire in invaded ecosystems worldwide. Woody invaders may increase or decrease aspects of the fire regime, including fire frequency, intensity and extent. This is in contrast to grass invaders which almost uniformly increase fire frequency. Woody plant invasion can lead to escape from a grass-fire cycle, but the resulting reduction in fire frequency can sometimes lead to a cycle of rare but more intense fires. Prescribed fires may be a useful management tool for controlling woody exotic invaders in some systems, but they are rarely sufficient to eliminate an invasive species, and a dearth of controlled experiments hampers evaluation of their benefits. Nevertheless, because some woody invaders have fuel properties that differ substantially from native species, understanding and managing the impacts of woody invaders on fire regimes and on prescribed burns should become an important component of resource and biodiversity management.

AB Ranaviruses have caused die-offs of amphibians across the globe. In North America, these pathogens cause more amphibian mortality events than any other pathogen. Field observations suggest that ranavirus epizootics in amphibian communities are common during metamorphosis, presumably due to changes in immune function. However, few controlled studies have compared the relative susceptibility of amphibians to ranaviruses across life stages. Our objectives were to measure differences in mortality and infection prevalence following exposure to ranavirus at four developmental stages and determine whether the differences were consistent among seven anuran species. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that susceptibility to ranavirus would be greatest at metamorphosis. Our results did not support this hypothesis, as four of the species were most susceptible to ranavirus during the larval or hatchling stages. The embryo stage had the lowest susceptibility among species probably due to the protective membranous layers of the egg. Our results indicate that generalizations should be made cautiously about patterns of susceptibility to ranaviruses among amphibian developmental stages and species. Further, if early developmental stages of amphibians are susceptible to ranaviruses, the impact of ranavirus epizootic events may be greater than realized due to the greater difficulty of detecting morbid hatchlings and larvae compared to metamorphs.

AB Most anthropogenic influences on marine ecosystems, except for river-or terrestrial-borne pollution, involve some sort of vessel activity. Increasing anthropogenic activities mean that many countries are being forced to develop spatial planning schemes, while at the same time implementing conservation sites for sensitive species at sea. The effects of ship traffic on seabirds sensitive to human disturbance are currently too poorly understood to allow for the development of proper planning and conservation guidelines. We therefore used aerial surveys and experimental disturbance to elucidate the effects of passing ships on the distribution patterns, habitat loss, and species-specific flight reactions of birds, as well as the potential for habituation. Loons (Gavia spp.) showed clear avoidance of areas with high shipping intensity. Flush distances of four sea duck species differed significantly, with the longest distances recorded for Common Scoters (Melanitta nigra) and the shortest for Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima). Flush distance was positively related to flock size. Among all the sea duck species studied, the duration of temporary habitat loss was longest for Common Scoters. We found indications of habituation in sea ducks within areas of channeled traffic. However, it is questionable if habituation to free-ranging ships is likely to occur, because of their unpredictable nature. We therefore recommend that spatial planning should aim to channel ship traffic wherever possible to avoid further habitat fragmentation and to allow for habituation, at least in some species. Information on the effects of shipping on other seabird species and during different periods of the year is urgently needed, together with information on the effects of different types of boats, including recreational and fishing vessels.

AB Aim To calculate the degree to which differences between local and regional elevational species richness patterns can be accounted for by the effects of regional area.
   Location Five elevational transects in Costa Rica, Ecuador, La Reunion, Mexico and Tanzania.
   Methods We sampled ferns in standardized field plots and collated regional species lists based on herbarium and literature data. We then used the Arrhenius function S = cA(z) to correct regional species richness (S) for the effect of area (A) using three slightly different approaches, and compared the concordance of local and regional patterns prior to and after accounting for the effect of area on regional richness using linear regression analyses.
   Results We found a better concordance between local and regional elevational species richness after including the effect of area in the majority of cases. In several cases, local and regional patterns are very similar after accounting for area. In most of the cases, the maximum regional richness shifted to a higher elevation after accounting for area. Different approaches to correct for area resulted in qualitatively similar results.
   Main conclusions The differences between local and regional elevational richness patterns can at least partly be accounted for by area effects, suggesting that the underlying causes of elevational richness patterns might be the same at both spatial scales. Values used to account for the effect of area differ among the different study locations, showing that there is no generally applicable elevational species-area relationship.

AB Given increasing demands on finite water supplies, accurate estimates of evapotranspiration (LE) from arid shrublands of the Southwestern United States are needed to develop or refine basin water budgets. In this work, a novel approach to estimating the equilibrium (or wet environment) surface temperature (T-e) and LE from regionally extensive phreatophyte shrublands is tested using complementary theory and micrometeorological data collected from five eddy correlation stations located in eastern Nevada. A symmetric complementary relationship between the potential LE (LEp) and actual LE is extremely attractive because it is based on general feedback mechanisms where detailed knowledge of the complex processes and interactions between soil, vegetation, and the near-surface boundary layer can be avoided. Analysis of computed LEp and eddy correlation-derived LE indicates that there is unequivocal evidence of a complementary relationship between LEp and LE, where the measured and normalized complementary relationship is symmetric when T-e is utilized to compute the wet environment LE (LEw). Application of a modified Brutsaert and Stricker advection-aridity (AA) model, where T-e is utilized to compute LEw as opposed to the measured air temperature, indicates an improvement in prediction accuracy over the standard Brutsaert and Stricker AA model. Monthly and annual predictions of LE using the modified AA model are within the uncertainty of the measurement accuracy, making the application of this approach potentially useful for estimating regional LE in arid shrubland environments. Our observational evidence supports the idea of a symmetric complementary relationship yielding an approach with standard parameters, making it simple to apply with satisfactory accuracy. To our knowledge, this work presents the first application and evaluation of the complementary relationship in phreatophyte shrublands while utilizing the T-e with comparisons to actual LE via flux measurements.

AB We determined the influence of environmental factors (air and soil temperature, precipitation, photoperiod) on onset of xylem growth in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) within a dry inner Alpine valley (750 m a.s.I., Tyrol, Austria) by repeatedly sampling micro-cores throughout 2007-10 at two sites (xeric and dry-mesic) at the start of the growing season. Temperature sums were calculated in degree-days (DD) >= 5 degrees C from 1 January and 20 March, i.e., spring equinox, to account for photoperiodic control of release from winter dormancy. Threshold temperatures at which xylogenesis had a 0.5 probability of being active were calculated by logistic regression. Onset of xylem growth, which was not significantly different between the xeric and dry-mesic sites, ranged from mid-April in 2007 to early May in 2008. Among most study years, statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) in onset of xylem growth were detected. Mean air temperature sums calculated from 1 January until onset of xylem growth were 230 +/- 44 DD (mean standard deviation) at the xeric site and 205 +/- 36 DD at the dry-mesic site. Temperature sums calculated from spring equinox until onset of xylem growth showed somewhat less variability during the 4-year study period, amounting to 144 +/- 10 and 137 +/- 12 DD at the xeric and dry-mesic sites, respectively. At both sites, xylem growth was active when daily minimum, mean and maximum air temperatures were 5.3, 10.1 and 16.2 degrees C, respectively. Soil temperature thresholds and DD until onset of xylem growth differed significantly between sites, indicating minor importance of root-zone temperature for onset of xylem growth. Although spring precipitation is known to limit radial growth in P. sylvestris exposed to a dry inner Alpine climate, the results of this study revealed that (i) a daily minimum air temperature threshold for onset of xylem growth in the range 5-6 degrees C exists and (ii) air temperature sum rather than precipitation or soil temperature triggers start of xylem growth. Based on these findings, we suggest that drought stress forces P. sylvestris to draw upon water reserves in the stem for enlargement of first tracheids after cambial resumption in spring.

AB Understanding the factors that shape community structure, and whether those factors vary geographically, has a long history in ecology. Because the abiotic environment often varies in predictable ways along elevational gradients, montane systems are ideal to study geographic variation in the determinants of community structure. In this study, we first examined the relative importance of environmental gradients, microclimate, and food resources in driving spatial variation in the structure of detrital communities in forests of the southeastern USA. Then, in order to assess whether the determinants of detrital community structure varied along a climatic gradient, we manipulated resource availability and microclimatic conditions at 15 sites along a well-studied elevational gradient. We found that arthropod abundance and richness generally declined with increasing elevation, though the shape of the relationship varied among taxa. Overall community composition and species evenness also varied systematically along the climatic gradient, suggesting that broad-scale variation in the abiotic environment drives geographic variation in both patterns of diversity and community composition. After controlling for the effect of climatic variation along the elevational gradient, food resource addition and microclimate alteration influenced the richness and abundance of some taxa. However, the effect of food resource addition and microclimate alteration on the richness and abundance of arthropods did not vary with elevation. In addition, the degree of community similarity between control plots and either resource-added or microclimate-altered plots did not vary with elevation suggesting a consistent influence of microclimate and food addition on detrital arthropod community structure. We conclude that using manipulative experiments along environmental gradients can help tease apart the relative importance and detect the interactive effects of local-scale factors and broad-scale climatic variation in shaping communities.

AB The large-scale spatial distribution of seafloor fauna is still poorly understood. In particular, the bathyal zone has been identified as the key depth stratum requiring further macro-ecological research [1], particularly in the Southern Hemisphere [2]. Here we analyze a large biological data set derived from 295 research expeditions, across an equator-to-pole sector of the Indian, Pacific, and Southern oceans, to show that the bathyal ophiuroid fauna is distributed in three broad latitudinal bands and not primarily differentiated by oceanic basins as previously assumed. Adjacent faunas form transitional ecoclines rather than biogeographical breaks. This pattern is similar to that in shallow water despite the order-of-magnitude reduction in the variability of environmental parameters at bathyal depths. A reliable biogeography is fundamental to establishing a representative network of marine reserves across the world's oceans [1, 3].

AB Modeling could be summed up as the task of reproducing the structure and imitating the behavior of complex real-life systems with components interacting with one another at different scales. In many disciplines of ecology, System Dynamics and more recently Individual-Based modeling have emerged as the major tools to support this task. These techniques have usually been considered until now as exclusive alternatives instead of synergistic tools. The present paper starts by presenting the two approaches, and compares them to identify their strong and weak points depending on the type of components constituting the system under consideration. Then we isolate a class of systems difficult or in some cases impossible to model dynamically using any of these approaches alone, because of conceptual limitations. We further point out the usefulness of merging the two paradigms inside of a hybrid modeling framework to handle this class of systems, and present what we consider as the elementary combination patterns of System Dynamics and Individual-Based modeling. Since the power of this promising approach has been unexplored in most fields of ecology, we suggest some possible applications illustrating its usefulness. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Aspen (Populus tremula L.) is associated with high biodiversity and provides high-quality forage for wild browsing herbivores in boreal and temperate ecosystems. The long-term persistence of aspen in many regions in Scandinavia has been questioned due to the historically high browsing levels. We here review the basic ecology, genetics and life histories of aspen in a browsing context. Browsers can suppress the regeneration of aspen and the relatively short lifespan of the trees result in frequent regeneration cycles and concurrent exposure to browsers. In the long term, browsing may reduce recruitment and delay maturation, increase mortality and ultimately cause a decline of aspen. Norwegian forest inventory data indicate a reduced recruitment rate of young aspen (diameter at breast height; 60-79 mm) during the last 25 years, but it is unclear whether this is all due to browsing. Regeneration may also be hampered by lack of disturbance. Recent genetic studies have shown that aspen may have substantial regeneration by seeds, which allows for effective migration. The main conclusion of this review is that although browsing may affect demography and local abundance of aspen, it is very unlikely to lead to the eradication of the species in Fennoscandia.

Locating these refuges has practical importance in tropical montane regions where a high diversity of climatically specialized species is threatened by climate change. Here, we use a combination of weather data and spatial modeling to quantify thermally buffered environments in a regional tropical rainforest. We do this by constructing a spatial surface of maximum air temperature that takes into account important climate-mediating processes. We find a strong attenuating effect of elevation, distance from coast and foliage cover on maximum temperature. The core habitat of a disproportionately high number of endemic species (45%) is encompassed within just 25% of the coolest identified rainforest. We demonstrate how this data can be used to (i) identify important areas of cool habitat for protection and (ii) efficiently guide restoration in degraded landscapes to expand extant networks of critical cool habitat.

AB Identifying congruence in the geographical position of lineage breaks and species range limits across multiple taxa is a focus of the field of comparative phylogeography. These regions are biogeographical hotspots for investigations into the processes driving divergence at multiple phylogenetic levels. We used spatially explicit statistical methods to identify these regions for amphibians across the United States. Significant clustering occurred in the Appalachian Mountains and in the general area of Alabama - a region underappreciated as an important amphibian hotspot. When the orders Caudata and Anura were examined separately, spatial clustering was still found in Alabama for both. However, in Caudata the Appalachians and California were also important, and for Anura, the Great Lakes region was highlighted. When species richness was statistically controlled, cluster hotspots shifted out of Alabama and the Appalachians and moved to broader swaths of the Great Lakes region, southwestern United States and California. The exact location of particular suture zones is probably a result of complex interactions between historical and ecological factors including physiography, climate and distance from glacial refugia. These contact zone and phylogeographical break hotspots are ideal arenas in which to test alternative speciation hypotheses and examine the extent of reproductive isolation using novel, integrative approaches combining modern methods in statistical phylogeography, ecological niche modelling and genomics.

ID ORDINATION; FIDELITY
AB Aim
   Introduction of a novel approach to the classification of vegetation data (species by plot matrices). This approach copes with a large amount of noise, groups irregularly shaped in attribute space and species turnover within groups.
   Method
   The proposed algorithm (Isopam) is based on the classification of ordination scores from isometric feature mapping. Ordination and classification are repeated in a search for either high overall fidelity of species to groups of sites, or high quantity and quality of indicator species for groups of sites. The classification is performed either as a hierarchical, divisive method or as non-hierarchical partitioning. In divisive clustering, resulting groups are subdivided until a stopping criterion is met. Isopam was tested on 20 real-world data sets. The resulting classifications were compared with solutions from eight widely used clustering algorithms.
   Results
   When looking at the significance of species fidelities to groups of sites, and at quantity and quality of indicator species, Isopam often achieved high ranks as compared with other algorithms.

AB Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles repeatedly forced thermal zones up and down the slopes of mountains, at all latitudes. Although no one doubts that these temperature cycles have left their signature on contemporary patterns of geography and phylogeny, the relative roles of ecology and evolution are not well understood, especially for the tropics. To explore key mechanisms and their interactions in the context of chance events, we constructed a geographical range-based, stochastic simulation model that incorporates speciation, anagenetic evolution, niche conservatism, range shifts and extinctions under late Quaternary temperature cycles along tropical elevational gradients. In the model, elevational patterns of species richness arise from the differential survival of founder lineages, consolidated by speciation and the inheritance of thermal niche characteristics. The model yields a surprisingly rich variety of realistic patterns of phylogeny and biogeography, including close matches to a variety of contemporary elevational richness profiles from an elevational transect in Costa Rica. Mountaintop extinctions during interglacials and lowland extinctions at glacial maxima favour mid-elevation lineages, especially under the constraints of niche conservatism. Asymmetry in temperature (greater duration of glacial than of interglacial episodes) and in lateral area (greater land area at low than at high elevations) have opposing effects on lowland extinctions and the elevational pattern of species richness in the model-and perhaps in nature, as well.

AB Assumptions of steady-state conditions in biogeochemical modelling are often invoked because knowledge on the development status of the modelling domain is generally unavailable. Here, we investigate the role of vegetation pool sizes on nonequilibrium conditions through model-data integration approaches for a set of sites using eddy covariance CO2 flux data. The study is based on the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model, modified (CASA(G)) in order to evaluate the sensitivity of simulated net ecosystem production (NEP) fluxes to vegetation pool sizes. The experimental design is based on the inverse model optimization of different parameter vectors performed at the measurement site level. Each parameter vector prescribes different simulation dynamics that embody different model structural assumptions concerning (non)steady-state conditions in vegetation and soil carbon pools. We further explore the potential of assimilating biometric constraints through the cost function for sites where in situ information on aboveground biomass or wood pools is available. The integration of biometric data yields marked improvements in the simulation of vegetation C pools compared to single constraints with eddy flux data. Overall, it is necessary to relax both vegetation and soil carbon pools for consistency with the observed data streams. Multiple constraints approaches also leads to variable model performance among the different experimental setups and model structures. We identify and assess the limitations of various model structures and the role of multiple constraints approaches for tackling issues of equifinality. These studies emphasize the need for establishing consistent data sets of fluxes and biometric data for successful model-data fusion.

AB The level and mechanisms of population mixing among faba bean (Vicia faba) rhizobia of different geographic origins (three ecoregions of China and several Western countries) were analysed by sequencing three chromosomal housekeeping loci (atpD, recA and glnII) and one nodulation gene (nodD). Eight distinct sublineages of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae (Rlv) were identified by concatenated sequences of chromosomal loci. structure analysis revealed admixture patterns of Rlv populations of different geographic origins. Recombination, particularly among these chromosomal loci, was revealed to be an important microevolutionary force in shaping the observed genetic diversity and the phylogeny of Rlv. The phylogeny of nodD is largely independent of that of the chromosomal loci, reflecting multiple gene transfers between sublineages and possibly selection imposed by different faba bean gene pools. The dominant nodulation genotype of faba bean rhizobia in the spring growing region of China is identical to the prevalent type of Europe, while the winter growing region of China has another related, but distinct, dominant nodulation genotype. Although several geographically specific sublineages of Rlv were observed, recombination and lateral gene transfer have driven the process of population mixing among different ecoregions of China or between China and countries to the west.

AB Studies of hybridization have increased our understanding of the nature of species boundaries, the process of speciation, and the effects of hybridization on the evolution of populations and species. In the present study we use genetic and morphological data to determine the outcome and consequences of secondary contact and hybridization between the butterfly species Lycaeides idas and L. melissa in the Rocky Mountains. Admixture proportions estimated from structure and geographical cline analysis indicate L. idas and L. melissa have hybridized extensively in the Rocky Mountains and that reproductive isolation was insufficient to prevent introgression for much of the genome. Geographical patterns of admixture suggest that hybridization between L. idas and L. melissa has led to the formation of a hybrid zone. The hybrid zone is relatively wide, given estimates of dispersal for Lycaeides butterflies, and does not show strong evidence of cline concordance among characters. We believe the structure of the Lycaeides hybrid zone might be best explained by the patchy distribution of Lycaeides, local extinction and colonization of habitat patches, environmental variation and weak overall selection against hybrids. We found no evidence that hybridization in the Rocky Mountains has resulted in the formation of independent hybrid species, in contrast to the outcome of hybridization between L. idas and L. melissa in the Sierra Nevada. Finally, our results suggest that differences in male morphology between L. idas and L. melissa might contribute to isolation, or perhaps even that selection has favoured the spread of L. melissa male genitalia alleles.

AB Selection pressures during domestication are thought to lead to an enhanced ability to use human-given cues. Horses fulfil a wide variety of roles for humans and have been domesticated for at least 5000 years but their ability to read human cues has not been widely studied. We tested the ability of 28 horses to attend to human-given cues in an object choice task. We included five different cues: distal sustained pointing, momentary tapping, marker placement, body orientation and gaze ( head) alternation. Horses were able to use the pointing and marker placement cues spontaneously but not the tapping, body orientation and gaze alternation cues. The overall pattern of responding suggests that horses may use cues that provide stimulus enhancement at the time of choice and do not have an understanding of the communicative nature of the cues given. As such, their proficiency at this task appears to be inferior to that of domestic dogs, Canis lupus familiaris, but similar to that of domestic goats, Caprus hircus.

AB Background: Gonadal and stress-related steroid hormones are known to influence auditory function across vertebrates but the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for steroid-mediated auditory plasticity at the level of the inner ear remain unknown. The presence of steroid receptors in the ear suggests a direct pathway for hormones to act on the peripheral auditory system, but little is known about which receptors are expressed in the ear or whether their expression levels change with internal physiological state or external social cues. We used qRT-PCR to measure mRNA expression levels of multiple steroid receptor subtypes (estrogen receptors: ER alpha, ER beta alpha, ER beta b; androgen receptors: AR alpha, AR beta; corticosteroid receptors: GR2, GR1a/b, MR) and aromatase in the main hearing organ of the inner ear (saccule) in the highly social African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni, and tested whether these receptor levels were correlated with circulating steroid concentrations.
   Results: We show that multiple steroid receptor subtypes are expressed within the main hearing organ of a single vertebrate species, and that expression levels differ between the sexes. We also show that steroid receptor subtype-specific changes in mRNA expression are associated with reproductive phase in females and social status in males. Sex-steroid receptor mRNA levels were negatively correlated with circulating estradiol and androgens in both males and females, suggesting possible ligand down-regulation of receptors in the inner ear. In contrast, saccular changes in corticosteroid receptor mRNA levels were not related to serum cortisol levels. Circulating steroid levels and receptor subtype mRNA levels were not as tightly correlated in males as compared to females, suggesting different regulatory mechanisms between sexes.
   Conclusions: This is the most comprehensive study of sex-, social-, and reproductive-related steroid receptor mRNA expression in the peripheral auditory system of any single vertebrate. Our data suggest that changes in steroid receptor mRNA expression in the inner ear could be a regulatory mechanism for physiological state-dependent auditory plasticity across vertebrates.

AB Pseudochondrostoma duriense and Achondrostoma oligolepis are two Iberian endemic cyprinid fish species that occur in sympatry over most of their distribution range and that are suspected to hybridize in nature. Here, we employed a combination of mitochondrial and microsatellite markers to explore the extent of introgressive hybridization between these fishes. Two natural hybrid zones were identified in different river basins. Introgression was bi-directional and both hybrid zones consisted mostly of parental genotypes/phenotypes (i.e. bimodal hybrid zones). Yet, they appeared to differ in the extent and direction of introgression, which supports the view that they constitute independent outcomes of different hybridization processes probably influenced by environmental features. Several discordances were found between mtDNA and microsatellite results, suggesting that this hybridization process has complex consequences and illustrating the importance of using independent markers to define accurately the hybrid status of individuals in the presence of high levels of backcrossing.

AB Senescence could depress prenatal and postnatal capacities of mothers to invest in offspring. Longitudinal observations on the blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii) revealed a quadratic effect of female age on fledgling production and cohort differences in rate of reproductive decline. By swapping clutches between females of different ages, we tested whether reproductive senescence is due to decline in egg quality or capacity to care. As laying mothers aged, egg size, ulna length of 5-day-old chicks, and ulna growth of second chicks up to age 30 days declined, and as rearing mothers aged, ulna growth and cellular mediated immune response of second chicks diminished. Oddly, senescent females (>11 years) produced more fledglings when rearing offspring of middle-aged females (8-11 years) than when rearing offspring of senescent or young females. Thus, senescence reduced egg quality and rearing capacities, and reproductive success of senescent mothers depended on prenatal effects associated with the age of the laying mother. Reproductive senescence of boobies may involve constraints on resources allocated to reproduction as well as adaptive adjustment of provision and care according to offspring value, implying that negative effects of senescence on offspring survival can be ameliorated by plasticity in postlaying or postnatal care.

AB We tested three hypotheses related to the functioning of mountain plants, namely their reproductive effort, leaf surface structure and effectiveness of CO2 assimilation, using archive material from contrasting elevations. Analysis of elevational trends is at risk of suffering from two major biases: a phylogenetic bias (i.e. an elevational change in the abundance of taxonomic groups), and covariation of different environmental drivers (e.g. water, temperature, atmospheric pressure), which do not permit a mechanistic interpretation. We solved both problems in a subcontinental survey of elevational trends in key plant traits in the European Alps and the high Arctic (northern Sweden, Svalbard), using herbarium samples of 147 species belonging to the genera Carex, Saxifraga and Potentilla. We used both species and phylogenetically independent contrasts as data points. The analysis revealed enhanced reproductive efforts at higher elevation in insect-pollinated taxa (not in wind-pollinated taxa), no increase in leaf pubescence at high elevation (as is often assumed), and a strong correlation between C-13 discrimination and elevation. Alpine taxa operate at a smaller mesophyll resistance to CO2 uptake relative to diffusive resistance (stomata). By comparison with congeneric low altitude polar taxa (low temperature, but high atmospheric pressure), the response could be attributed to the elevational decline in atmospheric pressure rather than temperature (a mean increase in delta C-13 by 1.4aEuro degrees km(-1)). The signal is consistent within and across genera and within species, suggesting rapid adjustment of leaf physiology to reduced partial pressure of CO2. These results offer answers to long-debated issues of plant responses to high elevation life conditions.

AB Dispersal capacity is a life-history trait that may have profound consequences for earthworm populations: it influences population dynamics, species persistence and distribution and community structure. It also determines the level of gene flow between populations and affects processes such as local adaptation, speciation and the evolution of life-history traits. It may play a great role in soil functioning by determining the spatial distribution of ecosystem engineers such as earthworms. Dispersal is an evolutionary outcome of the behaviour in response to the ecological constraints of the species. Hence different dispersal behaviour is expected from the different ecological types of earthworms. Nevertheless the dispersal behaviour of earthworms has been little documented.
   In this work we test a series of basic mechanisms that are fundamental and complementary to understand earthworms dispersal behaviour. We focus on the dispersal triggered by environmental conditions, a fundamental process usually termed "conditional dependent dispersal". We show experimentally in mesocosms that in one week: 1) earthworm dispersal can be triggered by low habitat quality, either through soil quality or the presence/absence of litter. 2) Earthworms can be subject to positive density dependent dispersal, that is the rate of dispersal increases when density increases; and 3) earthworm dispersal can be reduced by the pre-use of the soil by conspecific individuals that are no longer present.
   Our results suggest that earthworms may be more mobile than expected from previous estimations. and that they present high capacities of habitat selection. In the light of our findings we elaborate a behavioural scenario of earthworm foraging, and propose several priority working directions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While a wide variety of studies have focused on population variation in adult cross-sectional properties, relatively little is known about population variation in postcranial robusticity in immature individuals. Furthermore, the age at which the population differences readily detected in adults manifest during growth is also unknown. This research addresses these gaps in our current understanding through the analysis of immature humeral and femoral long bone strength. Cross-sectional geometry was used to compare the developmental trajectories of diaphyseal strength in Late Pleistocene Neandertal and modern human subadults to a sample of immature humans from seven geographically diverse Holocene populations. Population differences in size-standardized cross-sectional properties appear to be systemic and develop very early in ontogeny in the Holocene sample. In many cases, these differences are present before one year of age. In general, the Late Pleistocene fossil samples fit within the range of recent human variation in long bone strength. Population differences detected here are likely related to a combination of factors including activity patterns, genetic propensities, and nutritional status. These results highlight the complex mosaic of processes that result in adult postcranial robusticity, and suggest that further exploration of the developmental interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic influences on skeletal robusticity will likely enhance our understanding of adult postcranial morphology.

AB P>Humans are increasing both the deposition of reactive nitrogen (N) and concentrations of atmospheric CO2 on Earth, but the combined effects on terrestrial ecosystems are not clear. In the absence of historical records, it is difficult to know if N availability is currently increasing or decreasing on regional scales.
   To determine the nature and timing of past changes in grassland ecosystem dynamics, we measured the composition of stable carbon (C) and N isotopes in leaf tissue from 545 herbarium specimens of 24 vascular plant species collected in Kansas, USA from 1876 to 2008. We also parameterized a simple model of the terrestrial N cycle coupled with a stable isotope simulator to constrain processes consistent with observed patterns.
   A prolonged decline in foliar N concentrations began in 1926, while a prolonged decline in foliar delta 15N values began in 1940. Changes in the difference between foliar and atmospheric C isotopes reveal slightly increased photosynthetic water use efficiency since 1876.
   The declines in foliar N concentrations and foliar delta 15N suggest declining N availability in these grasslands during the 20th century despite decades of anthropogenic N deposition. Our results are consistent with progressive-nitrogen-limitation-type hypotheses where declines in N availability are driven by increased ecosystem N storage as a result of increased atmospheric CO2.

TI Phylogeny and evolutionary history of Leymus (Triticeae; Poaceae) based
   on a single-copy nuclear gene encoding plastid acetyl-CoA carboxylase

LA English
DT Article

AB Background: Single- and low-copy genes are less likely subject to concerted evolution, thus making themselves ideal tools for studying the origin and evolution of polyploid taxa. Leymus is a polyploid genus with a diverse array of morphology, ecology and distribution in Triticeae. The genomic constitution of Leymus was assigned as NsXm, where Ns was presumed to be originated from Psathyrostachys, while Xm represented a genome of unknown origin. In addition, little is known about the evolutionary history of Leymus. Here, we investigate the phylogenetic relationship, genome donor, and evolutionary history of Leymus based on a single-copy nuclear Acc1 gene.
   Results: Two homoeologues of the Acc1 gene were isolated from nearly all the sampled Leymus species using allele-specific primer and were analyzed with those from 35 diploid taxa representing 18 basic genomes in Triticeae. Sequence diversity patterns and genealogical analysis suggested that (1) Leymus is closely related to Psathyrostachys, Agropyron, and Eremopyrum; (2) Psathyrostachys juncea is an ancestral Ns-genome donor of Leymus species; (3) the Xm genome in Leymus may be originated from an ancestral lineage of Agropyron and Eremopyrum triticeum; (4) the Acc1 sequences of Leymus species from the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau are evolutionarily distinct; (5) North America Leymus species might originate from colonization via the Bering land bridge; (6) Leymus originated about 11-12MYA in Eurasia, and adaptive radiation might have occurred in Leymus during the period of 3.7-4.3 MYA and 1.7-2.1 MYA.
   Conclusion: Leymus species have allopolyploid origin. It is hypothesized that the adaptive radiation of Leymus species might have been triggered by the recent upliftings of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau and subsequent climatic oscillations. Adaptive radiation may have promoted the rapid speciation, as well as the fixation of unique morphological characters in Leymus. Our results shed new light on our understanding of the origin of Xm genome, the polyploidization events and evolutionary history of Leymus that could account for the rich diversity and ecological adaptation of Leymus species.

AB In many tropical bird species, both males and females maintain elaborate plumage traits. Although there is considerable evidence that many male plumage traits function as status signals that convey information about fighting ability, less is known about status signaling in females. We tested whether the carotenoid-based orange breast coloration of the female streak-backed oriole (Icterus pustulatus pustulatus) signals status during territorial interactions. To do this, we simulated territorial intrusions using taxidermic models and compared the roles of the sexes within pairs during territorial defense directed toward different types of simulated intruders. Females were more territorial than their mates during the breeding season, whereas males were more territorial than their mates in the nonbreeding season, contrary to patterns seen in studies of temperate zone birds. The coloration of simulated female intruders also influenced territorial responses: When presented with color-augmented female models, females responded with greater intensity than their mates, whereas the intensity of defense was similar for both sexes when presented with average-colored female models. The greater female response to more colorful intruders suggests that females perceive more ornamented females as greater threats to their territorial tenure or to their pair bond. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that female carotenoid-based coloration signals status in this species.

AB The solicitation behaviours performed by dependent young are under selection from the environment created by their parents, as well as wider ecological conditions. Here we show how mechanisms acting before hatching enable canary offspring to adapt their begging behaviour to a variable post-hatching world. Cross-fostering experiments revealed that canary nestling begging intensity is positively correlated with the provisioning level of their own parents (to foster chicks). When we experimentally increased food quality before and during egg laying, mothers showed higher faecal androgen levels and so did their nestlings, even when they were cross-fostered before hatching to be reared by foster mothers that had been exposed to a standard regime of food quality. Higher parental androgen levels were correlated with greater levels of post-hatching parental provisioning and (we have previously shown) increased faecal androgens in chicks were associated with greater begging intensity. We conclude that androgens mediate environmentally induced plasticity in the expression of both parental and offspring traits, which remain correlated as a result of prenatal effects, probably acting within the egg. Offspring can thus adapt their begging intensity to variable family and ecological environments.

AB Background: Among birds, corvids and parrots are prime candidates for advanced cognitive abilities. Still, hardly anything is known about cognitive similarities and dissimilarities between them. Recently, exclusion has gained increasing interest in comparative cognition. To select the correct option in an exclusion task, one option has to be rejected (or excluded) and the correct option may be inferred, which raises the possibility that causal understanding is involved. However, little is yet known about its evolutionary history, as only few species, and mainly mammals, have been studied.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We tested ravens and keas in a choice task requiring the search for food in two differently shaped tubes. We provided the birds with partial information about the content of one of the two tubes and asked whether they could use this information to infer the location of the hidden food and adjust their searching behaviour accordingly. Additionally, this setup allowed us to investigate whether the birds would appreciate the impact of the shape of the tubes on the visibility of food. The keas chose the baited tube more often than the ravens. However, the ravens applied the more efficient strategy, choosing by exclusion more frequently than the keas. An additional experiment confirmed this, indicating that ravens and keas either differ in their cognitive skills or that they apply them differently.
   Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that corvids and parrots may perform differently in cognitive tasks, highlighting the potential impact of different selection pressures on the cognitive evolution of these large-brained birds.

AB Rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) are the 2 most commonly used primate model species in biomedical sciences. Although morphological studies have revealed a weak hybridization at the interspecific contact zone, in the north of Indochina, a molecular study has suggested an ancient introgression from rhesus to long-tailed macaque into the Indo-Chinese peninsula. However, the gene flow between these 2 taxa has never been quantified using genetic data and theoretical models. In this study, we have examined genetic variation within and between the parapatric Chinese rhesus macaque and Indo-Chinese long-tailed macaque populations, using 13 autosomal, 5 sex-linked microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA sequence data. From these data, we assessed genetic structure and estimated gene flow using a Bayesian clustering approach and the "Isolation with Migration" model. Our results reveal a weak interspecific genetic differentiation at both autosomal and sex-linked loci, suggesting large population sizes and/or gene flow between populations. According to the Bayesian clustering, Chinese rhesus macaque is a highly homogeneous gene pool that contributes strongly to the current Indo-Chinese long-tailed macaque genetic makeup, whether or not current admixture is assumed. Coalescent simulations, which integrated the characteristics of the loci, pointed out 1) a higher effective population size in rhesus macaque, 2) no mitochondrial gene flow, and 3) unilateral and male-mediated nuclear gene flow of similar to 10 migrants per generation from rhesus to long-tailed macaque. These patterns of genetic structure and gene flow suggest extensive ancient introgression from Chinese rhesus macaque into the Indo-Chinese long-tailed macaque population.

AB Partial migration, variation in the percentage of a population that completes a migration, can be influenced by the local environment and condition of an individual. We examined the direct and interacting effects of habitat quality and gender on migration decision by manipulating population density and sex ratio in a factorial field experiment using aquatic enclosures. In partially migrating red-spotted newts (Notophthalmus viridescens), we measured the percentage of newts migrating to the terrestrial habitat vs. overwintering as pond residents. Density significantly influenced migration, with 63% of newts migrating from high-density enclosures compared to 39% from low-density enclosures. Newts also migrated earlier from high-density enclosures, but no significant effects of the sex ratio treatment were found. Females migrated earlier than males, and 64% more females developed the migrant phenotype, suggesting important sex-based trade-offs of migration. No differences were found between migrants and residents in initial body size, counter to our prediction that larger individuals would be more likely to remain pond residents. This study demonstrates experimentally that migration can be a plastic response influenced by both local density and gender.

AB The number of individuals involved in an invasion event, or 'propagule size', has a strong theoretical basis for influencing invasion success. However, rarely has propagule size been experimentally manipulated to examine changes in invader behaviour, and propagule longevity and success.
   We manipulated propagule size of the invasive Argentine ant Linepithema humile in laboratory and field studies. Laboratory experiments involved L. humile propagules containing two queens and 10, 100, 200 or 1000 workers. Propagules were introduced into arenas containing colonies of queens and 200 workers of the competing native ant Monomorium antarcticum. The effects of food availability were investigated via treatments of only one central resource, or 10 separated resources. Field studies used similar colony sizes of L. humile, which were introduced into novel environments near an invasion front.
   In laboratory studies, small propagules of L. humile were quickly annihilated. Only the larger propagule size survived and killed the native ant colony in some replicates. Aggression was largely independent of food availability, but the behaviour of L. humile changed substantially with propagule size. In larger propagules, aggressive behaviour was significantly more frequent, while L. humile were much more likely to avoid conflict in smaller propagules.
   In field studies, however, propagule size did not influence colony persistence. Linepithema humile colonies persisted for up to 2 months, even in small propagules of 10 workers. Factors such as temperature or competitor abundance had no effect, although some colonies were decimated by M. antarcticum.
   Synthesis and applications. Although propagule size has been correlated with invasion success in a wide variety of taxa, our results indicate that it will have limited predictive power with species displaying behavioural plasticity. We recommend that aspects of animal behaviour be given much more consideration in attempts to model invasion success. Secondly, areas of high biodiversity are thought to offer biotic resistance to invasion via the abundance of predators and competitors. Invasive pests such as L. humile appear to modify their behaviour according to local conditions, and establishment was not related to resource availability. We cannot necessarily rely on high levels of native biodiversity to repel invasions.

AB The transport of larval coral reef fishes to juvenile habitat inherently requires that they survive the planktonic journey; however, the processes governing survival-particularly those related to feeding-are not well known. Monthly sampling across the Straits of Florida allowed for analyses of the diets and diet variability of several co-occurring taxa of coral reef fish larvae from the families Serranidae, Lutjanidae, Mullidae, Pomacentridae, Labridae, Scaridae and Acanthuridae. The proportions of larvae with food present in the gut were high (0.94 to 1.0) for all taxa except scarids (0.04), and diets were generally narrow and predator-specific. Serranus spp. (Serranidae) diets changed little with growth and were composed almost entirely of calanoid copepods, while the labrids Thalassoma bifasciatum and Xyrichtys spp. consumed harpacticoid and cyclopoid (Farranula and Oncaea) copepods almost exclusively throughout ontogeny. Lutjanine and acanthurid larvae relied increasingly upon appendicularians with growth, and mullids exhibited an ontogenetic shift from nauplii to calanoid copepodites and appendicularians, Cluster analysis examining diet similarity among taxa yielded clear groupings: small acanthurids, labrids, appendicularian-feeders, and a fourth group consisting of subgroups of larvae with calanoid and mixed diets, Within larval taxa, canonical correspondence analysis indicated how diet varied with several environmental and larva-specific variables. The trophic niche breadth of 4 taxa decreased significantly with growth, while other taxa exhibited no significant change. These results highlight distinct differences between high- and low-latitude regions, most notably the taxon-specific trophic roles and the apparent niche partitioning of larval fishes within the diverse planktonic food webs of lower latitudes.

AB Home-range estimators are commonly tested with simulated animal locational data in the laboratory before the estimators are used in practice. Although kernel density estimation (KDE) has performed well as a home-range estimator for simulated data, several recent studies have reported its poor performance when used with data collected in the field. This difference may be because KDE and other home-range estimators are generally tested with simulated point locations that follow known statistical distributions, such as bivariate normal mixtures, which may not represent well the space-use patterns of all wildlife species. We used simulated animal locational data of 5 point pattern shapes that represent a range of wildlife utilization distributions to test 4 methods of home-range estimation: 1) KDE with reference bandwidths, 2) KDE with least-squares cross-validation, 3) KDE with plug-in bandwidths, and 4) minimum convex polygon (MCP). For the point patterns we simulated, MCP tended to produce more accurate area estimates than KDE methods. However, MCP estimates were markedly unstable, with bias varying widely with both sample size and point pattern shape. The KDE methods performed best for concave distributions, which are similar to bivariate normal mixtures, but still overestimated home ranges by about 4050% even in the best cases. For convex, linear, perforated, and disjoint point patterns, KDE methods overestimated home-range sizes by 50300%, depending on sample size and method of bandwidth selection. These results indicate that KDE does not produce home-range estimates that are as accurate as the literature suggests, and we recommend exploring other techniques of home-range estimation.

AB Recent accelerated trends of human-induced global changes are providing many examples of adaptation to novel environments. Although the rate of environmental change can vary dramatically, its effect on evolving populations is unknown. A crucial feature explaining the adaptation to harsh environments is the supply of beneficial mutations via immigration from a 'source' population. In this study, we tested the effect of immigration on adaptation to increasing concentrations of antibiotics. Using experimental population of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a pathogenic bacterium, we show that higher immigration rates and a slow increase in antibiotic concentration result in a more rapid evolution of resistance; however, a high immigration rate combined with rapid increases in concentration resulted in higher maximal levels of resistance. These findings, which support recent theoretical work, have important implications for the control of antibiotic resistance because they show that rapid rates of change can produce variants with the ability to resist future treatments.

AB Background: The Mus musculus musculus/M. m. domesticus contact zone in Europe is characterised by sharp frequency discontinuities for sex chromosome markers at the centre of wider clines in allozyme frequencies.
   Results: We identify a triangular area (approximately 330 km(2)) where the musculus Y chromosome introgresses across this front for up to 22 km into domesticus territory. Introgression of the Y chromosome is accompanied by a perturbation of the census sex ratio: the sex ratio is significantly female biased in musculus localities and domesticus localities lacking Y chromosome introgression. In contrast, where the musculus Y is detected in domesticus localities, the sex ratio is close to parity, and significantly different from both classes of female biased localities. The geographic position of an abrupt cline in an X chromosome marker, and autosomal clines centred on the same position, seem unaffected by the musculus Y introgression.
   Conclusion: We conclude that sex ratio distortion is playing a role in the geographic separation of speciation genes in this section of the mouse hybrid zone. We suggest that clines for genes involved in sex-ratio distortion have escaped from the centre of the mouse hybrid zone, causing a decay in the barrier to gene flow between the two house mouse taxa.

AB An important aspect of ecosystem sustainability is the ability to withstand and recover from disturbance or stress. in this study, we investigated the effect of a heat-disturbance on soil microbial biomass, microbial activity in response to the addition of organic acid (malate), and microbial community structure in a laboratory experiment. The soils investigated were from a jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest that had undergone rehabilitation following bauxite mining 12 years previously. Soils from a full factorial of two field treatments; contour ripping induced micro-topography (mound or furrow) and prior exposure to prescription fire (burnt or non-burnt), were sampled and found to exhibit treatment-dependent differences in soil biological and chemical properties. Exposure of soil microcosms from each field treatment to 90 degrees C and 120 degrees C for 20 min, resulted in a significant loss of microbial biomass C and malate-induced respiration in all soils, compared with non-disturbed control microcosms maintained at 15 degrees C. No significant changes were recorded following the exposure to 60 degrees C. There were no significant differences in the immediate loss of microbial biomass relative to control soils between field treatments (microbial biomass was approximately halved in size in all soils) and the microbial biomass size did not recover during 28 days of incubation. However, the resistance of malate-induced respiration following heat-disturbance was greater in the non-burnt soils, and in particular non-burnt mound soil. Multivariate canonical correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between the resistance of malate-induced respiration and bacterial community structure (by PCR-DGGE and to a lesser extent by PLFA profiles). No relationship was found between the resistance of malate-induced respiration and other soil chemical and biological properties. The resilience of malate-induced respiration was significantly affected by the soil micro-topography and only non-burnt furrow soil recovered to the respiration rate of the non-disturbed control. Resilience was positively related to the size of the microbial biomass but not related to the microbial community structure. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reviews results of experimental and field studies of downstream migration of young fish carried out in the Institute of Ecology and Evolution (Russian Academy of Sciences) as a part of the research programme on fish behaviour and ecology. Studies of fish migrations have been dominated by descriptions of migratory routes and proximate control of orientation. Behaviour and ecological factors influencing variability of downstream migrations of fish larvae and fry are still poorly understood. Life cycles of most of freshwater fishes can be roughly considered as a sequence of "residential" and "migratory" phases. Migrating, or just moving between microhabitats, fish are especially vulnerable to various threats including impacts of water abstraction systems. Abiotic (water flow velocity, rheogradients, turbulence, visual habitat heterogeneity) and biotic (foraging conditions, predators, competitors and parasites) factors can cause changes in fish spatial distribution as well as shift from residential to migratory behaviour. From the viewpoint of fish protection, these changes are important not only in the vicinity of water abstraction sites, but also in more distant parts of the aquatic system that should be taken into account in long-term assessments of impacts of abstraction on fish populations in regulated rivers. Besides macro- and meso-scale impacts that affect fish migrations and spatial distribution, micro-scale habitat heterogeneity (hydrodynamic and visual) are important as factors triggering and controlling various aspects of young fish behaviour. Interactions of water abstraction zones with fish populations have to be analysed at ecological (meso-scale spatial overlapping and long-term dynamics) and behavioural (effects of micro-scale structures and events) levels.

AB Micro-organisms play a central role in every ecosystem and in the global biomass cycle. They are strongly involved in many fields of human interest, from medicine to the food industry and waste control. Nevertheless, most micro-organisms remain almost unknown, and nearly 99% of them have not yet been successfully cultured in vitro. Therefore, new approaches and new tools must be developed in order to understand the collective behaviour of microbial communities in any natural or artificial setting. In particular, theoretical and practical methodologies to deal with such systems at a mesoscopic level of description (covering the range from 100 to 10(8) cells) are required. Individual-based modelling (IBM) has become a widely used tool for describing complex systems made up of autonomous entities, such as ecosystems and social networks. Individual-based models (IBMs) provide some advantages over the traditional whole-population models: (a) they are bottom-up approaches, so they describe the behaviour of a system as a whole by establishing procedural rules for the individuals and for their interactions, and thus allow more realistic assumptions for the model of the individuals than population models do; (b) they permit the introduction of randomness and individual variability, so they can reproduce the diversity found in real systems; and (c) they can account for individual adaptive behaviour to their environmental conditions, so the evolution of the whole system arises from the dynamics that govern individuals in their pursuit of optimal fitness. However, they also present some drawbacks: they lack the clarity of continuous models and may easily become rambling, which makes them difficult to analyse and communicate. All in all, IBMs supply a holistic description of microbial systems and their emerging properties. They are specifically appropriate to deal with microbial communities in non-steady states, and spatially explicit IBMs are particularly appropriate to study laboratory and natural microbiological systems with spatial heterogeneity. In this paper, we review IBM methodology applied to microbiology. We also present some results obtained from the application of Individual Discrete Simulations, an IBM of ours, to the study of bacterial communities, yeast cultures and Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in vitro cultures of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes.

AB Much of our knowledge on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning comes from studies examining the effects of biodiversity on biomass production within a trophic group. A large number of these studies have found that increasing biodiversity tends to increase biomass production, leading many ecologists to believe that there exists a general positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Here we argue that such a positive relationship may not be general, particularly for ecosystem functions other than biomass. Our argument centers on the potential importance of the negative selection effect, which operates where competitively dominant species do not contribute significantly to the function of interest. We suggest that negative selection effects may be potentially common for non-biomass functions, for which species competitive ability may often be a poor indictor of its functional impact. We conclude that diverse (positive, negative, and neutral) BEF relationships are possible for non-biomass functions and that for a particular function, the exact form of the BEF relationship may depend on how species functional impacts relate to their competitive abilities in the community.

AB Observed patterns of species richness at landscape scale (gamma diversity) cannot always be attributed to a specific set of explanatory variables, but rather different alternative explanatory statistical models of similar quality may exist. Therefore predictions of the effects of environmental change (such as in climate or land cover) on biodiversity may differ considerably, depending on the chosen set of explanatory variables. Here we use multimodel prediction to evaluate effects of climate, land-use intensity and landscape structure on species richness in each of seven groups of organisms (plants, birds, spiders, wild bees, ground beetles, true bugs and hoverflies) in temperate Europe. We contrast this approach with traditional best-model predictions, which we show, using cross-validation, to have inferior prediction accuracy. Multimodel inference changed the importance of some environmental variables in comparison with the best model, and accordingly gave deviating predictions for environmental change effects. Overall, prediction uncertainty for the multimodel approach was only slightly higher than that of the best model, and absolute changes in predicted species richness were also comparable. Richness predictions varied generally more for the impact of climate change than for land-use change at the coarse scale of our study. Overall, our study indicates that the uncertainty introduced to environmental change predictions through uncertainty in model selection both qualitatively and quantitatively affects species richness projections.

AB The present distribution of freshwater fish in the Alpine region has been strongly affected by colonization events occurring after the last glacial maximum (LGM), some 20 000 years ago. We use here a spatially explicit simulation framework to model and better understand their colonization dynamics in the Swiss Rhine basin. This approach is applied to the European bullhead (Cottus gobio), which is an ideal model organism to study fish past demographic processes since it has not been managed by humans. The molecular diversity of eight sampled populations is simulated and compared to observed data at six microsatellite loci under an approximate Bayesian computation framework to estimate the parameters of the colonization process. Our demographic estimates fit well with current knowledge about the biology of this species, but they suggest that the Swiss Rhine basin was colonized very recently, after the Younger Dryas some 6600 years ago. We discuss the implication of this result, as well as the strengths and limits of the spatially explicit approach coupled to the approximate Bayesian computation framework.

AB The "botanist effect" is thought to be the reason for higher plant species richness in areas where botanists are disproportionately present as an artefactual consequence of a more thorough sampling. We examined whether this was the case for US. counties. We collated the number of species of vascular plants, human population size, and the area of US. counties. Controlling for spatial autocorrelation and county area, plant species richness increased with human population size and density in counties with and without universities and/or botanical gardens, with no significant differences in the relation between the two subsets. This is consistent with previous findings and further evidence of a broad-scale positive correlation between species richness and human population presence, which has important consequences for the experience of nature by inhabitants of densely populated regions. Combined with the many reports of a negative correlation between the two variables at a local scale, the positive relation between plant species richness in US. counties and human population presence stresses the need for the conservation of seminatural areas in urbanized ecosystems and for the containment of urban and suburban sprawl.

AB Though observations on re-colonisation of post-fire sites in the Mediterranean Basin are plentiful, there still is an ongoing debate on the interrelation of fire regimes and species traits related to fire adaptation. Most of the studies found are restricted to particular species or claim to present community attributes. Therefore they often lack information for the evaluation of evolutionary evidence and historical contingency of the local fire regime and other abiotic conditions, which may act as selective pressure for plant regeneration strategies. Indeed, knowledge about the success of regeneration mechanisms and their interrelation with ecological factors is essential for the interpretation of the high spatio-temporal variability found in post-fire species performance. Such knowledge would be necessary to assess the potential of different regeneration mechanisms to cope with ongoing land-use and climate change-a crucial scientific challenge.A summary is given of the knowledge about the limits and potential of plant regeneration mechanisms after fire in the Mediterranean Basin, along with corresponding studies conducted in other parts of the world with similar climatic conditions in order to present the fullest possible picture. Moreover, the positive or negative impacts of particular parameters of a fire regime on different regeneration strategies (post-fire seeders, resprouters, and facultative resprouters) are explained and discussed in the light of published literature. To conclude, reference is made to scientific gaps that need to be filled in order to analyse species resistance and community resilience absorbing possible climate or land use changes.

AB Sexual isolation may arise when male mating traits and female preferences differ between species. Such divergence in mating traits is likely to occur when the strength or targets of sexual selection differ. Therefore, by comparing the traits under sexual selection in closely related species and the nature of preference for those traits, we can gain insight into when sexual selection contributes to sexual isolation and how it does so. Collecting these data is no easy undertaking. To simplify this comparison, I use the presence and extent of condition dependence in traits to determine whether directional sexual selection is acting on them. Condition dependence thus serves as a signature of sexual selection. I investigate differences in sexual selection on red nuptial colour in limnetic-benthic species pairs of three-spined sticklebacks. I evaluate condition dependence by comparing the strength of the relationship between colour and condition, and the magnitude of variance in red nuptial colour to other colour traits and to nonsexual traits. I find that limnetic males have strong condition-dependent expression of red nuptial colour whereas benthic males have at most weak condition-dependent expression. Ancestral anadromous males show no condition dependence. This suggests that colour is under strong directional sexual selection only in limnetics and that this is the derived state. Moreover, I find that the strength of female preference for red is related to the extent of condition dependence. The extent of condition dependence is also associated with the importance of colour differences to mate recognition. These results show that differences between these species in the action of sexual selection underlie their sexual isolation.

AB 1 Local abiotic factors are likely to play a crucial role in modifying the relative abundance of native and exotic species in plant communities. Natural gradients provide an ideal opportunity to test this hypothesis.
   2 In a coastal dune system in northern California, we used comparative and experimental studies to evaluate how a wind and soil texture gradient influences the relative abundance of native and exotic plant species in this community.
   3 We detected small-scale spatial variation in soil texture along a 200-m gradient from relatively sheltered to more exposed. Sand coarseness significantly increased with exposure while soil nitrate levels significantly decreased. The more extreme end of the gradient was also subject to greater wind speeds and less soil moisture.
   4 The plant community consistently responded to this gradient in the 7 years censused. Species richness decreased with exposure, cover of natives decreased and cover of exotics increased at the more extreme end of the gradient.
   5 A single-season wind-shelter experiment similarly shifted the balance between native and exotic species. Shelters decreased the relative density of exotic species and increased the relative density of natives regardless of position on the gradient.
   6 These comparative and manipulative findings both suggest that a single factor, wind, at least partially explains the success of exotic species in a coastal dune plant community. This supports the hypothesis that local abiotic conditions can explain differences in invasibility within a plant community.

AB Patch-based landscape metrics can be biased by the boundaries and the extent of a reporting unit if the boundaries fragment patches. We call this the "boundary problem''. The effective mesh size m(eff) is a convenient method to quantify landscape fragmentation, that is based on the probability that two points chosen randomly in a region will be connected, e. g., not be separated by roads, railroads, or urban development. The cutting-out (CUT) procedure, used in the original computation of m(eff), suffers from the boundary problem because the boundaries of the reporting units are considered to be additional barriers. Therefore, m(eff) will be underestimated, particularly if reporting units are embedded within the broader landscape. In this paper, we present a solution to overcome this limitation by a new method called "cross-boundary connections'' (CBC) procedure. It attributes the connections between two points that are located in different reporting units to both reporting units. We systematically compare the CBC procedure to the CUT procedure and show that the boundary problem is intrinsic to the CUT procedure, while the CBC procedure is independent of the size and administrative boundaries of reporting units. In addition, we elucidate the superior performance of the new procedure in the case study of South Tyrol where meff is being used for sustainability reporting on the level of municipalities. The new CBC procedure eliminates the bias due to the boundaries and the size of reporting units in measuring landscape fragmentation through m(eff).

AB Although generally considered as beneficial components of dietary fats, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been suspected to compromise maximum lifespan (MLSP) in mammals. Specifically, high amounts of phospholipid PUFAs are thought to impair lifespan due to an increase in the susceptibility of membranes to lipid peroxidation and its damaging effect on cellular molecules. Also, there is evidence from in vitro studies suggesting that highly unsaturated PUFAs elevate basal metabolic rate (BMR). Previous comparative studies in this context were based on small sample sizes, however, and, except for one study, failed to address possible confounding influences of body weight and taxonomic relations between species. Therefore, we determined phospholipid membrane composition in skeletal muscle from 42 mammalian species to test for a relation with published data on MLSP, and with literature data on BMR (30 species). Using statistical models that adjust for the effects of body weight and phylogeny, we found that among mammals, MLSP indeed decreases as the ratio of n-3 to n-6 PUFAs increases. In contrast to previous studies, we found, however, no relation between MLSP and either membrane unsaturation (i.e. PUFA content or number of double bonds) or to the very long-chain, highly unsaturated docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Similarly, our data set gave no evidence for any notable relation between muscle phospholipid fatty acid composition and BMR, or MLSP and BMR in mammals. These results contradict the 'membrane pacemaker theory of aging', that is, the concept of a direct link between high amounts of membrane PUFAs, elevated BMR, and thus, impaired longevity.

AB The citation frequency of papers on invasion ecology published between 1981 and 2003 and that had accumulated at least 30 citations on the Web of Science on 9 August 2006 was analysed. The dataset comprised 329 papers and 27,240 citations. For each paper, the total number of citations was recorded and the annual citation rate (number of citations per year) was calculated. Papers were classified into broad research fields: plant invasions, animal invasions, biological control, and general papers (reviews and syntheses). Eight papers were cited more than 300 times, five of them dealt with general topics, and the mean value of the total number of citations across the whole data set is 82.8 +/- 73.1. The mean annual citation rate is 11.5 +/- 11.3 citations per year; six studies received on average at least 50 citations each year. About a half (50.8%) of papers in the data set deal with plant invasions. General papers are significantly more cited than papers from the other categories. The annual citation rate increased with time over the analysed period (1981-2003), by 1.0 citations per year. To compare the trends in invasion ecology with those in other fields of ecology, comparable data were compiled for population ecology and dynamics, and global change. The annual citation rate for invasion ecology as a whole increased faster than that for population ecology and dynamics, but not exponentially as is the case with studies on global change. The best-cited papers on invasion ecology were distributed among most of the top ecology journals. Those published in Oikos, Journal of Ecology, Ecological Applications and BioScience are cited 3.8-5.8 times more than the average for these journals (based on the impact factor). Papers on biodiversity, community ecology, impact, invasibility, dispersal, population ecology, competition, resources, genetical issues, biological control and species invasiveness received the highest total number of citations. However, measured by the annual citation rate, the hottest current topics in invasion ecology are the effect of global change on invasions, the role of natural enemies, character of the invasion process, evolutionary aspects, invasibility of communities and ecosystem processes. Some topics are disproportionally more cited than studied and vice versa. Studies on plant and animal invasions differ in focus: the topics of invasibility, biodiversity, resources, species invasiveness and population genetics are more emphasized in botanical studies, dispersal, competition, impact and pathways in papers dealing with animal invasions. Studies of grasslands and marine environment are most frequently cited in botanical and zoological studies, respectively. Most of the highly cited papers deal with multiple species; only 14 plant species and four animal species are the primary focus of one or more of the highly-cited papers. Twenty-two authors (4.5% of the total involved in the papers analysed), each with seven or more contributions cited at least 30 times, together contributed 49.4% of the most-cited papers, and attracted 55.6% of the total number of citations.

AB Mesic grasslands in North America and South Africa share many structural attributes, but less is known of their functional similarities. We assessed the control of a key ecosystem process, aboveground net primary production (ANPP), by interannual variation in precipitation amount and pattern via analysis of data sets (15- and 24-year periods) from long-term research programs on each continent. Both sites were dominated by C-4 grasses and had similar growing season climates; thus, we expected convergence in precipitation-ANPP relationships. Lack of convergence, however, would support an alternative hypothesis-that differences in evolutionary history and purportedly greater climatic variability in South Africa fundamentally alter the functioning of southern versus northern hemisphere grasslands. Neither mean annual precipitation nor mean ANPP differed between the South African and North American sites (838 vs. 857 mm/year, 423.5 vs. 461.4 g/m(2) respectively) and growing season precipitation-ANPP relationships were similar. Despite overall convergence, there were differences between sites in how the seasonal timing of precipitation affected ANPP. In particular, interannual variability in precipitation that fell during the first half of the growing season strongly affected annual ANPP in South Africa (P < 0.01), but was not related to ANPP in North America (P = 0.098). Both sites were affected similarly by late season precipitation. Divergence in the seasonal course of available soil moisture (chronically low in the winter and early spring in the South African site vs. high in the North American site) is proposed as a key contingent factor explaining differential sensitivity in ANPP to early season precipitation in these two grasslands. These long-term data sets provided no support for greater rainfall, temperature or ANPP variability in the South African versus the North American site. However, greater sensitivity of ANPP to early season precipitation in the South African grassland suggests that future patterns of productivity may be more responsive to seasonal changes in climate compared with the North American site.

AB Questions: 1. What are the distribution and habitat associations of non-native (neophyte) species in riparian zones? 2. Are there significant differences, in terms of plant species diversity, composition, habitat condition and species attributes, between plant communities where non-natives are present or abundant and those where non-natives are absent or infrequent? 3. Are the observed differences generic to non-natives or do individual non-native species differ in their vegetation associations?
   Location: West Midlands Conurbation (WMC), UK.
   Methods: 56 sites were located randomly on four rivers across the WMC. Ten 2 m x 2 m quadrats were placed within 15 m of the river to sample vegetation within the floodplain at each site. All vascular plants were recorded along with site information such as surrounding land use and habitat types.
   Results: Non-native species were found in many vegetation types and on all rivers in the WMC. There were higher numbers of non-natives on more degraded, human-modified rivers. More non-native species were found in woodland, scrub and tall herb habitats than in grasslands. We distinguish two types of communities with non-natives. In communities colonized following disturbance, in comparison to quadrats containing no non-native species, those with non-natives had higher species diversity and more forbs, annuals and short-lived monocarpic perennials. Native species in quadrats containing non-natives were characteristic of conditions of higher fertility and pH, had a larger specific leaf area and were less stress tolerant or competitive. In later successional communities dominated by particular non-natives, native diversity declined with increasing cover of non-natives. Associated native species were characteristic of low light conditions.
   Conclusions: Communities containing non-natives can be associated with particular types of native species. Extrinsic factors (disturbance. eutrophication) affected both native and non-native species. In disturbed riparian habitats the key determinant of diversity is dominance by competitive invasive species regardless of their native or non-native origin.

AB Natural hybridization between plant species often occurs in disturbed habitats and it is generally considered a threat for rare and endangered species. A different situation occurs in Mediterranean food deceptive orchids, where hybridization is a common phenomenon, as a natural consequence of their unspecific pollination system.
   Here, we present molecular and ecological evidence from a hybrid zone between Orchis mascula and O. pauciflora in order to address the consequences of hybridization on local orchid evolution and to assess conservation priorities for hybrids and hybrid zones in orchid conservation programs.
   We find that, although hybrids among the two target taxa are formed relatively frequently, hybrid zones often consist of F1 individuals, whereas backcrosses and later generation hybrids appear to be either rare or absent, presumably as a consequence of postzygotic reproductive barriers acting in these food-deceptive orchids. Experimental evidence further indicates that hybrids are less fit than the parental species in attracting pollinators and that parental taxa exhibit higher or similar fitness in sympatry compared to allopatric populations. Since introgression is not frequent as indicated by molecular analyses, fitness and phenotypic trait differences observed among sympatric and allopatric populations of the parental taxa may be a consequence of pollinator-mediated selection. Our experimental data confirm that hybridization is a natural phenomenon in food-deceptive orchids and that it does not pose a threat to their survival. Furthermore, sympatric zones provide the stage for evolutionary processes in orchids, and this peculiarity should be taken into account when devising orchid conservation strategies.

AB The objectives of this study were to investigate leaf breakdown in two reaches of different magnitudes, one of a 3(rd) (closed riparian vegetation) order and the other of a 4(th) (open riparian vegetation) order, in a tropical stream and to assess the colonization of invertebrates and microorganisms during the processing of detritus. We observed that the detritus in a reach of 4(th) order decomposed 2.4 times faster than the detritus in a reach of 3(rd) order, in which, we observed that nitrate concentration and water velocity were greater. This study showed that the chemical composition of detritus does not appear to be important in evaluating leaf breakdown. However, it was shown to be important to biological colonization. The invertebrate community appeared not to have been structured by the decomposition process, but instead by the degradative ecological succession process. With regards to biological colonization, we observed that the density of bacteria in the initial stages was more important while fungi appeared more in the intermediate and final stages.

AB The Atlantic herring Clupea harengus has played a pivotal role in the formulation of ideas relating to population structuring in marine fishes, yet considerable uncertainty remains as to the extent to which phenotypic and genetic differentiation coincide in such a highly mobile species. In this study, we examined genetic population structure across the major herring spawning aggregations in the North Sea and adjacent waters over 2 years, 2002 and 2003. We analysed 1660 spawning individuals across 9 microsatellite loci. Data were analysed using several approaches, taking into account the effect of location, year-class and sex, as well as pooling all individuals together, making no assumption as to the number of populations present in the data set. The results suggest the presence of a genetically homogeneous unit off Northern Scotland, and a temporally stable pattern of isolation by distance determined predominantly by the divergence of the English Channel samples and, in 2003, by the Norwegian spring spawners. Our data suggest that the current view of North Sea herring as a unit-stock might be adequate, but confirm the considerable degree of demographic independence of the herring populations in the English Channel. Despite major recent population collapses, genetic data indicated no evidence of bottlenecks affecting the genetic diversity of extant North Sea herring populations. Finally, despite evidence of weak population structuring, we discuss the risks of underestimating population differentiation in marine fish of large population sizes, and with reference to herring population history and dynamics, we attempt to reconcile the existing theories on herring population structure.

AB This study constitutes the first investigation of the phylogeographic structure of a forest bird distributed throughout the montane and lowland forest biomes of Africa. The key objective was to investigate the importance of Pleistocene climatic cycles on avian diversification across Africa. The Olive Sunbird is a relatively large polytypic sunbird widely distributed throughout evergreen, montane and coastal forests in Africa. Recently, it was split into two species, the Eastern Olive Sunbird (Nectarinia olivacea) and the Western Olive Sunbird (Nectarinia obscura), based on morphological grounds. Analyses of a 395 bp fragment of the mtDNA NADH subunit 3 gene with flanking tRNA sequences, from 196 individuals of N. olivacea and 86 from N. obscura indicate that genetic divergence levels are low (1.0-2.4%) across some 9000 km, from Ghana in the northwest of Africa to KwaZulu-Natal in eastern South Africa. Neither currently recognized Olive Sunbird species were monophyletic using either parsimony or likelihood tree-building methods. Phi(ST) values suggested that there was less variation partitioned among species than between most neighboring regions. Genetic diversity within the N. olivacealobscura complex was dominated by three star-like phylogenies linked to each other by a single mutational step and two subnetworks (IV and V) separated from the core star-like phylogenies (subnetworks I, II, and III) by five to six mutational steps. The dominant evolutionary mechanism shaping genetic variation within the N. olivacealobscura complex as identified by nested-clade analyses, appears to be one of range expansion possibly out of East Africa associated with a period of forest expansion during the mid-Pleistocene, some 1.1-0.7 million years ago. Mismatch profiles suggested that secondary contact has occurred between eastern and western lineages within the Ufipa Escarpment and possibly Zimbabwe, as well as between eastern lineages in the Kenyan Highlands and northern Eastern Arc Mts.

AB The amount of transmitted light in the understories of forest stands affects many variables such as biomass and diversity of the vegetation, tree regeneration and plant morphogenesis. Therefore, its prediction according to main tree or stand characteristics, without the need for difficult and costly light measurements, would be most useful for many different users and scientists. Transmitted global solar radiation was measured using tube solarimeters in the understories of 204 plots of even-aged coniferous stands of four species ( Pseudotsuga menziesii, Picea abies, Larix sp. and Pinus sylvestris) in a wide range of ecological and management conditions in the temperate climate zone. From these data, a range of simple models based on the Beer-Lambert law was built and fitted to predict mean stand radiation transmittance from basic stand traits and management features: stand basal area, stand age, time since last thinning, and last thinning intensity. Forest managers can use it to predict understory light availability and adapt their silviculture to various objectives.

AB Patterns and functioning of communities, which are determined by a set of processes operating at a large variety of spatial and temporal scales, exhibit quite high context-dependency and low predictability at the fine spatial scales at which recent studies have concentrated. More attention to broader scale and across-scale phenomena may be useful to search for general patterns and rules in communities. In this context, it is effective to incorporate hierarchical spatial scale explicitly into the experimental and sampling design of field studies, an approach referred to here as the spatial hierarchical approach, focusing on a particular assemblage in which biological interaction and species life history are well known. The spatial hierarchical approach can provide insight into the effects of scale in operating processes and answers to a number of important questions in community ecology such as: (1) detection of patterns and processes in spatiotemporal variability in communities, including how to explain the partitioning of pattern information of species diversity at a broad scale into finer scales, and the pattern of spatial variability of community properties at the finest spatial scale; (2) evaluation of changes in patterns observed in macroecology at finer scales; (3) testing of models explaining the coexistence of competing species; and (4) detection of latitudinal patterns in spatiotemporal variability in communities and their causal processes.

AB Using museum specimens, we studied temporal changes in skull size in two species of Japanese rodents, the large Japanese field mouse (Apodemus speciosus) and Pratt's vole (Eothenomys smithii = E. kageus) during the 20th century. We used the greatest length of the skull (GTL), zygomatic breadth (ZB), narrowest width of the skull across the interorbital region (IC) and the length of the upper cheek teeth row (M) as indicators to such changes. We found that GTL and ZB (but not IC and M) increased during the study period in mice, and that IC and M (but not GTL and ZB) increased marginally in voles. We attribute these changes to elevated ambient minimal temperatures, which increased food availability and energy savings for the mice, and required diet change in the voles.

AB Most research on the occurrence and stability of alpine timberlines has focused on correlations between adult tree growth and mean temperatures rather than on specific mechanisms. Timberline migration to higher altitude is dependent on new seedling establishment in the tree-line ecotone; however, reductions in photosynthetic carbon gain in establishing seedlings have previously been interpreted solely in terms of decreased seedling survival. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of abiotic factors (temperature, light and water) on photosynthetic carbon gain in young seedlings of the two dominant conifer tree species occurring naturally above (tree-line ecotone site, TS) and below (forest site, FS) a Rocky Mountain timberline in southeastern Wyoming, USA. Coincidentally, measurements were made during an unusually dry summer.
   Mean daily photosynthesis in seedlings of both Abies lasio-carpa (Hook.) Nutt. (subalpine fir) and Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm. (Engelmann spruce) was less at TS than at FS (19 and 29%, respectively). Minimum nighttime temperatures below 2 degreesC were more frequent at TS than at FS and were associated with reduced maximum photosynthesis the following day. Low midday water potentials were associated with a reduction in carbon gain at both sites early in the season, prior to snowmelt, as well as late in the season when soils began to dry. However, the lower photosynthetic rates at TS than at FS appeared to be unrelated to seedling water status because seedlings at both sites had similar xylem pressure potentials. Solar irradiance was highly variable at both sites as a result of uneven shading by neighboring trees, although this variation was substantially reduced on cloudy days (44% of all days observed). Compared with sunny days, cloudy days resulted in greater integrated daily carbon gain at both sites (41% increase at TS and 69% increase at FS), based on a simulated photosynthesis model. Photosynthetic responses to temperature, sunlight and water suggest that variable solar irradiance and nighttime temperatures were major abiotic factors limiting photosynthetic carbon acquisition in these young seedlings, especially for seedlings growing in the tree-line ecotone.

AB We used underwater visual census (UVC) to characterize fish assemblages among estuaries with different degrees of fragmentation on Andros Island, Bahamas. Estuaries were classified a priori into four fragmentation categories: totally fragmented (no surface water connectivity to the ocean), partially fragmented, minimally fragmented, and unfragmented (unimpeded surface water connectivity through the estuary to the ocean). Visual surveys (n=159) were conducted in thirty estuarine systems using snorkeling gear in four habitat types: flat, mangrove, rock, and seagrass. Fish species density differed significantly among habitat types and among estuaries with different degrees of fragmentation. Highest species density occurred in rock habitats in unfragmented or minimally fragmented estuaries; lowest species density was in totally fragmented estuaries. Assemblages in unfragmented and minimally fragmented estuaries were characterized by presence of reef-associated (e.g., damselfish and parrotfish) and transient marine (e.g., jacks) taxa. In completely fragmented sites, assemblages were dominated by species tolerant of temperature and salinity extremes (e.g., sheepshead minnow). Multi-dimensional scaling suggested fish assemblages in mangrove and rock habitats experienced the greatest impact of estuary fragmentation (i.e., the most differentiation among surveys in estuaries with different fragmentation status). Fish assemblages were especially variable among partially fragmented estuaries (i.e., estuaries where hydrologic connectivity was maintained by a culvert), suggesting hydrologic connectivity through culverts may not be sufficient to maintain habitat quality, recruitment dynamics, or upstream movements by vagile organisms. These data reveal effects fragmentation has on faunal assemblages, and demonstrates that faunal presence/absence may guide initiatives to conserve and restore sub-tropical estuaries.

AB A study was initiated in 1993 to evaluate the potential effects of both above- and below-ground competition exclusion on yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britton), sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) and American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) sapling growth along an understory light gradient ranging from 3% to 50% of full sunlight. We compared four different growth variables between a control and a treatment (trenching and manual removal of nearby vegetation). Height growth, diameter growth, height over stem diameter ratio, and crown area varied with light availability in all three species, whereas trenching treatment had no significant effect. Our results show that light is the main factor affecting understory sapling growth following a selection cut in this northern hardwood forest, at least up to 50% full sunlight. The unresponsiveness of these three species to below-ground competition is discussed in relation to a literature review in which both soil richness and species functional ecology are considered.

AB Colour polymorphisms can be maintained in a population if all morphs have equal fitness on average, if fitness is frequency dependent or if fitness functions cross for some environmental or social variable. We studied female-limited colour polymorphism in the Rambur's forktail damselfly, Ischnura ramburi, in which one female morph looks like the male. The most commonly cited hypotheses to explain this polymorphism involve an advantage to andromorphs of avoiding costly matings through male mimicry. An alternative hypothesis argues that males learn the most common morph and that the polymorphism is maintained by a rare-morph advantage of mating avoidance, irrespective of male mimicry. We tested predictions of the male mimicry hypothesis, learned mate recognition hypothesis (LMR) and two new hypotheses. We used censuses and a mark-resight study to estimate density, sex ratio, morph frequency and mating frequencies. We observed interactions to test for male mimicry and female competition and to evaluate the frequency of mating attempts. Andromorphs were less likely than gynomorphs to receive mating attempts in encounters with males, but did not mate less frequently, or attack males or interrupt oviposition by other females more frequently. Contrary to the LMR hypothesis, the rarer morph was more likely to receive mating attempts. Andromorph frequency was greater in older females than in younger females, suggesting higher mortality or dispersal of gynomorphs. Our results support a modification of the male mimicry hypothesis, the signal detection hypothesis. Together with past studies, our results suggest that the female morphs may be alternative mating avoidance strategies. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study ofAnimal Behaviour.

AB Immunocompetence may be especially important in long-lived species where infectious organisms may have detrimental effects upon future reproductive value of hosts. The resource demand for immunocompetence may reduce resource availability for reproduction and a trade-off between these traits has therefore been proposed. Capital breeders, such as the common eider (Somateria mollissima), rely upon accumulated body reserves during reproduction. Eiders lose more than 40% of pre-breeding body mass during egglaying and incubation and many females abandon their ducklings to other females after hatching. Results from our observational study show that levels of leukocytes (i.e., lymphocytes, heterophils and heterophil/lymphocyte ratio) are not related to body mass early in the incubation period. However, eider females with low initial body mass showed signs of immunosuppression (i.e., decreased late levels of lymphocytes) and increased response towards stressors (i.e., increased heterophil/lymphocyte ratio) later in the incubation period. Moreover, females with low lymphocyte levels more frequently abandoned their brood, and females abandoning young had an increased return rate to the next breeding season. However, among brood abandoning females return rate was lower for the females with low lymphocyte levels. These results suggest that immunosuppression, as indicated by low lymphocyte levels, is a reproductive cost that may be partly compensated for by abandoning young.

AB 1. Allocational shifts in response to light may be an important factor in allowing plants to survive in shade, while increasing their extension rates and competitive ability in sun. To investigate this response, the allocation of above-ground growth between leaves, branches and stems was studied in saplings of Acer pensylvanicum L. and Castenea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh. in the Appalachian mountains of western Virginia, USA. Measurements of current leaf biomass, current and past year leaf numbers and the growth ring widths of branches and stem were used to estimate biomass partitioning for saplings growing in locations ranging from forest understorey to large openings.
   2. Both species showed higher leaf area per unit leaf biomass (SLA) and higher allocation of above-ground growth to leaves in shade than in sun.
   3. There were no differences between species in the slopes of the relationships of allocation and SLA vs estimated irradiance, but SLA was significantly greater in A. pensylvanicum than in C. dentata at a given light level. Hence, somewhat lower production per unit leaf area is required to maintain the canopy in A. pensylvanicum, consistent with foresters' ratings of greater shade tolerance for this species.
   4. Greater foliar allocation in shade than sun has also been observed in broad-leaved evergreen saplings, but generally not in seedlings. This difference is probably related to differences in size and age between seedlings and saplings. Young seedlings typically show exponential growth with no immediate foliar losses, while shaded saplings lie closer to the steady state where new leaves replace old ones with little additional stem growth.
   5. Thus trees shift their allocation patterns in an acclimatory fashion, depending on their size and light environment, with the costs of replacing senesced leaves becoming of consequence as juveniles age.

AB Dramatic changes have occurred in agricultural landscapes of western: Europe since the 1950s. Their effects on biodiversity have been documented at local scales in terms of agricultural practices and management of uncultivated elements, more than at the landscape level. The highest diversity of agricultural landscape structure found in Brittany (France) is characterised by hedgerows surrounding arable fields and permanent grasslands. Some areas did not change much over a few decades, while others were totally transformed by agricultural intensification, field enlargement and removal of hedges. The present paper aimed at examining if this landscape context affected carabid beetles communities in hedgerows. In 11 sites of 1 km(2) each, land use diversity and heterogeneity, hedgerow connectivity and landscape openness were measured. Carabid beetles sampled in hedgerows were identified to species, and grouped in functional units. Multivariate analyses were used to relate the spatial distribution of insects to different parameters of landscape structure. The results show a significant relationship between landscape structure and carabid communities. Forest species were more abundant in dense hedgerow networks with a relatively high ratio of permanent grasslands. Landscape opening induced a shift in species composition; the relative abundance of large species decreased while small, mobile and more ubiquitous species were favoured. Two trajectories of landscape change were identified, which led to different responses in communities, the increase in maize for milk production opening the landscape far more than cereal crops associated with industrial pig or poultry production. Changes were most important in the latter case. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Theory and empirical results suggest that high biodiversity should often cause lower temporal variability in aggregate community properties such as total community biomass. We assembled microbial communities containing 2 to 8 species of competitors in aquatic microcosms and found that the temporal change in total community biomass was positively but insignificantly associated with diversity in a constant temperature environment. There was no evidence of any trend in variable temperature environments. Three non-exclusive mechanisms might explain the lack of a net stabilising effect of species richness on temporal change. (1) A direct destabilising effect of diversity on population level variances caused some populations to vary more when embedded in more diverse communities. (2) Similar responses of the different species to environmental variability might have limited any insurance effect of increased species richness. (3) Large differences in the population level variability of different species (i.e. unevenness) could weaken the relation between species richness and community level stability. These three mechanisms may outweigh the stabilising effects of increases in total community biomass with diversity, statistical averaging, and slightly more negative covariance in more diverse communities. Our experiment and analyses advocate for further experimental investigations of diversity variability relations.

AB One of the most important factors shaping animal sex-roles is the operational sex ratio, since a skew of this ratio promotes mating competition in the more abundant sex. In this study, we wanted to see if a change in sex-roles, related to an environmental induced change in operational sex ratio, could be demonstrated in a field situation. Common goby (Pomatoschistus microps) males build nests under bivalve shells and provide exclusive parental care. Therefore, available nest sites are crucial for successful breeding in this species and should also affect the operational sex ratio. We addressed the question of whether the availability of nest sites, through an effect on the operational sex ratio, affects courtship and mating competition in the common goby. We increased nest site availability in the field by adding potential nest material (bivalve shells) to one location. We then compared the reproductive behaviour of the gobies at this and another location with lower nest site abundance. In general, the reproductive behaviour differed as predicted. Under nest shortage, males occupied new nests and received eggs faster than under nest excess. Behavioural observations of nests revealed that males initiated courtship more often than females where nest sites were abundant, whereas female courtship dominated where nests were scarce. Males more often rejected females attempting to enter their nests under nest shortage, male sneaking attempts were also more common in this bay. Male-male aggression was frequent at both locations, whereas agonistic interactions between females only occurred in the nest shortage bay. Thus, males should be subject to sexual selection in both bays even though courtship roles differed. These results suggest that nest site availability affects mating competition and courtship roles in the common goby.

AB Changes in reef assemblages of corals and fishes following a tropical cyclone were assessed using data sets from (1) manta tow surveys of entire reef perimeters and (2) intensive surveys of specific sites, across 11 reefs lying close to the cyclone's track. Only one of the reefs experienced an obvious and immediate decline in mean coral cover (from 24 to 8%) due to the cyclone. The abundance and species richness of adult damselfish assemblages on intensive survey sites at this reef were not affected in the short term (6-8 weeks), despite the removal of 48% of living hard coral. Assemblages of adult fishes showed a similar lack of response at three other reefs where no significant habitat changes had occurred. Eleven to twelve months later, the total abundance of damselfishes had decreased substantially at eight of the sampled reefs, while the abundance of larger mobile fishes remained stable. We infer that the effects on coral assemblages reflect the short duration and orientation of the cyclone, the history of exposure to wave energy (influencing life-form structure and therefore degree of fragility), and the degree of consolidation of the reef matrix. The lack of short-term effects of the cyclone on adult fishes shows that these fishes can endure periods of intense underwater turbulence. The lack of change in damselfish assemblages weeks after loss of coral cover implies that this resource was not limiting adult fish densities. The reasons for widespread decreases in damselfish numbers 11-12 months after the cyclone are unknown.

AB In an attempt to define the upper thermal tolerance of coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch, we examined the relationship between the presence of this species and the summer temperature regime in 21 tributaries of the Mattole River or northwestern California. We characterized the temperature regime of cacti tributary by determining the highest average of maximum daily temperatures over any 7-d period (maximum weekly maximum temperature, MWMT) and the highest average of mean daily temperatures over any 7-d period (maximum weekly average temperature MWAT), by the use of hourly measurements throughout the summer. Coho salmon presence was determined by divers in late summer. Both variables that were used to describe the temperature regime provided good-fitting models of the presence or absence of coho salmon in separate logistic regressions, and both correctly determined the presence or absence in 18 of 21 streams. given the precious probability of a 50% likelihood of coho salmon presence. Temperature regimes in the warmest tributaries containing juvenile coho salmon had MWMT of 18.0degreesC or less or MWAT of 16.7degreesC or less: conversely, all of the streams where MWMT was less than 16.3degreesC or MWAT was less than 14.5degreesC contained juvenile coho salmon. These results, combined with historical and current watershed conditions that affect stream temperatures, suggest that management strategies to restore and conserve coho salmon in the Mattole River drainage should focus on the water temperature regime. Such a focus is also likely to benefit other declining species requiring cold water, including the tailed frog Ascaphus truei and southern torrent salamander Rhyacotriton variegatus.

AB Nest predation accounts for the largest share of nest failures in most species of neotropical migrant songbirds and contributes to low reproductive success. Increased rates of nest predation have often been related to habitat fragmentation and edge effects. However, recent studies have emphasized the mediating effect of landscape structure and composition on rates of nest predation. The identity of important nest predators at a local site also may vary regionally and in response to landscape characteristics. Needed are comparative studies and manipulative experiments that identify conditions under which nest predation is a critical concern and assess situations where management can be effective.

AB Sexual and vegetative reproduction of clonal plants phenotypically differ in dispersal distance, in the phenology of offspring production and establishment, and in the success of establishment. We applied a combination of analytical and of spatially explicit individual-based simulation modelling to calculate long-term fitness. We predicted optimal clonal plant life histories in a parameter space spanned by stolon number, stolon internode length, and relative allocation to sexual and vegetative reproduction. For a given allocation to sexual reproduction and number of stolons, fitness was optimised for rather short internode lengths under small disturbances, and for the longest possible internodes under larger disturbances. A trade-off between length and number of vegetative spacers drew parameters away from their unrestricted optima. Now, intermediate length and number of spacers led to maximum fitness under large disturbances. Simultaneous trade-offs between sexual and vegetative reproduction and between the length and number of spacers could also lead to fitness optima at intermediate parameter values, depending on the success of seedling establishment. We demonstrated that spatial habitat structure (1) selects for an efficient use of available space either by optimum internode length or by investment into seeds, which disperse farther than vegetative spacers, and (2) leads to an interaction between trade-offs. We conclude, that dispersal distance, i.e. a spatial life-history component, and trade-offs must be included in considerations on adaptive evolution of clonal life histories.

AB Disturbance regimes strongly determine vegetation patterns and succession in the boreal landscape. One of the current challenges for boreal vegetation modellers is to represent disturbance agents as dynamic factors that can respond to climate change. Outbreak species of insects and plant pathogens can cause marked changes in vegetation patterns and should be incorporated into vegetation change models. This introduction to the ecology of boreal biotic disturbance agents is designed as a brief overview for global change researchers and modellers. We discuss the importance of biotic disturbance agents in the boreal forest, offer an overview of their ecology, and review modelling approaches. We illustrate these issues with examples from different systems, drawing largely from our experience with bark beetles.

AB A total of 66 algal species representing 32 genera were recovered from soils of 10 sites in the Catavina region of the Central Desert of Baja California, Mexico. The most common species encountered were the cyanophytes;Nostoc commune and Schizothrix calcicola, the chlorophyte Myrmecia astigmatica, and the diatoms Hantzschia amphioxys, Hantzschia amphyoxys f. capitata, Luticola cohnii, Luticola mutica, and Pinnularia borealis var. scalaris. Nine species not found in any previous studies of North American desert soils were present in our study sites, including 3 taxa new to science: Cylindrocystis brebissonii var. deserti, var. nov.; Elakatothrix obtusata, sp. nov.; and Fasciculochloris mexicana, sp. nov. Attempts to correlate species composition with soil chemical and physical parameters were unsuccessful apart from a pH effect on cyanobacterial distribution. Overall composition of the soil algal community in the Catavina region is distinct from other desert sites we have studied, although some cosmopolitan desert soil taxa were present.

AB Management options in commercial forestry include choice of conifers or broadleaves, rotation length, stand size and grazing regime. Each factor potentially affects the conservation value of woodland for birds. Relationships between these factors and the structure and composition of breeding bird communities were examined in 69 stands distributed across a range of plantations composed of predominantly native broadleaved and non-native coniferous trees in the Forest of Dean, western England, in 1992 and 1993. Each stand was classified as one: of three high forest types: broadleaved, coniferous or mixed broadleaves and conifers. Stand size had no effect on bird communities. Species richness and overall bird abundance increased with forest age when all forest types were combined. Within stands of similar ages, there were no consistent differences in species richness or overall bird abundance between the three forest types or between grazed and ungrazed stands. However, bird communities in mixed stands were intermediate in their overall species composition to those in broadleaved and coniferous stands. Regression and gradient analyses (CCA and PCA) revealed that major gradients in the species composition of the bird communities were associated with stand age and with tree species composition. The proportion of individuals contributed by hole-nesting species was higher in broadleaved than coniferous stands and increased with stand age. The proportion of individuals contributed by migrants was higher in especially the early years, but also in the late years of the rotation. The proportion of migrants was higher in ungrazed than in grazed stands and increased with openness of the canopy and development of low vegetation. The diversity of stands in terms of tree sizes and tree species was positively correlated with both number of bird species and overall bird abundance. The relevance of these findings is discussed in relation to the integration of bird conservation into coniferous forestry, focusing particularly on the value of broadleaved stands and the effects on bird communities of stand structure and grazing pressure.

AB Recent environmental change in Lake Baikal has been attributed to anthropogenic influences on the ecosystem, especially through pollution and cultural eutrophication. These hypotheses are tested in this paper principally by diatom analyses in 20 short sediment cores. Most of the cores were collected with a new type of box corer specifically designed for use on Lake Baikal. Most cores contain a good sediment record but turbidites occur in some sediment profiles which may he best recognized using a combination of techniques, such as radiometric dating and percentage dry weight analyses. The most recent sediments, especially those in the southern basin and in the very north of Baikal, contain a record of anthropogenic contamination in the form of lead and spheroidal carbonaceous particles, which confirms that the southern basin of Baikal is most affected by atmospheric sources of pollution. However, there is no sedimentary diatom evidence indicating offshore water quality deterioration in Baikal owing to air pollution or eutrophication. Small increases in diatoms which indicate nutrient enrichment (e.g. Stephanodiscus minutulus, Synedra acus v. radians and Synedra acus v. acus) may reflect local eutrophication of the shallow waters close to the Selenga Delta and certain coastal sites in the southern basin near to the Baikalsk paper and pulp mill. By using numerical techniques, Lake Baikal can be split into at least four regions on the basis of its surface sediment flora: the south, middle and north basins, and the shallow waters surrounding the Selenga Delta region. Diatom analyses reveal that the endemic flora of Lake Baikal has been constantly changing over at least the last 2000 years and that these fluctuations are probably responses to natural climatic variability. Recent sediments of Baikal may be affected by taphonomic processes (e.g. dissolution) and turbidite deposition, and these must be taken into account when interpreting the sedimentary diatom record.
   The diatom flora of the lake is currently dominated by several species, such as Aulacoseira baicalensis, A, islandica, Cyclotella minuta and Stephanodiscus binderanus v. baicalensis. All these species, except for C. minuta, have become more common in the lake in approximately the last 130 years, and we hypothesize that these changes may be attributed to a number of different processes linked to an ameliorating climate after the end of the Little Ice Age. The results presented here have important implications for this recently designated World Heritage Site, with regard to future pollution controls and catchment management policies.

AB Surficial sediments from 32 Danish lakes were screened for subfossil chydorid (Cladocera) assemblages. Two data sets from 1965 and 1992 were examined by cluster analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) for lake classification. The best environmental variable to explain the 1992 species data was total phosphorus (TP) (r = 0.58, Spearman rank correlation), and NMDS defined three lake classes that were significantly different in communities (p < 0.01, ANOSIM) and in TP values. Canonical correspondence analysis found a strong relationship between the species data and log(TP) (axis 1 eigenvalue = 0.30, total inertia = 0.85, log(TP) intraset correlation = 0.92). Environmental variables were tested by forward selection and six variables were found to be statistically significant by 99 unrestricted Monte Carlo permutations. Weighted averaging regression and calibration models were established from the 1992 chydorid data and corresponding contemporary log-transformed TP data. The model's predictive ability was assessed by the bootstrapped coefficient of determination and the bootstrapped root mean squared error of prediction (r(boot)(2) = 0.79, RMSEboot = 0.24). The patterns of changes in chemical and biological variables (diversity, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) over the 27-year period placed the 32 lakes in six different response groups.

AB This paper reports a field investigation of interactions between juveniles and their mothers in the Australian sleepy lizard, Tiliqua rugosa. In their first spring season, juvenile lizards maintain home ranges largely within the home range of their mother. Juvenile home ranges are significantly smaller than those of adult males and females, and juveniles move significantly less often and significantly shorter distances than adults. While siblings were never found together in the spring, they showed a significant tendency to be closer to each other than if they were randomly located in their home ranges. Juveniles and mothers were never found together, nor was there any evidence for any positive (or negative) spatial association. Nevertheless, the extended tolerance of home range overlap represents a greater degree of mother-offspring association than has been previously reported for other lizards. Despite this, the level of parental care can only be described as minimal.

TI Factors influencing behavior and transferability of habitat models for a
   benthic stream fish
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY

DT Article
ID VIRGINIA STREAMS; SYSTEMS; TEMPLET
AB We examined the predictive power and transferability of habitat-based models by comparing associations of tangerine darter Percina aurantiaca and stream habitat at local and regional scales in North Fork Holston River (NFHR) and Little River, Virginia. Our models correctly predicted the presence or absence of tangerine darters in NFHR for 64% (local model) and 78% (regional model) of the sampled habitat-units (i.e., pools, runs, riffles). The distribution of tangerine darters apparently was influenced more by regional variables than local variables. Data from Little River and 37 historical records from Virginia were used to assess transferability of our models developed from NFHR data. In general, the models did not transfer well to Little River; all models predicted that either no (regional model) or few (local model) habitat-units in Little River would contain tangerine darter even though the species was observed in 83% of the habitat-units sampled. Conversely, the regional model correctly predicted presence of tangerine darters for 95% of the historical records. Principal components analysis showed extensive overlap in NFHR and Little River habitat which suggests that the two streams are ecologically similar. The suitability of Little River for tangerine darters was shown more clearly by principal components analysis than by our models. Because different limiting factors may apply in different systems, the elimination of potentially important ecological variables may compromise model transferability. A hierarchical approach to habitat modeling, with regard to variable retention, may improve transferability of habitat models.

AB Feed intake, specific growth rate and changes in body composition of age 1+ and 2+ Baltic salmon, Salmo salar L, were studied for fish held under constant temperature conditions. The 1+ fish (60 g) were reared for 6 weeks at 11, 15, 17, 19 or 23 degrees C and 2+ fish (250 g) were held at 15 degrees C. Feed intake of 1+ salmon increased from 176 kJ kg(-1) day(-1) at 11 degrees C to 275 kJ kg(-1) day-1 at 17 degrees C and decreased to 229 kJ kg(-1) day(-1) at 23 degrees C. Specific growth rate increased from 1.18% day(-1) at 11 degrees C to 1.59% day(-1) at 15 degrees C and decreased to 0.56% day(-1) at 23 degrees C. Optimum temperatures for feed intake and growth were estimated at 17.8 degrees C and 15.6 degrees C, respectively, and estimated upper thermal limits for feeding and growth were 29.0 degrees C and 24.1 degrees C, respectively. Models for feed intake and growth rate in relation to temperature and fish size are presented. The utilization efficiency of ingested energy decreased from 57% at 11 degrees C to 22% at 23 degrees C. For all groups of if fish, most (approximately 86%) of the weight gain consisted of water. Lipid deposition accounted for about 52% of the body energy gain irrespective of rearing temperature.

AB In May 1994, we investigated the short-term development of the planktonic community in the epi- and metalimnion of an oligo-mesotrophic lake (Piburger See, Tyrol), focusing on trophic links between protists and picoplankton, but also including phyto- and zooplankton. Uptake experiments with fluorescently labelled bacteria (FLB) and picocyanobacteria (FLC) were performed in order to compare the importance of both prey types as carbon sources for bacterivorous protists. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) were responsible for similar to 90% of total protozoan picoplanktivory (FLB + FLC); ciliates accounted for similar to 10%. A selectivity index related to prey density showed that both HNF and ciliates clearly preferred FLC over FLB. The mean cell size of autotrophic (prokaryotic) picoplankton (APP) was nearly three times larger (0.323 mu m(3)) and much less variable than mean bacterial cell volume (0.122 mu m(3)). Although APP biomass was on average only 8.6% of total picoplankton biomass, picocyanobacteria accounted for a mean 15.9% of total HNF carbon uptake. We calculated that total HNF grazing could match potential APP maximum growth rates at the beginning of the study period. A strong decrease in HNF individual clearance rate (CR) on APP was clearly related to a fall in the percentage of choanoflagellates (from 75 to similar to 10% of the HNF community). A simultaneous decrease in HNF biomass and CR was followed by a steep increase in APP abundance; APP abundance and HNF biomass were highly negatively correlated both in the epi- and the metalimnion (rs(EPI) = -0.879, rs(META) -0.907; P < 0.001). Total rotifer abundance increased by a factor of 50 within 2 weeks and was also negatively correlated with HNF biomass (rs(EPI) = -0.852 P < 0.001; rs(META) = -0.659, P < 0.05). HNF grazing was found to exert a strong short-term control on picocyanobacteria and this link was probably broken by an increase in metazooplankton, especially due to rotifer predation on HNF.

AB The hyperbenthic fauna of the subtidal channels of the Eems (N. Netherlands), Westerschelde (S.W. Netherlands), and Gironde (S.W. France) estuaries was sampled within a 15-day period in summer 1991. In each estuary, quantitative samples were taken at regularly spaced stations covering the entire salinity gradient from marine conditions at the mouth to nearly freshwater conditions upstream. The diversity of the samples and the distribution of the species along the main estuarine gradients were assessed. Hyperbenthic communities were identified using different multivariate statistical techniques. The species composition and the density and biomass of the dominant species of each community were compared among communities.

AB Migration by nematode larvae through the tissues of their mammalian hosts can cause considerable pathology, and yet the evolutionary factors responsible for this migratory behaviour are poorly understood. The behaviour is particularly paradoxical in genera such as Ascaris and Strongylus in which larvae undergo extensive migrations which begin and end in the same location. The orthodox explanation for this apparently pointless behaviour is that a tissue phase is a developmental requirement following the evolutionary loss of skin penetration or intermediate hosts. Yet tissue migration is not always necessary for development, and navigation and survival in an array of different habitats must require costly biochemical and morphological adaptations. Migrating larvae also risk becoming lost or killed by the host. Natural selection should therefore remove such behaviour unless there are compensating benefits. Here we propose that migration is a selectively advantageous life-history strategy. We show that taxa exploiting tissue habitats during development are, on average, bigger than their closest relatives that develop wholly in the gastrointestinal tract. Time to reproduction is the same, indicating that worms with a tissue phase during development grow faster. This previously unsuspected association between juvenile habitat and size is independent of any effects of adult habitat, life-cycle, or host size, generation time or diet. Because fecundity is intimately linked with size in nematodes, this provides an explanation for the maintenance of tissue migration by natural selection, analogous to the pre-spawning migrations of salmon.

AB Competition for light can affect exploitation of spatially heterogeneous soil resources. To evaluate the influence of shoot status on root growth responses in nutrient-rich soil patches, we studied the effects of shading and whole-plant nitrogen status on root growth in N-enriched and nonenriched patches by mature Agropyron desertorum plants growing in the field with below-ground competition. Roots in enriched patches had greater length to weight ratios (specific root length, SRL), indicating increased absorptive surface areas, compared with roots in control patches. Increased SRL was due to increased production and length of higher order laterals rather than morphological changes in roots of the same branching order. Although the pattern of root growth rates in patches was the same for shaded and unshaded plants, the magnitude of this response to enriched patches was damped by shading. Root relative growth rates (RGR) in N-enriched patches were reduced by more than 50% by short-term shading treatments (60% reduction in photosynthetic flux density), while root RGR in unenriched patches was unaffected by shading. Unexpectedly, plants with higher nitrogen status had greater root RGR in enriched patches than plants that had not received nitrogen supplement, again with no detectable effect on root RGR in the unenriched patches. Therefore, while both shading and plant N status affected the ability of roots to exploit enriched patches by proliferation, there was no stimulation or suppression of root growth in the unenriched, control patches. Thus, plants already under competitive pressure above ground for light and below ground for nutrients should be less able to rapidly respond to opportunities presented in nutrient patches and pulses.

AB A model is developed to predict some effects of climate change on anadromous fish. A review the relevant biology of salmonids, focusing on three species of Pacific salmon and on Atlantic salmon, shows that there is sufficient commonality to this biology that we can conceive of a ''general salmon'' model, which is then tailored to consider a particular species in a particular situation. Such a model is developed for the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) and is used to study the effects of climate change on its patterns of development and maturation. The main variables in this model are the weight and length of the fish (assumed to be related allometrically), the metabolic rate of the fish (a measure of how potential growth is converted into realized growth) and environmental properties such as food availability and water temperature. The main predictions are the pattern of development (maturation and smoltification) and feeding behavior in the stream. Given these predicted patterns of development and behavior, we can address the response to climate change. For example, if climate change leads to an overall decrease in the availability of food, then returning fish will be smaller (as expected). However, the return timing may change too, depending upon the metabolic rate. Similarly, assuming that streams are warmed by climate change, leads to a clear prediction about switches in the patterns of smolting as a function of size of the fish and metabolic rate. Methods for testing the proposed models are described.

AB Diatoms were identified and enumerated from the surface sediments of 65 lakes located on the Cariboo and Chilcotin Plateaux (British Columbia, Canada). These lakes span a large gradient in lakewater ionic concentration (fresh through hypersaline) and composition, as well as other physical/chemical variables. Almost all of the study lakes had higher salinities in the late-summer than in the spring. The lakes with spring salinities > 8 gl(-1) showed the largest seasonal increases in salinity. Ionic composition was similar in the spring and late-summer for most lakes. Both ionic concentration (i.e. salinity) and composition were important environmental variables that could account for the different diatom floras in the lakes. Diatom assemblages characteristic of carbonate-dominated and sulfate-dominated waters were identified. Other variables such as water depth and phosphorus concentration were also important.
   The majority (87%) of diatom taxa had estimated salinity optima < 3 gl(-1). Halophilic diatom taxa had broader tolerances to salinity when compared to the fresh water taxa, however taxa with narrow and broad tolerances could be identified across the salinity gradient. Species diversity was weakly but significantly correlated to lakewater salinity (r(2) = 0.18 to 0.3, P < 0.05).
   Salinity inference models were developed based on the relationship between the diatom assemblages and the spring, late-summer and average salinity. The correlations between the measured and diatom-inferred salinity, based on the spring (r = 0.95), late-summer (r = 0.94) and average (r = 0.95) salinity data, are high because there was an extremely strong correlation (r = 0.98) between the log transformed spring and late-summer measured salinities. These salinity reconstruction models provide a tool that can be used to infer past climatic changes as part of paleolimnological studies from appropriate closed-basin lakes in British Columbia.

AB We assessed salmonid production in summer in a second- and third-order montane stream in eastern Tennessee in 1987.  We sampled three stream sections, one containing exclusively brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis, one containing exclusively rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, and a third with a mixture of both species.  Population estimates for July and October 1987 revealed reductions in biomass over the 4-month period that ranged from 31 to 49%, whereas population densities declined by 32-46% during the same period.  Total net production during the 4-month period was low and ranged from 0.38 to 0.45 g/m2.  From June through September, the mean number of prey items per stomach ranged from 4.2 to 29.9, whereas the mean relative weight of stomach contents ranged from 0.12 to 1.34 mg dry weight per gram wet weight of fish flesh.  There was a strong positive correlation between the mean relative weight of stomach contents and the mean condition factor for a given date.  Calculated energy intake was below the level necessary to provide energy for maintenance metabolism.

AB The frequency and severity of drought are expected to increase due to climate change; therefore, drought tolerance of tree species should be considered before planting for maximal survival in the field. In this study, we examined the response of drought stress in two of the most popular plantation species: Sargent cherry (Prunus sargentii) and Japanese larch (Larbc kaempferi) based on the morphological and physiological characteristics. These plantation species are widely planted in central and northern Asia, especially in Japan and Korea, and also widely used for plantation purpose in northern Europe. Three different irrigation regimes of control (CT; 100% precipitation (P)), light drought (LD; 40% reduction of P), and heavy drought (HD; 80% reduction of P) were applied at the experimental site of Mt Jiri, the Republic of Korea. For morphological responses, both species experienced a significant decrease in leaf size in drought conditions; however, Sargent cherry and Japanese larch experienced reduced leaf width and length, respectively. On the other hand, leaf mass area (LMA, g cm(-2)) increased and branch growth decreased in both species under drought conditions. As physiological responses, drought stress significantly decreased maximum photosynthesis rate (A(max)) and electron transfer rate (J(max)) for both species, while stomatal conductance (G(s)) at A(max) significantly decreased only in Sargent cherry. Drought significantly reduced predawn (Psi(PD)), midday leaf water potential (Psi(MD)), and transpiration in Sargent cherry but not in Japanese larch. In mid-summer, carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) significantly decreased in Sargent cherry but only showed a reduction tendency in Japanese larch. However, the changes of delta C-13 were not significant in early summer or mid-fall. In the present study, both species showed isohydric and anisohydric characteristics, but Sargent cherry showed greater anisohydric behavior with a steeper slope (Y = 2.132X) and Japanese larch showed more isohydric behavior with a shallower slope (Y = 1.722X). Our results highlight that both species altered their morphological and physiological responses under drought stress; however, the Japanese larch showed greater resistance and resilience in morphological and physiological responses, and in plant-water relations. Therefore, Japanese larch would be more beneficial for plantations in water deficit regions than Sargent cherry.

AB The grand challenges that humanity faces-poverty, inequality, hunger, conflict, climate change, deforestation, and pandemics, among others-hinder the progress of sustainable development. These issues can be addressed only by fundamental changes in behavior, as well as in the modes and processes of production and of business more generally. In this paper we will develop the concept of responsible innovation and discuss the potential and limitations of various models of corporate governance with regard to responsible innovation. Our analysis imports from the political sciences theoretical and empirical insights into how alternative forms of participative and reflexive governance can help address the social and environmental challenges that society faces. The paper thereby offers examples of innovative corporate governance that can help to generate innovations that do good and avoid harm. We also illustrate the governance challenges and the role of responsible innovation in the advent of the new coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).

AB Our ability to predict invasions has been hindered by the seemingly idiosyncratic context-dependency of individual invasions. However, we argue that robust and useful generalisations in invasion science can be made by considering "invasion syndromes" which we define as "a combination of pathways, alien species traits, and characteristics of the recipient ecosystem which collectively result in predictable dynamics and impacts, and that can be managed effectively using specific policy and management actions". We describe this approach and outline examples that highlight its utility, including: cacti with clonal fragmentation in arid ecosystems; small aquatic organisms introduced through ballast water in harbours; large ranid frogs with frequent secondary transfers; piscivorous freshwater fishes in connected aquatic ecosystems; plant invasions in high-elevation areas; tall-statured grasses; and tree-feeding insects in forests with suitable hosts. We propose a systematic method for identifying and delimiting invasion syndromes. We argue that invasion syndromes can account for the context-dependency of biological invasions while incorporating insights from comparative studies. Adopting this approach will help to structure thinking, identify transferrable risk assessment and management lessons, and highlight similarities among events that were previously considered disparate invasion phenomena.

AB In contrast to previous studies, analyses now show that ocean acidification does not perturb important behaviours-such as the avoidance of chemical cues from predators-of coral reef fishes.
   The partial pressure of CO2 in the oceans has increased rapidly over the past century, driving ocean acidification and raising concern for the stability of marine ecosystems(1-3). Coral reef fishes are predicted to be especially susceptible to end-of-century ocean acidification on the basis of several high-profile papers(4,5) that have reported profound behavioural and sensory impairments-for example, complete attraction to the chemical cues of predators under conditions of ocean acidification. Here, we comprehensively and transparently show that-in contrast to previous studies-end-of-century ocean acidification levels have negligible effects on important behaviours of coral reef fishes, such as the avoidance of chemical cues from predators, fish activity levels and behavioural lateralization (left-right turning preference). Using data simulations, we additionally show that the large effect sizes and small within-group variances that have been reported in several previous studies are highly improbable. Together, our findings indicate that the reported effects of ocean acidification on the behaviour of coral reef fishes are not reproducible, suggesting that behavioural perturbations will not be a major consequence for coral reef fishes in high CO2 oceans.

AB Hybridization among naturally separate taxa is increasing owing to human impact, and can result in taxon loss. Previous classification of anthropogenic hybridization has largely ignored the case of bimodal hybrid zones, in which hybrids commonly mate with parental species, resulting in many backcrossed individuals with a small proportion of introgressed genome. Genetic markers can be used to detect such hybrids, but until recently too few markers have been used to detect the true extent of introgression. Recent studies of wolves and trout have employed thousands of markers to reveal previously undetectable backcrosses. This improved resolution will lead to increased detection of late-generation backcrosses, shed light on the consequences of anthropogenic hybridization, and pose new management issues for conservation scientists.

AB The ecology of fungi lags behind that of plants and animals because most fungi are microscopic and hidden in their substrates. Here, we address the basic ecological process of fungal succession in nature using the microscopic, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) that form essential mutualisms with 70-90% of plants. We find a signal for temporal change in AMF community similarity that is 40-fold stronger than seen in the most recent studies, likely due to weekly samplings of roots, rhizosphere and soil throughout the 17 weeks from seedling to fruit maturity and the use of the fungal DNA barcode to recognize species in a simple, agricultural environment. We demonstrate the patterns of nestedness and turnover and the microbial equivalents of the processes of immigration and extinction, that is, appearance and disappearance. We also provide the first evidence that AMF species co-exist rather than simply co-occur by demonstrating negative, density-dependent population growth for multiple species. Our study shows the advantages of using fungi to test basic ecological hypotheses (e.g., nestedness v. turnover, immigration v. extinction, and coexistence theory) over periods as short as one season.

AB Sperm morphological variation has attracted considerable interest and generated a wealth of predominantly descriptive studies over the past three centuries. Yet, apart from biophysical studies linking sperm morphology to swimming velocity, surprisingly little is known about the adaptive significance of sperm form and the selective processes underlying its tremendous diversification throughout the animal kingdom. Here, we first discuss the challenges of examining sperm morphology in an evolutionary context and why our understanding of it is far from complete. Then, we review empirical evidence for how sexual selection theory applies to the evolution of sperm form and function, including putative secondary sexual traits borne by sperm.

AB The extreme rarity of asexual vertebrates in nature is generally explained by genomic decay due to absence of meiotic recombination, thus leading to extinction of such lineages. We explore features of a vertebrate asexual genome, the Amazon molly, Poecilia formosa, and find few signs of genetic degeneration but unique genetic variability and ongoing evolution. We uncovered a substantial clonal polymorphism and, as a conserved feature from its interspecific hybrid origin, a 10-fold higher heterozygosity than in the sexual parental species. These characteristics seem to be a principal reason for the unpredicted fitness of this asexual vertebrate. Our data suggest that asexual vertebrate lineages are scarce not because they are at a disadvantage, but because the genomic combinations required to bypass meiosis and to make up a functioning hybrid genome are rarely met in nature.

AB Despite the urgent demand for sustainable mining, the revegetation and rehabilitation of areas degraded by mining activities remain challenging. Uncertainties about species selection, the management and control of alien invasive species and monitoring procedures require ongoing multidisciplinary research. Modern functional and phylogenetic approaches in community ecology represent powerful tools to enhance the entire rehabilitation process and to overcome these challenges, but methodologies that incorporate up-to-date phylogenetic information or knowledge about intraspecific variation along rehabilitation trajectories must be developed. Functional and phylogenetic criteria may play an especially important role in guiding the definition of faster-growing, more resistant species mixtures that can be applied in mine land revegetation and rehabilitation. Limiting similarity approaches may help to reduce biological invasions, enabling native vegetation to outcompete alien invasive species and aiding in the development of enduring mechanisms for controlling such species in rehabilitated mine land. Finally, incorporating phylogenetic and functional aspects into monitoring of the success of mine land rehabilitation with additional tools, such as remote sensing or metabarcoding, can enrich scientific knowledge about ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling, community assembly and resource availability while providing sound information about the success of revegetation activities. In the middle to long term, research activities on these topics can provide valuable technical recommendations for all aspects of the management of rehabilitated ecosystems, thus contributing to more sustainable mining.

AB Study objectives: To determine the effect of light exposure on subsequent sleep characteristics under ambulatory field conditions.
   Methods: Twenty healthy participants were fitted with ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) and wrist-actigraphs to assess light exposure, rest-activity, sleep quality, timing, and architecture. Laboratory salivary dim-light melatonin onset was analyzed to determine endogenous circadian phase.
   Results: Later circadian clock phase was associated with lower intensity (R-2 = 0.34, chi(2)(1) = 7.19, p < .01), later light exposure (quadratic, controlling for daylength, R-2 = 0.47,.2(3) = 32.38, p < .0001), and to later sleep timing (R-2 = 0.71, chi(2)(1) = 20.39, p < .0001). Those with later first exposure to more than 10 lux of light had more awakenings during subsequent sleep (controlled for daylength, R-2 = 0.36, chi(2)(2) = 8.66, p < .05). Those with later light exposure subsequently had a shorter latency to first rapid eye movement (REM) sleep episode (R-2 = 0.21, chi(2)(1) = 5.77, p < .05). Those with less light exposure subsequently had a higher percentage of REM sleep (R-2 = 0.43, chi(2)(2) = 13.90, p < .001) in a clock phase modulated manner. Slow-wave sleep accumulation was observed to be larger after preceding exposure to high maximal intensity and early first light exposure (p < .05).
   Conclusions: The quality and architecture of sleep is associated with preceding light exposure. We propose that light exposure timing and intensity do not only modulate circadian-driven aspects of sleep but also homeostatic sleep pressure. These novel ambulatory PSG findings are the first to highlight the direct relationship between light and subsequent sleep, combining knowledge of homeostatic and circadian regulation of sleep by light. Upon confirmation by interventional studies, this hypothesis could change current understanding of sleep regulation and its relationship to prior light exposure.

   IMPACTS; AGROFORESTRY; POTENTIALS; VEGETATION
AB Massive near-term greenhouse gas emissions reduction is a precondition for staying "well below 2 degrees C" global warming as envisaged by the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, extensive terrestrial carbon dioxide removal (tCDR) through managed biomass growth and subsequent carbon capture and storage is required to avoid temperature "overshoot" in most pertinent scenarios. Here, we address two major issues: First, we calculate the extent of tCDR required to "repair" delayed or insufficient emissions reduction policies unable to prevent global mean temperature rise of 2.5 degrees C or even 4.5 degrees C above pre-industrial level. Our results show that those tCDR measures are unable to counteract "business-as-usual" emissions without eliminating virtually all natural ecosystems. Even if considerable (Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 [RCP4.5]) emissions reductions are assumed, tCDR with 50% storage efficiency requires >1.1 Gha of the most productive agricultural areas or the elimination of > 50% of natural forests. In addition, > 100 MtN/yr fertilizers would be needed to remove the roughly 320 GtC foreseen in these scenarios. Such interventions would severely compromise food production and/or biosphere functioning. Second, we reanalyze the requirements for achieving the 160-190 GtC tCDR that would complement strong mitigation action (RCP2.6) in order to avoid 2 degrees C overshoot anytime. We find that a combination of high irrigation water input and/or more efficient conversion to stored carbon is necessary. In the face of severe trade-offs with society and the biosphere, we conclude that large-scale tCDR is not a viable alternative to aggressive emissions reduction. However, we argue that tCDR might serve as a valuable " supporting actor" for strong mitigation if sustainable schemes are established immediately.
   Plain Language Summary In 2015, parties agreed to limit global warming to " well below" 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. However, this requires not only massive near-term greenhouse gas emissions reductions but also the application of " negative emission" techniques that extract already emitted carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Specifically, this could refer to the establishment of extensive plantations of fast-growing tree and grass species in combination with biomass conversion to carbon-saving products. Although such deployment is seen as promising, its carbon sequestration potentials and possible side-effects still remain to be studied in depth. In this study, we analyzed two feasibility aspects of such a negative emissions approach using biomass plantations and carbon utilization pathways. First, we show that biomass plantations with subsequent carbon immobilization are likely unable to "repair" insufficient emission reduction policies without compromising food production and biosphere functioning due to its space-consuming properties. Second, the requirements for a strong mitigation scenario staying below the 2 degrees C target would require a combination of high irrigation water input and development of highly effective carbon process chains. Although we find that this strategy of sequestering carbon is not a viable alternative to aggressive emission reductions, it could still support mitigation efforts if sustainably managed.

AB Neonicotinoid seed treatments, typically clothianidin or thiamethoxam, are routinely applied to >80% of maize (corn) seed grown in North America where they are marketed as a targeted pesticide delivery system. Despite this widespread use, the amount of compound translocated into plant tissue from the initial seed treatment to provide protection has not been reported. Our two year field study compared concentrations of clothianidin seed treatments in maize to that of maize without neonicotinoid seed treatments and found neonicotinoids present in root tissues up to 34 days post planting. Plant-bound clothianidin concentrations followed an exponential decay pattern with initially high values followed by a rapid decrease within the first similar to 20 days post planting. A maximum of 1.34% of the initial seed treatment was successfully recovered from plant tissues in both study years and a maximum of 0.26% was recovered from root tissue. Our findings show neonicotinoid seed treatments may provide protection from some early season secondary maize pests. However, the proportion of the neonicotinoid seed treatment clothianidin translocated into plant tissues throughout the growing season is low overall and this observation may provide a mechanism to explain reports of inconsistent efficacy of this pest management approach and increasing detections of environmental neonicotinoids.

AB Females can benefit from mate choice for male traits (e.g. sexual ornaments or body condition) that reliably signal the effect that mating will have on mean offspring fitness. These male-derived benefits can be due to material and/or genetic effects. The latter include an increase in the attractiveness, hence likely mating success, of sons. Females can potentially enhance any sex-biased benefits of mating with certain males by adjusting the offspring sex ratio depending on theirmate's phenotype. One hypothesis is that females should produce mainly sons whenmating with more attractive or higher quality males. Here we perform a meta-analysis of the empirical literature that has accumulated to test this hypothesis. The mean effect size was small (r = 0.064-0.095; i.e. explaining <1% of variation in offspring sex ratios) but statistically significant in the predicted direction. It was, however, not robust to correction for an apparent publication bias towards significantly positive results. We also examined the strength of the relationship using different indices of male attractiveness/quality that have been invoked by researchers (ornaments, behavioural displays, female preference scores, body condition, male age, body size, and whether a male is a within-pair or extra-pair mate). Only ornamentation and body size significantly predicted the proportion of sons produced. We obtained similar results regardless of whether we ran a standard random-effects meta-analysis, or a multi-level, Bayesian model that included a correction for phylogenetic non-independence. A moderate proportion of the variance in effect sizes (51.6-56.2%) was due to variation that was not attributable to sampling error (i.e. sample size). Much of this non-sampling error variance was not attributable to phylogenetic effects or high repeatability of effect sizes among species. It was approximately equally attributable to differences (occurring for unknown reasons) in effect sizes among and within studies (25.3, 22.9% of the total variance). There were no significant effects of year of publication or two aspects of study design (experimental/observational or field/laboratory) on reported effect sizes. We discuss various practical reasons and theoretical arguments as to why small effect sizes should be expected, and why there might be relatively high variation among studies. Currently, there are no species where replicated, experimental studies show that mothers adjust the offspring sex ratio in response to a generally preferred male phenotype. Ultimately, we need more experimental studies that test directly whether females produce more sons when mated to relatively more attractive males, and that provide the requisite evidence that their sons have higher mean fitness than their daughters.

AB Elevated forest mortality has been attributed to climate change-induced droughts, but prediction of spatial mortality patterns remains challenging. We evaluated whether introducing plant hydraulics and topographic convergence-induced soil moisture variation to land surface models (LSM) can help explain spatial patterns of mortality.
   A scheme predicting plant hydraulic safety loss from soil moisture was developed using field measurements and a plant physiology-hydraulics model, TREES. The scheme was upscaled to Populus tremuloides forests across Colorado, USA, using LSM-modeled and topographymediated soil moisture, respectively. The spatial patterns of hydraulic safety loss were compared against aerial surveyed mortality.
   Incorporating hydraulic safety loss raised the explanatory power of mortality by 40% compared to LSM-modeled soil moisture. Topographic convergence was mostly influential in suppressing mortality in low and concave areas, explaining an additional 10% of the variations in mortality for those regions.
   Plant hydraulics integrated water stress along the soil-plant continuum and was more closely tied to plant physiological response to drought. In addition to the well-recognized topo-climate influence due to elevation and aspect, we found evidence that topographic convergence mediates tree mortality in certain parts of the landscape that are low and convergent, likely through influences on plant-available water.

AB The mid-late Ediacaran Period (similar to 579-541 Ma) is characterized by globally distributed marine soft-bodied organisms of unclear phylogenetic affinities colloquially called the Ediacara biota. Despite an absence of systematic agreement, previous workers have tested for underlying factors that may control the occurrence of Ediacaran macrofossils in space and time. Three taxonomically distinct assemblages, termed the Avalon, White Sea, and Nama, were identified and informally incorporated into Ediacaran biostratigraphy. After similar to 15 years of new fossil discoveries and taxonomic revision, we retest the validity of these assemblages using a comprehensive database of Ediacaran macrofossil occurrences. Using multivariate analysis, we also test the degree to which taphonomy, time, and paleoenvironment explain the taxonomic composition of these assemblages. We find that: (1) the three assemblages remain distinct taxonomic groupings; (2) there is little support for a large-scale litho-taphonomic bias present in the Ediacaran; and (3) there is significant chronostratigraphic overlap between the taxonomically and geographically distinct Avalonian and White Sea assemblages ca. 560-557 Ma. Furthermore, both assemblages show narrow bathymetric ranges, reinforcing that they were paleoenvironmental-ecological biotopes and spatially restricted in marine settings. Meanwhile, the Nama assemblage appears to be a unique faunal stage, defined by a global loss of diversity, coincident with a noted expansion of bathymetrically unrestricted, long-ranging Ediacara taxa. These data reinforce that Ediacaran biodiversity and stratigraphic ranges of its representative taxa must first statistically account for varying likelihood of preservation at a local scale to ultimately aggregate the Ediacaran macrofossil record into a global biostratigraphic context.

AB Many plant species have established self-sustaining populations outside their natural range because of human activities. Plants with selfing ability should be more likely to establish outside their historical range because they can reproduce from a single individual when mates or pollinators are not available. Here, we compile a global breeding-system database of 1,752 angiosperm species and use phylogenetic generalized linear models and path analyses to test relationships between selfing ability, life history, native range size and global naturalization status. Selfing ability is associated with annual or biennial life history and a large native range, which both positively correlate with the probability of naturalization. Path analysis suggests that a high selfing ability directly increases the number of regions where a species is naturalized. Our results provide robust evidence across flowering plants at the global scale that high selfing ability fosters alien plant naturalization both directly and indirectly.

AB It is increasingly argued that preferences and values for complex goods such as ecosystem services are not preformed but need to be generated through a process of deliberation and learning. While the number of studies incorporating deliberation in monetary and non-monetary valuation of ecosystem services is increasing, there is a limited theoretical basis to how values are influenced and shaped in social valuation processes. In this paper we present the Deliberative Value Formation (DVF) model, a new theoretical model for deliberative valuation informed by social-psychological theory. Anchored within a broader theoretical framework around shared and plural values, the DVF model identifies a range of potential positive (e.g. learning) and negative (e.g. social desirability bias) outcomes of deliberation and key factors that influence outcomes (e.g. ability to deliberate, institutional factors, power dynamics). It also conceptualises how values may be formed by 'translating' transcendental values, our principles and life goals, into more specific contextual values. Underpinned by this theoretical model, we present a six-step template for designing deliberative valuation processes. The DVF provides a theoretical and methodological framework for more rigorous monetary and non-monetary deliberative valuation, and enables more effective integration of social learning and plural knowledges and values in valuation and decision-making.

AB Natural hybrid zones have proven to be precious tools for understanding the origin and maintenance of reproductive isolation (RI) and therefore species. Most available genomic studies of hybrid zones using whole-or partial-genome resequencing approaches have focused on comparisons of the parental source populations involved in genome admixture, rather than exploring fine-scale patterns of chromosomal ancestry across the full admixture gradient present between hybridizing species. We have studied three well-known European 'replicate' hybrid zones of Populus alba and P. tremula, two widespread, ecologically divergent forest trees, using up to 432 505 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing. Estimates of fine-scale chromosomal ancestry, genomic divergence and differentiation across all 19 poplar chromosomes revealed strikingly contrasting results, including an unexpected preponderance of F-1 hybrids in the centre of genomic clines on the one hand, and genomically localized, spatially variable shared variants consistent with ancient introgression between the parental species on the other. Genetic ancestry had a significant effect on survivorship of hybrid seedlings in a common garden trial, pointing to selection against early-generation recombinants. Our results indicate a role for selection against recombinant genotypes in maintaining RI in the face of apparent F-1 fertility, consistent with the intragenomic 'coadaptation' model of barriers to introgression upon secondary contact. Whole-genome resequencing of hybridizing populations will clarify the roles of specific genetic pathways in RI between these model forest trees and may reveal which loci are affected most strongly by its cyclic breakdown.

AB Altitude is a determining factor of ecosystem properties and processes in mountains. This study investigated the changes in the concentrations of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) and their ratios in four key ecosystem components (forest floor litter, fine roots, soil, and soil microorganisms) along an altitudinal gradient (from 50 m to 950 m a.s.l.) in subtropical China. The results showed that soil organic C and microbial biomass C concentrations increased linearly with increasing altitude. Similar trends were observed for concentrations of total soil N and microbial biomass N. In contrast, the N concentration of litter and fine roots decreased linearly with altitude. With increasing altitude, litter, fine roots, and soil C:N ratios increased linearly, while the C:N ratio of soil microbial biomass did not change significantly. Phosphorus concentration and C:P and N:P ratios of all ecosystem components generally had nonlinear relationships with altitude. Our results indicate that the altitudinal pattern of plant and soil nutrient status differs among ecosystem components and that the relative importance of P vs. N limitation for ecosystem functions and processes shifts along altitudinal gradients.

AB Elevational gradients of biodiversity have been widely investigated, and yet a clear interpretation of the biotic and abiotic factors that determine how species richness varies with elevation is still elusive. In mountainous landscapes, habitats at different elevations are characterized by different areal extent and connectivity properties, key drivers of biodiversity, as predicted by metacommunity theory. However, most previous studies directly correlated species richness to elevational gradients of potential drivers, thus neglecting the interplay between such gradients and the environmental matrix. Here, we investigate the role of geomorphology in shaping patterns of species richness. We develop a spatially explicit zero-sum metacommunity model where species have an elevation-dependent fitness and otherwise neutral traits. Results show that ecological dynamics over complex terrains lead to the null expectation of a hump-shaped elevational gradient of species richness, a pattern widely observed empirically. Local species richness is found to be related to the landscape elevational connectivity, as quantified by a newly proposed metric that applies tools of complex network theory to measure the closeness of a site to others with similar habitat. Our theoretical results suggest clear geomorphic controls on elevational gradients of species richness and support the use of the landscape elevational connectivity as a null model for the analysis of the distribution of biodiversity.

AB The concept of ecological solidarity (ES) is a major feature of the 2006 law reforming national park policy in France. In the context of biodiversity conservation, the objectives of this study are to outline the historical development of ES, provide a working defi nition, and present a method for its implementation that combines environmental pragmatism and adaptive management. First, we highlight how ES provides a focus on the interdependencies among humans and nonhuman components of the socioecological system. In doing so, we identify ES within a framework that distinguishes ecological, socioecological, and sociopolitical interdependencies. In making such interdependencies apparent to humans who are not aware of their existence, the concept of ES promotes collective action as an alternative or complementary approach to state-or market-based approaches. By focusing on the awareness, feelings, and acknowledgement of interdependencies between actors and between humans and nonhumans, we present and discuss a learning-based approach (participatory modeling) that allows stakeholders to work together to construct cultural landscapes for present and future generations. Using two case studies, we show how an ES analysis goes beyond the ecosystem management approach to take into account how human interactions with the environment embody cultural, social, and economic values and endorse an ethically integrated science of care and responsibility. ES recognizes the diversity of these values as a practical foundation for socially engaged and accountable actions. Finally, we discuss how ES enhances academic support for a socioecological systems approach to biodiversity conservation and promotes collaboration with decision-makers and stakeholders involved in the adaptive management of protected areas and their surrounding landscapes.

AB Open government has become an important topic in democratically developed societies. Its key aims are to increase transparency, citizen trust and public participation. Against this background, the article focuses on perceived barriers opposing the introduction of open government data. On the basis of cognitive theory and a literature review, the essential factors that impede public servants in implementing open government data are conceptualized and summarized in a model. The perceived risk-based attitude of public servants is identified as the main barrier. Other significant obstacles include perceived legal barriers, perceived hierarchical structuring of authorities, perceived bureaucratic decision-making culture and perceived organizational transparency.

AB Temporal increases of tree mortality have been observed in regions where global warming has decreased long-term water availability and/or induced droughts. However, temporal decreases in water availability are not a global phenomenon. Understanding how water deficit-free forests respond to the recent effects of climate change is paramount towards a full appreciation of the impacts of climate change on global forests. Here, we reveal temporally increasing tree mortality across all study species over the last three decades in the central boreal forests of Canada, where long-term water availability has increased without apparent climate change-associated drought. In addition, we find that the effects of conspecific tree-to-tree competition have intensified temporally as a mechanism for the increased mortality of shade-intolerant tree species. Our results suggest that the consequences of climate change on tree mortality are more profound than previously thought.

AB A multitude of hypotheses claim that abiotic factors are the main drivers of macroevolutionary change. By contrast, Van Valen's Red Queen hypothesis is often put forward as the sole representative of the view that biotic forcing is the main evolutionary driver. This imbalance of hypotheses does not reflect our current knowledge: theoretical work demonstrates the plausibility of biotically driven long-term evolution, whereas empirical work suggests a central role for biotic forcing in macroevolution. We call for a more pluralistic view of how biotic forces may drive long-term evolution that is compatible with both phenotypic stasis in the fossil record and with non-constant extinction rates. Promising avenues of research include contrasting predictions from relevant theories within ecology and macroevolution, as well as embracing both abiotic and biotic proxies while modelling long-term evolutionary data. By fitting models describing hypotheses of biotically driven macroevolution to data, we could dissect their predictions and transcend beyond pattern description, possibly narrowing the divide between our current understanding of micro- and macroevolution.

AB Prescribed fire is an important management tool to reduce fuel loads, to remove non-fire adapted species and to sustain fire-adapted taxa in many forested ecosystems of the southeastern USA. Yet, the long-term effects of recurring prescribed fires on soil fungi and their communities in these ecosystems remain unclear. We Illumina MiSeq sequenced and analyzed fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS2) amplicons from a long-term prescribed burn experiment that has implemented different regimes for nearly a quarter century to evaluate the effects of differing prescribed fire intervals and the season of their implementation on soil-inhabiting fungal communities. Unburned plots were used as a reference to represent the compositional state resulting from fire suppression. Our data show that while the recurring burning or the season of the prescribed burning do not affect richness and diversity of the fungal communities, the frequent (two and three year interval) fires maintain a fire-adapted community that is distinct from those in unburned reference plots. Subsequent indicator taxon analyses identified a total of 37 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) that were more frequent in the frequently implemented burns and 26 OTUs that were more frequent in the fire suppressed treatment. We conclude that frequent prescribed burning maintains fire selected soil fungal communities that may support plant communities that are composed of desired fire adapted or fire tolerant species that dominate the frequently burned areas.

AB Wildfire occurrence and intensity are increasing worldwide causing severe disturbances to forest watersheds used for potable water supply. The effects of Wildfire on drinking water quality are not well understood, especially in terms of terrestrial dissolved organic Matter (DOM) and DOM-associated formation of disinfection by-products (DBP). As the forest floor layer is a major source of terrestrial DOM, We investigated characteristics and DBP formation of water extractable organic matter (WEOM) from the 0-5 cm depth of nonburned detritus (control) and burned detritus with black ash (moderate severity) and white ash (high severity) associated with the 2013 Rim Fire in California. Spectroscopic results suggested that the aromaticity of WEOM followed white ash > control > black: ash and fluorescence region II (excitation 220-250 nm; emission 330-380 nm) of the emission-excitation-matrix was identified as a potential burn severity indicator. Compared to the control, WEOM from white and black ashes had lower reactivity in forming trihalomethanes (55%-of-control) and haloacetic acids (67%-of-control), but higher reactivity in forming the more carcinogenic haloacetonitrile after chlorination (244%-of-control) and N-nitrosodimethylamine after chloramination (229%-of-control). There was no change in reactivity for chloral hydrate formation, while WEOM from black ash showed a higher reactivity for haloketone formation (150%-of-control): Because wildfire consumed a large portion of organic matter from the detritus layer, there Was lower water extractable organic carbon (27%-of-control) and organic nitrogen (19%-of-control) yields in ashes. Consequently, the wildfire caused an overall reduction in water extractable terrestrial DBP precursor yield from detritus materials.

AB The control of tree growth vs environment by carbon sources or sinks remains unresolved although it is widely studied. This study investigates growth of tree components and carbon sink-source dynamics at different temporal scales. We constructed a dynamic growth model carbon allocation sink source interaction' (CASSIA) that calculates tree-level carbon balance from photosynthesis, respiration, phenology and temperature-driven potential structural growth of tree organs and dynamics of stored nonstructural carbon (NSC) and their modifying influence on growth. With the model, we tested hypotheses that sink demand explains the intra-annual growth dynamics of the meristems, and that the source supply is further needed to explain year-to-year growth variation. The predicted intra-annual dimensional growth of shoots and needles and the number of cells in xylogenesis phases corresponded with measurements, whereas NSC hardly limited the growth, supporting the first hypothesis. Delayed GPP influence on potential growth was necessary for simulating the yearly growth variation, indicating also at least an indirect source limitation. CASSIA combines seasonal growth and carbon balance dynamics with long-term source dynamics affecting growth and thus provides a first step to understanding the complex processes regulating intra- and interannual growth and sink-source dynamics.

AB Assessing changes in plant functional traits along gradients is useful for understanding the assembly of communities and their response to global and local environmental drivers. However, these changes may reflect the effects of species composition (i.e. composition turnover), species abundance (i.e. species interaction), and intra-specific trait variability (i.e. species plasticity). In order to determine the relevance of the latter, trait variation can be assessed under minimal effects of composition turnover. Nine sampling sites were established along an altitudinal gradient in a Mediterranean high mountain grassland community with low composition turnover (Madrid, Spain; 1940 m-2419 m). Nine functional traits were also measured for ten individuals of around ten plant species at each site, for a total of eleven species across all sites. The relative importance of different sources of variability (within/between site and intra-/inter-specific functional diversity) and trait variation at species and community level along the considered gradients were explored. We found a weak individual species response to altitude and other environmental variables although in some cases, individuals were smaller and leaves were thicker at higher elevations. This lack of species response was most likely due to greater within-than between-site species variation. At the community level, inter-specific functional diversity was generally greater than the intra-specific component except for traits linked to leaf element content (leaf carbon content, leaf nitrogen content, delta C-13 and delta N-15). Inter-specific functional diversity decreased with lower altitude for four leaf traits (specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, delta C-13 and delta N-15), suggesting trait convergence between species at lower elevations, where water shortage may have a stronger environmental filtering effect than colder temperatures at higher altitudes. Our results suggest that, within a vegetation type encompassing various environmental gradients, both, changes in species abundance and intra-specific trait variability adjust for the community functional response to environmental changes.

AB The position of the Arctic treeline, which is a key regulator of surface energy exchange and carbon cycling, is widely thought to be controlled by temperature. Here, we present evidence that soil nutrient availability, rather than temperature, may be the proximate control on growth of treeline trees at our study site in northwest Alaska. We examined constraints on growth and allocation of white spruce in three contrasting habitats. The habitats had similar aboveground climates, but soil temperature declined from the riverside terrace to the forest to the treeline. We identified six lines of evidence that conflict with the hypothesis of direct temperature control and/or point to the importance of soil nutrient availability. First, the magnitude of aboveground growth declined from the terrace to the forest to the treeline, along gradients of diminishing soil nitrogen (N) availability and needle N concentration. Second, peak rates of branch extension, main stem radial and fine-root growth were generally not coincident with seasonal air and soil temperature maxima. At the treeline, in particular, rates of aboveground and fine-root growth declined well before air and soil temperatures reached their seasonal peaks. Third, in contrast with the hypothesis of temperature-limited growth, growing season average net photosynthesis was positively related to the sum of normalized branch extension, main stem radial and fine-root growth across trees and sites. Fourth, needle nonstructural carbohydrate concentration was significantly higher on the terrace, where growth was greatest. Fifth, annual branch extension growth was positively related to snow depth, consistent with the hypothesis that deeper snow promotes microbial activity and greater soil nutrient availability. Finally, the tree ring record revealed a large growth increase during late 20th-century climate warming on the terrace, where soil N availability is relatively high. Meanwhile, trees in the forest and at the treeline showed progressively smaller growth increases. Our results suggest temperature effects on tree growth at our study sites may be mediated by soil nutrient availability, making responses to climate change more complex and our ability to interpret the tree ring record more challenging than previously thought.

AB In this review, we aim to draw parallels between the principal concepts of invasion biology, developed mainly for terrestrial plants in temperate regions, with findings for macrophytes recorded in tropical inland waters. In these ecosystems, the most important abiotic and biotic filters influencing invasion success are related to water and sediment conditions, light, disturbance, hydrology and the diversity and density of native species. The main impacts are related to direct and indirect changes in the populations and communities of native macrophytes and other associated organisms. Non-native ecosystem engineer species of macrophytes can affect ecosystems directly, and after affecting ecosystems, their effects can extend to populations and communities. High plant growth rates in the tropics could lead to rapid invasion and larger impacts compared to temperate ecosystems. Although we found many parallels between ecosystems regarding the general concepts of invasion, areas that should receive further investigation in the tropics include (i) the synergistic interaction of multiple invasive species, (ii) the effects of regime shift on invasion success and vice versa and (iii) how climate change will affect the dynamics of macrophyte invasion in tropical ecosystems.

AB Forest growth is sensitive to interannual climatic change in the alpine treeline ecotone (ATE). Whether the alpine treeline ecotone shares a similar pattern of forest growth with lower elevational closed forest belt (CFB) under changing climate remains unclear. Here, we reported an unprecedented acceleration of Picea schrenkiana forest growth since 1960s in the ATE of Tianshan Mountains, northwestern China by a stand-total sampling along six altitudinal transects with three plots in each transect: one from the ATE between the treeline and the forest line, and the other two from the CFB. All the sampled P. schrenkiana forest patches show a higher growth speed after 1960 and, comparatively, forest growth in the CFB has sped up much slower than that in the ATE. The speedup of forest growth at the ATE is mainly accounted for by climate factors, with increasing temperature suggested to be the primary driver. Stronger water deficit as well as more competition within the CFB might have restricted forest growth there more than that within the ATE, implying biotic factors were also significant for the accelerated forest growth in the ATE, which should be excluded from simulations and predictions of warming-induced treeline dynamics.

AB Knowledge of variations in morphophysiological leaf traits with forest height is essential for quantifying carbon and water fluxes from forest ecosystems. Here, we examined changes in leaf traits with forest height in diverse tree species and their role in environmental acclimation in a tropical rain forest in Borneo that does not experience dry spells. Height-related changes in leaf physiological and morphological traits [e.g., maximum photosynthetic rate (A (max)), stomatal conductance (gs), dark respiration rate (R (d)), carbon isotope ratio (delta C-13), nitrogen (N) content, and leaf mass per area (LMA)] from understory to emergent trees were investigated in 104 species in 29 families. We found that many leaf area-based physiological traits (e.g., A (max-area), R (d), gs), N, delta C-13, and LMA increased linearly with tree height, while leaf mass-based physiological traits (e.g., A (max-mass)) only increased slightly. These patterns differed from other biomes such as temperate and tropical dry forests, where trees usually show decreased photosynthetic capacity (e.g., A (max-area), A (max-mass)) with height. Increases in photosynthetic capacity, LMA, and delta C-13 are favored under bright and dry upper canopy conditions with higher photosynthetic productivity and drought tolerance, whereas lower R (d) and LMA may improve shade tolerance in lower canopy trees. Rapid recovery of leaf midday water potential to theoretical gravity potential during the night supports the idea that the majority of trees do not suffer from strong drought stress. Overall, leaf area-based photosynthetic traits were associated with tree height and the degree of leaf drought stress, even in diverse tropical rain forest trees.

AB A scarcity of life-history data currently exists for many exploited coral reef fishes, hindering our ability to interpret fishery dynamics and develop sound conservation policies. In particular, parrotfishes (Family Labridae) represent a ubiquitous and ecologically important group that is increasingly prevalent in commercial and artisanal fisheries worldwide. We used both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data to examine the effect of life histories on vulnerability to overexploitation in parrotfishes. Vulnerability for each species was derived from independent measures associated with both temporal (20-year catch records) and spatial datasets. Most life-history traits examined were significant predictors of vulnerability across species, but their relative utility differed considerably. Length-based traits (e.g., lengths at maturity and sex change, maximum length) were generally superior to age-based traits (e.g., life span), but one age-based trait, age at female maturation, was the best predictor. The results suggest that easily derived metrics such as maximum length can be effective measures of sensitivity to exploitation when applied to phylogenetically related multispecies assemblages, but more holistic and comprehensive age-based demographic data should be sought, especially in data-deficient and heavily impacted regions. Given the increasing prevalence of parrotfishes in the global coral reef harvest, species-specific responses demonstrate the capacity for heavy fishing pressure to alter parrotfish assemblages considerably.

AB To ensure viable species populations in fragmented landscapes, individuals must be able to move between suitable habitat patches. Despite the increased interest in biodiversity assessment in urban environments, the ecological relevance of habitat connectivity in highly fragmented landscapes remains largely unknown. The first step to understanding the role of habitat connectivity in urban ecology is the challenging task of assessing connectivity in the complex patchwork of contrasting habitats that is found in cities.
   We developed a data-based framework, minimizing the use of subjective assumptions, to assess habitat connectivity that consists of the following sequential steps: (1) identification of habitat preference based on empirical habitat-use data; (2) derivation of habitat resistance surfaces evaluating various transformation functions; (3) modeling of different connectivity maps with electrical circuit theory (Circuitscape), a method considering all possible pathways across the landscape simultaneously; and (4) identification of the best connectivity map with information-theoretic model selection. We applied this analytical framework to assess habitat connectivity for the European hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus, a model species for ground-dwelling animals, in the city of Zurich, Switzerland, using GPS track points from 40 individuals.
   The best model revealed spatially explicit connectivity "pinch points," as well as multiple habitat connections. Cross-validation indicated the general validity of the selected connectivity model. The results show that both habitat connectivity and habitat quality affect the movement of urban hedgehogs (relative importance of the two variables was 19.2% and 80.8%, respectively), and are thus both relevant for predicting urban animal movements.
   Our study demonstrates that even in the complex habitat patchwork of cities, habitat connectivity plays a major role for ground-dwelling animal moverrient. Data-based habitat connectivity maps can thus serve as an important tool for city planners to identify habitat corridors and plan appropriate management and conservation measures for urban animals. The analytical framework we describe to model such connectivity maps is generally applicable to different types of habitat-use data and can be adapted to the movement scale of the focal species. It also allows evaluation of the impact of future landscape changes or management scenarios on habitat connectivity in urban landscapes.

AB Altitudinal gradients are characterized by steep changes of the physical and biotic environment that present challenges to plant adaptation throughout large parts of the world. Hybrid zones may form where related species inhabit different neighbouring altitudes and can facilitate interspecific gene flow and potentially the breakdown of species barriers. Studies of such hybrid zones can reveal much about the genetic basis of adaptation to environmental differences stemming from changes in altitude and the maintenance of species divergence in the face of gene flow. Furthermore, owing to recombination and transgressive effects, such hybrid zones can be sources of evolutionary novelty. We document plant hybrid zones associated with altitudinal gradients and; emphasize similarities and differences in their structure. We then focus on recent studies of a hybrid zone between two Senecio species that occur at high and low altitude on Mount Etna, Sicily, showing how adaptation to local environments and intrinsic selection against hybrids act to maintain it. Finally, we consider the potential of altitudinal hybrid zones for generating evolutionary novelty through adaptive introgression and hybrid speciation. Examples of homoploid hybrid species of Senecio and :Pinus that originated from altitudinal hybrid zones are discussed.

AB Plants in Mediterranean ecosystems face multiple environmental stresses during the growing season. Such stresses greatly affect ecosystem function, but are poorly represented by current ecosystem models. Here, we review recent advances in understanding the responses of ecosystem photosynthesis to drought and photoinhibition. Reductions in canopy net assimilation rates by recurrent water limitations during the day and during drought periods result from multiple limitations at the biochemical, cellular and structural levels, including reductions in stomatal, and mesophyll diffusion conductances, foliage biochemical potentials, light harvesting efficiency and modifications in canopy structure. Overall, a hierarchy of environmental effects, from instantaneous, short- and long-term influences, shape photosynthetic responses to stress in the field. The processes involved can be incorporated into photosynthesis models to different degrees, given our current understanding of each. However, fully mechanistic consideration of certain phenomena such as non-reversible, hysteretic and lagged heat and drought effects, or photoinhibition, would require the use of models including dynamic damage and repair mechanisms. We outline further model and experimental work needed to describe the parameter space for quantitative simulation of such phenomena, especially considering the need to simulate plant production under global change.

AB Temperature and nutrients are major limiting factors in subarctic tundra. Experimental manipulation of nutrient availability along elevational gradients (and thus temperature) can improve our understanding of ecological responses to climate change. However, no study to date has explored impacts of nutrient addition along a tundra elevational gradient, or across contrasting vegetation types along any elevational gradient. We set up a full factorial nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization experiment in each of two vegetation types (heath and meadow) at 500 m, 800 m, and 1000 m elevation in northern Swedish tundra. We predicted that plant and microbial communities in heath or at lower elevations would be more responsive to N addition while communities in meadow or at higher elevations would be more responsive to P addition, and that fertilizer effects would vary more with elevation for the heath than for the meadow. Although our results provided little support for these predictions, the relationship between nutrient limitation and elevation differed between vegetation types. Most plant and microbial properties were responsive to N and/or P fertilization, but responses often varied with elevation and/or vegetation type. For instance, vegetation density significantly increased with N + P fertilization relative to the other fertilizer treatments, and this increase was greatest at the lowest elevation for the heath but at the highest elevation for the meadow. Arbuscular mycorrhizae decreased with P fertilization at 500 m for the meadow, but with all fertilizer treatments in both vegetation types at 800 m. Fungal to bacterial ratios were enhanced by N + P fertilization for the two highest elevations in the meadow only. Additionally, microbial responses to fertilization were primarily direct rather than indirect via plant responses, pointing to a decoupled response of plant and microbial communities to nutrient addition and elevation. Because our study shows how two community types differ in their responses to fertilization and elevation, and because the temperature range across this gradient is similar to 3 degrees C, our study is informative about how nutrient limitation in tundra may be influenced by temperature shifts that are comparable to those expected under climate change during this century.

AB Forest fires are a major environmental concern, especially in the semiarid Mediterranean regions, where the long dry and hot summers and mild winters favor outbreaks of wildfires. The objective of this work was to study the effects of different fire treatments on physical, chemical, and physicochemical properties of Pale rendzina, and their impact on infiltration rate (IR), runoff and soil loss under consecutive rainstorms. After a wildfire in a forest located in northern Israel, soil samples were taken from an area that was directly exposed to fire (direct fire treatment) and from adjacent unburned (unburned soil treatment). Part of the unburned soil was heated in a muffle at 300 degrees C (heated soil treatment). Runoff, soil loss and IR values were measured for the various samples using a laboratory rainfall simulator, and aggregate stability was determined using slaking and dispersion values. The organic matter, clay, and sand content, and cation exchange capacity were significantly lower in the heated soil than in the unburned soil. The CaCO3 content in the heated soil was significantly higher than in the unburned and direct fire soils. In general, the IR values were highest, intermediate, and lowest and the runoff and soil loss amounts were lowest, intermediate, and highest in the heated, direct fire, and unburned soils, respectively. However, these differences decreased with progression of the consecutive rainstorms. Heating the soil to 300 degrees C enhanced soil-structure stability, most likely due to increased dehydration of 2:1 clay minerals and transformation of iron and aluminum oxides which acted as cementing agents. In addition, soil heating increased the electrical conductivity (EC) and decreased the sodium adsorption ratio in the heated soil solution in the first rainstorm. These processes limited clay dispersion and seal formation in the heated soil, leading to high IR values and low runoff and soil loss. In the second and third rainstorms, EC of the soil solution decreased, which in turn increased clay dispersion. This lessened the differences in the IR values and runoff and soil loss amounts between the fire treatments in these rainstorms compared to the first rainstorm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The RNetLogo package delivers an interface to embed the agent-based modeling platform NetLogo into the R environment with headless (no graphical user interface) or interactive GUI mode. It provides functions to load models, execute commands, push values, and to get values from NetLogo reporters. Such a seamless integration of a widely used agent-based modeling platform with a well-known statistical computing and graphics environment opens up various possibilities. For example, it enables the modeler to design simulation experiments, store simulation results, and analyze simulation output in a more systematic way. It can therefore help close the gaps in agent-based modeling regarding standards of description and analysis. After a short overview of the agent-based modeling approach and the software used here, the paper delivers a step-by-step introduction to the usage of the RNetLogo package by examples.

AB Understanding cultural dimensions of human/environment relationships is now widely seen as key to effective management, yet characterizing these dimensions remains a challenge. We report on an approach for considering the nonmaterial values associated with ecosystems, i.e., cultural ecosystem services. We applied the approach in Kona, Hawai'i, using 30 semistructured interviews and 205 in-person surveys, striving to balance pragmatism and depth. We found spirituality, heritage, and identity-related values to be particularly salient, with expression of some of these values varying among respondents by ethnicity and duration of residence in Hawai'i. Although people of various backgrounds reported strong spirituality and heritage-related values, Native Hawaiians rated heritage connections as deeper, and lifetime residents portrayed ecosystem-identity connections as more integral to their wellbeing than did people from other backgrounds. The approach also proved useful in identifying concerns not addressed in survey and interview prompts, including postcolonial issues, access to ecosystems, and relationships between people of different ethnic backgrounds. Although understanding these nonmaterial dimensions of human-ecosystem relationships can be complex, emerging techniques eliciting qualitative and quantitative data provide feasible ways of deepening that understanding.

AB According to island biogeography theory, the species richness of patches is determined by their size and spatial isolation, while in conservation practice, it is patch quality that determines protection and guides management. We analysed whether size, isolation or habitat quality are most important for the species richness in a set of 50 dry grassland fragments in agricultural landscapes of eastern Austria. We studied two plant taxa (vascular plants, bryophytes) and 11 invertebrate taxa (gastropods, spiders, springtails, grasshoppers, true bugs, leafhoppers and planthoppers, ground beetles, rove beetles, butterflies and burnets, ants and wild bees). The species richness of three categories was analysed: (1) dry grassland specialist species, (2) all grassland species and (3) all species. We used regression and hierarchical partitioning techniques to determine the relationship between species richness and environmental variables describing patch size and shape, patch quality, landscape configuration and landscape quality. The area-isolation paradigm was only applicable for dry grassland specialists, which comprised 12% of all species. Richness of all grassland species was determined mostly by landscape heterogeneity parameters. Total species richness was highly influenced by spillover from adjacent biotopes, and was significantly determined by the percentage of arable land bordering the patches. When analysing all taxa together, species richness of dry grassland specialists was significantly related to historical patch size but not to current patch size, indicating an extinction debt. At the landscape scale, the variable 'short-grass area' was a better predictor than the less specific variable 'area of extensively used landscape elements'. 'Distance to mainland' was a good predictor for specialists of mobile animal taxa. Plant specialists showed a pronounced dependence on quality measures at the patch scale and at the landscape scale, whereas animal specialists were influenced by patch size, patch quality, landscape quality and isolation measures. None of the taxa benefited from linear structures in the surroundings. In conclusion, high patch quality and a network of high-quality areas in the surrounding landscape should be the best conservation strategy to ensure conservation of dry grassland specialists. This goal does not conflict with the specific demands of single taxa. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Exposure to adverse environmental conditions during early development can shape life-history traits and have lasting effects on physiological function in later life. Although findings within the biomedical literature have shown that environmentally induced elevations in glucocorticoids (GCs) during critical developmental windows can cause persistent carry-over effects (i.e., developmental programming), little is known about whether such effects of GCs can be generalized to wildlife species. Using wood frogs as a study species, we conducted an experiment with a split-plot design to assess the short-term and the long-term physiological consequences of availability of food, hydroperiod length (i.e., pond drying), and the interaction between these two environmental conditions. In outdoor experimental ponds, we reared tadpoles in chronically high or low-food conditions, and tadpoles from each pond experienced either high water until metamorphosis or a reduction in water volume during late developmental stages (after Gosner stage 38). After metamorphosis, animals were housed individually and fed ad libitum for 10 weeks, and growth rate, fat content, and resting and acute stress-induced GC levels were measured. We found that tadpoles experiencing low availability of food and reduced water volume had elevated GC levels, reduced mass, and body condition as they approached metamorphosis. At 10 weeks after metamorphosis, we found that these two conditions also had persistent interactive effects on post-metamorphic allocation of resources to growth, energy storage, and responsiveness of GCs to a novel stressor. Of individuals that experienced reduced water volume, only those that experienced high food as tadpoles were able to catch up to individuals that did not experience reduced water volume in terms of body mass, femur length, and body condition, and they allocated more resources to fat storage. By contrast, 10-week old frogs with low-food and that experienced low water volume and low-food levels as tadpoles allocated fewer resources to mass-specific growth, stored less fat, and exhibited blunted GC response to a novel stressor relative to those that did not experience water-reduction. Our findings demonstrate that environmental conditions experienced prior to and during important developmental transitions shape resource allocation and the ability to physiologically respond to future stressors in juvenile and potentially adult animals. These results suggest that chronic and acute environmental stressors experienced during early life stages can have cumulative and interactive effects that need to be considered when modeling the ecological and evolutionary consequences of environmental change on populations.

AB The correlation between vegetation patterns (species distribution and richness) and altitudinal variation has been widely reported for tropical forests, thereby providing theoretical basis for biodiversity conservation. However, this relationship may have been oversimplified, as many other factors may influence vegetation patterns, such as disturbances, topography and geographic distance. Considering these other factors, our primary question was: is there a vegetation pattern associated with substantial altitudinal variation (10-1,093 m a.s.l.) in the Atlantic Rainforest-a top hotspot for biodiversity conservation-and, if so, what are the main factors driving this pattern? We addressed this question by sampling 11 1-ha plots, applying multivariate methods, correlations and variance partitioning. The Restinga (forest on sandbanks along the coastal plains of Brazil) and a lowland area that was selectively logged 40 years ago were floristically isolated from the other plots. The maximum species richness (> 200 spp. per hectare) occurred at approximately 350 m a.s.l. (submontane forest). Gaps, multiple stemmed trees, average elevation and the standard deviation of the slope significantly affected the vegetation pattern. Spatial proximity also influenced the vegetation pattern as a structuring environmental variable or via dispersal constraints. Our results clarify, for the first time, the key variables that drive species distribution and richness across a large altitudinal range within the Atlantic Rainforest.

AB The quantification of land surface evapotranspiration (ET) at daily or longer time scales is of great significance in modeling the global hydrological cycle, studying climate change, and managing water resources. However, current remote sensing-based ET models can generally only provide snapshots of ET at the time of a satellite overpass and do not satisfy the expectations of hydrologists, irrigation engineers, or water resource managers concerned with practical applications. Four commonly used ET upscaling schemes, namely, the constant reference evaporative fraction (EFr) method, the constant evaporative fraction (EF) method, the constant extraterrestrial solar radiation ratio (R-p) method, and the constant observed global solar radiation ratio (R-g) method, were evaluated in this study using ground-based eddy covariance (EC) measurements and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived estimates from a two-source energy balance model. Analysis was made of both closed and un-closed surface fluxes and of different assumed satellite overpass times from mid-morning to mid-afternoon. Data for the analysis were collected at the Yucheng comprehensive experimental station in Northern China, spanning the period from late April 2009 to late October 2011. The results show that all four upscaling factors from noon to mid-afternoon had a better agreement with their corresponding daily averages. Overall, the EFr (R-g) method had the best (second best) performance of the four upscaling methods. The EF method was found to significantly underestimate the daily latent heat flux (LE) and performed the worst of the four upscaling methods. With the correction of the energy imbalance of EC measurements, the R-g method's performance was improved and outperformed the EF, method in the morning. The presence of clouds either increased or decreased the BIAS but generally increased the root mean square error (RMSE) for all four upscaling methods. When the upscaling methods were applied to convert the instantaneous MODIS remote sensing estimates of ET to daily values, the accuracy of the extrapolated daily ET was controlled by the accuracy of both the remote sensing ET estimates and the upscaling methods themselves. With the insignificantly biased estimates of the instantaneous LE from the N95 model at 101 MODIS overpass times in this study, using the EF method underestimated the daily ET by 11%, while all the remaining three factors overestimated the daily ET by a range of 5%-18%. This study was conducted to provide a scientific basis for developing an operational and more accurate ET-upscaling method with easy access to data in future studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Although low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) is traditionally considered to have adapted to its wild waterbird host to become avirulent, recent studies have suggested that LPAIV infection might after all have clinical effects. Therefore, I reviewed the literature on LPAIV infections in wild waterbirds. The virulence of LPAIV was assessed in 17 studies on experimental infections and nine studies on natural infections. Reported evidence for virulence were reductions in return rate, feeding rate, body weight, long-range movement and reproductive success, as well as pathological changes in infected organs. However, major caveats in studies of experimental infections were unnatural route of LPAIV inoculation, animal husbandry not simulating natural stressors and low sensitivity of clinical assessment. Major caveats in studies of natural infections were incomplete measurement of LPAIV infection burden, quasi-experimental design and potential misclassification of birds. After taking these caveats into account, the only remaining evidence for virulence was that presence and intensity of LPAIV infection were negatively correlated with body weight. Based on this correlation, together with the demonstrated LPAIV tropism for the intestinal tract, I hypothesize that LPAIV reduces digestive tract function, and suggest how future studies could be directed to test this hypothesis.

AB Animal movements are the primary behavioural adaptation to spatiotemporal heterogeneity in resource availability. Depending on their spatiotemporal scale, movements have been categorized into distinct functional groups (e.g. foraging movements, dispersal, migration), and have been studied using different methodologies. We suggest striving towards the development of a coherent framework based on the ultimate function of all movement types, which is to increase individual fitness through an optimal exploitation of resources varying in space and time. We developed a novel approach to simultaneously study movements at different spatiotemporal scales based on the following proposed theory: the length and frequency of animal movements are determined by the interaction between temporal autocorrelation in resource availability and spatial autocorrelation in changes in resource availability. We hypothesized that for each time interval the spatiotemporal scales of moose Alces alces movements correspond to the spatiotemporal scales of variation in the gains derived from resource exploitation when taking into account the costs of movements (represented by their proxies, forage availability NDVI and snow depth respectively). The scales of change in NDVI and snow were quantified using wave theory, and were related to the scale of moose movement using linear mixed models. In support of the proposed theory we found that frequent, smaller scale movements were triggered by fast, small-scale ripples of changes, whereas infrequent, larger scale movements matched slow, large-scale waves of change in resource availability. Similarly, moose inhabiting ranges characterized by larger scale waves of change in the onset of spring migrated longer distances. We showed that the scales of movements are driven by the scales of changes in the net profitability of trophic resources. Our approach can be extended to include drivers of movements other than trophic resources (e.g. population density, density of related individuals, predation risk) and may facilitate the assessment of the impact of environmental changes on community dynamics and conservation.

AB The skyglow produced by artificial lights at night is one of the most dramatic anthropogenic modifications of Earth's biosphere. The GLOBE at Night citizen science project allows individual observers to quantify skyglow using star maps showing different levels of light pollution. We show that aggregated GLOBE at Night data depend strongly on artificial skyglow, and could be used to track lighting changes worldwide. Naked eye time series can be expected to be very stable, due to the slow pace of human eye evolution. The standard deviation of an individual GLOBE at Night observation is found to be 1.2 stellar magnitudes. Zenith skyglow estimates from the "First World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness" are tested using a subset of the GLOBE at Night data. Although we find the World Atlas overestimates sky brightness in the very center of large cities, its predictions for Milky Way visibility are accurate.

AB Ecologists have long sought to explain the coexistence of multiple potentially competing species in local assemblages. This is especially challenging in species-rich assemblages in which interspecific competition is intense, as it often is in ant assemblages. As a result, a suite of mechanisms has been proposed to explain coexistence among potentially competing ant species: the dominance-discovery tradeoff, the dominance-thermal tolerance tradeoff, spatial segregation, temperature-based niche partitioning, and temporal niche partitioning. Through a series of observations and experiments, we examined a deciduous forest ant assemblage in eastern North America for the signature of each of these coexistence mechanisms. We failed to detect evidence for any of the commonly suggested mechanisms of coexistence, with one notable exception: ant species appear to temporally partition foraging times such that behaviourally dominant species foraged more intensely at night, while foraging by subdominant species peaked during the day. Our work, though focused on a single assemblage, indicates that many of the commonly cited mechanisms of coexistence may not be general to all ant assemblages. However, temporal segregation may play a role in promoting coexistence among ant species in at least some ecosystems, as it does in many other organisms.

AB The effect of arabica coffee management intensity on composition, structure, and regeneration of moist evergreen Afromontane forests was studied in three traditional coffee-management systems of southwest Ethiopia: semiplantation coffee, semiforest coffee, and forest coffee. Vegetation and environmental data were collected in 84 plots from forests varying in intensity of coffee management. After controlling for environmental variation (altitude, aspect, slope, soil nutrient availability, and soil depth), differences in woody species composition, forest structure, and regeneration potential among management systems were compared using one way analysis of variance. The study showed that intensification of forest coffee cultivation to maximize coffee production negatively affects diversity and structure of Ethiopian moist evergreen Afromontane forests. Intensification of coffee productivity starts with the conversion of forest coffee to semiforest coffee, which has significant negative effects on tree seedling abundance. Further intensification leads to the conversion of semiforest to semiplantation coffee, causing significant diversity losses and the collapse of forest structure (decrease of stem density, basal area, crown closure, crown cover, and dominant tree height). Our study underlines the need for shade certification schemes to include variables other than canopy cover and that the loss of species diversity in intensively managed coffee systems may jeopardize the sustainability of coffee production itself through the decrease of ecosystem resilience and disruption of ecosystem services related to coffee yield, such as pollination and pest control.

ID SOCKEYE-SALMON; HABITAT
AB We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes from muscle tissues accrued in the ocean to examine whether marine foraging tactics in anadromous sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) are linked to their ultimate freshwater life history as adults. Adults from large-bodied populations spawning in deep freshwater habitats had more enriched delta N-15 than individuals from small-bodied populations from shallow streams. Within populations, earlier maturing individuals had higher delta N-15 than older fish. These differences in delta N-15 suggest that the fish with different life histories or spawning habitats in freshwater either fed at different trophic positions or in different habitats in the ocean. We propose that, nested within interspecific diversity in the ecological attributes of salmon, population and life-history diversity in spawning adults is associated with variation in marine foraging tactics. These results further indicate that the trophic diversity of sockeye salmon in the ocean may be linked to trade-offs in ecological and evolutionary constraints they eventually experience as adults in freshwater ecosystems.

AB Using a decade of satellite ocean-colour observations and a model that links chlorophyll-a to the size of the phytoplankton cells, parameterised using pigment data from the Indian Ocean, we examine the implications of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) for phytoplankton size structure. The inferred interannual anomalies in phytoplankton size structure are related to those in sea-surface temperature (SST) and sea-surface height (SSH), derived using satellite radiometry and altimetry, and stratification, derived using the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) database. In regions influenced by the Indian Ocean Dipole, we observe a tight correlation between phytoplankton size structure and the physical variables, such that interannual variations in the physical variables accounts for up to 70% of the total variance in phytoplankton size structure. For much of the Indian Ocean, low temperature. low SSH and low stratification (indicative of a turbulent environment) are correlated with larger size classes, consistent with theories on coupling between physical-chemical processes and ecosystem structure. To the extent that phytoplankton function is related to its size structure, changes in physical forcing are likely to influence biogeochemical cycles in the region and the pelagic food web. The limitations of our approach are discussed and we highlight future challenges in satellite ocean-colour monitoring, should climate change lead to any modification in our marine ecosystem.

AB Individuals of many avian and mammalian species produce antipredator calls when they encounter a predator. These calls often vary in acoustic structure depending on the type or level of predation risk, thereby eliciting the appropriate escape responses in conspecifics. Such complexity in communication may also be advantageous in situations in which animals recruit other individuals to mob predators because different risks may sometimes require different mobbing responses. I tested this idea in Japanese great tits, Parus major minor, which produce acoustically distinct mobbing calls for two different nest predators: 'chicka' calls for jungle crows, Corvus macrorhynchos, and 'jar' calls for Japanese rat snakes, Elaphe climacophora. A playback experiment revealed that adult great tits responded to different mobbing calls with qualitatively different behaviours: they scanned the horizon in response to 'chicka' calls and gazed towards the ground in response to 'jar' calls. These two responses help adults search for and detect the corresponding predators since crows fly to the nest and snakes approach from the ground. This study demonstrates that the mobbing calls of Japanese great tits transmit referential information about predator types and elicit the appropriate predator-searching behaviours in adults.

AB Over the next century, changes in the global climate are expected to have major consequences for plant communities, possibly including the exacerbation of species invasions. We evaluated this possibility in the grass flora of California, which is economically and ecologically important and heavily invaded. We used a novel, trait-based approach involving two components: identifying differences in trait composition between native and exotic components of the grass flora and evaluating contemporary traitclimate relationships across the state. The combination of traitclimate relationships and trait differences between groups allows us to predict changes in the exotic-native balance under climate change scenarios. Exotic species are more likely to be annual, taller, with larger leaves, larger seeds, higher specific leaf area, and higher leaf N percentage than native species. Across the state, all these traits are associated with regions with higher temperature. Therefore, we predict that increasing temperatures will favor trait states that tend to be possessed by exotic species, increasing the dominance of exotic species. This prediction is corroborated by the current distribution of exotic species richness relative to native richness in California; warmer areas contain higher proportions of exotic species. This pattern was very well captured by a simple model that predicts invasion severity given only the traitclimate relationship for native species and trait differences between native and exotic species. This study provides some of the first evidence for an important interaction between climate change and species invasions across very broad geographic and taxonomic scales.

AB Homoploid hybrid speciation in animals is poorly understood, mainly because of the scarcity of well-documented cases. Here, we present the results of a multilocus sequence analysis on the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), Spanish sparrow (P. hispaniolensis) and their proposed hybrid descendant, the Italian sparrow (P. italiae). The Italian sparrow is shown to be genetically intermediate between the house sparrow and Spanish sparrow, exhibiting genealogical discordance and a mosaic pattern of alleles derived from either of the putative parental species. The average variation on the Z chromosome was significantly reduced compared with autosomal variation in the putative parental species, the house sparrow and Spanish sparrow. Additionally, divergence between the two species was elevated on the Z chromosome relative to the autosomes. This pattern of variation and divergence is consistent with reduced introgression of Z-linked genes and/or a faster-Z effect (increased rate of adaptive divergence on the Z). F-ST-outlier tests were consistent with the faster-Z hypothesis: two of five Z-linked loci (CHD1Z and PLAA) were identified as candidates for being subject to positive, divergent selection in the putative parental species. Interestingly, the two latter genes showed a mosaic pattern in the (hybrid) Italian sparrow; that is, the Italian sparrow was found to be fixed for Spanish sparrow alleles at CHD1Z and to mainly have house sparrow alleles at PLAA. Preliminary evidence presented in this study thus suggests that sex chromosomes may play a significant role in this case of homoploid hybrid speciation.

AB On the Eastern Tibetan Plateau region (Sichuan province, China) dogs are regarded as important definitive hosts of Echinococcus multilocularis. We studied dog spatial behaviour in 4 Tibetan villages in order to determine the role of dogs in environmental contamination and their potential interactions with small mammal intermediate hosts. We identified definitive host species and Echinococcus spp. infection status of feces collected in the field by PCR methods and analysed the spatial distribution of canid feces. Nocturnal space utilization of GPS collared dogs in and around villages was also undertaken. E. multilocularis DNA was amplified in 23% of dog feces (n=142) and in 15% of fox feces (n=13) but this difference was not significant. However, dog feces were more frequently observed (78% of collected feces) than fox feces and are therefore assumed to largely contribute to human environment contamination. Feces were mainly distributed around houses of dog owners (0-200 m) where collared dogs spent the majority of their time. Inside villages, the contamination was aggregated in some micro-foci where groups of dogs defecated preferentially. Finally, small mammal densities increased from the dog core areas to grasslands at the periphery of villages occasionally used by dogs; male dogs moving significantly farther than females. This study constitutes a first attempt to quantify in a spatially explicit way the role of dogs in E. multilocularis peri-domestic cycles and to identify behavioural parameters required to model E. multilocularis transmission in this region.

AB The role climate change may play in altering human health, particularly in the emergence and spread of diseases, is an evolving area of research. It is important to understand this relationship because it will compound the already significant burden of diseases on national economies and public health. Authorities need to be able to assess, anticipate, and monitor human health vulnerability to climate change, in order to plan for, or implement action to avoid these eventualities. Environmental health indicators (EHIs) provide a tool to assess, monitor, and quantify human health vulnerability, to aid in the design and targeting of interventions, and measure the effectiveness of climate change adaptation and mitigation activities. Our aim was to identify the most suitable framework for developing EHIs to measure and monitor the impacts of climate change on human health and inform the development of interventions. Using published literature we reviewed the attributes of 11 frameworks. We identified the Driving force-Pressure-State-Exposure-Effect-Action (DPSEEA) framework as the most suitable one for developing EHIs for climate change and health. We propose the use of EHIs as a valuable tool to assess, quantify, and monitor human health vulnerability, design and target interventions, and measure the effectiveness of climate change adaptation and mitigation activities. In this paper, we lay the groundwork for the future development of EHIs as a multidisciplinary approach to link existing environmental and epidemiological data and networks. Analysis of such data will contribute to an enhanced understanding of the relationship between climate change and human health.

AB Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) is one of the oldest domesticated cereal crops in Eurasia, but identifying foxtail millets, especially in charred grains, and differentiating it from its wild ancestor, green foxtail (Setaria viridis), in the archaeobotanical remains, is still problematic. Phytolithic analysis provides a meaningful method for identifying this important crop. In this paper, the silicon structure patterns in the glumes, lemmas, and paleas from inflorescence bracts in 16 modern plants of foxtail millet and green foxtail from China and Europe are examined using light microscopy with phase-contrast and a microscopic interferometer. Our research shows that the silicon structure of Omega III from upper lemmas and paleas in foxtail millet and green foxtail can be correspondingly divided into two groups. The size of Omega III type phytolith of foxtail millet is bigger than that from green foxtail. Discriminant function analysis reveals that 78.4% of data on foxtail millet and 76.9% of data on green foxtail are correctly classified. This means certain morphotypes of phytoliths are relatively reliable tools for distinguishing foxtail millet from green foxtail. Our results also revealed that the husk phytolith morphologies of foxtail millets from China and Eastern Europe are markedly different from those from Western Europe. Our research gives a meaningful method of separating foxtail millet and green foxtail. The implications of these findings for understanding the history of foxtail millet domestication and cultivation in ancient civilizations are significant.

AB Urbanization is a leading cause of species endangerment in the United States; however, certain species thrive in urban habitats. The loss of key predators or the addition of new predators in urban areas could alter the structure of urban communities. A reduction in nest predation is hypothesized to explain the high density of urban birds, yet urban areas typically have increased populations of avian nest predators. The loss of important nest predators in urban habitats, prey switching of urban predators, or successful nest defense against avian nest predators could explain this urban nest predator paradox. To assess these hypotheses I compared nest predation rates of Northern mockingbirds (Mimus polyglottos) in parking lots and residential neighborhoods to populations in pastures and wildlife preserves during 2007-2009 in Florida, USA and placed video cameras on a subset of nests in 2008-2009. Data do not support the hypothesis that urban nest predation rates are consistently lower than non-urban nest predation rates. Of the 56 nest predation events recorded, cats were the dominant urban predator and Cooper's hawks (Accipiter cooperii) were the dominant non-urban predator. There was no evidence for a loss of important nest predators in urban habitats; however, prey switching by Cooper's hawks likely occurred. There was also indirect evidence for the importance of nest defense. Furthermore, some of the cats recorded as nest predators in residential neighborhoods were owned cats and all but one cat predation event occurred at night. To reduce nest predation rates, cat owners should keep their cats indoors at night. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In Japan, pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum mainly feed on vetch and clover, and many aphid clones produce more progeny on vetch than on clover. In this context, particular genotypes of the facultative symbiont Regiella insecticola enhance reproduction of infected pea aphids specifically on clover, thereby broadening the suitable food plant range of the insect. A species that is sympatric to A. pisum, vetch aphids Megoura crassicauda, are commonly found on vetch but not on clover. Laboratory rearing of M. crassicauda strains revealed active reproduction on vetch but substantially no reproduction on clover. Experimental transfection of Regiella from A. pisum to M. crassicauda by haemolymph injection established stable and heritable infection in the recipients, although no Regiella infection has been detected in natural populations of M. crassicauda. Different strains of Regiella-transfected M. crassicauda grew and reproduced on vetch, but exhibited lower fitness in comparison with corresponding uninfected aphid strains. Strikingly, the Regiella-transfected M. crassicauda exhibited improved survival and some reproduction on clover. These results suggest that Regiella has the potential to confer an ecological trait, adaptation to clover, on novel insect hosts, and also account for why Regiella is able to infect M. crassicauda but is scarcely found in these aphid populations.

AB Amphibians are an important and imperiled component of biodiversity. In this study we analyze the efficacy of Italian reserve network for protecting multiple amphibian species in a climate change scenario, considering both nationally designated areas and Natura 2000 sites. Our approach is based on ensemble niche modeling estimate of potential range shift under two carbon emission scenarios (A1FI and B1) and two dispersal assumptions. The predicted distributions were used to perform gap and irreplaceability analyses. Our findings show that the current Italian reserve network incompletely represents current amphibian diversity and its geographic pattern. The combination of the nationally designated protected areas and the Natura 2000 sites improves current representation of amphibians, but conservation targets based on geographic range extent are achieved for only 40% of species. Under the future scenarios, Natura 2000 sites become a crucial component of the protected areas system. Nonetheless, we predict that climate change decreases for many species the amount of suitable range falling into reserves, regardless of our assumptions about dispersal. We identify some currently unprotected areas that have high irreplaceability scores for species conservation and that maintain their importance under all the future scenarios we considered. We recommend designation of new reserves in these areas to help guarantee long-term amphibian conservation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB P>There is a gap between the order of magnitude of maximum documented distances of airborne tree pollen transport (up to 102-103 km) and effective wind pollination (up to 101 km), which may partly derive from greater difficulties in detecting the latter. This study aims to assess wind pollination over scales closer to the maximum observed physical pollen transport distances.
   The origin of effective pollen immigrants into a strongly isolated Iberian Pinus sylvestris remnant was investigated using paternally inherited microsatellite markers and maximum-likelihood estimation combined with Monte Carlo assessment of parameter uncertainty.
   The results revealed significant effective pollen flow (up to 4.4%) from a large population located 100 km away, suggesting that the well-known mesoscale airborne transport of viable pine pollen can result in successful pollination over larger scales than previously reported for wind-pollinated tree species.
   This study supports the view that the gap between documented potential and effective wind pollen dispersal scales might not accurately reflect biological reality. Expanding the expected range of effective wind pollination has an impact on the assessment of a wide range of ecological and evolutionary processes, including reproductive assurance on fragmentation or colonization, metapopulation connectivity and interactions with local adaptation in heterogeneous habitats.

AB Infectious disease has been shown to be a major cause of population declines in wild animals. However, there remains little empirical evidence on the genetic consequences of disease-mediated population declines, or how such perturbations might affect demographic processes such as dispersal. Devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) has resulted in the rapid decline of the Tasmanian devil, Sarcophilus harrisii, and threatens to cause extinction. Using 10 microsatellite DNA markers, we compared genetic diversity and structure before and after DFTD outbreaks in three Tasmanian devil populations to assess the genetic consequences of disease-induced population decline. We also used both genetic and demographic data to investigate dispersal patterns in Tasmanian devils along the east coast of Tasmania. We observed a significant increase in inbreeding (FIS pre/post-disease -0.030/0.012, P<0.05; relatedness pre/post-disease 0.011/0.038, P=0.06) in devil populations after just 2-3 generations of disease arrival, but no detectable change in genetic diversity. Furthermore, although there was no subdivision apparent among pre-disease populations (theta=0.005, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.003 to 0.017), we found significant genetic differentiation among populations post-disease (theta=0.020, 0.010-0.027), apparently driven by a combination of selection and altered dispersal patterns of females in disease-affected populations. We also show that dispersal is male-biased in devils and that dispersal distances follow a typical leptokurtic distribution. Our results show that disease can result in genetic and demographic changes in host populations over few generations and short time scales. Ongoing management of Tasmanian devils must now attempt to maintain genetic variability in this species through actions designed to reverse the detrimental effects of inbreeding and subdivision in disease-affected populations.

AB In this article, we present a study on the surface energy balance of a polygonal tundra landscape in northeast Siberia. The study was performed during half-year periods from April to September in each of 2007 and 2008. The surface energy balance is obtained from independent measurements of the net radiation, the turbulent heat fluxes, and the ground heat flux at several sites. Short-wave radiation is the dominant factor controlling the magnitude of all the other components of the surface energy balance during the entire observation period. About 50% of the available net radiation is consumed by the latent heat flux, while the sensible and the ground heat flux are each around 20 to 30%. The ground heat flux is mainly consumed by active layer thawing. About 60% of the energy storage in the ground is attributed to the phase change of soil water. The remainder is used for soil warming down to a depth of 15 m. In particular, the controlling factors for the surface energy partitioning are snow cover, cloud cover, and the temperature gradient in the soil. The thin snow cover melts within a few days, during which the equivalent of about 20% of the snow-water evaporates or sublimates. Surface temperature differences of the heterogeneous landscape indicate spatial variabilities of sensible and latent heat fluxes, which are verified by measurements. However, spatial differences in the partitioning between sensible and latent heat flux are only measured during conditions of high radiative forcing, which only occur occasionally.

AB Explosive speciation in ancient lakes has fascinated biologists for centuries and has inspired classical work on the tempo and modes of speciation. Considerable attention has been directed towards the extrinsic forces of speciation-the geological, geographical and ecological peculiarities of ancient lakes. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in the intrinsic nature of these radiations, the biological characteristics conducive to speciation. While new species are thought to arise mainly by the gradual enhancement of reproductive isolation among geographically isolated populations, ancient lakes provide little evidence for a predominant role of geography in speciation. Recent phylogenetic work provides strong evidence that multiple colonization waves were followed by parallel intralacustrine radiations that proceeded at relatively rapid rates despite long-term gene flow through hybridization and introgression. Several studies suggest that hybridization itself might act as a key evolutionary mechanism by triggering major genomic reorganization/revolution and enabling the colonization of new ecological niches in ancient lakes. These studies propose that hybridization is not only of little impediment to diversification but could act as an important force in facilitating habitat transitions, promoting postcolonization adaptations and accelerating diversification. Emerging ecological genomic approaches are beginning to shed light on the long-standing evolutionary dilemma of speciation in the face of gene flow. We propose an integrative programme for future studies on speciation in ancient lakes.

AB P>1. Clearcut logging results in major changes in ectomycorrhizal fungal communities, but whether this results in the loss of key functional traits, such as those associated with nutrient acquisition from soil organic matter, is unknown. Furthermore, little is known about the importance of resource partitioning in structuring ectomycorrhizal fungal communities following disturbance because most research on these communities has focussed on life history strategies. By studying functional traits, such as activities of enzymes involved in the catabolism of organic macromolecules in soil, we can determine whether a physiological potential for resource partitioning exists in pioneer ectomycorrhizal communities and whether severe disturbance affects these important ecosystem services.
   2. We used activities of key hydrolytic enzymes in the ectomycorrhizospheres of Douglas-fir seedlings regenerating at clearcut sites as a functional trait to test whether these differed from those at recent wildfire sites or control forests. We sampled the most abundant types of ectomycorrhizas from 16-month-old seedlings from sites exposed to (i) low or (ii) high severity wildfire, (iii) sites that had been clearcut logged in the same year as the fire and (iv) sites that contained control stands of mature Douglas-fir. We expected differences in activities among ectomycorrhizas sampled from different disturbance treatments and among those formed by different fungal species.
   3. In spite of large differences in soil chemistry, activities of acid phosphomonoesterase, N-acetylglucosaminidase and beta-glucosidase, when averaged among the ectomycorrhizas sampled per site, were not affected by disturbance agent. However, activities varied up to sixfold among mycorrhizospheres of different fungal species on the same seedling. Multivariate analysis also indicated some consistent differences in enzyme profiles among ectomycorrhizas formed by specific fungal species, independent of treatment.
   4. The finding that ectomycorrhizal fungal communities exposed to different disturbance agents are functionally similar with respect to the activities of three mycorrhizosphere enzymes supports the conclusion that complementarity exists among ectomycorrhizal fungi. The substantial physiological diversity among ectomycorrhizal fungi at the scale of an individual seedling's root tips, especially at control mature forests, indicates the potential for resource partitioning within the ectomycorrhizal community and access to a wider range of nutrient sources by each seedling.
   5. Functional similarity among ectomycorrhizal fungal communities across a disturbance severity gradient suggests that dry interior Douglas-fir forests are resilient to severe disturbances such as high severity wildfire and clearcutting with forest floor removal. Moreover, our results suggest that current harvesting practices emulate natural disturbances with respect to site-level mycorrhizosphere enzyme activity. The large variation in activity among fungal species, however, indicates that a substantial simplification of the fungal community through other perturbations, as expected with climate change, has the potential to affect ecosystem function.

TI Sex in a material world: why the study of sexual reproduction and
   sex-specific traits should become more nutritionally-explicit

AB Recent advances in nutritional ecology, particularly arising from Ecological Stoichiometry and the Geometric Framework for nutrition, have resulted in greater theoretical coherence and increasingly incisive empirical methodologies that in combination allow for the consideration of nutrient-related processes at many levels of biological complexity. However, these advances have not been consistently integrated into the study of sexual differences in reproductive investment, despite contemporary emphasis on the material costs associated with sexually selected traits (e.g. condition-dependence of exaggerated ornaments). Nutritional ecology suggests that material costs related to sex-specific reproductive traits should be linked to quantifiable underlying differences in the relationship between individuals of each sex and their foods. Here, we argue that applying nutritionally-explicit thought to the study of sexual reproduction should both deepen current understanding of sex-specific phenomena and broaden the tractable frontiers of sexual selection research. In support of this general argument, we examine the causes and consequences of sex-specific nutritional differences, from food selection and nutrient processing to sex-specific reproductive traits. At each level of biological organization, we highlight how a nutritionally-explicit perspective may provide new insights and help to identify new directions. Based on predictions derived at the individual level, we then consider how sex-specific nutrient limitation might influence population growth, and thus potentially broader patterns of life history evolution, using a simple population dynamics model. We conclude by highlighting new avenues of research that may be more accessible from this integrative perspective.

AB Many studies have found that seemingly unconnected behaviors are correlated into behavioral syndromes. These behavioral syndromes may be the consequence of interindividual variation in life-history strategies. Only few studies have investigated the role of behavioral syndromes in cooperatively breeding species, despite the fact that one would expect particular large variation in behavior clue to the wealth of life-history decisions a cooperative breeder faces. In a longitudinal study, we repeatedly tested individuals of the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher for exploration, boldness, and aggression and tested whether these behaviors were sex specific; whether they were interrelated; and whether they were connected to growth and to 2 major life-history decisions, helping, and dispersal. In both sexes, explorative behavior was correlated over time, even though after sexual maturity males increased their exploration rate. In both sexes, exploration, boldness, and aggression correlated when mature, and in females, helping behavior was part of the syndrome. No relationships with growth were detected. Helping and dispersal were related to each other in males, whereas females hardly dispersed. We suggest that the differences in the life histories between males and females (male dispersal vs. female philopatry) lead to the differences in behavioral types observed and also to the differences in the stability of the behavioral syndromes between the sexes. The links between dispersal and helping in males and the behavioral types and helping in females highlight the necessity to study multiple traits to understand the evolution and maintenance of variation in cooperative behavior.

AB As range shifts coincident with climate change have become increasingly well documented, efforts to describe the causes of range boundaries have increased. Three mechanisms-genetic impoverishment, migration load, or a physical barrier to dispersal-are well described theoretically, but the data needed to distinguish among them have rarely been collected. We describe the distribution, abundance, genetic variation, and environment of Tetraclita rubescens, an intertidal barnacle that expanded its northern range limit by several hundreds of kilometres from San Francisco, CA, USA, since the 1970s. We compare geographic variation in abundance with abiotic and biotic patterns, including sea surface temperatures and the distributions of 387 co-occurring species, and describe genetic variation in cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, mitochondrial noncoding region, and nine microsatellite loci from 27 locations between Bahia Magdalena (California Baja Sur, Mexico) and Cape Mendocino (CA, USA). We find very high gene flow, high genetic diversity, and a gradient in physical environmental variation coincident with the range limit. We infer that the primary cause of the northern range boundary in T. rubescens is migration load arising from flow of maladapted alleles into peripheral locations and that environmental change, which could have reduced selection against genotypes immigrating into the newly colonized portion of the range, is the most likely cause of the observed range expansion. Because environmental change could similarly affect all taxa in a region whose distributional limits are established by migration load, these mechanisms may be common causes of range boundaries and largely synchronous multi-species range expansions.

AB We studied the vegetation, testate amoebae and abiotic variables (depth of the water table, pH, electrical conductivity, Ca and Mg concentrations of water extracted from mosses) along the bog to extremely rich fen gradient in sub-alpine peatlands of the Upper Engadine (Swiss Alps). Testate amoeba diversity was correlated to that of mosses but not of vascular plants. Diversity peaked in rich fen for testate amoebae and in extremely rich fen for mosses, while for testate amoebae and mosses it was lowest in bog but for vascular plants in extremely rich fen. Multiple factor and redundancy analyses (RDA) revealed a stronger correlation of testate amoebae than of vegetation to water table and hydrochemical variables and relatively strong correlation between testate amoeba and moss community data. In RDA, hydrochemical variables explained a higher proportion of the testate amoeba and moss data than water table depth. Abiotic variables explained a higher percentage of the species data for testate amoebae (30.3% or 19.5% for binary data) than for mosses (13.4%) and vascular plants (10%). These results show that (1) vascular plant, moss and testate amoeba communities respond differently to ecological gradients in peatlands and (2) testate amoebae are more strongly related than vascular plants to the abiotic factors at the mire surface. These differences are related to vertical trophic gradients and associated niche differentiation.

AB The western Balkans, characterized by high rates of endemism, are recognized as one of the most diverse and species-rich areas of Europe. The present study flocuses on diploid spcciation in a poorly explored ancestral group of the genus Cardainiiie that is distributed in the arnphi-Adriatic territory. Morphological data and DNA sequences (plastid trnL intron and trnL-trnF spacer. ITS of nrDNA, and single-copy nuclear gene CHS) were Used to address taxonomic, phylogenetic and evolutionary questions. Recognition ofseveral previsouly described. but recently not accepted narrow endemics is Supported (C. fialae, C. rupetris. C. serbica). Cardamine marilima s.str. is segregated into three distinct entities, which were given species rank. A new taxonomic Concept of the group) is proposed, including identification key, synonymy, typifications, C. montenegrina sp.. nov. and C. adriatica nom. nov. Chloroplast data indicate radiation of the ancestral lineagc into a series of distinct endemic species. lack of resolution at internal nodes and incongruence With nuclear Phylogenics suggest that this radiation occurred rapidly. Nuclear data indicate more recent hybridization events. It is assumed that glacial-induced local-scale and altitudinal migrations along the Balkan coastline and in adjacent massifs caused contacts between previously isolated populations, resulting in occasional interspecific gcne-flow. Trans-Adriatic conlacts and gene exchange are also suggested

AB Charcoal produced by fire on the soil surface mixes into the soil over time and is heterogeneously distributed within the soil profile in post-fire forests. To determine how different patterns of vertical distribution of charcoal and ectomycorrhizal formation affect the growth of Larix gmelinii (Gmelin larch) in post-fire forests, we conducted a model experiment in the pots. In this study, pots with a layer of charcoal in the middle of the soil profile promoted growth of the root system of the seedlings significantly more than did pots with no charcoal or with charcoal scattered throughout the soil. Along with the development of the root system, above-ground biomass and total biomass were also increased. Furthermore, in addition to the positive effects of charcoal in the soil, there were also strong positive effects on the growth of seedlings from ectomycorrhizal root formation. As a result, the largest above-ground biomass and total biomass were found for seedlings grown in layered charcoal with ectomycorrhizae. Furthermore, the highest phosphorus concentration in needles was also found for seedlings grown in layered charcoal with ectomycorrhizae. This is attributable to the frequent contact of roots with charcoal in the middle layer of the soil and the utilisation of phosphate by ectomycorrhizae. This suggests that buried and layered charcoal occurring in patches in post-fire stands may provide a suitable habitat for the growth of Gmelin larch seedlings.

AB Disturbance from floods and/or low flows is a pervading force in almost all benthic riverine communities around the world. As such the study of disturbance effects on benthic communities has been a dominant theme of research in benthic river ecology. Many of these studies have been phenomenological or have evaluated hypotheses developed in other areas of ecology. These studies have provided considerable weight to move the common view of ecological communities in general as deterministically structured, to one where stochastic disturbances can be the dominant structuring force in many communities. Benthic river studies investigating the link between disturbance and diversity have generally failed to find support for single variable hypotheses, such as the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, from other areas of ecology, however, river ecologists have been among the first to embrace multivariate models of diversity. The highly mobile, larval life history stage of many riverine invertebrates makes many of the hypotheses generated in general ecology inappropriate for benthic river communities; however, the recently popularized neutral models may prove to be good descriptors of these communities. Food web structure studies indicate riverine webs respond differently to disturbance from the way predicted by ecological theory. The contribution of studies of disturbance in benthic ecology to general ecology has to date been rather limited with some notable exceptions. However, the ubiquity of floods in rivers worldwide offers fertile ground for future contributions that could substantially advance this area of ecology. Benthic river ecologists need to resist the temptation to simply show general ecological models often do not work in streams, and need to develop their own models, which in turn may feed back to wider ecology.

AB Tintinnid ciliates, characterized by the possession of a lorica into which the ciliate cell can contract, are a common component of the marine microzooplankton. Lorica architecture and size range widely and classically distinguishes species. Here relationships between ecological parameters and lorica dimensions (lorica oral diameter (LOD), lorica length (LL) and lorica volume (LV) are examined using data from literature reports. The relationships between lorica dimensions and reproductive potential, using maximum reported growth rates of natural populations (n = 52 species) are assessed. Susceptibility to copepod predation and lorica dimensions are considered based on reports of clearance rates of Acartia species feeding on tintinnid ciliates (n = 7 species). Diet and lorica dimension is analyzed using data on mean maximum food size contained in field-caught cells (n = 20 species), and preferred food size based on prey size associated with maximal reported clearance rates (n = 15 species). Overall, LOD is closely related to most of the ecological parameters. Maximum growth rate is related to LOD with smaller LODs corresponding to higher growth rates, in contrast to LL and LV. Maximum prey size is positively related to both LOD and LL but more tightly with LOD. Preferred prey size is positively related to LOD and LV but more tightly related to LOD. Clearance rates of Acartia species feeding on tintinnids are significantly related only to LOD with small LODs corresponding to lower copepod feeding rates. Relationships excluding data on species of Tintinnopsis, the species-rich genus which generally dominates coastal communities, are also examined and show similar trends. In tintinnids, LOD, known to be a conservative and relatively reliable species characteristic, appears related to a wide range of ecological characteristics.

AB Large-scale diversity patterns in relationship to environmental factors at multiple spatial scales have been well-studied for many taxonomic groups; however, freshwater ecosystems remain understudied. Biodiversity is now widely recognized to encompass many more factors than just species numbers, particularly the inclusion of functional attributes. In this study, we examined richness patterns of stream invertebrate genera and their biological traits ("functional" richness) across 364 sites in the contiguous USA. In particular, we focused on the relationship between taxonomy- and trait-based richness to test for functional redundancy in stream communities. Further, we obtained environmental data to model the relative importance of local and watershed-scale environmental factors and residual spatial (latitude, longitude) influences on taxonomy- and trait-based richness. Trait richness increased linearly with genus richness (slope a parts per thousand(a) 1), although this appears to be an artifact of the restricted range of genus richness in our study (32 genera maximum). Furthermore, trait richness was significantly lower than expected under random community assembly. In contrast, the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) genera exhibited a saturating pattern between trait and genus richness and trait richness was no different from random. Our study indicates that there is functional redundancy among stream invertebrate genera, likely as a result of harsh habitat filters limiting trait diversity. Environmental factors (including spatially structured environmental factors) were always more important than spatial factors (latitude, longitude) in structuring richness despite strong longitudinal patterns of all richness measures (these differences were only significant for EPT genera). Finally, we found no significant difference in the relative importance of local and watershed scale environmental factors for taxonomy- and trait-based richness.

AB The role of plant community structure and plant functional traits for above- and belowground carbon (C) fluxes was studied for 2 years in a mesocosm experiment with grassland monoliths, using continuous gas exchange measurements and soil analyses. Here we test the response-and-effect trait hypothesis, by applying a mathematical framework used to predict changes in C fluxes after a change in disturbance through the community response (R) and effect (E) traits. Monoliths were extracted from two contrasted long-term field treatments (high vs. low grazing disturbance) and exposed to both low and high (simulated grazing) disturbance during a 2 years experiment. Carbon dioxide exchanges were measured continuously in an open flow system. Net ecosystem productivity and ecosystem C balance were positively correlated at low disturbance with plant species richness. Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and soil C sequestration were, however, unrelated to these variables. Community aggregated leaf (specific leaf area, leaf dry-matter content) and root and rhizome (specific length, tissue density, diameter) traits responded (R) significantly to changes in disturbance, indicating an increased dominance of conservative plant growth strategies at low compared with high disturbance. Applying the mathematical framework, ANPP was predicted by distribution of leaf traits within the community (functional divergence), while mean root and rhizome traits had significant effects (E) on soil C sequestration, irrespective of the experimental disturbance and of the year. According to highly significant linear regression models, between 6% and 61% of the transient changes in soil C sequestration resulted from community root and rhizome (response-and-effect) traits after a change in disturbance.

AB Ecosystem flux measurements using the eddy covariance (EC) technique were undertaken in 4 subsequent years during summer for a total of 562 days in an arctic wet tundra ecosystem, located near Cherskii, Far-Eastern Federal District, Russia. Methane (CH4) emissions were measured using permanent chambers. The experimental field is characterized by late thawing of permafrost soils in June and periodic spring floods. A stagnant water table below the grass canopy is fed by melting of the active layer of permafrost and by flood water. Following 3 years of EC measurements, the site was drained by building a 3 m wide drainage channel surrounding the EC tower to examine possible future effects of global change on the tundra tussock ecosystem. Cumulative summertime net carbon fluxes before experimental alteration were estimated to be about + 15 g C m(-2) (i.e. an ecosystem C loss) and + 8 g C m(-2) after draining the study site. When taking CH4 as another important greenhouse gas into account and considering the global warming potential (GWP) of CH4 vs. CO2, the ecosystem had a positive GWP during all summers. However CH4 emissions after drainage decreased significantly and therefore the carbon related greenhouse gas flux was much smaller than beforehand (475 +/- 253 g C-CO2-e m(-2) before drainage in 2003 vs. 23 +/- 26 g C-CO2-e m(-2) after drainage in 2005).

AB Papilio swallowtail butterflies exhibit a remarkable diversity of Batesian mimicry, manifested in several sex-limited and polymorphic types. There is little understanding of how this diversity is distributed within Papilio, and how different mimicry types have evolved in relation to each other. To answer these questions, I present a graphical model that connects various mimicry types by hypothetical character state changes within a phylogenetic framework. A maximum likelihood analysis of evolution of mimicry types on the Papilio phylogeny showed that sexually monomorphic mimicry and female-limited mimicry have evolved repeatedly but predominantly independently in different clades. However, transitions between these mimicry types are rarely observed. The frequency distribution of character state changes was skewed in favor of the evolution of mimicry, whereas many theoretically plausible character state changes, especially evolutionary loss of mimicry, were not evident. I discuss these findings in relation to studying the tempo of evolutionary change, loss of traits, and directionality and connectivity among character states. The pathway approach and phylogenetic patterns of mimicry demonstrated in Papilio are useful to test novel hypotheses regarding the diversity and evolutionary directionality of Batesian mimicry in other systems.

AB Begging signals of offspring are condition-dependent cues that are usually predicted to display information about the short-termneed (i.e. hunger) to which parents respond by allocating more food. However, recent models and experiments have revealed that parents, depending on the species and context, may respond to signals of quality (i.e. offspring reproductive value) rather than need. Despite the critical importance of this distinction for life history and conflict resolution theory, there is still limited knowledge of alternative functions of offspring signals. In this study, we investigated the communication between offspring and caring females of the common earwig, Forficula auricularia, hypothesizing that offspring chemical cues display information about nutritional condition to which females respond in terms of maternal food provisioning. Consistent with the prediction for a signal of quality we found that mothers exposed to chemical cues from well-fed nymphs foraged significantly more and allocated food to more nymphs compared with females exposed to solvent (control) or chemical cues from poorly fed nymphs. Chemical analysis revealed significant differences in the relative quantities of specific cuticular hydrocarbon compounds between treatments. To our knowledge, this study demonstrates for the first time that an offspring chemical signal reflects nutritional quality and influences maternal care.

AB Question
   While it is well known that species richness depends on plot size, it is not generally recognised that the same must be true for constancy. Accordingly, many authors use varying plot sizes when classifying vegetation based on the comparison of constancies between groups of plots. We ask whether the constancy-area relationship follows a general rule, how strong the effect of plot sizes is on constancies, and if it is possible to correct constancies for area.
   Location
   For empirical evaluation, we use data from plant communities in the Czech Republic, Sweden and Russia.
   Methods
   To assess the potential influence of differences in plot size on constancies, we develop a mathematical model. Then, we use series of nested plot species richness data from a wide range of community types (herbaceous and forest) to determine the parameters of the derived function and to test how much the shape of the constancy-area relationship depends on taxa or vegetation types.
   Results
   Generally, the constancy-area relationship can be described by C (A)=1-(1-C-0)((A/A0)boolean AND d), with C being constancy, A area, C-0 known constancy on a specific area A(0), and d a damping parameter accounting for spatial autocorrelation. As predicted by this function, constancies in plant communities always varied from values near 0% to near 100% if plot sizes were changed sufficiently. For the studied vegetation types, a two- to fourfold increase in plot size resulted in a change of conventional constancy classes, i.e. an increase of constancy by 20% or more.
   Conclusions
   Vegetation classification, which largely relies on constancy values, irrespective of whether traditional or modern fidelity definitions are used, is strongly prone to distorting scale effects when releves of different plot sizes are combined in studies. The constancy-area functions presented allow an approximate transformation of constancies to other plot sizes but are flawed by idiosyncrasies in taxa and vegetation types. Thus, we conclude that the best solution for future surveys is to apply uniform plot sizes within a few a priori delimited formations and to determine diagnostic species only within these formations. Finally, we suggest that more detailed analyses of constancy-area relationships can contribute to a better understanding of species-area relationships because the latter are the summation of the first for all species.

AB The diversities and distributions of diatoms are much more complex than was ever imagined. To understand the underlying mechanisms, research must focus on evolutionary processes occurring at a population level and employ sufficiently informative molecular markers. Using ten microsatellites and ITS rDNA sequence data, we investigated the genetic structure of populations of the benthic freshwater diatom Sellaphora capitata (until 2004 acryptic entity within the S. pupula agg. species complex). This is the first time that microsatellites have been used to investigate the genetic structure of any fresh water or benthic microalga. Using an integrated approach (morphology, DNA barcoding and specificity of the microsatellite primers), we verified the identity of 70 S. capitata isolates obtained from lakes in the UK, Belgium and Australia. Standardized F'(ST) values were very high (>0.4) and in Bayesian analyses, isolates clustered according to their country of origin, with limited evidence of admixture. However, selected isolates from all countries were sexually compatible, a result consistent with limited ITS divergence. Considering the apparent absence of desiccation- resistant resting stages in most diatoms, we conclude that such levels of differentiation are likely to be a consequence of limited dispersal. With restricted dispersal, previously unacknowledged opportunities for allopatric speciation exist, which may help to explain the huge extant diversity of diatoms. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

AB Habitat fragmentation is one of the principal threats to primates. Studies of primates in fragments usually conclude that fragmentation negatively affects some aspect of their biology or ecology. Nevertheless, the definition and quantification of fragmentation vary considerably among studies, resulting in contradictions and results that are difficult to interpret. We here 1) discuss the problems associated with the definition of habitat fragmentation and the ways of measuring it, 2) emphasize the importance of the concepts and methods from landscape ecology and metapopulation theory for the study of primates in fragmented landscapes, and 3) offer recommendations for more precise use of concepts associated with habitat fragmentation from the primates' perspective. When specific knowledge of the study species/population is available, we suggest that the definition of the variables to be measured should be functional from the primates' perspective, based, e.g., on their habitat requirements and dispersal capacity. The distance to the nearest fragment may not be the best way to measure the isolation between populations. Fragmentation per se is a landscape scale process and, hence, landscape scale studies are required to understand how species are distributed across heterogeneous landscapes. Finally, it is important to consider that what happens at the fragment scale could be the consequence of processes that interact at various spatial and temporal scales.

Diorhabda koltzei ab. basicornis Laboissiere, 1935 and D. e. deserticola Chen, 1961 are synonymized under D. carinulata NEW SYNONYMY. Illustrated keys utilize genitalia, including male endophallic sclerites and female vaginal palpi and internal sternite VIII. Distribution, comparative biogeography, biology, and potential in biological control of Tamarix in North America are reviewed. Diorhabda elongata is circummediterranean, favoring Mediterranean and temperate forests of Italy to western Turkey. Diorhabda carinata resides in warm temperate grasslands, deserts, and forests of southern Ukraine south to Iraq and east to western China. Diorhabda sublineata occupies Mediterranean woodlands from France to North Africa and subtropical deserts east to Iraq. Diorhabda carinulata primarily inhabits cold temperate deserts of Mongolia and China west to Russia and south to montane grasslands and warm deserts in southern Iran. Diorhabda meridionalis primarily occupies maritime subtropical deserts of southern Pakistan and Iran to Syria. Northern climatypes of D. carinulata are effective in Tamarix biological control, especially in the Great Basin desert. Diorhabda elongata is probably best suited to Mediterranean woodlands of northern California. Northern climatypes of D. carinata may be best suited for central U. S. grasslands. Diorhabda sublineata, D. meridionalis, and southern climatypes of D. carinata and D. carinulata may each be uniquely suited to areas of the southwestern U. S.

AB Our objective was to investigate the physiological basis of grain number per square meter (GN) and yield in two CIMMYT spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines of large-spike phenotype (LSP), LSP1 and LSP2, and one check cultivar, Bacanora, when grown as single plants in the growth room and at normal sowing densities in high radiation, irrigated field conditions. In the growth room, rachis length, spikelets per spike, and grains per spike were increased by 14 to 39%, 12 to 31% and 8 to 19%, respectively, compared to Bacanora. Increased spikelet number was associated with a longer thermal duration for spikelet primordia production. In the field, averaged over three seasons, 2003-2004 to 2005-2006, spikelets per spike and grains per spike were increased by 4 to 6% and 4 to 5%, respectively, in LSP lines compared to Bacanora (P < 0.05). Overall GN (-23%) and yield (-8%) were decreased in LSP2 compared to Bacanora associated with a lower spike number per square meter (-26%) (P < 0.05). The GN (-9%) and yield (+2%) of LSP1 overall were not different to Bacanora, although LSP1 yielded more in one season, 2004-2005 (+9%) (P < 0.05). LSP1 produced grains about 10% heavier and LSP2, about 20% heavier, than Bacanora, in both growth-room and field experiments. LSP1 showed a positive departure from the overall negative relationship between grains per gram of spike dry matter (at anthesis) and grain weight among the genotypes. LSP1 may represent a source of novel spike morphology for use in breeding programs aimed at boosting grain size at high GN to enhance yield potential.

AB Oceanic islands are good model systems with which to explore factors affecting exotic species diversity. Islands vary in size, topography, substrate type, degree of isolation, native species diversity, history, human population characteristics, and economic development. Moreover, islands are highly vulnerable to exotic species establishment. We used AICc analyses of data on 1132 vascular plant species for 15 countries and 114 islands from the Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk (PIER) project to examine biological, geographical, and socioeconomic correlates of exotic species richness. PIER provides data on the distribution of naturalized non-native plant species thought to pose environmental or economic risk. We hypothesized that the numbers of PIER-listed species would be positively correlated with island size, habitat diversity, and proximity to major source pools for propagules. Further, we expected numbers of PIER-listed exotic species to be similar among islands in the same country and to be greater where human populations were larger and where economic activity was high. Most species (908) were found on <= 10 islands. Species number was significantly correlated with island and country areas and with native plant species richness. The strongest model revealed by AICc analyses of island data included log (area) and maximum elevation as well as country membership, substrate type, and presence of an airport with paved runway (an index of economic activity). By country, AICc analyses revealed two equivalent models, both of which included log (area) and per capita gross domestic product as well as a measure of population size (either log (population size) or (population density)). Our analyses provide strong evidence of the roles of biogeographic, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts on the distribution and spread of exotic species.

AB This study discusses theoretical and practical issues around the definition of internal borders for the management of marine pests, drawing on principles from freshwater and terrestrial pest management. Internal borders are defined as post-border intervention points around which vector management and related activities, such as pest surveillance and incursion response, can be undertaken.
   Internal borders can be identified in marine systems based on knowledge of natural barriers to the dispersal or establishment of pests, including planktonic life stages. We highlight opportunities to define internal borders at broad spatial scales according to oceanographic features or environmental conditions. At smaller spatial scales, habitat barriers based on relatively permanent features (e.g. substratum) could be defined for target organisms (or suites of similar organisms), especially those having both restricted habitat requirements and a limited planktonic duration.
   Where internal borders are identified, risk-based approaches can be used to determine vector management priorities, incorporating knowledge of the connectivity and strength of interactions between hubs of vector activity. However, greater biosecurity and biodiversity benefits may arise from approaches that combine risk-based measures for target pests, with generic measures (e.g. vessel hull anti-fouling) that are applied equally across all human-mediated invasion pathways.
   Case studies of high-profile marine pests in New Zealand illustrate situations where the benefits of internal border management have been realized. The challenge now is to identify how practical it is to widely apply internal borders in a marine biosecurity context, and to identify new internal borders around which management can practically be undertaken.
   Synthesis and applications. Effective control of pest species in marine environments is possible even when they become relatively widespread and established. The definition of internal borders provides an approach to marine biosecurity that assists in elucidating opportunities and priorities for management. Although marine systems are regarded as relatively open, the principles and approaches necessary for the successful management of marine pests are conceptually the same as those applied in freshwater systems and on land.

AB Northeast (NE) China covers three climatic zones and contains all the major forest types of NE Asia. We sampled 108 forest plots in six nature reserves across NE China to examine the influence of climate and local factors (canopy seasonality, successional stage, topography and forest structure) on geographic patterns of plant richness. We analyzed the relative effects of different factors at two spatial scales: the regional scale (across both latitude and altitude) and the local scale (along the altitudinal gradient within site). Our results showed that the relative importance of climate vs local factors differed remarkably depending on scale and functional group. While total and tree species richness were mainly limited by climate, herb and shrub richness was more related to local factors (especially at the local scale). In the climatic factors, heat sum was the major correlate of tree, shrub and total species richness, while herb richness was more associated with winter coldness. Precipitation was not a limiting factor for forest plant richness in NE China. Climate accounted for 34-76% of variation in richness at the regional scale, but explained only 0-44% at the local scale. Among the local factors, shrub species richness was sensitive to seasonal canopy openness, with higher richness in deciduous forests than in the evergreen needle-leaf forest. On the other hand, herb richness was sensitive to forest successional stage, with higher richness in middle- successional forests than in the early and late-sucessional forests. Local topography (aspect and position on slope) and forest structure (tree density) also showed remarkable influence on species richness. Our results suggest the importance of including local factors when examining large scale diversity gradient (especially for understory species), and the necessity of comparing diversity patterns among functional groups at different spatial scales.

AB Local adaptation to contrasting biotic or abiotic environments is an important evolutionary step that presumably precedes floral diversification at the species level, yet few studies have demonstrated the adaptive nature of intraspecific floral divergence in wild plant populations. We combine a population-genomic approach with phenotypic information on floral traits to examine whether the differentiation in metric floral traits exhibited by 14 populations of the southern Spanish hawk moth-pollinated violet Viola cazorlensis reflects adaptive divergence. Screening of many amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci using a multiple-marker-based neutrality test identified nine outlier loci (2.6% of the total) that departed from neutral expectations and were potentially under selection. Generalized analysis of molecular variance revealed significant relationships between genetic distance and population divergence in three floral traits when genetic distance was based on outlier loci, but not when it was based on neutral ones. Population means of floral traits were closely correlated with population scores on the first principal coordinate axis of the genetic distance matrix using outlier loci, and with the allelic frequencies of four of the outlier loci. Results strongly support the adaptive nature of intraspecific floral divergence exhibited by V. cazorlensis and illustrate the potential of genome scans to identify instances of adaptive divergence when used in combination with phenotypic information.

AB In Western Europe, many pond owners introduce amphibians for ornamental purposes. Although indigenous amphibians are legally protected in most European countries, retailers are circumventing national and international legislation by selling exotic nonprotected sibling species. We investigated to what extent non-native species of the European water frog complex (genus Pelophylax) have become established in Belgium, using morphological, mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers. A survey of 87 sampling sites showed the presence of non-native water frogs at 47 locations, mostly Marsh frogs (Pelophylax ridibundus). Surprisingly, at least 19% of all these locations also harboured individuals with mitochondrial haplotypes characteristic of Anatolian water frogs (Pelophylax cf. bedriagae). Nuclear genotyping indicated widespread hybridization and introgression between P. ridibundus and P. cf. bedriagae. In addition, water frogs of Turkish origin obtained through a licensed retailer, also contained P. ridibundus and P. cf. bedriagae, with identical haplotypes to the wild Belgian populations. Although P. ridibundus might have invaded Belgium by natural range expansion from neighbouring countries, our results suggest that its invasion was at least partly enhanced by commercial trade, with origins as far as the Middle East. Also the invasion and rapid spread of Anatolian lineages, masked by their high morphological similarity to P. ridibundus, is likely the result of unregulated commercial trade. We expect that Anatolian frogs will further invade the exotic as well as the native range of P. ridibundus and other Pelophylax species elsewhere in Western and Central Europe, with risks of large-scale hybridization and introgression.

AB A number of indices designed to assess ecosystem function were applied to an existing benthic macrofaunal dataset collected following recent marine aggregate extraction activity at the Hastings Shingle Bank (UK). The objective of the study was to assess the use of these different functional metrics, some incorporating to investigate the rate of recovery in ecosystem function after dredging impact. All biological traits analysis, of the indices tested behaved in a broadly similar fashion following the aggregate extraction event, although some suggested faster rates of functional recovery than others. All indicated that the disturbed area of seabed was capable of full recovery given enough time. It is considered that this outcome may be because the physical nature of the seabed was unlikely to have been permanently altered by dredging for aggregate by the method used. This is not always the case following aggregate extraction and depends on the dredging protocol used (e.g., sediment screening). The indices tested (some applied for the first time to benthic macrofaunal data) were considered to be complementary to traditional environmental assessment metrics and each might be used under different circumstances.

AB 1. Land-use change in 450 ha in southern Sweden between 1814 and 2004 was recorded. Butterflies and burnet moths were surveyed in 1904-1913 and 2001-2005.
   2. We explore if local extinctions were related to land-use changes and species attributes.
   3. Land use changed drastically over the 190-year period, and the largest relative change occurred for hay meadows with late harvest, which decreased from 28% to 0%. The area changed from grasslands and grazed forests to being dominated by timber forests. Previous open grazed mixed woodlands changed to spruce plantations with clear-cuts.
   4. Of the 48 resident butterfly and burnet moths found a century ago, 44% have become extinct. The extinct Aporia crat oe gi, Colias palaeno, and Leptidea sinapis were abundant 100 years ago and had their highest densities in flower-rich glades in forest, a habitat which no longer exists.
   5. The butterfly extinctions could be predicted from species-specific attributes as a short flight length period (P 0.02), narrow habitat breadth (P < 0.02), small distribution area in Europe (P = 0.033) and possibly larvae food plant nitrogen class (P < 0.06). In a multiple logistic regression, the flight length period was the only significant variable because the independent variables were intercorrelated.
   6. We conclude that the most important factor explaining the high extinction rate is that flower-rich habitats have disappeared from both woodlands as well as from open farmlands. The most sensitive species are specialised species with a short summer flight which have gone extinct. Only the most unspecialised species still persist in the current landscape.

AB Approaches for modelling the distribution of animals in relation to their environment can be divided into two basic types, those which use records of absence as well as records of presence and those which use only presence records. For terrestrial species, presence-absence approaches have been found to produce models with greater predictive ability than presence-only approaches. This study compared the predictive ability of both approaches for a marine animal, the harbour porpoise (Phoceoena phocoena). Using data on the occurrence of harbour porpoises in the Sea of Hebrides, Scotland, the predictive abilities of one presence-absence approach (generalised linear modelling-GLM) and three presence-only approaches (Principal component analysis-PCA, ecological niche factor analysis-ENFA and genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction-GARP) were compared. When the predictive ability of the models was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots, the presence-absence approach (GLM) was found to have the greatest predictive ability. However, all approaches were found to produce models that predicted occurrence significantly better than a random model and the GLM model did not perform significantly better than ENFA and GARP. The PCA had a significantly lower predictive ability than GLM but not the other approaches. In addition, all models predicted a similar spatial distribution. Therefore, while models constructed using presence-absence approaches are likely to provide the best understanding of species distribution within a surveyed area, presence-only models can perform almost as well. However, careful consideration of the potential limitations and biases in the data, especially with regards to representativeness, is needed if the results of presence-only models are to be used for conservation and/or management purposes.

AB We investigate the diversity of the North American tiger moth genus Grammia Rambur (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) by comparing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 'barcode' fragments of cytochrome oxidase I with non-molecular characters such as morphology, ecology, behaviour and distribution. Mitochondrial DNA genealogy is strikingly at odds with morpho-species taxonomy for most of the 28 sampled species, as haplotypic polyphyly not only is taxonomically widespread, but involves multiple shared haplotypes among two to four species. Morpho-ecological traits show that those species sharing haplotypes are often not closely related. Furthermore, high mtDNA divergences occur within species. Haplotypic variation is highly discordant with species taxonomy, but variation at a continental scale reveals significant geographic structuring of haplogroups, transcending morpho-species boundaries. A nested clade analysis and comparison of non-molecular with mtDNA data indicate that most discordance between mtDNA and taxonomy in Grammia is explained best by taxonomically and geographically widespread ongoing hybridization events resulting in mtDNA introgression. We hypothesize that broad areas of sympatry, interspecifically compatible genitalic structure, and species overlap in pheromone components facilitate hybridization, with disparate interspecies abundances promoting mitochondrial introgression. The molecular evolution of Grammia challenges the view that interspecific gene exchange occurs rarely and is restricted to recently diverged species. These results show the value of mtDNA in detecting cryptic hybridization, while highlighting the inherent dangers of drawing taxonomic conclusions based solely on mtDNA.

AB The reproductive compensation hypothesis says that individuals constrained by ecological or social forces to reproduce with partners they do not prefer compensate for likely offspring viability deficits. The reproductive compensation hypothesis assumes that (i) pathogens and parasites evolve more rapidly than their hosts, (ii) mate preferences predict variation in health and viability of offspring, (iii) social and ecological factors keep some individuals from mating with their preferred partners (some are constrained to mate with partners they do not prefer), (iv) all individuals may be induced to compensate, so that (v) variation in compensation is due to environmental and developmental factors affecting between-individual abilities to express compensatory mechanisms. Selection favouring compensation may act through variation in prezygotic physiological mechanisms, zygotic mechanisms, or parental care to eggs or young that enhance offspring health, increasing the likelihood that some offspring survive to reproductive age, often at a survival cost to the parents. Compensation may be through increased number of eggs laid or offspring born, a compensatory effort working during a single reproductive bout that sometimes will match the number of offspring surviving to reproductive age produced by unconstrained parents during the same bout. The reproductive compensation hypothesis therefore predicts trade-offs in components of fitness for breeders, such that parents constrained to mating with a nonpreferred partner, but who compensate sometimes match their current productivity (number of offspring at reproductive age) to unconstrained parents (those breeding with their preferred partners), and, when all else is equal, die faster than unconstrained parents. The reproductive compensation hypothesis emphasizes that reproductive competition is not just between constrained and unconstrained individuals, but also among constrained individuals who do and do not compensate. The reproductive compensation hypothesis may thus explain previously unexplained between-population and within-population, between-individual variation in reproductive success, survival, physiology and behaviour.

AB Interacting changes in predator and prey diversity likely influence ecosystem properties but have rarely been experimentally tested. We manipulated the species richness of herbivores and predators in an experimental benthic marine community and measured their effects on predator, herbivore and primary producer performance. Predator composition and richness strongly affected several community and population responses, mostly via sampling effects. However, some predators survived better in polycultures than in monocultures, suggesting complementarity due to stronger intra- than interspecific interactions. Predator effects also differed between additive and substitutive designs, emphasizing that the relationship between diversity and abundance in an assemblage can strongly influence whether and how diversity effects are realized. Changing herbivore richness and predator richness interacted to influence both total herbivore abundance and predatory crab growth, but these interactive diversity effects were weak. Overall, the presence and richness of predators dominated biotic effects on community and ecosystem properties.

AB 1. With biological invasions causing widespread problems in ecosystems, methods to curb the colonization success of invasive species are needed. The effective management of invasive species will require an integrated approach that restores community structure and ecosystem processes while controlling propagule pressure of non-native species.
   2. We tested the hypotheses that restoring native vegetation and minimizing propagule pressure of invasive species slows the establishment of an invader. In field and greenhouse experiments, we evaluated (i) the effects of a native submersed aquatic plant species, Vallisneria americana, on the colonization success of a non-native species, Hydrilla verticillata; and (ii) the effects of H. verticillata propagule density on its colonization success.
   3. Results from the greenhouse experiment showed that V. americana decreased H. verticillata colonization through nutrient draw-down in the water column of closed mesocosms, although data from the field experiment, located in a tidal freshwater region of Chesapeake Bay that is open to nutrient fluxes, suggested that V. americana did not negatively impact H. verticillata colonization. However, H. verticillata colonization was greater in a treatment of plastic V. americana look-alikes, suggesting that the canopy of V. americana can physically capture H. verticillata fragments. Thus pre-emption effects may be less clear in the field experiment because of complex interactions between competitive and facilitative effects in combination with continuous nutrient inputs from tides and rivers that do not allow nutrient draw-down to levels experienced in the greenhouse.
   4. Greenhouse and field tests differed in the timing, duration and density of propagule inputs. However, irrespective of these differences, propagule pressure of the invader affected colonization success except in situations when the native species could draw-down nutrients in closed greenhouse mesocosms. In that case, no propagules were able to colonize.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We have shown that reducing propagule pressure through targeted management should be considered to slow the spread of invasive species. This, in combination with restoration of native species, may be the best defence against non-native species invasion. Thus a combined strategy of targeted control and promotion of native plant growth is likely to be the most sustainable and cost-effective form of invasive species management.

AB Spermicide (i.e., female-mediated sperm death) is an understudied but potentially widespread phenomenon that has important ramifications for the study of sexual conflict, post-copulatory sexual selection, and fertility [1, 2]. Males are predicted to evolve adaptations against spermicide, but few antispermicidal mechanisms have been definitively identified. One such adaptation may be the enigmatic infertile sperm morphs or "parasperm" produced by many species, which have been hypothesized to protect their fertile brother "eusperm" from spermicide [2, 3]. Here, we show that female Drosophila pseudoobscura reproductive tracts are spermicidal and that the survival of eusperm after exposure to the female tract is highest when males produce many parasperm. This study clarifies the adaptive significance of infertile sperm castes, which has remained elusive in Drosophila and other taxa despite much recent interest [2-8]. We suggest that spermicide and male countermeasures against it are more common than is appreciated currently and discuss how spermicide could drive the evolution of several key male traits, including sperm size and number.

AB There is convincing evidence showing that resistance to invasion greatly varies among recipient assemblages. We assessed whether variation in the performance of the introduced macro-alga Caulerpa racemosa between algal turfs and surfaces dominated by encrusting corallines (barrens) arises from their physical or biological properties, by comparing the invasion success of this alga between natural assemblages and their mimics. Furthermore, to establish whether greater retention of sediments by algal turfs can favour C. racemosa, sediment deposition in barrens was raised to levels matching those recorded in turfs. The effects of herbivores on patterns of distribution of C. racemosa between habitats were evaluated by removing urchins from some experimental patches. The performance of C, racemosa was greater in turfs than in barrens, regardless of the type of substratum (natural or artificial), suggesting that positive effects of turfs on C. racemosa are physical (e.g. entrapment of fragments of the alga and/or enhancing the anchoring of stolons). Removing urchins or enhancing the deposition of sediments in barrens had no effect on C. racemosa, Our results show that the complexity of biogenic substrata is key to determining the spread of this invader and that facilitation of exotic species by natives could enhance ecosystem invasibility. This study has important implications for the management of C. racemosa, as turfs are progressively replacing canopy-forming species along urbanised coasts. Also, it suggests that current invasion theories based on the assumption that interactions between native and exotic Species are exclusively negative may be inadequate to predict future invasion scenarios.

AB The evolutionary relationships among members of the cetacean family Delphinidae, the dolphins, pilot whales and killer whales, are still not well understood. The genus Sotalia (coastal and riverine South American dolphins) is currently considered a member of the Stenoninae subfamily, along with the genera Steno (rough toothed dolphin) and Sousa (humpbacked dolphin). In recent years, a revision of this classification was proposed based on phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b, wherein Sousa was included in the Delphininae subfamily, keeping only Steno and Sotalia as members of the Stenoninae subfamily. Here we investigate the phylogenetic placement of Sotalia using two mitochondrial genes.. six autosomal introns and four Y chromosome introns, providing a total of 5,196 base pairs (bp) for each taxon in the combined dataset. Sequences from these genomic regions were obtained for 17 delphinid species, including at least one species from each of five or six currently recognized subfamilies plus five odontocete outgroup, species. Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of independent (each fragment) and combined datasets (mtDNA, nuDNA or mtDNA+nuDNA) showed that Sotalia and Sousa fall within a clade containing other members of Delphininae, exclusive of Steno. Sousa was resolved as the sister taxon to Sotalia according to analysis of the nuDNA dataset but not analysis of the mtDNA or combined mtDNA+nuDNA datasets. Based on the results from our multi-locus analysis, we offer several novel changes to the classification of Delphinidae, some of which are supported by previous morphological and molecular studies.

AB We use a two-species model of plant competition to explore the effect of intraspecific variation on community dynamics. The competitive ability ("performance") of each individual is assigned by an independent random draw from a species-specific probability distribution. If the density of individuals competing for open space is high (e.g., because fecundity is high), species with high maximum (or large variance in) performance are favored, while if density is low, species with high typical (e.g., mean) performance are favored. If there is an interspecific mean-variance performance trade-off, stable coexistence can occur across a limited range of intermediate densities, but the stabilizing effect of this trade-off appears to be weak. In the absence of this trade-off, one species is superior. In this case, intraspecific variation can blur interspecific differences (i.e., shift the dynamics toward what would be expected in the neutral case), but the strength of this effect diminishes as competitor density increases. If density is sufficiently high, the inferior species is driven to extinction just as rapidly as in the case where there is no overlap in performance between species. Intraspecific variation can facilitate coexistence, but this may be relatively unimportant in maintaining diversity in most real communities.

AB Collina di Brindisi is an Italian extra virgin olive oil that obtained the mark of protected designation of origin (PDO) according to EC Regulation 2081/92. The varietal requirements of the official production protocol of this oil foresee that this oil is prepared from cultivar Ogliarola (minimum 70%) and other Olea europaea L. cultivars that are diffused in the production area, accounting for a maximum of 30%. The aim of this work was to verify the effectiveness of microsatellite analysis in verifying the identity of Collina di Brindisi PDO olive oil. A preliminary assessment of product's quality by means of chemical analyses was also carried out. Microsatellite analysis clarified that the generic name Ogliarola, indicated in the technical sheet of this PDO oil, actually corresponded to the Ogliarola salentina cultivar. Furthermore, the obtained results showed that the examination of a limited number of DNA microsatellites enables the identification of the Ogliarola salentina cultivar in this PDO oil.

AB It is well known that the current genetic pattern of many European species has been highly influenced by climatic changes during the Pleistocene. While there are many well known vertebrate examples, knowledge about squamate reptiles is sparse. To obtain more data, a range-wide sampling of Lacerta viridis was conducted and phylogenetic relations within the L. viridis complex were analysed using an mtDNA fragment encompassing part of cytochrome b, the adjacent tRNA genes and the noncoding control region. Most genetic divergence was found in the south of the distribution range. The Carpathian Basin and the regions north of the Carpathians and Alps are inhabited by the same mitochondrial lineage, corresponding to Lacerta viridis viridis. Three distinct lineages occurred in the south-eastern Balkans - corresponding to L. v. viridis, L. v. meridionalis, L. v. guentherpetersi - as well as a fourth lineage for which no subspecies name is available. This distribution pattern suggests a rapid range expansion of L. v. viridis after the Holocene warming, leading to a colonization of the northern part of the species range. An unexpected finding was that a highly distinct genetic lineage occurs along the western Balkan coast. Phylogenetic analyses (Bayesian, maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony) suggested that this west Balkan lineage could represent the sister taxon of Lacerta bilineata. Due to the morphological similarity of taxa within the L. viridis complex this cryptic taxon was previously assigned to L. v. viridis. The distribution pattern of several parapatric, in part highly, distinct genetic lineages suggested the existence of several refuges in close proximity on the southern Balkans. Within L. bilineata sensu stricto a generally similar pattern emerged, with a high genetic diversity on the Apennine peninsula, arguing for two distinct refuges there, and a low genetic diversity in the northern part of the range. Close to the south-eastern Alps, three distinct lineages (L. b. bilineata, L. v. viridis, west Balkan taxon) occurred within close proximity. We suggest that the west Balkan lineage represents an early offshoot of L. bilineata that was isolated during a previous Pleistocene glacial from the more western L. bilineata populations, which survived in refuges on the Apennine peninsula.

AB Effects of elevated temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) on spring phenology of mature field-grown Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) trees were followed for three years. Twelve whole-tree chambers (WTC) were installed around individual trees and used to expose the trees to a predicted future climate. The predicted climate scenario for the site, in the year 2100, was 700 mu mol mol(-1) [CO2], and an air temperature 3 degrees C higher in summer and 5 degrees C higher in winter, compared with current conditions. Four WTC treatments were imposed using combinations of ambient and elevated [CO2] and temperature. Control trees outside the WTCs were also studied. Bud development and shoot extension were monitored from early spring until the termination of elongation growth. Elevated air temperature hastened both bud development and the initiation and termination of shoot growth by two to three weeks in each study year. Elevated [CO2] had no significant effect on bud development patterns or the length of the shoot growth period. There was a good correlation between temperature sum (day degrees >= 0 degrees C) and shoot elongation, but a precise timing of bud burst could not be derived by using an accumulation of temperature sums.

AB We used long-term data collected for up to 10 yr (1994-2004) Lit 23 trapping arrays (i.e., webs and grids) in Arizona, Colorado, Montana, and New Mexico to examine demographic factors known or suspected to be associated with risk of infection with Sin Nombre virus (SNV) in its natural host, the deer mouse (Peromyscus manicultus). Gender, age (mass), wounds or scars, season, and local relative population densities were statistically associated with the period prevalence of antibody (used as a marker of infection) to SNV in host populations. Nevertheless, antibody prevalence and some of the risk factors associated with antibody prevalence, such as relative population density, gender bias, and prevalence of wounding, varied significantly among sites and even between nearby trapping arrays at a single site. This suggests that local microsite-specific differences play an important role in determining relative risk of infection by SNV in rodents and, consequently, in humans. Deer mouse relative population density-varied among sites and was positively and statistically associated with infection prevalence, an association that researchers conducting shorter-term studies failed to demonstrate. Both wounding and antibody prevalence increased with mass class in both males and females; this increase was much more pronounced in males than in females and wounding was more frequent in adult males than in adult females. Prevalence of wounding was greatest among seropositive deer mice, regardless of mass class, but many deer mice without detectable wounds or scars eventually became infected. Many of these patterns, which will be useful in the development of predictive models of disease risk to humans, were only detected through the application of data collected over a long (10-yr) period and with abundant replication.

AB The distribution of Vitis vinifera subsp. silvestris, the wild grapevine subspecies of Vitis vinifera L., has been dramatically reduced in its major sites of diffusion, at first by the spread, over the last 150 years, of pathogens from North America and, more recently, with fragmentation of habitat and disbranching by humans. In this work, 418 wild grapevine samples, belonging to 78 populations, were collected in their main Mediterranean distribution areas, including the Caucasus area, and the extent of their genetic variability evaluated by analysing plastid microsatellite DNA polymorphism. Results show low haplotype diversity value, with five haplotypes detected within the analysed populations. The highest within-population haplotypic diversity, with the presence of all five detected haplotypes, was found in the Caucasus regions and in the central regions of Italy. The distribution of all detected haplotypes suggests the Caucasian region as the possible center of origin of Vitis vinifera subsp. silvestris. A principal plastid lineage was found to be fixed in several locations, in the Northernmost European countries and in the Southern island of Sardinia. These results draw attention to two different refugium sites in the Mediterranean basin and suggest that conservation priority should be given to grapevine populations still preserved in hotspots of these regions.

AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Endocrine parameters have proven useful in the detection of early or low-level responses to pollutants. Although most of the studies on endocrine modulation have been focused on processes involving gonadal steroids, contaminants may target other parts of the endocrine system as well. In this study we examined the adrenocortical stress response and thyroid hormone status in free-living nestling white storks (Ciconia ciconia) in relation to heavy metals (zinc, lead, copper, cadmium) and arsenic levels in blood.
   METHODS: Fieldwork was conducted in an area polluted by the Aznalcollar mine accident (southwestern Spain) and in a reference site. We used a standardized capture, handling, and restraint protocol to determine both baseline and maximum plasma corticosterone. Circulating levels of thyroxine (T-4) and triiodothyronine (T-3) were also measured.
   RESULTS: No effects of metals or As were found on baseline corticosterone, but maximum levels of corticosterone were positively related to Pb in both locations. This relationship was stronger in single nestlings than in birds from multiple-chick broods, which suggests a greater impact of Pb on more stressed individuals. Metal pollution did not affect plasma T-4 or T-3 levels, although thyroid status differed with location.
   CONCLUSIONS: Because a compromised hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function can have far-reaching consequences in terms of altered behavioral and metabolic processes necessary for survival, our results suggest that birds exposed to sublethal Pb levels may be at risk through an altered adrenocortical stress response, and further support the idea that HPA axis-related end points might be useful indicators of metal exposure and potential toxicity in wild animals.

AB The small variability of habitat generalist abundances in relation to landscape changes has been related to their behavioural flexibility. We hypothesise that successful generalists, such as the starling, compensate for feeding resource difficulties (poor quality of food, accessibility) in habitats such as urban ecosystems and that its behavioural flexibility allows for similar breeding performance in rural and urban areas. Along an urbanisation gradient we compared simultaneously (1) success factors such as the abundance of breeding starlings, their breeding performance and the fitness of nestlings, and (2) possible flexibility quantified through the rate of parental food-provisioning, and the composition and the amount of food delivered to nestlings. Abundance of breeding starlings are similar throughout the urbanisation gradient, but urbanisation profoundly and negatively affects reproductive parameters of starlings. Differences in the amount of food delivered to nestlings by parents (less food in town centre), and the small masses of nestlings reared in the urban sectors support the idea that urban nestlings received insufficient food loads. Despite modifications to their diurnal food-provisioning rhythm and the incorporation of some human food refuse into their diet, starling parents have a significantly reduced production of young in the urban centre sector. We rebut the idea that the "generalist" starling is able to breed successfully anywhere: other more "specialist" species succeed in producing their young by innovating more in terms of diet resources. We suggest defining successful birds with respect to colonisation or invasion process through behavioural innovation rather than an ambiguous habitat generalist definition.

AB Evidence supporting an association between phenotypic plasticity and invasiveness across a range of plant taxa is based primarily on comparisons between invasive species and native species whose potential invasiveness is typically unknown. Comparison of invasive and non-invasive exotic species would provide a better test of whether plasticity promotes invasion. Such comparisons should distinguish between adaptive and non-adaptive plasticity because they have different consequences for invasiveness. Adaptive plasticity is expected to promote the invasion of multiple habitats, but non-adaptive plasticity may reflect specialization for invading more favorable habitats only. We grew four invasive and four non-invasive species of the Commelinaceae with and without competitors and compared their putatively adaptive plasticity of three traits related to competitive ability and non-adaptive plasticity in performance. The invasive species grew significantly more than the non-invasive species only in the non-competitive environment. The invasive species had greater plasticity of performance (total biomass) in response to competition than non-invasives, but there was no consistent difference in the plasticities of the traits related to competitive ability. These results are consistent with specialization of these invasive taxa for invading the more productive non-competitive environment rather than a superior ability to invade both competitive and non-competitive environments. A comprehensive understanding of the relationship between plasticity and invasiveness will require many more comparisons of the plasticity of invasive and non-invasive taxa in a range of traits in response to a variety of environments.

AB Assembly rules provide a useful framework for predicting patterns of community assembly under defined environmental conditions. Habitat created by canopy-forming algae (such as kelps) provides a promising system for identifying assembly rules because canopies typically have a large and predictable influence on understorey communities. Across > 1,000 km of subtidal South Australian coastline, we identified natural associations between assemblages of understorey algae and (1) monospecific canopies of Ecklonia radiata, (2) canopies comprised of E. radiata mixed with Fucales (Cystophora spp. and Sargassum spp.), and (3) gaps among canopies of algae. We were able to recreate these associations with experimental tests that quantified the assembly of understorey algae among these three habitat types. We propose the assembly rule that understorey communities on subtidal rocky coast in South Australia will be (1) monopolised by encrusting coralline algae beneath monospecific canopies of E. radiata, (2) comprised of encrusting corallines, encrusting non-corallines, and sparse covers of articulated corallines, beneath mixed E. radiata-Fucales canopies, and (3) comprised of extensive covers of articulated corallines and filamentous turfs, as well as sparse covers of foliose algae and juvenile canopy-formers, within gaps. Consistencies between natural patterns and experimental effects demonstrate how algal canopies can act as a filter to limit the subsets of species from the locally available pool that are able to assemble beneath them. Moreover, the subsets of species that assemble to subtidal rocky substrata in South Australia appear to be predictable, given knowledge of the presence and composition of canopies incorporating E. radiata.

AB The effects of post-ingestion and physical conditions under which killed mosquitoes are stored on the success of detecting blood meal DNA of Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasiatus were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification at the human mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b (cytB) gene. I-lost DNA extracted from the blood meal Lip to 33 h post-ingestion in both species acts as,in efficient template for PCR amplification. However, more DNA concentration is needed for meals digested for a longer time, and successful PCR amplification from meals digested for 36h,dropped to a faint band. There were no differences between PCR Success rate for samples stored at +4 or -20 degrees C, but less Successful products were observed in samples kept at 4 degrees C for the periods longer than 30 h digestion. The results of this Study are important for conducting malaria epidemiological Studies that provide information about the degree of contact between human hosts and mosquito vectors, impact of vector controls such as bed nets and repellents, and the transmission dynamics of human malaria and other vector-borne diseases.

AB The Setesdal valley in South Norway runs north to south for 200 km, from alpine vegetation at 1200 m, passing the tree-line at around 1000 m, through Boreal forests, to Nemoral forest at sea level. The Holocene vegetation history and its altitudinal differentiation were reconstructed using pollen percentages and influx and plant macrofossil concentration records from four lakes along an altitudinal transect. During the early Holocene (c. 10500-8000 cal b.p.) Betula pubescens, Pinus sylvestris, Alnus, and Corylus expanded in the lowlands. Only Pinus and B. pubescens reached 1000 m asl (Lille Kjelavatn). Only B. pubescens reached Holebudalen (1144 m asl) at about the same time as it arrived in the lowlands. Between c. 8000-3000 cal b.p. mixed deciduous forest developed around Dalane (40 m asl) and to a lesser extent around Grostjorna (180 m asl), birch woodland with pine surrounded Lille Kjelavatn and birch woodland occurred at Holebudalen. From c. 3000 cal b.p. to present, the vegetation at Dalane hardly changed except for slight human impact and the immigration of Picea abies. At Grostjorna Pinus expanded. At Lille Kjelavatn Pinus disappeared and Betula became sparse as at the tree-line today. Betula retreated from Holebudalen thus leaving it above the tree-line in low-alpine vegetation. The strengths and weaknesses of pollen and plant macrofossil data were assessed for forest reconstructions. Where local pollen production is low, as near the tree-line, percentages of long-distance tree pollen can be misleadingly high. Pollen influxes of Betula and Pinus were much smaller near their altitudinal limits than at lower altitudes, although their macrofossils were equally abundant. The limited dispersal capacity of macrofossils documents the local presence of species and the character of the local vegetation, although macrofossils of some tree taxa are rarely found. Pollen and plant macrofossil evidence complement each other to provide a more complete reconstruction of Holocene tree-limits and tree-lines and hence climate changes, than either form of evidence alone.

AB The transfer of seed-containing hay is a restoration measure for the introduction of plant species of local provenance. We investigated the effect of hay transfer on species richness and on long-term establishment of target plant and grasshopper species on former arable fields with and without topsoil removal in comparison to reference sites in a nature reserve. Plant species richness, the number of target plant species, and Red List plant species were significantly positively affected by hay transfer, both on the scale of whole restoration fields and on permanent plots of 4 m(2). Eight years after the start of the restoration, only few of the transferred plant species had disappeared and some target species were newly found. Grasshoppers were affected not by hay transfer but by topsoil removal. The proportion of target grasshopper and plant species and Red List grasshopper species was higher on topsoil removal sites with low standing crop and high cover of bare soil than on sites without soil removal. On topsoil removal sites without hay, however, plant species richness was very low because of the slow natural dispersal of the target species. Vegetation and grasshopper communities still differed between restoration fields and the nature reserve. Nevertheless, our results indicate that the transfer of autochthonous seed-containing hay is a successful method to establish species-rich grasslands with a high proportion of target species.

AB Because of the spatiotemporal scales involved and the logistical constraints in collecting landscape-level data, spatially explicit simulation models have become important tools in ecological and biogeographical studies conducted over broad extents. Here we review the methods used and some of the applications of landscape-level models of succession and disturbance dynamics. Mechanistic and stochastic models are compared and contrasted and the development, over the last 15 years, of spatial landscape models of ecological change is discussed. Coarse-grained spatial landscape models are compared with finer-grained individual-based approaches (eg, forest gap models). Management and monitoring applications of landscape models are considered alongside a discussion of the appropriate use of models in this context. A key area where spatial landscape models of the type described here need to develop is improved integration with the social sciences - both in terms of the parameters and the processes that the models incorporate. Finally issues related to scale and scaling are outlined and, in particular, the utility of methods for linking ecological models operating at disparate scales ( eg, forest gap models versus landscape models) is examined.

AB Using sequences of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene (ND2, 1047 bp) and a segment of the non-coding mitochondrial control region, as well as nuclear sequences including two introns from the S7 ribosomal protein and the loci TmoM25, TmoM27, and UME002, we explore the phylogenetic relationships of Lepidiolamprologus, one of seven lamprologine cichlid genera in Lake Tanganyika, East Africa. Analyses consisted of direct optimization using POY, including a parsimony sensitivity analysis, and maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference for comparison. With respect to Lepidiolamprologus, the results based on the mitochondrial dataset were robust to parameter variation in POY. Lepidiolamprologus cunningtoni was resolved in a large clade sister to ossified group lamprologines, among which the remaining Lepidiolamprologus were nested. In addition-to L. attenuatus, L. elongatus, L. kendalli, and L. profundicola, Neolamprologus meeli, N. hecqui, N. boulengeri, N. variostigma, and two undescribed species were resolved in a two-pore Lepidiolamprologus clade sister to Lamprologus callipterus and two species of Altolamprologus. Lepidiolamprologus nkambae, in marked conflict with morphological and nuclear DNA evidence, nested outside of the two-pore Lepidiolamprologus clade, suggesting that the mtDNA signal has been convoluted by introgressive hybridization.

AB Land managers are concerned about the negative effects of alien annual plants on native plants, threatened and endangered species such as the desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), and ecosystem integrity in the Mojave Desert. Management of alien plants is hampered by a lack of information regarding the dominance and environmental correlates of these species. The results of this study indicate that alien plant species comprised a small fraction of the total annual plant flora, but most of the annual plant community biomass. When rainfall was high in 1995, aliens comprised 6% of the flora and 66% of the biomass. When rainfall was low in 1999, aliens comprised 27% of the flora and 91% of the biomass. Bromus rubens, Schismus spp. (S. arabicus and S. barbatus), and Erodium cicutarium were the predominant alien species during both years, comprising 99% of the alien biomass. B. rubens was more abundant in relatively mesic microhabitats beneath shrub canopies and at higher elevations above 800-1000m, whereas Schismus spp. and E cicutarium were more abundant in the relatively and interspaces between shrubs, and, for Schismus spp., at lower elevations as well. Disturbance variables were more reliable indicators of alien dominance than were productivity or native plant diversity variables, although relationships often varied between years of contrasting rainfall. The strongest environmental correlates occurred between dirt road density and alien species richness and biomass of E. cicutarium, and between frequency and size of fires and biomass of B. rubens.

AB It has been argued that niche pre-emption is not the only possible explanation for monophyly among Macaronesian endemic plants because (i) interspecific competition is diffuse, not species-specific, (ii) the radiations in question may not in fact be monophyletic, and (iii) later colonists may have hybridized with earlier ones, making a small and undetected contribution to the gene pool of lineages that appear to be monophyletic.
   The niche pre-emption mechanism does not, however, require species-specific competitive interactions. It merely proposes that the clade created by adaptive radiation will occupy more niche space than the original colonist could on its own. Members of the clade will then collectively inhibit establishment by new colonists more effectively than can a colonist that has not radiated.
   The monophyly of many larger radiations in the Macaronesian flora is well established and new studies tend to confirm this pattern.
   A few later-arriving colonists may have undetectably hybridized with earlier arrivals, but this is only a genetic interpretation of the essential idea behind pre-emption, i.e. that early arrivals so outnumber later colonists that the latter cannot establish.
   We do not therefore believe that hybridization provides an alternative explanation of why groups with multiple colonization failed to radiate in Macaronesia.

AB We examined the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizas ( AM), phosphorus fertilization, intraspecific density, and their interaction, on the growth, phosphorus uptake, and root morphology of three facultative mycotrophic crops ( Capsicum annuum, Zea mays, and Cucurbita pepo). Plants were grown in pots with or without AM at three densities and four phosphorus availabilities for 10 weeks. AM colonization, plant weight, and shoot phosphorus concentration were measured at harvest. Root morphology was assessed for C. annuum and Z. mays. Phosphorus fertilization reduced but did not eliminate AM colonization of all species. AM, phosphorus, and density interacted significantly to modify growth of C. annuum and C. pepo such that increased density and phosphorus diminished beneficial effects of AM. Increased density reduced positive effects of AM on C. annuum and C. pepo shoot phosphorus concentrations. AM altered both Z. mays and C. annuum root morphology in ways that complemented potential phosphorus uptake by mycorrhizas, but increased density and phosphorus diminished these effects. We infer that increased density predominantly influenced plant responses by affecting whether or not carbon ( photosynthate) or phosphorus limited plant growth. By exacerbating carbon limitation, high density reduced the benefit/ cost ratio of mycorrhizas and minimized their effects.

TI Constraint and competition in assemblages: A cross-continental and

AB The mechanisms leading to structure in local assemblages are controversial. On the one hand, assemblage structure is thought to be the outcome of local interactions determined by the properties of species and their responses to the local environment. Alternatively, this structure has been shown to be an emergent property of assemblages of identical individuals or of random sampling of a regional assemblage. In ants at baits, a combination of environmental stress and interspecific competition is widely held to lead to a unimodal relationship between the abundance of dominant ants and species richness. It is thought that in comparatively adverse environments, both abundance and richness are low. As habitats become more favorable, abundance increases until the abundance of dominant ants is so high that they exclude those that are subordinate and so depress richness. Here we demonstrate empirically that this relationship is remarkably similar across three continents. Using a null model approach, we then show that the ascending part of the relationship is largely constrained to take this form not simply as a consequence of stress but also as a result of the shape of abundance frequency distributions. While the form of the species-abundance frequency distribution can also produce the descending part of the relationship, interspecific competition might lead to it too. Scatter about the relationship, which is generally not discussed in the literature, may well be a consequence of resource availability and environmental patchiness. Our results draw attention to the significance of regional processes in structuring ant assemblages.

AB Sexual selection involves two main mechanisms: intrasexual competition for mates and intersexual mate choice. We experimentally separated intrasexual (male-male interference competition) and intersexual (female choice) components of sexual selection in a freshwater fish, the European bitterling (Rhodeus sericeus). We compared the roles of multiple morphological and behavioural traits in male success in both components of sexual competition, and their relation to male reproductive success, measured as paternity of offspring. Body size was important for both female choice and male-male competition, though females also preferred males that courted more vigorously. However, dominant males often monopolized females regardless of female preference. Subordinate males were not excluded from reproduction and sired some offspring, possibly through sneaked ejaculations. Male dominance and a greater intensity of carotenoid-based red colouration in their iris were the best predictors of male reproductive success. The extent of red iris colouration and parasite load did not have significant effects on female choice, male dominance or male reproductive success. No effect of parasite load on the expression of red eye colouration was detected, though this may have been due to low parasite prevalence in males overall. In conclusion, we showed that even though larger body size was favoured in both intersexual and intrasexual selection, male-male interference competition reduced opportunities for female choice. Females, despite being choosy, had limited control over the paternity of their offspring. Our study highlights the need for reliable measures of male reproductive success in studies of sexual selection.

AB Plethodon shermani comprises a series of geographically disjunct populations occupying high-elevation mountain isolates. These populations hybridize at their borders with salamanders of the Plethodon glutinosus species complex, and past range expansions inferred from Pleistocene climatic cycles may have increased the possible genetic interactions between P. shermani and species of the P. glutinosus complex. Because mitochondrial DNA haplotypes often show introgression across species borders, we survey mtDNA variation for evidence of past and ongoing genetic interactions between P. shermani, its close relative Plethodon cheoah, and species of the P. glutinosus complex. Ongoing hybridization with the P. glutinosus-complex species Plethodon teyahalee is accompanied by extensive mitochondrial introgression in some Unicoi populations of P. shermani, but it has little genetic impact on P. shermani populations outside hybrid zones at three other isolates (Tusquitee, Wayah Bald, Standing Indian). Some Unicoi populations of P. shermani exhibit mtDNA evidence of past hybridization with diverse lineages from P. aureolus and P. glutinosus. The Tusquitee isolate of P. shermani is also characterized by mtDNA haplotypes most closely related to Plethodon aureolus and P. glutinosus, presumably introduced by past genetic contact with these species or with introgressed populations of Unicoi P. shermani. The mtDNA variation in sampled populations of the Wayah Bald and Standing Indian isolates of P. shermani appears largely unaffected by ongoing hybridization. Principal components analyses of allozymic data indicate that P. shermani isolates collectively form a genetically homogeneous unit clearly demarcated from species with which they have had current or past genetic interactions. Rapid mtDNA introgression associated with transient contacts between P. shermani and other species permits a fine-level resolution of evolutionary lineages not evident from allozymic data.

AB 1. Roadless areas on United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service lands hold significant potential for the conservation of native biodiversity and ecosystem processes, primarily because of their size and location. We examined the potential increase in land-cover types, elevation representation and landscape connectivity that inventoried roadless areas would provide in a northern Rockies (USA) conservation reserve strategy, if these roadless areas received full protection.
   2 For the northern Rocky Mountain states of Montana, Wyoming and Idaho, USA, we obtained GIS data on land-cover types and a digital elevation model. We calculated the percentage of land-cover types and elevation ranges of current protected areas (wilderness, national parks and national wildlife refuges) and compared these with the percentages calculated for roadless and protected areas combined. Using five landscape metrics and corresponding statistics, we quantified how roadless areas, when assessed with current protected areas, affect three elements of landscape connectivity: area, isolation and aggregation.
   3. Roadless areas, when added to existing federal-protected areas in the northern Rockies, increase the representation of virtually all land-cover types, some by more than 100%, and increase the protection of relatively undisturbed lower elevation lands, which are exceedingly rare in the northern Rockies. In fact, roadless areas protect more rare and declining land-cover types, such as aspen, whitebark pine, sagebrush and grassland communities, than existing protected areas.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Landscape metric results for the three elements of landscape connectivity (area, isolation and aggregation) demonstrate how roadless areas adjacent to protected areas increase connectivity by creating larger and more cohesive protected area 'patches.' Roadless areas enhance overall landscape connectivity by reducing isolation among protected areas and creating a more dispersed conservation reserve network, important for maintaining wide-ranging species movements. We advocate that the USDA Forest Service should retain the Roadless Area Conservation Rule and manage roadless areas as an integral part of the conservation reserve network for the northern Rockies.

AB Parallel latitudinal clines to the long-standing ones in the original Palearctic populations have independently evolved at different rates for chromosomal polymorphism and body size in South and North American populations of Drosophila subobscura since colonization around 25 years ago. This strongly suggests that (micro) evolutionary changes are largely predictable, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. The putative role of temperature per se was investigated by using three sets of populations at each of three temperatures (13degrees, 18degrees, and 22degreesC) spanning much of the tolerable range for this species. We found a lower chromosomal diversity at the warmest temperature; a quick and consistent shift in gene arrangement frequencies in response to temperature; an evolutionary decrease in wing size, mediated by both cell area and cell number, at 18degreesC; no relationship between wing size and those inversions involved in latitudinal clines; and a shortening of the basal length of longitudinal vein IV relative to its total length with increasing standard dose. The trends for chromosomal polymorphism and body size were generally inconsistent from simple climatic-based explanations of worldwide latitudinal patterns. The findings are discussed in the light of available information on D. subobscura and results from earlier thermal selection experiments with various Drosophila species.

AB Little evidence of benefits from female mate choice has been found when males provide no parental care or resources. Yet, good genes models of sexual selection suggest that elaborated male sexual characters are reliable signals of mate quality and that the offspring of males with elaborate sexual ornaments will perform better than those of males with less elaborate ornaments. We used cod (Gadus morhua L.), an externally fertilizing species where males provide nothing but sperm, to examine the potential of optimal mate selection with respect to offspring survival. By applying in vitro fertilizations, we crossed eight females with nine males in all possible combinations and reared each of the 72 sib groups. We found that offspring survival was dependent on which female was mated with which male and that optimal mate selection has the potential to increase mean offspring survival from 31.9 to 55.6% (a 74% increase). However, the size of the male sexual ornaments and sperm quality (i.e. sperm velocity and sperm density) could not predict offspring survival. Thus, even if there may be large fitness benefits of mate selection, we might not yet have identified the male characteristics generating high offspring survival.

ID FIDELITY
AB Every proposed vegetation classification is sooner or later confronted with an accumulation of new data, which has to be assigned to existing vegetation units. Calculation of similarity indices between new releves (vegetation plots) and constancy columns of established vegetation units is a suitable method for computerised assignment of releves to these units. This paper compares several similarity indices using simulated data set where either randomly distributed or diagnostic species prevail in the species composition of the tested releve. Traditional indices, based only on species composition, produce different results than similarity indices that consider species fidelity. However, both types of indices failed in some situations and thus cannot be widely accepted as suitable methods of additional releve assignment. Therefore a combined Frequency-Positive Fidelity Index (FPFI) is proposed. This new index includes compositional similarity of an assigned releve with vegetation unit and retains the advantages and lacks the disadvantages of tested indices. The calculation of all these indices is available in the JUICE program (http://www.sci.muni.cz/botany/juice.htm).

AB Whether the Pleistocene has had a disproportionate impact on the recent diversification of temperate species, or played a lesser role in a more protracted process, has been a prominent evolutionary debate for the past decade. We used cytochrome b sequences to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of two widely co-distributed, and ecologically divergent frogs (Rana catesbeiana and Pseudacris crucifer) to examine the role of the Pleistocene in structuring these species. Results for R. catesbeiana reflect a pattern of allopatric fragmentation, likely in Coastal Plain refugia on either side of the Mississippi River dating to the mid to early Pleistocene. In contrast, P. crucifer contains numerous divergent lineages, including one west of the Mississippi River in the Interior Highlands, and in the east, multiple lineages that likely expanded from a number of southern Appalachian refugia with lineage sundering originating in the late Pliocene. Large-scale phylogeographic comparisons between these and other eastern North American species reflect both congruent and independent patterns of diversification, possibly reflecting the relative importance of dispersal ability and habitat associations. Although intra-lineage diversification has been structured by repeated Pleistocene glaciations, lineage sundering likely dates at least to the Pliocene in most (but not all) northern temperate amphibian and reptile species studied to date.

AB Empirical landscape habitat models are valuable tools for addressing species conservation issues in heterogeneous landscapes. These have been particularly useful for animal populations requiring extensive areas, like large mammalian carnivores. Although models are scale-dependent, they are often based exclusively on coarse-grained information on landscape structure and species distribution. However, accurate discrimination and quality assessment of breeding habitats may require more detailed information on both individuals' habitat use and landscape patterns.
   Here, we modeled breeding habitat for the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus), an endangered specialist of Mediterranean native ecosystems, in a human-dominated landscape. For this, we used radiotelemetry data on breeding individuals and fine-grained landscape variables obtained over an areal extent encompassing an entire lynx metapopulation. In addition, we restricted the study domain to areas of potential presence within this extent based on previous habitat analyses. This fine-scale landscape analysis and design aimed to test whether it was possible to obtain detailed inferences on breeding habitat distribution and quality within more coarsely defined habitats that only indicate where the species can be found. Landscape composition factors (i.e., fine-grain variables of landscape pattern within territories) and context factors (variables on geographical location of territories) were combined in different candidate habitat models. These reflected various hypotheses involving territory presence and size, including vegetation structure characteristics, landscape heterogeneity and complexity, favorable prey habitat, and human disturbance. The best approximating model for territory presence included only one landscape composition variable, namely, density of ecotones between scrubland and pastureland, which favored presence. For this model, classification accuracy was >80% in 94% of cross-validation tests performed. The best approximating model for territory size explained 65% of the variation in size and included also density of ecotones, plus mean coverage of tall shrubs within territories; both correlated negatively. with size. We show how these predictors are also related to prey density and, suggest that this low-hierarchical-level relationship between the prey and patterns of the landscape can be interpreted as a likely mechanism explaining breeding habitat distribution and quality at a higher level. Our approach shows the potential of finescale landscape analysis to understand patterns of breeder abundance, and to better manage population viability of threatened species in human-populated areas.

AB We examined the ability of three species of native North American freshwater mussels ( Margaritifera margaritifera, Amblema plicata, and Pyganodon cataracta) to preferentially ingest or reject various phytoplankton species and nonliving particles. Our objective was to: ( 1) determine the particle preferences of the native mussels, ( 2) determine whether native mussels are able to differentiate between nutritious and less nutritious particles, and ( 3) compare sorting abilities and particle preferences to those of the invasive zebra mussel ( Dreissena polymorpha). Native mussels selected and preferentially ingested the unicellular cyanobacteria Microcystis over most other phytoplankton species. However, despite their ability to select between phytoplankton, they did not select against cattail (Typha) detritus. Our results suggest that native mussels ( 1) prefer particles ( Microcystis) that may no longer be abundant in some systems, such as the Hudson River, ( 2) must compete with zebra mussels for the same preferred food types ( Microcystis), and ( 3) are unable to differentiate between nutritious ( phytoplankton) and less nutritious ( Typha detritus) particles. We suggest that native mussels must compete with zebra mussels for many of the same food types and are less efficient than zebra mussels at differentiating between nutritious and less nutritious particles. This indicates that there is an additional mechanism, other than direct physical interference, contributing to native mussel mortalities following zebra mussel invasions.

AB The number of eggs fertilized by a male at any given copulation (fertilization success) is affected by a large number of factors. Male insemination and sperm competition success and various female structures and/or processes that bias paternity in favor of some males over others (cryptic female choice) are all likely to affect fertilization success. We suggest that more comprehensive measures of male fertilization success can increase our understanding of postcopulatory sexual selection. To improve our understanding of the importance of various sources of variance in male fertilization success, we conducted a series of experiments using flour beetles. Different wild-type strains were used in reciprocal double mating experiments, against a phenotypic marker strain. We assessed the relative effects of female genotype, male genotype and mating order on independent and inclusive measures of male defense ability (P-1), male offense ability (P-2) and female remating behavior. Female genotype influenced both P-1 and P-2, and male genotype interacted strongly with female genotype in its effect on P-2. We also documented an interaction between female and male genotypes in the effects of mating on female remating behavior, such that females tended to remate most rapidly when mated to males of their own genotype. It is clear from our experiments that cryptic female choice influences the pattern of fertilization success in flour beetles, and we suggest that cryptic female choice may often be an important component of postcopulatory sexual selection. Future investigations would benefit from studying the multiple components of variance in male fertilization success.

AB We determined the effect of distance from ecological edges, both wooded and water edges, on nest predation for 862 painted turtle, Chrysemys picta, nests from 1995 to 1999 at an similar to 1.5 ha study site. In three of live years and overall, nests closer to the water edge had a higher probability of predation; and in one year nests closer to the wooded edge had a higher probability of predation. Although more turtles nested closer to the water edge as the nesting season progressed in some years and overall, this behavior does not explain the observed patterns of nest predation. We present a novel application of the cubic spline analysis to address the dynamics of predation across continuous distances from an edge and identify threshold values where the predation rate levels off. Threshold values of similar to 25-40 m were detected in 1925 1998, and with all five years combined. However, even though a significant edge effect was detected in 1997, a threshold was not clear. While an edge effect on predation was not detected in each year, this study provides evidence for a strong effect of distance from the water edge on nest predation over significant ecological time. Focusing on turtle nest predation and smaller spatial scales addresses previous taxonomic and spatial bias in edge effects research, and provides further support for the ecological importance of edge effects.

AB To determine the role of leaf mechanical properties in altering foliar inclination angles, and the nutrient and carbon costs of specific foliar angle variation patterns along the canopy, leaf structural and biomechanical characteristics, biomass partitioning into support, and foliar nitrogen and carbon concentrations were studied in the temperate deciduous species Liriodendron tulipifera L., which possesses large leaves on long petioles. We used beam theory to model leaf lamina as a uniform load, and estimated both the lamina and petiole flexural stiffness, which characterizes the resistance to bending of foliar elements at a common load and length. Petiole and lamina vertical inclination angles with respect to horizontal increased with increasing average daily integrated photon flux density (Q(int)). Yet, the light effects on lamina inclination angle were primary determined by the petiole inclination angle. Although the petioles and laminas became longer, and the lamina loads increased with increasing Q(int), the flexural stiffness of both lamina and petiole increased to compensate for this, such that the lamina vertical displacement was only weakly related to Q(int). In addition, increases and decreases in the petiole inclination angle with respect to the horizontal effectively reduced the distance of lamina load from the axis of rotation, thereby reducing the bending moments and lamina inclination due to gravity. We demonstrate that large investments, up to 30% of total leaf biomass, in petiole and large veins are necessary to maintain the lamina at a specific position, but also that light has no direct effect on the fractional biomass investment in support. However, we provide evidence that apart from light availability, structural and chemical characteristics of the foliage may also be affected by water stress, magnitude of which scales positively with Q(int).

AB Habitat selection by birds is a complex phenomenon that varies by species and community. Some birds select habitat according to specific combinations of microhabitat characteristics, which pertain to the structure and composition of site-specific vegetation. Recently, however, habitat selection studies have shifted from site-specific characteristics to consideration of coarser environmental scales. We examined habitat relationships for 31 bird species in the White Mountain National Forest at a series of scales from microhabitat (fine scale) to the landscape (coarse scale). Relative abundance data were collected through 10 min. point counts at 360 points organized into 15 transects. Habitats sampled included a diversity of forest-cover types (deciduous to coniferous) and management strategies (wilderness to clearcuts). Species-specific logistic regression models based on subsets (183 and 48 points) of the original dataset corroborated the historical focus on microhabitat, but models including other scales indicated that some birds respond to coarser scale environmental characteristics. These results also supported the premise that some birds respond to multiple environmental scales. Community gradient descriptions, based on canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), supported results of logistic regression, indicating that microhabitat constituted the most important level followed by lesser, but significant, contributions from other scales. Through species-environment biplots, CCA also effectively illustrated avian habitat selection as a multiple-scale phenomenon, showing the hierarchical organization of landscape components and how they affect the spatial distribution of bird communities.

AB We studied the natural regeneration of an ombrotrophic peatland (Cacouna bog) located in southern Quebec that was disturbed by peat mining and other anthropogenic activities over a 200-year period. Using an extensive collection of historical documents, as well as dendrochronological data, we reconstructed the history of the peatland. We also sampled vegetation and environmental variables, and integrated the data in a geographic information system. More than 60% of the total area of the bog was mined between 1942 and 1975, and 98 km of ditches were dug to drain the site. The peatland lost 34% of its initial peat volume between 1946 and 1998. Although the bog was severely disturbed, the spontaneous revegetation of the site by vascular plants was successful (90%-100% cover). However, only 10% of the total mined area has been recolonized by Sphagnum species, mainly because drainage ditches are still operational and contribute to drying out the bog. Water table level, peat deposit thickness, and pH are abiotic factors strongly influencing the vegetation composition in the bog. Spatial and historical factors are also important components in this study since they explain, either alone or in interaction with abiotic factors, 44% of the variation of the species data. The intensity of mining activities and the pattern of abandonment of mined sectors strongly influenced abiotic factors, which in turn affected the revegetation process. Even if the Sphagnum cover of the bog is low, the rapid "recovery" of the vegetation cover in the peatland indicates that after the reestablishment of an appropriate hydrological regime, a highly disturbed peatland has a considerable potential for regeneration.

AB Some migratory birds refuel at stopover sites that they by-pass on the return trip. In theory, this skipping behaviour is only expected in time-selected migrants when the overflown site is of a lower quality than the departure site. We provide empirical evidence that quality differences in stopover sites are the cause for skipping in Bewick's Swans Cygnus bewickii tracked by satellite telemetry. Two and five complete tracks were recorded in spring and autumn, respectively, showing that the White Sea was visited for c. 2 weeks in spring, but by-passed (or visited for a few days at the most) in autumn. Skipping of the White Sea in autumn was predicted by a dynamic programming model which was based on calculated gain rates during stopover in the Pechora Delta and the White Sea. This prediction was not sensitive to plausible variations in gain rates. Relative to the Pechora Delta the White Sea is a poor site because a large tidal amplitude precludes foraging on the beds of the submerged macrophyte Fennel Pondweed Potamogeton pectinatus during high tide. The dynamic programming model predicted a fast autumn migration. However, the phenology of autumn arrival dates of Bewick's Swans on the wintering grounds revealed that only in three out of ten years a significant number of birds was able to reach the wintering grounds without refuelling. In the other years, unfavourable wind conditions along the Russian/Baltic part of the route prevented such non-stop migration.

AB The age and size of trees was sampled and measured on eight sample plots (0.2 ha each) within a Pinus sylvestris -dominated boreal forest landscape in Vienansalo wilderness, Russian Karelia. The fire history of these plots was obtained from a previous dendrochronological study. All the studied sample plots showed a wide and uneven distribution of tree ages, but the shape of the age distributions of trees as well as tree species composition varied substantially. Trees over 250 years of age occurred in every studied plot, despite its small size. This suggests that old Pinus were common and rather evenly distributed in the landscape matrix. The oldest Pinus tree was 525 years of age. The correlations between tree age and size were often weak or even nil. In Pinus the correlation between age and diameter was stronger than that between age and height. In the dominant tree species Pinus and Picea, the largest trees were not the oldest trees. The tree age distributions together with the fire history data indicated that the past fires have not been stand replacing, as many of the older Pinus had survived even several fires. Tree age classes that had regenerated after the last fire were most abundant and dominated by Picea and/or deciduous trees, while the trees established before the last fire were almost exclusively Pinus. The results suggest that periodic occurrence of fire is important for the maintenance of the Pinus-dominated landscape. This is because fire kills most Picea and deciduous trees and at the same time enhances conditions for Pinus regeneration, facilitated by available seed from the continuous presence of old fire-tolerant Pinus trees.

AB Although relationships of birds to patch a-rea and habitat characteristics have been dominant themes in avian ecology over the past few decades, relatively little is known about these relationships in wetland-dominated landscapes of the Great Lakes coastline. During 1997 and 1998, we surveyed birds and measured habitat characteristics along transects in wet meadows associated with the northern Lake Huron shoreline (NLHS) in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Using a suite of multivariate techniques, we related abundance and presence/absence of individual species to wet meadow area and habitat characteristics. Nine species were positively associated with increasing wet meadow area, which underscores the importance of large wetlands to avian conservation in the region. Bird variables also were related to habitat characteristics. Higher values of bird variables were generally associated with a suite of characteristics: more robust and dense grass/sedge vegetation, structural diversity in the horizontal and vertical planes, and increased frequency of willow shrubs. Individual species that require particular aspects of these characteristics for nesting or foraging were associated with principal components containing those aspects. In the NLHS, large wet meadows that possess these characteristics would support the greatest diversity and benefit the majority of species. However, conservation efforts that focus only on these traits will not be sufficient for all species because habitat requirements for some species are very specific (e.g., open water for mallard), and for others, habitat preferences may change from year to year in response to lake-level changes. While our results provide important insights, continued research is needed to further the successful conservation and management of birds in Great Lakes coastal wetlands.

AB This study investigates hybridization and population genetics of two species of macaque monkey in Sulawesi, Indonesia, using molecular markers from mitochondrial, autosomal, and Y-chromosome DNA. Hybridization is the interbreeding of individuals from different parental taxa that are distinguishable by one or more heritable characteristics. Because hybridization can affect population structure of the parental taxa, it is an important consideration for conservation management. On the Indonesian island of Sulawesi an explosive diversification of macaques has occurred: seven of 19 species in the genus Macaca live on this island. The contact zone of the subjects of this study, M. maura and M. tonkeana, is located at the base of the southwestern peninsula of Sulawesi. Land conversion in Sulawesi is occurring at an alarming pace; currently two species of Sulawesi macaque, one of which is M. maura, are classified as endangered species. Results of this study indicate that hybridization among M. maura and M. tonkeana has led to different distributions of molecular variation in mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA in the contact zone; mitochondrial DNA shows a sharp transition from M. maura to M. tonkeana haplotypes, but nuclear DNA from the parental taxa is homogenized in a narrow hybrid zone. Similarly, within M. maura divergent mitochondrial DNA haplotypes are geographically structured but population subdivision in the nuclear genome is low or absent. In M. tonkeana, mitochondrial DNA haplotypes are geographically structured and a high level of nuclear DNA population subdivision is present in this species. These results are largely consistent with a macaque behavioral paradigm of female philopatry and obligate mate dispersal, suggest that introgression between M. maura and M. tonkeana is restricted to the hybrid zone. and delineate one conservation management unit in M. maura and at least two in M. tonkeana.

AB 1 The effects of habitat degradation on the soil seed bank at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba are described. Foraging by lesser snow geese leads to loss of vegetation, coupled with changes in soil abiotic conditions and an increase in salinity.
   2 The density of seeds and the relative abundance in the seed bank of species characteristic of undisturbed sites decrease following degradation, while the relative abundance of invasive species increases. Vegetation loss had the greatest impact on seed banks of stress-tolerant species and the least impact on species with many widely dispersed seeds.
   3 The above-ground vegetation and below-ground seed bank were less similar in undamaged plots than in disturbed plots. In spite of the low degree of similarity, redundancy analysis of the data indicated that approximately half of the variation in the soil seed bank could be explained by the vegetation data and vice versa.
   4 More recently degraded soils had richer soil seed banks than those from older disturbances. Site-specific factors not only influenced the species present but also the time lag between loss of vegetation and loss of the seed bank. Seed banks in these impacted and fragmented sites do not recover quickly.
   5 Seed banks in sandy beach-ridges were less affected by degradation due to the greater proportion of ruderals present in the original vegetation and the absence of the high soil salinities that are characteristic of degraded salt-marsh soils.

AB Patterns in the relationships among the range, abundance, and distribution of species within a biome are of fundamental interest in ecology. A self-similarity condition, imposed at the community level and previously demonstrated to lead to the power-law form of the species-area relationship, is extended to the species level and shown to predict testable power-law relationships between range size and both species abundance and area of census cell across scales of spatial resolution. The predicted slopes of plots of log (range size) versus log (abundance) are shown to be in good agreement with data from British breeding bird and mammal censuses and with data on the distribution of fern species in old-growth forest. The predicted slopes of plots of log (range size) versus log (area of census cell) are consistent with the limited available data for British plant species. Self-similarity provides a testable theoretical framework for a unified understanding of patterns among the range, abundance, and distribution of species.

AB Four variable microsatellite loci were used to examine the genetic diversity and differentiation of golden lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia) in four populations recently isolated by habitat fragmentation. Using Rst estimates of genetic differentiation, a considerable genetic divergence was detected among these populations, with an average differentiation of 31%. Significant differences in allele number among these populations were found. However, the heterozygosity among these populations was not statistically different. These results suggest that loss in allele diversity was faster than loss in heterozygosity. Conservation implications, particularly for golden lion tamarins, are then discussed. Loss of allelic diversity might be as serious a concern to endangered species as heterozygosity or inbreeding.

AB The amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorbed by a canopy (APAR) is an important driving variable for vegetation processes such as photosynthesis. PAR extinction in clumped canopies of shortgrass ecosystems is the focus of this paper. Directional gap fractions estimated at peak biomass on several Mexican shortgrass ecosystems with a hemispherical radiation sensor (Li-Cor, LAI-2000) were higher than those predicted by a Poisson model assuming a random leaf dispersion (RLD), LAI-2000-estimated gap fractions, together with independent estimations of plant area index (PAI), and leaf and stem angle distribution (LSAD) were used for estimating the angular course of a leaf dispersion parameter lambda(theta). Radiation extinction coefficients simulated for all solar zenith angles using Markov chain processes and estimated lambda(theta) were subsequently incorporated in a simple radiative transfer model for estimating the efficiencies of instantaneous and daily integrated PAR interception and absorption, and for studying the effects of clumping, sky conditions and soil albedo on PAR absorption. For clear sky condition, instantaneous PAR absorption showed marked directional effects, therefore indicating that using a constant extinction coefficient in canopy photosynthesis models working at hourly time step would be inaccurate. The effects of clumping, sky conditions and soil albedo were all found to be significant for low PAI, and decreased with higher PAI. As shortgrass ecosystems are characterized by low PAI, neglecting these effects would give inaccurate estimations of PAR absorption. Daily PAR absorption was found to be significantly higher than PAR interception for low PAI, especially when soil albedo was high, and lower than PAR interception for high PAI. These results indicate that in canopy photosynthesis models where APAR is estimated from simple exponential-like relationships calibrated using PAR interception measurements, the PAR available for photosynthesis might be significantly underestimated in the first stages of the growth, and may be overestimated in the later stages of the growing season.

AB This paper presents results from studies in 4 mountain regions in East Africa, 2 in Ethiopia (Simen Mountains, Bale Mountains), and 2 in Uganda (Rwenzori Mountains, Mount Elgon). The focus is on the ericaceous vegetation that forms the (upper) treeline ecotone at all sites. There is little evidence for climatic control of the patchy appearance of this belt in all afroalpine environments. Since traces of former fires were observed in all ranges, repeated burning is most probably responsible for the present appearance of the ericaceous vegetation in East Africa. The fires observed were almost exclusively lit by local people, who utilize the afroalpine zone for poaching, livestock grazing, and honey hunting. Although these fires are man-made and not strictly natural, they help to maintain a structurally and biologically diverse environment.

AB A cyclic behaviour in the intensity of maritime conditions which varies with the periodic behaviour of the North Atlantic oscillation has recently became apparent in the climatic record of northern Europe. Periodic increases in oceanicity are usually viewed as having a positive effect on plant survival, as milder winters, reduction of temperature extremes, low risk of exposure to frost, and freedom from drought reduce many aspects of environmental stress. However, warmer winters in maritime environments may also have a powerful influence in creating habitats that are unfavourable for many species. The dangers of long periods of soil saturation for overwintering plants, soaking injury to germinating seeds, premature bud burst in spring, depression of treelines by increased cloud cover and high lapse rates, as well as the constant leaching of soils, are all negative aspects of the maritime environment. Woody species in which root dormancy is delayed by mild winters are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of winter flooding. Subsequent re-exposure to oxygen as water tables fall in spring can aggravate flooding damage through post-anoxic injury, leading to severe dieback of anchoring roots. Soil leaching, particularly after human disturbance, can induce nutrient deficiencies and the establishment of oligotrophic communities with reduced productivity. Podzolization and iron pan formation have in the past facilitated the processes of paludification in oceanic regions. The resulting spread of bogs and acid moorlands can further reduce the potential for productivity in both agriculture and natural plant communities. Given the probability that current climatic trends may increase the degree of oceanicity in western and northern regions of Europe, the potentially negative consequences of such a climatic change need to be considered in relation to future ecological changes and their consequences for conservation and land use.

AB The main objective of this study was to quantify the relationship between taxonomic and functional parameters of macroinvertebrate assemblages and reach/landscape attributes of agricultural catchment. We aimed to analyse the relation between landscape patchiness and land-water ecotone structure, and their influence on benthic fauna composition, biomass and functional organization. A variety of catchment characteristics: land use patterns, surface geology (e.g. type of soils), elevation, hydrology database were incorporated into a geographical information system (GIS) to evaluate anthropogenic impact on landscape properties. The scenarios of potential transfer of nitrogen load along the gradient of the river valley were elaborated. The assessment of nutrient export focused on identifying the most effective nutrient barriers across spatial scales. The analysis of landscape and reach units demonstrated significant, negative correlations between the rate of nutrient transfer to surface/groundwaters and (i) the length of riparian ecotones, (ii) river width, and (iii) the areas of wetland and forested patches in the catchment. The trophic base (primary producers; CPOM; FPOM) in the stream channel was analysed as a factor modifying the structural and functional organization of macrobenthos. Canopy cover, and the consequent amount of solar input reaching the stream bed, significantly influenced food-related variables: leaf input and algal biomass. The factor that significantly affected food availability, retention and transport of benthic particulate organic matter (BPOM) and amount of chlorophyll a was stream discharge. Higher discharge contributed to low retention of BPOM. To obtain more information about environmental variability (56 variables) and macroinvertebrate functional organization, the entire data matrix was analysed using Principal Component Analysis. A significant correlation was shown in the case of shredder abundance (i) in the low-order station S1, (ii) high canopy cover complexity, and (iii) retention of benthic organic matter. Filtering collectors were significantly associated with the presence of suspended organic matter. Other faunal assemblages, highly related to stream hydraulics factors, were alternative gathering collectors/scrapers, much retained at fourth-order station S3. Stream discharge, depth and chlorophyll a significantly affected the presence of these organisms. This indicated the crucial role of habitat heterogeneity, which was attributable to local conditions (detrital inputs, hydraulics, morphological characteristics), and significantly influenced the trophic structure of biocommunities. In the regulated section of the river (S2) without overhanging vegetation, the abundance of scrapers was significantly correlated with open canopy. Domestic and agricultural impact, evidenced by high nutrient concentrations, significantly reduced species richness (stations S4/S4a). Macroinvertebrate communities were used to detect environmental stress in the river system. Assessment of water quality with biological indices directly revealed human-induced alterations (e.g. land use, lack of riparian vegetation, channelization).

AB Spatial and temporal abundance patterns of anopheline larvae and their relationships with wetland conditions were studied in an endemic malaria area in northeastern Venezuela, where Anopheles aquasalis Curry is the main vector. Larvae were sampled over a 2-yr period in 7 wetland types (brackish and freshwater herbaceous swamps, mangrove swamps, freshwater ponds, clear-cut marsh forests, small irrigation canals, and swamp forests), covering 3 environmental gradients (salinity, aquatic vegetation, and habitat permanence). Twelve variables were quantified to describe each habitat. Two species of anophelines were collected. An. aquasalis was the species with the widest distribution, and its highest abundance was in the seasonal brackish mangrove habitat during the rainy season. An. oswaldoi Peryassu was rarely encountered but was mainly associated with the dry season and with the permanent freshwater wetlands (such as ponds). Principal components and correlation analyses revealed that the physicochemical (salinity, disserved oxygen) variables of the wetland were associated most strongly with the spatial distribution of both species. Variations in salinity were strongly associated with the abundance of An. aquasalis. Both the occurrence and abundance of An. oswaldoi were most closely correlated with disserved oxygen. Changes in seasonal abundance of both species were associated with rainfall. The relevance of these results to vector control in northern Venezuela is discussed.

AB The parasitoid assemblages associated with grass-feeding chalcid wasps in Great Britain were used to examine the relationships between diversity (species richness), community function (total parasitism rate) and stability (variability in parasitism rate over time). Species-rich communities did not generate higher parasitism rates than species-poor communities, nor was temporal variation of parasitism rates related to parasitoid community richness. The mechanisms underlying hypotheses linking species richness and community function and stability are discussed in the light of these results. Because all parasitoid species represent a single functional group, a lack of complementarity in the ways they use their resources may explain why diversity is not linked to function or community stability. A second likely reason is that these parasitoid communities are under bottom-up control, thus exerting little or no influence on total system function and variability. This is likely to be common in parasitoid communities.

AB Quartz fields are edaphically arid, azonal habitats occurring under different macroclimatic conditions in several arid regions of southern Africa. They are the exclusive home of 142 plant species of which ca. 70% are local or regional endemics. This paper is an analysis of the quartz-field floras and growth form-soil relationships in two quartz field regions: the Knersvlakte in the Namaqualand-Namib Domain of the Succulent Karoo, and the western Little Karoo in the Southern Karoo Domain. The Knersvlakte supported 52 quartz-field specialists of which 39 were endemic to the region. Corresponding data for the Little Karoo were 11, and 10 species, respectively. In both regions, the average canopy cover on the quartz-field releves was ca. 8%, and more than half of this comprised contracted, succulent nanochamaephytes. Cover and vegetation stature were markedly higher on adjacent zonal habitats. Quartz fields in both regions supported a similar array of compact, subglobose and subterranean nanochamaephytes, as evidenced by convergent patterns in two distantly related genera (Argyroderma N. E. Brown and Gibbaeum (Haworth) N. E. Brown, both Mesembryanthemaceae), endemic to the Knersvlakte and largely restricted to the Little Karoo, respectively. Analyses of vegetational and edaphic data of quartz fields and adjacent, zonal habitats were carried out using multivariate direct gradient analysis (Canonical Correspondence Analysis) in order to identify those factors that control the peculiar composition of growth forms on quartz fields. The results revealed highly similar patterns of growth form composition in relation to similar edaphic gradients in both regions. In general, the soils of quartz fields were shallower compared to those of adjacent zonal habitats. In both regions, two different groups of quartz-field edaphic habitats, representing extremes of a continuum, were identified. Group 1 was characterized by high salt content, neutral to slightly acid soil pH, and low stone content. Group 2 was characterized by low salt content, low soil pH, and high stone content. Group 1 quartz fields are the most edaphically arid habitats and support the highest relative cover and diversity of subglobose and subterranean chamaephytes. The combination of reduced competition from larger growth forms, shallow soils and high soil salinity, represents a regionally unusual selective regime. Some succulent lineages in the Mesembryanthemaceae have undergone diversification which has resulted in the fine-scale discrimination of subtle edaphic gradients within the saline quartz-patch habitats. Reliable seasonal rainfall and reduced thermal stress have also played a role in the evolution of quartz patch specialists.

AB Phytoplankton production was measured at the shelf edge region of the Celtic Sea in April/May 1994 at the beginning of the spring bloom. Size fractionated C-14 uptake experiments showed that phytoplankton >2 mu m dominated the bloom although, in the period immediately before the increase in phytoplankton biomass, picophytoplankton(< 2 mu m) was responsible for up to 42% of the production; in these late winter conditions, chlorophyll concentrations were generally < 0.7 mu g l(-1) and primary production was ca. 70 mmol C m(-2) d(-1). As the spring bloom developed, phytoplankton production rates of 120 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) were measured. Chlorophyll concentration increased to >2 mu g l(-1) as a result of growth of larger phytoplankton, including diatoms, with large numbers of Nitzschia, Thalassionema and Chaetoceros dominating the assemblage. Picophytoplankton production declined as the spring bloom progressed. Nutrient concentrations were not depleted during the sampling period, and NO3- concentrations were > 6 mu mol l(-1). Nutrient assimilation rates were measured at the same time as primary production was estimated. Before the development of any substantial phytoplankton biomass, the uptake rates for ammonium and nitrate were very similar, with S-ratios ranging from 0.5 to 0.6. Assimilation of ammonium remained relatively constant after the onset of stratification and bloom development, but nitrate uptake increased by a factor of 2 or more, resulting in f-ratios >0.8. There was significant phosphate uptake in the dark, which was generally ca. 50% of the rate in the light. The C:N:P assimilation ratios changed as the bloom developed; in the pre-bloom situation, when small phytoplankton cells dominated the assemblage, the C:N assimilation ratio was variable, with some stations having ratios less than (ca 2.5), and some higher than (ca. 9), the Redfield ratio. The most actively growing assemblages had N:P ratios close to the Redfield ratio, but the C:N ratios were consistently lower. New production was found to be closely correlated with the size of the species making up the phytoplankton assemblage, and high f ratios were measured when larger phytoplankton dominated the assemblage.

AB Patterns in the assemblage structure of littoral fishes occupying the gradient between riverine and estuarine ecosystems were revealed through multivariate analysis of 5 annual summer seine surveys in 4 tributary systems of the lower Chesapeake Bay. Catch per unit effort of fishes was quantified and environmental variables measured to characterize assemblage structure and population responses along large-scale (km) environmental gradients. Results of two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA) suggested the presence of 4 intergrading assemblages of littoral beach fishes: permanent tidal freshwater, lower tidal freshwater, oligohaline estuary and mesohaline estuary. Littoral fish assemblages were ordered along a large-scale spatial gradient between tidal freshwater and mesohaline river reaches during summer, when relatively stable hydrological conditions create a well-defined salinity gradient. Large-scale distribution of these fishes along the liver axis corresponded with salinity (and its correlates) up to the interface, and with structural attributes of the habitat (nearshore sediment grain size, presence of submerged aquatic vegetation, woody debris) in the permanent tidal freshwater river reaches. The permanent tidal freshwater reaches were more riverine in character, and were typified by speciose and relatively stable assemblages dominated by resident secondary division freshwater fishes and the juveniles of several diadromous species. Although the resident fauna is certainly derivative of more upland, non-tidal streams. patterns of association suggest distinct ecological relationships may exist for species co-occurring in tidal freshwater habitats.

AB Most of the available support for the hypothesis that pollutants' effects depend on size comes from shortterm experiments. We appried a size-based approach to the analysis of the fossil remains of Lago d'Orta in Northern Italy, a lake that has been polluted with copper, other metals, and acid for more than 50 yr. Once this pollution began, the size distribution of diatoms, thecamoebians, and cladocerans shifted to smaller individuals. These changes in size reflected shifts in the taxonomic composition of the assemblages, but we also observed reduction of body size within a single taxon (the diatom Achnanthes minutissima). These reductions in the average size across three communities from different kingdoms and trophic levels provide strong evidence that chronically stressed environments select for smaller organisms.

AB This study investigates the effect of increasing sampling resolution on our ability to detect the effects of large-scale processes on marine benthic communities. The sampling resolutions used are common to many marine benthic studies (i.e., in order of increasing resolution: video transects; grab sampling; small-core sampling). We investigate whether: (1) loss of information about the finer scale inhibits our ability to detect relationships between large-scale (e.g., environmental) processes and communities at coarser resolutions; or (2) information collected at the finer scale is noisy and obscures detection of large-scale relationships; or (3) the same information is available from ail 3 resolutions. We detected fewest relationships between environmental variables and communities at our coarsest resolution; this has important implications to study designs utilising video methods. The results of this study suggest that finding an 'appropriate' scale of sampling for impact assessment may not be a question that should be concerning us. Rather, multiscale modelling and sampling may provide us with an increased ability to detect and interpret large-scale relationships. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The relationship between surface sediment diatom assemblages and measured limnological variables in thirty-three coastal Antarctic lakes from the Vestfold Hills was examined by constructing a diatom-water chemistry dataset. Previous analysis of this dataset by canonical correspondence analysis revealed that salinity accounted for a significant amount of the variation in the distribution of the diatom assemblages. Weighted-averaging regression and calibration of this diatom-salinity relationship was used to establish a transfer function for the reconstruction of past lakewater salinity from fossil diatom assemblages. Weighted-averaging regression and calibration with classical deshrinking provided the best model for salinity reconstructions and this was applied to the fossil diatom assemblages from one of the saline lakes in the Vestfold Hills in order to assess its potential for palaeosalinity and palaeoclimate reconstruction.

AB Assessment of the effects of nutrients in running water upon macrophytes is compounded by the variety of additional environmental factors which influence their growth. Some classification schemes have been effective in detecting eutrophication on a national or regional scale, and also downstream changes in large single catchments. However, in lowland rivers with naturally nutrient-rich geologies, detection of change at smaller spatial scales has been difficult. This study examined the macrophyte community at 44 sites on the river Welland, a small lowland catchment rising below 150 m in Leicestershire, England. The community at 23 of these sites was adequate for further analysis. The data show that the dearest effect on community composition is caused by watercourse size. However, sites below sewage works, even small village works, did show a reduction in Mean Trophic Rank, (MTR - an assesment system introduced into the UK over the last three years using a 10-100 scale based upon scores and cover value of indicator species). Overall there was a slight but significant correlation of MTR with soluble phosphate and nitrate. The effectiveness of the MTR method is limited at full catchment scale by low numbers of the indicator taxa at small upstream sites. Catchment-scale assessment of the plant community is probably best served by more detailed phytosociological analysis and by the further development of the 'habitat templet' approach.

AB Nile tilapia weighing 8.29-11.02 g were fed a practical diet at seven ration levels (starvation, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4% body weight per day and satiation) twice a day at 30 degrees C. Feed consumption, apparent digestibility, nitrogenous excretion and growth were determined directly, and heat production was calculated by difference of energy budget. The relationship between specific growth rate in wet weight (SGR(w), percentage per day) and ration size (RL, percentage per day) was a decelerating curve described as SGR(w) = 2.98 (1 - e(-0.61(RL-0.43))). The apparent digestibility coefficients for dry matter and protein showed a decreasing pattern with increasing ration while the apparent digestibility coefficient of energy was not significantly affected by ration size. The proportion of gross energy intake lost in nitrogenous excretion tended to decrease with increasing ration. Feed efficiency was highest, and the proportion of gross energy intake channelled to heat production was lowest, at an intermediate ration level (2% per day). The energy budget at the satiation level was: 100IE = 16.9FE + 1.2(ZE + UE) + 62.3HE + 19.6RE, where IE, FE, (ZE + UE), HE and RE represent gross energy intake, faecal energy, excretory (non-faecal) energy loss, heat production and recovered energy (growth), respectively.

AB mSpecies richness and abundance of vascular plants and several groups of invertebrates (spiders, oribatid mites, diplopods, grasshoppers and bush crickets, ground beetles, butterflies and terrestrial gastropods) were recorded in three calcareous grasslands (Nenzlingen, Movelier and Vicques) in the northwestern Swiss Jura mountains. Species richness varied both between taxonomical groups and between sites (species richness ranges: 96-116 vascular plants, 60-66 spiders, 18 oribatid mites at each site, 1-7 diplopods, 10-16 grasshoppers and bush crickets, 19-21 ground beetles, 32-46 butterflies and 15-21 terrestrial gastropods). Species overlap (number of species that occurred at all sites) was relatively large in terrestrial gastropods (59.1%), butterflies (56.5%), vascular plants (53.8%) and grasshoppers (47.1%), but relatively low in oribatid mites (32.3%), spiders (25.0%), ground beetles (18.4%) and diplopods (12.5%). Diversity expressed by the Shannon-Wiener index (H') was compared for five groups of invertebrates. Diversity was largest in spiders and ground beetles and lowest in terrestrial gastropods. Different taxonomical groups had their maximum diversity at different sites: each grassland had the highest diversity in at least one group. The three sites also varied in the abundance of different invertebrate groups. Most groups had the highest densities in Nenzlingen and the lowest densities in Vicques. All three sites contained a high proportion of species listed in the Red Data Book of Switzerland with values averaging 49.5% in grasshoppers and bush crickets, 28.9% in butterflies, 18.9% in vascular plants, 11.2% in terrestrial gastropods, and 6.7% in ground beetles. One spider species (Oxyptila pullata) and two mite species (Epilohmannia cylindrica minima and Pergalumna myrmophila) were recorded for the first time in Switzerland.

AB 1) Crab-eating zorros, Cerdocyon thous, in Amazonian Brazil weighed 5.2 kg (S.D. 0.6, n = 19), exhibited no sexual dimorphism. lived in social units of 2-5 adults of >1 year old, and occupied territories (restricted polygons) of 532 ha (range 48-1042 ha, n = 21).
   2) The zorros were omnivorous, fruit being the most frequent food (occurring in 57% of 72 faeces in the dry season) comprising 26.4% by volume of undigested faecal remains. Insects were frequently eaten (86%), and vertebrates rarely (15.2%).
   3) Zorros were territorial. The ranges of neighbours overlapped minimally and were very stable in configuration, both from month to month and between dry and wet seasons. Members of each social unit shared on average 88.3% of 200 x 200 m grid cells within their territory. Members of male-female breeding pairs were within 100 m of each other for 63% of the activity period. their proximity being greatest during the mating season (July-August). Parents travelled in close company with their adult-sized offspring, and stayed within 100 m for up to 93.3% of the activity period.
   4) Territories differed in habitat composition. Overall, zorros spent most time in wooded savanna (33.9%) and scrub (30.5%). They did not utilize habitats in direct proportion to their availability, using some more (e.g. scrub) and some less (e.g. open savanna) than expected. Habitat preferences differed between wet and dry seasons. with elevated habitats being favoured during the wet season.
   5) Individuals differed in their habitat utilization, and parents had different habitat usage to their yearling offspring; this difference was exaggerated in the dry season when the yearlings used low-lying habitats apparently disfavoured by the parents. Differences in habitat utilization between group members were least in the wet season, when widespread flooding forced the shared use of higher ground.
   6) Each of two social units larger than two individuals comprised a pair and their three adult-sized offspring (totalling five males and one female). In three cases, a yearling daughter was present in the breeding season, but none of these bred. Non-breeding offspring were seen frequently in the whelping area and In close company with the breeding pair's cubs. This is the first proof of group-living in South American zorros.
   7) Five dispersal events were monitored, and revealed a 'good neighbour' strategy in which newly formed pairs set up their territories adjoining their natal territories. In each case individuals returned intermittently to their original territory where they were in close and amicable company with their parents. One male, having dispersed, returned home frequently without his mate to tend the next generation of his parents' cubs. Of four dispersing males, two subsequently returned to their natal group following the deaths of their mates at least 3-13 months after their initial dispersal, in one case after breeding elsewhere.

AB The cryptostigmatid mite Alaskozetes antarcticus (Michael) is a dominant member of many terrestrial communities in the maritime Antarctic, where it survives extreme temperatures, short cold summers, numerous freeze-thaw cycles, desiccating conditions and a limited season for growth and reproduction. However, examination of features of its biology, from morphology, through life-history strategy to physiology, indicate very little specialization to the Antarctic environment. Alaskozetes antarcticus is a herbivore/detritivore, typical of the Cryptostigmata in general, with low feeding and growth rates, long life span and low reproductive output. Physiological specializations exist in the form of low enzyme activation energies and elevated metabolic rates at low temperatures when compared with temperate species, and associated low optimum temperatures for activity, feeding and growth. Growth rates comparable with temperate species are achieved in the field, with an extended life cycle of five years or more as a result of the short growing season, and the ability of all life stages to overwinter equally successfully. Overwintering survival, involving supercooling enhanced by the use of antifreezes such as glycerol, although initially described in Antarctic species, is now known to be characteristic of many temperate relatives, so it is nor a specific adaptation to the polar environment. The obvious success of A. antarcticus in maritime Antarctic terrestrial environments must be attributed to a combination of several features characteristic of the Cryptostigmata in general, rather than to specific polar adaptations.

AB We tested a metapopulation model of coexistence for the insect herbivores of ragwort. Previous research suggested that some of them survive the intense but patchy defoliation of ragwort by the cinnabar moth (Tyria jacobaeae) by continually colonizing new patches of ragwort. We confirmed prior findings of strong asymmetric competition among these insects, However, we found that all insects, including the cinnabar moth, readily colonized experimental patches up to 380 m from a source. In our study system (60 ragwort patches in a 1.3-km(2) area), median and maximum distances between natural patches were 20 m and 85 m, respectively. Because of the high level of dispersal relative to interpatch distances, a metapopulation model is unlikely to apply in this system. We propose other means of coexistence and suggest that metapopulation hypotheses require more critical examination than they have been given.

ID CARABID BEETLES; PITFALL TRAPS; COMMUNITIES
AB We studied the structure of spider assemblages in fragments of old coniferous forest in the southern Finnish taiga. We sampled spiders with pitfall traps in the interiors and in the edges of the old-forest patches and in the surrounding managed forests. We surveyed assemblages of ground-dwelling spiders and the relation of species to formerly mentioned three forest-habitat categories. We analysed spider assemblages in relation to vegetation structure as well. As in forest spiders there are no habitat specialists, no strict old-forest species were found. However, the spider assemblages of old forests were different from those in the surrounding managed forests. The difference was attributable to habitat differences, mainly to reduced tree-canopy cover in managed forests. Large hunting-spider species (Gnaphosidae, Lycosidae) benefitted from clearcutting and other management measures, whereas the catches of small forest-living species (Linyphiidae) decreased in plantations and open forests. The hunters colonized the edges of old-forest fragments, and were seldom found in the interior of old forest. Size of old-forest fragment did not affect significantly the spider assemblage. The results indicate that a buffer zone of mature forest with closed canopy should be left to surround the old-growth reserves in order to minimize the edge effect in the fragments.

AB To address the lack of information on the distribution and habitat use of 0+ juvenile fishes in the Hungarian/Slovak flood plain of the middle Danube River, we undertook the first cross-border ichthyological investigation, examining three levels of ecological perception (hydrosystem, macrohabitat, microhabitat) during August 1992 using 'Point Abundance Sampling' by electrofishing. Being that the Gabcikovo hydroscheme was about to begin diverting most of the river's discharge away from the flood plain during the winter of 1992, the present investigation represented the last chance to record the distribution and microhabitat use of 0+ fishes within the flood plain. At each sampling point, numerous environmental variables were measured quantitatively, or as percentages. At the hydrosystem level, 25 species of 0+ fishes were captured in the 1170 point samples collected from 52 sites (27 in Hungary, 25 in Slovakia), ranging from 10 to over 200 mm standard length (i.e. pike Esox lucius). No significant differences were found between the Hungarian and Slovak specimens with respect to standard length (ANOVA, p > 0.31), nor in the relative densities (ind.m(-2)) of 0+ fish (Student's t-test: df 24, t = 0.601, p = 0.553). A typology of macrohabitats using principal components analysis of the sites X species data matrix in absence/presence revealed three groupings of sites: (1) lotic channels, weirs and wing-dams; (2) partially-abandoned channels; (3) abandoned channels; the results corroborated our assumption that weirs of the anabranch systems represent a quasi-lotic refuge for rheophilous 0+ fishes of the flood plain during late summer. At the microhabitat level, an empirical model of microhabitat use was generated using canonical correspondence analysis and association analysis (based on chi-square probabilities). Water velocity was the most influential variable, with the 0+ juveniles ordinated along the first canonical axis according to their increasing rheophily. The second most influential microhabitat variable was water transparency, followed by the percentage abundance of macrophytes and substrate composition.

AB The interrelationship between river flooding regime, topography, soil properties and the distribution of tree and bamboo species was analysed in an area of tropical semideciduous forest on the margins of the Rio Grande, in Madre de Deus de Minas, Southeastern Brazil. A survey was carried out in a single forest plot (1.597 ha, 71 adjacent 225 m(2) quadrats) located in the inner side of a river bend and extending from the point bar to the top of the slope. All trees (greater than or equal to 5 cm diameter at the base of the trunk) and bamboo culms were registered. Soil samples were collected and analysed for their properties and the river level was monitored during a two year period. In the point bar the forest was dominated by only two tree species, Salix humboldtiana and Inga affinis, that tended to occur in distinct areas. Differences in soil properties between these areas suggest variation in sedimentation dynamics. In the sloping part of the plot, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that the floristic composition was significantly correlated with three topographic sectors and their corresponding flood regimes. The Lower Slope corresponds to the sharp transition to the point bar forest, endures partial and annual floods and shows a very distinct flora that includes many light-demanding species. The Middle Slope is only occasionally reached by exceptional river floods and is characterised by a high density of the bamboo Merostachys neesii. The comparatively low density and basal area of trees, particularly for the smaller ones, provide evidence that the bamboos are problably interfering with the trees by restricting their recruitment. The Ridgetop lies entirely above the highest flooding level registered. The density of bamboos is lower and the understorey trees abundant.

TI APPEARANCE EVENT ORDINATION - A NEW BIOCHRONOLOGIC METHOD
SO PALEOBIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CONTEXT
AB The fundamental goal of biochronology is ordering taxonomic first and last appearance events. The most useful biochronologic data are of the form ''the first appearance event of one taxon predates the last appearance event of a second taxon'' (FAE < LAE). FAE < LAE data sets are unusually reliable because they converge on a unique solution with greater sampling. The fact that the FAE of one taxon i < the LAE of another taxon j always can be inferred either if i is found lower than j in a stratigraphic section, or if i and j co-occur in at least one taxonomic list. Thus, FAE < LAE data accurately synthesize two disparate sources of information: routine biostratigraphic observations and taxonomic lists that may have no stratigraphic context. Appearance event ordination, the new method introduced here, is intended to summarize FAE < LAE data. The algorithm is founded on the following parsimony criterion: arrangements of FAEs and LAEs should always imply FAEi < LAEj when this is known, and otherwise imply LAEj < FAEi whenever possible. The technique differs from others related to correspondence analysis in its use of FAE < LAE data and explicit definition as a parsimony method. The algorithm is even more unique in that it uses different subsets of FAEi < LAEj statements at each iterative seep, converging on separate sets of scores for the FAEs and LAEs. After arranging either the FAEs or the LAEs on the basis of their scores, the other set of scores can be discarded and the best arrangement of the remaining events can be inferred directly. An analysis of the Plio-Pleistocene mammalian record in the Lake Turkana region is used to illustrate the method. Biochronologic resolution on the order of 0.2-1.5 m.y. is achieved. The Turkana species lists by themselves demonstrate enough FAEi < LAEj relationships to resolve the basic biochronologic pattern, but stratigraphic information is still of great use.

AB Habitat selection of the little bustard Tetrax tetrax during the breeding season was analysed in four cultivated areas of central Spain. Little bustards preferred long-fallow land legume crops and fallow land. Cereal crops, ploughed land and shrubland were avoided. One of the most important habitat requirements was vegetation whose average height does not exceed 20 cm. The species shows some tolerance to the proximity of buildings, villages and roads. Conservation implications are discussed.

ID RED-COCKADED WOODPECKER; CONSERVATION; FOREST
AB The population decline of the white-backed woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos in Finland is presented and factors affecting this decrease are analysed The woodpecker favours mature, deciduous forests which include many dead trees. These forests have been clearcut and thinned heavily from the 1950s. Winter bird counts from the late 1950s to the 1980s show declines of over 90%. The size of the present population is estimated at 30-50 breeding pairs. Fledging success and adult survival rate are not exceptionally low compared to the results of other studies but juvenile mortality appears to be very high as the recruitment rate is low. The breeding population is also very sparse: the mean distance between nearest nests was 15 km. In order to preserve the white-backed woodpecker from extinction in Finland a network of deciduous forests favoured by the woodpecker has been proposed.

AB Habitat use, feeding behavior, and growth of native brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis and hatchery brown trout Salmo trutta were compared in an experiment in which the two species were held alone and together in laboratory stream channels at 14-degrees-C. Microhabitat location and vertical distribution of brook trout within the stream channels shifted in the presence of brown trout, and the frequency with which brook trout initiated aggressive interactions declined. Prey capture rates were higher for brown trout than for brook trout in single- and mixed-species trials, and higher for both species when they occurred alone than when they were together. Brook trout and brown trout in single-species trials maintained weight, but did not grow. In the presence of brown trout, however, brook trout lost weight. Instantaneous growth rates of brown trout in mixed species trials were positive. In the presence of brown trout, 33% of the brook trout contracted the fungus Saprolegnia sp. and died; brown trout were never infected nor were brook trout in single-species trials. If these changes in behaviors and growth rates extend to natural settings in which brook trout and brown trout co-occur, they may contribute to an explanation for the observed decline of brook trout abundance in eastern North America.

AB Meta-analysis plays a crucial role in syntheses of quantitative evidence in ecology and biodiversity conservation. The reliability of estimates in meta-analyses strongly depends on unbiased sampling of primary studies. Although earlier studies have explored potential biases in ecological meta-analyses, biases in reported statistical results and associated study characteristics published in different languages have never been tested in environmental sciences. We address this knowledge gap by systematically searching published meta-analyses and comparing effect-size estimates between English- and Japanese-language studies included in existing meta-analyses. Of the 40 published ecological meta-analysis articles authored by those affiliated to Japanese institutions, we find that three meta-analysis articles searched for studies in the two languages and involved sufficient numbers of English- and Japanese-language studies, resulting in four eligible meta-analyses (i.e., four meta-analyses conducted in the three meta-analysis articles). In two of the four, effect sizes differ significantly between the English- and Japanese-language studies included in the meta-analyses, causing considerable changes in overall mean effect sizes and even their direction when Japanese-language studies are excluded. The observed differences in effect sizes are likely attributable to systematic differences in reported statistical results and associated study characteristics, particularly taxa and ecosystems, between English- and Japanese-language studies. Despite being based on a small sample size, our findings suggest that ignoring non-English-language studies may bias outcomes of ecological meta-analyses, due to systematic differences in study characteristics and effect-size estimates between English- and non-English languages. We provide a list of actions that meta-analysts could take in the future to reduce the risk of language bias.

AB Neonicotinoid insecticides (NNIs) are extensively used insecticides worldwide, yet the data on NNIs residues in the Yangtze River, China is scarce. Occurrence and distribution of six NNIs and a metabolite (desmethyl-acetamiprid) in surface water were investigated in the central Yangtze River, China at 20 sites from March to July and September 2015. Acetamiprid (ACE), imidacloprid (IMI) and thiamethoxam (THM) were the most frequently detected NNIs and IMI had a highest median concentration of 4.37 ng/L, followed by ACE (2.50 ng/L), THM (1.10 ng/L), nitenpyram (NTP; 0.34 ng/L), clothianidin (CLO; 0.10 ng/L), and thiacloprid (THCP; 0.02 ng/L). Significantly higher concentrations and detection frequencies of NNIs were observed in the summer than in the spring, which may be explained by the heavier precipitation in summer. Spatial variation with higher levels among the lower sites than the upper sites may be related with the agriculture land use. NNI contamination presented a low risk to aquatic life according to the risk quotient method, while IMI had potential risk to aquatic life according to the threshold of IMI (8.3 ng/L) in freshwater recommended in Netherland. Using the relative potency factors method for chronic cumulative risk assessment for NNIs, potential exposure to NNIs through water ingestion are three orders of magnitude lower than the recommended relative chronic reference dose.

ID CLASSIFICATION; LOCALIZATION
AB Myocardial infarction (MI) is also called the heart attack, and it results in the death of heart muscle cells due to the lacking in the supply of oxygen and other nutrients. The early and accurate detection of MI using the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is helpful in the clinical standard for saving the lives of the patients suffering from this pathology. This paper proposes a novel approach for the detection of MI pathology using the multiresolution analysis of 12-lead ECG signals. The approach is based on the use of Fourier-Bessel series expansion-based empirical wavelet transform (FBSE-EWT) for the time-scale decomposition of 12-lead ECG signals. For each lead ECG signal, nine subband signals are evaluated using FBSE-EWT. The statistical features such as the kurtosis, the skewness, and the entropy are evaluated from the subband signals of each ECG lead. The deep neural network such as the deep layer least-square support-vector machine (DL-LSSVM) which is formulated using the hidden layers of sparse auto-encoders and the LSSVM is used for the detection of MI from the feature vector of 12-lead ECG. The experimental results demonstrate that the combination of FBSE-EWT-based entropy features and DL-LSSVM has the mean accuracy, the mean sensitivity, and the mean specificity values of 99.74%, 99.87%, and 99.60%, respectively, for the detection of MI. The accuracy value of the proposed method is improved by more than 3% as compared to the wavelet-based features for the detection of MI.

   CONSERVATION; RESPONSES; PROTOCOL
AB Research in applied ecology provides scientific evidence to guide conservation policy and management. Applied ecology is becoming increasingly quantitative and model selection via information criteria has become a common statistical modeling approach. Unfortunately, parameters that contain little to no useful information are commonly presented and interpreted as important in applied ecology. I review the concept of an uninformative parameter in model selection using information criteria and perform a literature review to measure the prevalence of uninformative parameters in model selection studies applying Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) in 2014 in four of the top journals in applied ecology (Biological Conservation, Conservation Biology, Ecological Applications, Journal of Applied Ecology). Twenty-one percent of studies I reviewed applied AIC metrics. Many (31.5%) of the studies applying AIC metrics in the four applied ecology journals I reviewed had or were very likely to have uninformative parameters in a model set. In addition, more than 40% of studies reviewed had insufficient information to assess the presence or absence of uninformative parameters in a model set. Given the prevalence of studies likely to have uninformative parameters or with insufficient information to assess parameter status (71.5%), I surmise that much of the policy recommendations based on applied ecology research may not be supported by the data analysis. I provide four warning signals and a decision tree to assist authors, reviewers, and editors to screen for uninformative parameters in studies applying model selection with information criteria. In the end, careful thinking at every step of the scientific process and greater reporting standards are required to detect uninformative parameters in studies adopting an information criteria approach.

AB In addition to their being vital components of mid-to high-latitude coastal ecosystems, salt marshes contain 0.1% of global sequestered terrestrial carbon. Their sustainability is now threatened by accelerating sea-level rise (SLR) that has reached a rate that is many times greater than the rate at which they formed and evolved. Modeling studies have been instrumental in predicting how marsh systems will respond to greater frequencies and durations of tidal inundation and in quantifying thresholds when marshes will succumb and begin to disintegrate due to accelerating SLR. Over the short term, some researchers believe that biogeomorphic feedbacks will improve marsh survival through greater biomass productivity enhanced by warmer temperatures and higher carbon dioxide concentrations. Increased sedimentation rates are less likely due to lower-than-expected suspended sediment concentrations. The majority of marsh loss today is through wave-induced edge erosion that beneficially adds sediment to the system. Edge erosion is partly offset by upland marsh migration during SLR.
   Despite positive biogeomorphic feedbacks, many salt marshes will succumb to accelerating sea-level rise due to insufficient mineral sediment.
   The latest multivariate marsh modeling is producing predictions of marsh evolution under various sea-level rise scenarios.
   The least well-known variables in projecting changes to salt marshes are suspended sediment concentrations and net sediment influx to the marsh.
   We are in the infancy of understanding the importance and processes of marsh edge erosion and the overall dynamicism of marshes.
   This review defines the latest breakthroughs in understanding the response of salt marshes to accelerating sea-level rise and decreasing sediment supply.
   Climate change is accelerating sea-level rise, warming temperatures, and increasing carbon dioxide, all of which are impacting marsh vegetation and vertical accretion.

AB This paper introduces a modular processing chain to derive global high-resolution maps of leaf traits. In particular, we present global maps at 500 m resolution of specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus content per dry mass, and leaf nitrogen/phosphorus ratio. The processing chain exploits machine learning techniques along with optical remote sensing data (MODIS/Landsat) and climate data for gap filling and up-scaling of in-situ measured leaf traits. The chain first uses random forests regression with surrogates to fill gaps in the database (> 45% of missing entries) and maximizes the global representativeness of the trait dataset. Plant species are then aggregated to Plant Functional Types (PFTs). Next, the spatial abundance of PFTs at MODIS resolution (500 m) is calculated using Landsat data (30 m). Based on these PFT abundances, representative trait values are calculated for MODIS pixels with nearby trait data. Finally, different regression algorithms are applied to globally predict trait estimates from these MODIS pixels using remote sensing and climate data. The methods were compared in terms of precision, robustness and efficiency. The best model (random forests regression) shows good precision (normalized RMSE <= 20%) and goodness of fit (averaged Pearson's correlation R = 0.78) in any considered trait. Along with the estimated global maps of leaf traits, we provide associated uncertainty estimates derived from the regression models. The process chain is modular, and can easily accommodate new traits, data streams (traits databases and remote sensing data), and methods. The machine learning techniques applied allow attribution of information gain to data input and thus provide the opportunity to understand trait-environment relationships at the plant and ecosystem scales. The new data products the gap-filled trait matrix, a global map of PFT abundance per MODIS gridcells and the high-resolution global leaf trait maps are complementary to existing large-scale observations of the land surface and we therefore anticipate substantial contributions to advances in quantifying, understanding and prediction of the Earth system.

AB Adaptive divergence and speciation may happen despite opposition by gene flow. Identifying the genomic basis underlying divergence with gene flow is a major task in evolutionary genomics. Most approaches (e.g., outlier scans) focus on genomic regions of high differentiation. However, not all genomic architectures potentially underlying divergence are expected to show extreme differentiation. Here, we develop an approach that combines hybrid zone analysis (i.e., focuses on spatial patterns of allele frequency change) with system-specific simulations to identify loci inconsistent with neutral evolution. We apply this to a genome-wide SNP set from an ideally suited study organism, the intertidal snail Littorina saxatilis, which shows primary divergence between ecotypes associated with different shore habitats. We detect many SNPs with clinal patterns, most of which are consistent with neutrality. Among non-neutral SNPs, most are located within three large putative inversions differentiating ecotypes. Many non-neutral SNPs show relatively low levels of differentiation. We discuss potential reasons for this pattern, including loose linkage to selected variants, polygenic adaptation and a component of balancing selection within populations (which may be expected for inversions). Our work is in line with theory predicting a role for inversions in divergence, and emphasizes that genomic regions contributing to divergence may not always be accessible with methods purely based on allele frequency differences. These conclusions call for approaches that take spatial patterns of allele frequency change into account in other systems.

AB Biodiversity loss undermines the long-term maintenance of ecosystem functions and the well-being of human populations. Global-scale policy initiatives, including the Convention on Biological Diversity, have failed to curb the loss of biodiversity. This failure has led to contentious debates over alternative solutions that represent opposing visions of value-orientations and policy tools at the heart of conservation action. We review these debates and argue that they impede conservation progress by wasting time and resources, overlooking common goals, failing to recognize the need for diverse solutions, and ignoring the central question of who should be involved in the conservation process. Breaking with the polarizing debates, we argue that biocultural approaches to conservation can guide progress toward just and sustainable conservation solutions. We provide examples of the central principles of biocultural conservation, which emphasize the need for pluralistic, partnership-based, and dynamic approaches to conservation.

AB Recently, concerns have been raised that residues of glyphosate-based herbicides may interfere with the homeostasis of the intestinal bacterial community and thereby affect the health of humans or animals. The biochemical pathway for aromatic amino acid synthesis (Shikimate pathway), which is specifically inhibited by glyphosate, is shared by plants and numerous bacterial species. Several in vitro studies have shown that various groups of intestinal bacteria may be differently affected by glyphosate. Here, we present results from an animal exposure trial combining deep 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the bacterial community with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based metabolic profiling of aromatic amino acids and their downstream metabolites. We found that glyphosate as well as the commercial formulation Glyfonova (R) 450 PLUS administered at up to fifty times the established European Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI = 0.5 mg/kg body weight) had very limited effects on bacterial community composition in Sprague Dawley rats during a two-week exposure trial. The effect of glyphosate on prototrophic bacterial growth was highly dependent on the availability of aromatic amino acids, suggesting that the observed limited effect on bacterial composition was due to the presence of sufficient amounts of aromatic amino acids in the intestinal environment. A strong correlation was observed between intestinal concentrations of glyphosate and intestinal pH, which may partly be explained by an observed reduction in acetic acid produced by the gut bacteria. We conclude that sufficient intestinal levels of aromatic amino acids provided by the diet alleviates the need for bacterial synthesis of aromatic amino acids and thus prevents an antimicrobial effect of glyphosate in vivo. It is however possible that the situation is different in cases of human malnutrition or in production animals. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Tropical forests store and sequester large amounts of carbon in above- and below-ground plant biomass and soil organic matter (SOM), but how these are driven by abiotic and biotic factors remains poorly understood.
   Here, we test the effects of abiotic factors (light variation, caused by logging disturbance, and soil fertility) and biotic factors (species richness and functional trait composition) on biomass stocks (above-ground biomass, fine root biomass), SOM and productivity in a relatively monodominant Guyanese tropical rainforest. This forest grows on nutrient-poor soils and has few species that contribute most to total abundance. We, therefore, expected strong effects of soil fertility and species' traits that determine resource acquisition and conservation, but not of diversity. We evaluated 6years of data for 30 0.4-ha plots and tested hypotheses using structural equation models.
   Disturbance increased productivity but decreased above-ground biomass stocks. Soil phosphorus (P) enhanced above-ground biomass and productivity, whereas soil nitrogen reduced fine root biomass. In contrast to expectations, trait values representing acquisitive strategies (e.g. high leaf nutrient concentration) increased biomass stocks, possibly because they indicate higher nutrient absorption and thus higher biomass build-up. However, under harsh conditions where biomass increase is slow, acquisitive trait values may increase respiration and vulnerability to hazards and therefore increase biomass loss. As expected, species richness did not affect productivity.
   We conclude that light availability (through disturbance) and soil fertilityespecially Pstrongly limit forest biomass productivity and stocks in this Guyanese forest. Low P availability may cause strong environmental filtering, which in turn results in a small set of dominant species. As a result, community trait composition but not species richness determines productivity and stocks of biomass and SOM in tropical forest on poor soils.

AB Analyzing the effectiveness of environmental impact assessment (EIA) is an important theme in EIA literature. Over the course of its development, the manifold term "effectiveness" has been delineated into four dimensions: Procedural, substantive, transactive, and normative. The present state of the art review covers not only studies about these concepts, but also the methods used to test them. It analyzes trends in 64 studies over a 20-year period. It is observed that results oriented research is more common than process oriented, but given the links between results and processes, procedural effectiveness remains the lens through which policy solutions are analyzed. Future research is recommended comparing developing and developed countries as well as studies focusing on subnational EIA systems. Serious gaps in the literature remain, such as developing methods to evaluate the direct impact of EIA on decision-making and how to integrate the pluralism found in the EIA process for sustainable ends. Reliance on perceptual survey and interview methods is common for substantive and normative effectiveness studies. The least studied dimension, transactive dimension, requires more study, specifically the cost efficiency of EIA. Promisingly, multidimensional studies are becoming more common that highlight linkages among these dimensions, although the nature of these linkages must be tested with more case studies

AB Climate change affects not just where species are found, but also when species' key life-history events occur-their phenology. Measuring such changes in timing is often hampered by a reliance on biased survey data: surveys identify that an event has taken place (for example, the flower is in bloom), but not when that event happened (for example, the flower bloomed yesterday). Here, we show that this problem can be circumvented using statistical estimators, which can provide accurate and unbiased estimates from sparsely sampled observations. We demonstrate that such methods can resolve an ongoing debate about the relative timings of the onset and cessation of flowering, and allow us to place modern observations reliably within the context of the vast wealth of historical data that reside in herbaria, museum collections, and written records. We also analyse large-scale citizen science data from the United States National Phenology Network and reveal not just earlier but also potentially more variable flowering in recent years. Evidence for greater variability through time is important because increases in variation are characteristic of systems approaching a state change.

AB A growing body of research in translational science provides a foundation for translational ecologists to consider the practices that show the most promise, as well as the potential pitfalls of those practices. These research approaches (eg user-inspired climate science) require deliberate engagement with end users, and an understanding of the social and cultural contexts in which a research project functions. We examine the climate science translation literature (looking at how research can inform decision making) to identify key issues related to how the social sciences have helped guide researchers engaged in user-inspired research. We focus on understanding the more intangible inputs to research projects, including the social and cultural contexts; stakeholder engagement; the role of social capital; and evaluating the outputs, outcomes, and impacts of translational science projects and initiatives. Research on return-on-investment metrics for translational science is increasingly pointing to the conclusion that intentional, structured processes, such as those found in translational sciences, boost the likelihood of science being successfully incorporated into environmental decision making and policy.

TI Values, trust, and cultural backlash in conservation governance: The
   case of wildlife management in the United States

AB The global rise of populism is having a profound effect on policies across many issues. We explore the potential effects on wildlife conservation using the western United States as a case study. Global populist trends have been explained through the phenomenon of cultural backlash, wherein those left behind in the value shift beginning post-World War II started to mobilize by the end of the century to protect their core values and traditions. Our prior work suggests that wildlife values in the western United States are shifting from traditional domination to mutualism orientations. The current study looked for indications of backlash from the American hunting culture that may be associated with that shift. Data from a 19-state survey (n = 12,673) revealed that, in states with a higher prevalence of mutualism, residents with domination values had lower levels of trust in the state wildlife agency. Traditional residents were also less supportive of broadly-inclusive governance models, and the potential for social conflict over wildlife issues was much higher in those states. Finally, we found evidence of actions to "fight back" against change among traditional groups in the growth of ballot initiatives from 1990 to 2016 to protect hunting rights. Backlash will likely affect different countries and jurisdictions differently, contingent on the historical and cultural context. Nonetheless, it will be a global force with important implications for conservation governance, even if only to intensify conflict. Governance innovations will be necessary to help conservation institutions adapt to dramatic changes in the socio-political environment.

AB Count-based PVA allows researchers to assess patterns of population change through time and to evaluate future persistence. We combined state-space models and citizen science data to evaluate viability of the western population of monarch butterflies over 36 years. A key feature of our analysis was combining irregular sampling from multiple sites to obtain a single estimate of total abundance using state-space models. The average population growth rate was negative, u = - 0.0762 (lambda = 0.927), average abundance in the 2000s was < 5% of average abundance in the 1980s, and current quasi-extinction risk is 72% within 20 years. Despite wide confidence intervals in some parameter estimates, western monarch monitoring data provide unambiguous evidence for dramatic population declines. To obtain viable populations, managers could target historic abundance and high enough growth rates to avoid near-term extinction.

AB Adult sex ratio (ASR, the proportion of males in the adult population) is a central concept in population and evolutionary biology, and is also emerging as a major factor influencing mate choice, pair bonding and parental cooperation in both human and non-human societies. However, estimating ASR is fraught with difficulties stemming from the effects of spatial and temporal variation in the numbers of males and females, and detection/capture probabilities that differ between the sexes. Here, we critically evaluate methods for estimating ASR in wild animal populations, reviewing how recent statistical advances can be applied to handle some of these challenges. We review methods that directly account for detection differences between the sexes using counts of unmarked individuals (observed, trapped or killed) and counts of marked individuals using mark-recapture models. We review a third class of methods that do not directly sample the number of males and females, but instead estimate the sex ratio indirectly using relationships that emerge from demographic measures, such as survival, age structure, reproduction and assumed dynamics. We recommend that detection-based methods be used for estimating ASR in most situations, and point out that studies are needed that compare different ASR estimation methods and control for sex differences in dispersal.
   This article is part of the themed issue `Adult sex ratios and reproductive decisions: a critical re-examination of sex differences in human and animal societies'.

AB Drought frequency is increasing in many parts of the world and may enhance tree decline and mortality. The underlying physiological mechanisms are poorly understood, however, particularly regarding chronic effects of long-term drought and the response to increasing temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). We combined analyses of radial growth and stable carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13) in tree rings in a mature Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest over the 20th century to elucidate causes of tree mortality in one of the driest parts of the European Alps (Pfynwald, Switzerland). We further compared trees that have recently died with living trees in a 10-year irrigation experiment, where annual precipitation was doubled. We found a sustained growth increase and immediate depletion of delta(13)Cvalues for irrigated trees, indicating higher stomatal conductance and thus indeed demonstrating that water is a key limiting factor for growth. Growth of the now-dead trees started declining in the mid-1980s, when both mean temperature and VPD increased strongly. But growth of these trees was reduced to some extent already several decades earlier, while intrinsic water-use efficiency derived from delta C-13 values was higher. This indicates a more conservative water-use strategy compared with surviving trees, possibly at the cost of low carbon uptake and long-term reduction of the needle mass. We observed reduced climatic sensitivity of raw tree-ring delta C-13 for the now-dead in contrast to surviving trees, indicating impaired stomatal regulation, although this difference between the tree groups was smaller after detrending the data. Higher autocorrelation and a lower inter-annual delta C-13 variability of the now-dead trees further indicates a strong dependence on (low) carbon reserves. We conclude that the recent increase in atmospheric moisture demand in combination with insufficient soil water supply was the main trigger for mortality of those trees that were weakened by long-term reduced carbon uptake.

AB Climate extremes will elicit responses from the individual to the ecosystem level. However, only recently have ecologists begun to synthetically assess responses to climate extremes across multiple levels of ecological organization. We review the literature to examine how plant responses vary and interact across levels of organization, focusing on how individual, population and community responses may inform ecosystem-level responses in herbaceous and forest plant communities. We report a high degree of variability at the individual level, and a consequential inconsistency in the translation of individual or population responses to directional changes in community-or ecosystem-level processes. The scaling of individual or population responses to community or ecosystem responses is often predicated upon the functional identity of the species in the community, in particular, the dominant species. Furthermore, the reported stability in plant community composition and functioning with respect to extremes is often driven by processes that operate at the community level, such as species niche partitioning and compensatory responses during or after the event. Future research efforts would benefit from assessing ecological responses across multiple levels of organization, as this will provide both a holistic and mechanistic understanding of ecosystem responses to increasing climatic variability.

AB Ecosystem and community ecology have evolved along different pathways, with little overlap. However, to meet societal demands for predicting changes in ecosystem services, the functional and structural view dominating these two branches of ecology, respectively, must be integrated. Biodiversity-ecosystem function research has addressed this integration for two decades, but full integration that makes predictions relevant to practical problems is still lacking. We argue that full integration requires going, in both branches, deeper by taking into account individual organisms and the evolutionary and physico-chemical principles that drive their behavior. Individual-based models are a major tool for this integration. They have matured by using individual-level mechanism to replace the demographic thinking which dominates classical theoretical ecology. Existing individual-based ecosystem models already have proven useful both for theory and application. Still, next-generation individual-based models will increasingly use standardized and re-usable submodels to represent behaviors and mechanisms such as growth, uptake of nutrients, foraging, and home range behavior. The strategy of pattern-oriented modeling then helps make such ecosystem models structurally realistic by developing theory for individual behaviors just detailed enough to reproduce and explain patterns observed at the system level. Next-generation ecosystem scientists should include the individual-based approach in their toolkit and focus on addressing real systems because theory development and solving applied problems go hand-in-hand in individual-based ecology.

AB Today most population genomic studies of nonmodel organisms either sequence a subset of the genome deeply in each individual or sequence pools of unlabelled individuals. With a step-by-step workflow, we illustrate how lowcoverage whole-genome sequencing of hundreds of individually barcoded samples is now a practical alternative strategy for obtaining genomewide data on a population scale. We used a highly efficient protocol to generate high-quality libraries for similar to 6.5 USD from each of 876 Atlantic silversides (a teleost fish with a genome size similar to 730 Mb) that we sequenced to 1-4x genome coverage. In the absence of a reference genome, we developed a bioinformatic pipeline for mapping the genomic reads to a de novo assembled reference transcriptome. This provides an 'in silico' method for exome capture that avoids the complexities and expenses of using wet chemistry for target isolation. Using novel tools for analysis of low-coverage data, we extracted population allele frequencies, individual genotype likelihoods and polymorphism data for 2 504 335 SNPs across the exome for the 876 fish. To illustrate the use of the resulting data, we present a preliminary analysis of geographical patterns in the exome data and a comparison of complete mitochondrial genome sequences for each individual (constructed from the low-coverage data) that show population colonization patterns along the US east coast. With a total cost per sample of less than 50 USD (including sequencing) and ability to prepare 96 libraries in only 5 h, our approach adds a viable new option to the population genomics toolbox.

   INTERACTION
AB Invasive and endangered species reflect opposite ends of a spectrum of ecological success, yet they experience many similar eco-evolutionary challenges including demographic bottlenecks, hybridization and novel environments. Despite these similarities, important differences exist. Demographic bottlenecks are more transient in invasive species, which (i) maintains ecologically relevant genetic variation, (ii) reduces mutation load, and (iii) increases the efficiency of natural selection relative to genetic drift. Endangered species are less likely to benefit from admixture, which offsets mutation load but also reduces fitness when populations are locally adapted. Invading species generally experience more benign environments with fewer natural enemies, which increases fitness directly and also indirectly by masking inbreeding depression. Adaptive phenotypic plasticity can maintain fitness in novel environments but is more likely to evolve in invasive species encountering variable habitats and to be compromised by demographic factors in endangered species. Placed in an eco-evolutionary context, these differences affect the breadth of the ecological niche, which arises as an emergent property of antagonistic selection and genetic constraints. Comparative studies of invasions and extinctions that apply an eco-evolutionary perspective could provide new insights into the environmental and genetic basis of ecological success in novel environments and improve efforts to preserve global biodiversity.

AB Operational application of a remote sensing-based two source energy balance model (TSEB) to estimate evaportranspiration (ET) and the components evaporation (E), transpiration (T) at a range of space and time scales is very useful for managing water resources in arid and semiarid watersheds. The TSEB model uses composite land surface temperature as input and applies a simplified Priestley-Taylor formulation to partition this temperature into soil and vegetation component temperatures and then computes subsequent component energy fluxes. The remote sensing-based TSEB model using component temperatures of the soil and canopy has not been adequately evaluated due to a dearth of reliable observations. In this study, soil and vegetation component temperatures partitioned from visible and near infrared and thermal remote sensing data supplied by advanced scanning thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) are applied as model inputs (TSEBCT) to assess and refine the subsequent component energy fluxes estimation in TSEB scheme under heterogeneous land surface conditions in an advective environment. The model outputs including sensible heat flux (H), latent heat flux (LE), component LE from soil and canopy from the TSEBCT and original model (TSEBPT) are compared with ground measurements from eddy covariance (EC) and larger aperture scintillometers (LAS) technique, and stable isotopic method. Both model versions yield errors of about 10% with LE observations. However, the TSEBCT model output of H and LE are in closer agreement with the observations and is found to be generally more robust in component flux estimation compared to the TSEBPT using the ASTER data in this heterogeneous advective environment. Thus given accurate oil and canopy temperatures, TSEBCT may provide more reliable estimates of plant water use and values of water use efficiency at large scales for water resource management in arid and semiarid landscapes.

AB By combining the psychosocial and social impact assessment model, this study explores the complex interrelationship between public reaction and social impacts in construction projects via the structural equation modeling. A road construction project in Wuhan, China was selected as case study and a face-to-face interview survey was conducted. Results showed that public reaction occurs through a chain of events rather than one-time independent event. This study revealed that inefficient communication is the most critical risk where public awareness plays a mediation role. The low level of awareness leads to limited knowledge, which in turn results in irrational behavior. Furthermore, a closer residence, high-level dependency and greater change in living tend to attract more concerns on project impacts. This calls for the change of paradigm of social impact assessment in construction projects from the engineering-oriented to the people-oriented approach. This provides useful inputs to facilitate the public participation and alternative analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

AB Exposure to phthalates has been demonstrated to cause reproductive toxicity in animals, but evidence of the association between phthalates and markers of male reproductive function have been inconsistent in human studies. Here we examined whether environmental exposure to phthalates contributes to altered reproductive hormone levels, sperm DNA damage and spermatozoa apoptosis in a Chinese population. From March to June 2013, repeated urine samples collected from male partners of couples attending an infertility clinic in Wuhan, China were analyzed for 8 phthalate metabolites. Associations of the urinary phthalate metabolites with serum hormone levels (n=483), sperm DNA damage parameters (n=509) and spermatozoa apoptosis measures (n=467) were assessed using multivariable linear regression models. After adjusting for potential confounders, mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), a metabolite of di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP), was inversely associated with serum levels of estradiol, total testosterone (T) and free T (all P for trend < 0.05). Additionally, we found positive dose-response relationships between the percentage of DEHP metabolites excreted as MEHP (%MEHP) and percentages of tail DNA (P for trend < 0.05) and between three metabolites of DEHP [MEHP, mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP)] and percentages of Annexin V+/PI - spermatozoa (all P for trend < 0.05). Our findings strengthen the emerging evidence that exposure to DEHP may alter hormone levels, disrupt sperm DNA integrity and induce spermatozoa apoptosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Forging strong links between traits and performance is essential for understanding and predicting community assembly and dynamics. Functional trait analyses of trees that have correlated single-trait values with measures of performance such as growth and mortality have generally found weak relationships. A reason for these weak relationships is the failure to use individual-level trait data while simultaneously putting that data into the context of the abiotic setting, neighborhood composition, and the remaining axes constituting the overall phenotype. Here, utilizing detailed growth and trait data for 59 species of trees in a subtropical forest, we demonstrate that the individual-level functional trait values are strongly related to individual growth rates, and that the strength of these relationships critically depends on the context of that individual. We argue that our understanding of trait-performance relationships can be greatly improved with individual-level data so long as that data is put into the proper context.

AB Clearance for agriculture or cattle ranching was the dominant land-cover change during the last two decades in the South American Dry Chaco. The Argentinean portion has been particularly affected, presenting greater deforestation rates than the continental and global averages. Little is known on the control factors of the location and the spatial clearance patterns. In this article we studied (a) deforestation dynamics in the Argentinean Dry Chaco and the factors determining land clearing locations for the last 25 years; (b) changes in the relative impact of those factors through time and space; and (c) the effect of regulations aimed to control the location and magnitude of land transformation. We also tested the "expansion of the agricultural frontier" hypothesis for the Argentinean Chaco. To identify the factors that defined agricultural expansion we used binomial logistic models that were fitted to a set of independent variables (bio-physical, infrastructure and political factors) that could eventually influence the distribution of new agricultural areas. Results indicate that the Forest Law devised by the Argentinean federal government to control the clearing process was insufficient to restrict both the area transformed per year and clearance locations. Agriculture is expanding over marginal areas and land clearing dynamics have been increasingly associated to the proximity to already cleared areas, defining a frontier advancement pattern which gives the idea of a contagion process. According to our results, the relative importance of the anthropic factors associated to the agricultural expansion in the region increased through time. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The 2000 Valley Complex wildfire burned in steep montane forests with ash cap soils in western Montana, USA. The effects of high soil burn severity on forest soil hydrologic function were examined using rainfall simulations (100 mm h(-1) for 1 h) on 0.5-m(2) plots. Infiltration rates, sediment yields and sediment concentrations were compared among three treatments: control (unburned and undisturbed); bare (unburned with all surface vegetation, litter, and duff removed prior to each simulation); and burned. Rainfall simulations were done immediately after the fire and repeated in 2001, 2002, and 2005. Soil moisture, water repellency, and understory canopy and ground cover were measured and related to infiltration rates and sediment yields. The unburned forest soil was water repellent at the mineral surface. This surface repellency was no longer detected after it was burned at high severity, but a post-fire water repellent soil layer was observed at 1-2 cm below the surface. The control plots had high ground cover (90% overall), infiltration of 44-48 mm, and very low sediment concentrations (median values of 0.1-0.6 g L-1) and sediment yields (6-54 g m(-2)) for all years despite changes in soil moisture and strong water repellency. The bare and control plots had similar water repellency values, but the interrill erosion in the bare plots was high throughout the study (624-1277 g m(-2)) In the year of the fire, the burned sites had high rates of soil water repellency (88%) and little ground cover (10%). This resulted in low infiltration rates (30 mm), high sediment concentrations (median value 21 g L-1), and high sediment yields (1157 g m(-2)). By 2005, the fire-altered water repellency decreased in occurrence (48%) and severity, and the ground cover increased (42%). This resulted in much greater infiltration (84 mm), lower sediment concentration (median value 0.5 g L-1), and lower sediment yields (15 g m(-2)) on the burned plots. The importance of ground cover for preventing interrill erosion was demonstrated by the very low sediment yields on the control plots as compared to the bare and burned plots. The strength and occurrence of water repellency in both the unburned and burned sites decreased as soil moisture increased; however, strong soil water repellency was detected at the soil surface whenever unburned soils were dry. Fire-altered soil water repellency influenced the infiltration capacity and increased runoff rates immediately after the fire; however, the loss of protective ground cover was a more significant factor for the increased sediment concentrations and sediment yields.

AB The growing demand for natural gas has pushed oil and gas exploration to more isolated and previously untapped regions around the world where construction of LNG processing plants is not always a viable option. The development of FLNG will allow floating plants to be positioned in remote offshore areas and subsequently produce, liquefy, store and offload LNG in the one position. The offloading process from an FLNG platform to a gas tanker can be a high risk operation. It consists of LNG being transferred, in hostile environments, through loading arms or flexible cryogenic hoses into a carrier which then transports the LNG to onshore facilities. During the carrier's offloading process at onshore terminals, it again involves risk that may result in an accident such as collision, leakage and/or grounding. It is therefore critical to assess and monitor all risks associated with the offloading operation. This study is aimed at developing a novel methodology using Bayesian Network (BN) to conduct the dynamic safety analysis for the offloading process of an LNG carrier. It investigates different risk factors associated with LNG offloading procedures in order to predict the probability of undesirable accidents. Dynamic failure assessment using Bayesian theory can estimate the likelihood of the occurrence of an event. It can also estimate the failure probability of the safety system and thereby develop a dynamic failure assessment tool for the offloading process at a particular FLNG plant. The main objectives of this paper are: to understand the LNG offloading process, to identify hazardous events during offloading operation, and to perform failure analysis (modelling) of critical accidents and/or events. Most importantly, it is to evaluate and compare risks. A sensitivity analysis has been performed to validate the risk models and to study the behaviour of the most influential factors. The results have indicated that collision is the most probable accident to occur during the offloading process of an LNG carrier at berth, which may have catastrophic consequences.

AB Ecological surrogacy - here defined as using a process or element (e.g., species, ecosystem, or abiotic factor) to represent another aspect of an ecological system - is a widely used concept, but many applications of the surrogate concept have been controversial. We argue that some of this controversy reflects differences among users with different goals, a distinction that can be crystalized by recognizing two basic types of surrogate. First, many ecologists and natural resource managers measure "indicator surrogates" to provide information about ecological systems. Second, and often overlooked, are "management surrogates" (e.g., umbrella species) that are primarily used to facilitate achieving management goals, especially broad goals such as "maintain biodiversity" or "increase ecosystem resilience." We propose that distinguishing these two overarching roles for surrogacy may facilitate better communication about project goals. This is critical when evaluating the usefulness of different surrogates, especially where a potential surrogate might be useful in one role but not another. Our classification for ecological surrogacy applies to species, ecosystems, ecological processes, abiotic factors, and genetics, and thus can provide coherence across a broad range of uses.

AB Pulsatilla patens s.s. is a one of the most endangered plant species in Europe. The present range of this species in Europe is highly fragmented and the size of the populations has been dramatically reduced in the past 50 years. The rapid disappearance of P. patens localities in Europe has prompted the European Commission to initiate active protection of this critically endangered species. The aim of this study was to estimate the degree and distribution of genetic diversity within European populations of this endangered species. We screened 29 populations of P. patens using a set of six microsatellite primers. The results of our study indicate that the analyzed populations are characterized by low levels of genetic diversity (H-o = 0.005) and very high levels of inbreeding (F-IS = 0.90). These results suggest that genetic erosion could be partially responsible for the lower fitness in smaller populations of this species. Private allelic richness was very low, being as low as 0.00 for most populations. Average genetic diversity over loci and mean number of alleles in P. patens populations were significantly correlated with population size, suggesting severe genetic drift. The results of AMOVA point to higher levels of variation within populations than between populations. The results of Structure and PCoA analyses suggest that the genetic structure of the studied P. patens populations fall into three clusters corresponding to geographical regions. The most isolated populations (mostly from Romania) formed a separate group with a homogeneous gene pool located at the southern, steppic part of the distribution range. Baltic, mostly Polish, populations fall into two genetic groups which were not fully compatible with their geographic distribution. Our results indicate the serious genetic depauperation of P. patens in the western part of its range, even hinting at an ongoing extinction vortex. Therefore, special conservation attention is required to maintain the populations of this highly endangered species of European Community interest.

AB Analysing functional traits along environmental gradients can improve our understanding of the mechanisms structuring plant communities. Within forests, vertical gradients in light intensity, temperature and humidity are often pronounced. Vascular epiphytes are particularly suitable for studying the influence of these vertical gradients on functional traits because they lack contact with the soil and thus individual plants are entirely exposed to different environmental conditions, from the dark and humid understorey to the sunny and dry outer canopy. In this study, we analysed multiple aspects of the trait-based ecology of vascular epiphytes: shifts in trait values with height above ground (as a proxy for vertical environmental gradients) at community and species level, the importance of intra- vs. interspecific trait variability, and trait differences among taxonomic groups. We assessed ten leaf traits for 1151 individuals belonging to 83 epiphyte species of all major taxonomic groups co-occurring in a Panamanian lowland forest. Community mean trait values of many leaf traits were strongly correlated with height and particularly specific leaf area and chlorophyll concentration showed nonlinear, negative trends. Intraspecific trait variability was pronounced and accounted for one-third of total observed trait variance. Intraspecific trait adjustments along the vertical gradient were common and seventy per cent of all species showed significant trait-height relationships. In addition, intraspecific trait variability was positively correlated with the vertical range occupied by species. We observed significant trait differences between major taxonomic groups (orchids, ferns, aroids, bromeliads). In ferns, for instance, leaf dry matter content was almost twofold higher than in the other taxonomic groups. This indicates that some leaf traits are taxonomically conserved. Our study demonstrates that vertical environmental gradients strongly influence functional traits of vascular epiphytes. In order to understand community composition along such gradients, it is central to study several aspects of trait-based ecology, including both community and intraspecific trends of multiple traits.

AB Vector borne diseases are susceptible to climate change because distributions and densities of many vectors are climate driven. The Amazon region is endemic for cutaneous leishmaniasis and is predicted to be severely impacted by climate change. Recent records suggest that the distributions of Lutzomyia (Nyssomyia) flaviscutellata and the parasite it transmits, Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis, are expanding southward, possibly due to climate change, and sometimes associated with new human infection cases. We define the vector's climatic niche and explore future projections under climate change scenarios. Vector occurrence records were compiled from the literature, museum collections and Brazilian Health Departments. Six bioclimatic variables were used as predictors in six ecological niche model algorithms (BIOCLIM, DOMAIN, MaxEnt, GARP, logistic regression and Random Forest). Projections for 2050 used 17 general circulation models in two greenhouse gas representative concentration pathways: "stabilization" and "high increase". Ensemble models and consensus maps were produced by overlapping binary predictions. Final model outputs showed good performance and significance. The use of species absence data substantially improved model performance. Currently, L. flaviscutellata is widely distributed in the Amazon region, with records in the Atlantic Forest and savannah regions of Central Brazil. Future projections indicate expansion of the climatically suitable area for the vector in both scenarios, towards higher latitudes and elevations. L. flaviscutellata is likely to find increasingly suitable conditions for its expansion into areas where human population size and density are much larger than they are in its current locations. If environmental conditions change as predicted, the range of the vector is likely to expand to southeastern and central-southern Brazil, eastern Paraguay and further into the Amazonian areas of Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela. These areas will only become endemic for L. amazonensis, however, if they have competent reservoir hosts and transmission dynamics matching those in the Amazon region.

AB Species hybrids have long been undervalued in conservation and are often perceived as a threat to pure species. Recently, the conservation value of hybrids, especially those of natural origin, has gained recognition; however, hybrid conservation remains controversial. We reviewed hybrid management policies, including laws, regulations, and management protocols, from a variety of organizations, primarily in Canada and the United States. We found that many policies are based on limited ethical and ecological considerations and provide little opportunity for hybrid conservation. In most policies, hybrids are either unrepresented or considered a threat to conservation goals. This is problematic because our review of the hybrid conservation literature identified many ethical and ecological considerations relevant to determining the conservation value of a hybrid, all of which are management-context specific. We also noted a lack of discussion of the ethical considerations regarding hybrid conservation. Based on these findings, we created a policy framework outlining situations in which hybrids could be eligible for conservation in Canada and the United States. The framework comprises a decision tree that helps users determine whether a hybrid should be eligible for conservation based on multiple ecological and ethical considerations. The framework may be applied to any hybrid and is flexible in that it accommodates context-specific management by allowing different options if a hybrid is a threat to or could benefit conservation goals. The framework can inform policy makers and conservationists in decision-making processes regarding hybrid conservation by providing a systematic set of decision criteria and guidance on additional criteria to be considered in cases of uncertainty, and it fills a policy gap that limits current hybrid management.
   Un Marco de Referencia para Guiar a la Conservacion de Hibridos de Especies con base en Consideraciones Eticas y Ecologicas Jackiw et al. 12526 Los hibridos de especies han sido subvalorados en la conservacion durante mucho tiempo y frecuentemente se perciben como una amenaza para las especies puras. Recientemente, el valor de conservacion de los hibridos, especialmente aquellos de origen natural, ha ganado reconocimiento; sin embargo, la conservacion de hibridos sigue siendo controversial. Revisamos las politicas de manejo de hibridos de una variedad de organizaciones, principalmente en Canada y en los Estados Unidos, incluyendo las leyes, regulaciones y protocolos de manejo. Encontramos que muchas politicas se basan en consideraciones eticas y ecologicas limitadas y proporcionan pocas oportunidades para la conservacion de hibridos. En la mayoria de las politicas, los hibridos estan mal representados o se consideran una amenaza para los objetivos de conservacion. Esto es problematico porque nuestra revision de la literatura sobre la conservacion de hibridos identifico muchas consideraciones eticas y ecologicas relevantes para la determinacion del valor de conservacion de un hibrido, de las cuales todas son especificas para el manejo de contexto especifico. Tambien notamos una falta de discusion sobre las consideraciones eticas con respecto a la conservacion de hibridos. Con base en estos hallazgos, creamos un marco de referencia politico que resalta situaciones en las que los hibridos pueden ser elegibles para la conservacion en Canada y en los Estados Unidos. El marco de referencia consta de un arbol de decision que ayuda a los usuarios a determinar si un hibrido debe ser elegible para la conservacion con base en multiples consideraciones eticas y ecologicas. El marco de referencia puede aplicarse a cualquier hibrido y es flexible, ya que acomoda el manejo de contexto especifico al permitir diferentes opciones si un hibrido es una amenaza o si podria beneficiar a los objetivos de conservacion. El marco de referencia puede informar a quienes hacen las politicas y a los conservacionistas sobre los procesos de toma de decisiones con respecto a la conservacion de hibridos al proporcionar un conjunto sistematico de criterios de decision y una guia de los criterios adicionales a ser considerados en casos de incertidumbre y llena un vacio politico que limita al manejo actual de los hibridos.

AB Documenting and responding to species invasions requires innovative strategies that account for ecological and societal complexities. We used the recent expansion of Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles) throughout northern Gulf of Mexico coastal waters to evaluate the role of stakeholders in documenting and responding to a rapid marine invasion. We coupled an online survey of spearfishers and citizen science monitoring programs with traditional fishery-independent data sources and found that citizen observations documented lionfish 1-2 years earlier and more frequently than traditional reef fish monitoring programs. Citizen observations first documented lionfish in 2010 followed by rapid expansion and proliferation in 2011 (+367%). From the survey of spearfishers, we determined that diving experience and personal observations of lionfish strongly influenced perceived impacts, and these perceptions were powerful predictors of support for initiatives. Our study demonstrates the value of engaging citizens for assessing and responding to large-scale and time-sensitive conservation problems.

AB In recent years, litter decomposition studies have begun to move beyond the concept of mass loss to consider the fate of fresh and pyrolized decomposing plant material in the ecosystem. However, these concepts have yet to be incorporated into conceptual models of litter decomposition. Understanding how fresh and pyrolized plant litter chemical traits control the partitioning of mass loss to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leaching and respiration to CO2 would help to inform models of litter-soil-atmosphere carbon (C) cycling. To test these controls, we incubated five fresh and one pyrolized leaf litters with differing chemistry and measured DOC and CO2 fluxes as well as changes in substrate and dissolved organic matter (DOM) chemistry over time using Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and wet chemistry. We found that the amount of hot water extractable C was a strong predictor of initial DOC leaching, while the lignocellulose index [Lignin/(Lignin + alpha-Cellulose)] was a strong inverse predictor of later stage DOC:CO2 partitioning. Changes in substrate and DOM chemistry indicated a progression of substrate availability for leaching: from soluble plant components, to partially decomposed cellulose and lignin, to microbial products. Based on these results we developed a new conceptual model that demonstrates how chemical traits of fresh and pyrolyzed plant litter can be used to predict the fate of aboveground organic matter decomposition and form a better linkage between aboveground decomposition and terrestrial ecosystem C cycling.

AB The climatic conditions of mountain habitats are greatly influenced by topography. Large differences in microclimate occur with small changes in elevation, and this complex interaction is an important determinant of mountain plant distributions. In spite of this, elevation is not often considered as a relevant predictor in species distribution models (SDMs) for mountain plants. Here, we evaluated the importance of including elevation as a predictor in SDMs for mountain plant species. We generated two sets of SDMs for each of 73 plant species that occur in the Pacific Northwest of North America; one set of models included elevation as a predictor variable and the other set did not. AUC scores indicated that omitting elevation as a predictor resulted in a negligible reduction of model performance. However, further analysis revealed that the omission of elevation resulted in large over-predictions of species' niche breadths this effect was most pronounced for species that occupy the highest elevations. In addition, the inclusion of elevation as a predictor constrained the effects of other predictors that superficially affected the outcome of the models generated without elevation. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of elevation as a predictor variable improves the quality of SDMs for high-elevation plant species. Because of the negligible AUC score penalty for over-predicting niche breadth, our results support the notion that AUC scores alone should not be used as a measure of model quality. More generally, our results illustrate the importance of selecting biologically relevant predictor variables when constructing SDMs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the yeast used widely for beer, bread, cider, and wine production, is the most resourceful eukaryotic model used for genetic engineering. A typical concern about using engineered yeasts for food production might be negative consumer perception of genetically modified organisms. However, we believe the true pitfall of using genetically modified yeasts is their limited capacity to either refine or improve the sensory properties of fermented foods under real production conditions. Alternatively, yeast diversity screening to improve the aroma and flavors could offer groundbreaking opportunities in food biotechnology. We propose a 'Yeast Flavor Diversity Screening' strategy which integrates knowledge from sensory analysis and natural whole-genome evolution with information about flavor metabolic networks and their regulation.

AB Theory predicts that the postindustrial rise in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere (c(a)) should enhance tree growth either through a direct fertilization effect or indirectly by improving water use efficiency in dry areas. However, this hypothesis has received little support in cold-limited and subalpine forests where positive growth responses to either rising c(a) or warmer temperatures are still under debate. In this study, we address this issue by analyzing an extensive dendrochronological network of high-elevation Pinus uncinata forests in Spain (28 sites, 544 trees) encompassing the whole biogeographical extent of the species. We determine if the basal area increment (BAI) trends are linked to climate warming and increased c(a) by focusing on region- and age-dependent responses. The largest improvement in BAI over the past six centuries occurred during the last 150years affecting young trees and being driven by recent warming. Indeed, most studied regions and age classes presented BAI patterns mainly controlled by temperature trends, while growing-season precipitation was only relevant in the driest sites. Growth enhancement was linked to rising c(a) in mature (151-300year-old trees) and old-mature trees (301-450year-old trees) from the wettest sites only. This finding implies that any potential fertilization effect of elevated c(a) on forest growth is contingent on tree features that vary with ontogeny and it depends on site conditions (for instance water availability). Furthermore, we found widespread growth decline in drought-prone sites probably indicating that the rise in c(a) did not compensate for the reduction in water availability. Thus, warming-triggered drought stress may become a more important direct driver of growth than rising c(a) in similar subalpine forests. We argue that broad approaches in biogeographical and temporal terms are required to adequately evaluate any effect of rising c(a) on forest growth.

AB The challenge for conservation managers is to ensure the long-term sustainability of an area by preserving its ecological and cultural values against predictable and unpredictable natural and human pressures and, at the same time, ensuring the fruition of the environmental resources. This research proposes an integrated use of GIS-based Decision Support System (DSS) with a conceptual linear model of vulnerability to foster conservation strategies in protected areas, by identifying: (1) the most vulnerable areas, requiring specific protection measures to enhance the natural features, as well as the prevention of natural and human risks; (2) the most effective management interventions to reduce system vulnerability to fire. The development of such a tool has been tested on the natural protected area of Torre Guaceto, through the selection of suitable indicators that enable discrimination among different levels of sensitivity and pressures, in order to provide evidence of its potential utility for the management of protected areas and the mitigation of their vulnerabilities. The results highlight that the most vulnerable areas are represented by contiguous patches of wetlands, the load of fuel at wetlands-agricultural lands interface areas, and the small patches of century-old forests, Mediterranean maquis and coastal dunes. On the basis of the results it is desirable that future researches on vulnerability should not only consider the "of what to what", but also consider "for who, where and when" with a focus on the spatial and temporal scale dimensions of vulnerability.
