AB An important issue in assessing microplastics is whether this newly emerging type of pollution affects freshwater invertebrates. This study was designed to examine the interactions between the amphipod Gammarus fossarum and two types of microplastics. To determine the ingestion and egestion of polyamide (PA) fibres (500 x 20 mu m), amphipods were exposed to four concentrations (100, 540, 2680, 13,380 PA fibres cm(-2) base area of glass beakers) and four exposure times (0.5, 2, 8, 32 h) as well as four post-exposure times (1, 2, 4, 16 h). We demonstrate a positive correlation between concentration and ingestion of PA fibres. Fibres were found in the gut after 0.5 h of exposure. Egestion was rapid and the digestive tract was empty 16 h after exposure ended. To investigate whether polystyrene (PS) beads (1.6 mu m) can be taken up in the epithelial cells of the gut and the midgut glands, four concentrations (500, 2500, 12,500, 60,000 PS beads mL(-1)) were tested. Cryosections exhibited fluorescent PS beads only within the gut lumen. In a 28-day feeding experiment with both, fibres and beads, we studied the amphipod's feeding rate, assimilation efficiency and wet weight change. The exposure to PA fibres (2680 PA fibres cm(-2) base area of glass beakers) significantly reduced the assimilation efficiency of the animals. While both tested polymer types are ingested and egested, PA fibres can impair the health and ecological functions of freshwater amphipods under continuous exposure.

AB Microbial habitats that contain an excess of carbohydrate in the form of sugar are widespread in the microbial biosphere. Depending on the type of sugar, prevailing water activity and other substances present, sugar-rich environments can be highly dynamic or relatively stable, osmotically stressful, and/or destabilizing for macromolecular systems, and can thereby strongly impact the microbial ecology. Here, we review the microbiology of different high-sugar habitats, including their microbial diversity and physicochemical parameters, which act to impact microbial community assembly and constrain the ecosystem. Saturated sugar beet juice and floral nectar are used as case studies to explore the differences between the microbial ecologies of low and higher water-activity habitats respectively. Nectar is a paradigm of an open, dynamic and biodiverse habitat populated by many microbial taxa, often yeasts and bacteria such as, amongst many others, Metschnikowia spp. and Acinetobacter spp., respectively. By contrast, thick juice is a relatively stable, species-poor habitat and is typically dominated by a single, xerotolerant bacterium (Tetragenococcus halophilus). A number of high-sugar habitats contain chaotropic solutes (e.g. ethyl acetate, phenols, ethanol, fructose and glycerol) and hydrophobic stressors (e.g. ethyl octanoate, hexane, octanol and isoamyl acetate), all of which can induce chaotropicity-mediated stresses that inhibit or prevent multiplication of microbes. Additionally, temperature, pH, nutrition, microbial dispersion and habitat history can determine or constrain the microbiology of high-sugar milieux. Findings are discussed in relation to a number of unanswered scientific questions.

AB Each year the Mythimna separate (Walker), undertakes a seasonal, long-distance, multigeneration roundtrip migration between southern and northern China. Despite its regularity, the decision to migrate is facultative, and is controlled by environmental, physiological, hormonal, genetic, and molecular factors. Migrants take off on days 1 or 2 after eclosion, although the preoviposition period lasts approximate to 7 d. The trade-offs among the competing physiological demands of migration and reproduction are coordinated in M. separata by the "oogenesis-flight syndrome." Larvae that experience temperatures above or below certain thresholds accompanied by appropriate humidity, short photoperiod, poor nutrition, and moderate density tend to develop into migrants. However, there is a short window of sensitivity within 24 h after adult eclosion when migrants can be induced to switch to reproductive residents if they encounter extreme environmental factors including starvation, low temperature and long photoperiod. Juvenile hormone (JH) titer is low before migration but high titers are associated with termination of migratory behavior and the switch to reproduction. Early release of JH by the corpora allata in environmentally stressed 1-d old adults, otherwise destined by larval conditions to be migrants, switches them to residents. Offspring inherit parental additive genetic effects governing migratory behavior. However, they also retain flexibility in expression of both flight and reproductive life history traits. The insect neuropeptide, allatotropin, which activates corpora allata to synthesize JH, controls adult flight and reproduction. Future research directions to better understand regulation of migration in this species are discussed.

AB P>1. Maintenance of ecological integrity and biodiversity must be based on well-grounded principles of disturbance ecology. However, non-equilibrium aspects of ecosystems, such as unpredictability, instability and stochasticity due to various natural disturbances, have not been satisfactorily integrated into practical application. Failure to acknowledge the dynamic nature of systems will inevitably lead to unexpected changes and unachieved conservation goals.
   2. This review discusses non-equilibrium ecology in terms of natural disturbances and the conservation and management of terrestrial ecosystems and landscapes.
   3. Several key components, which require further ecological consideration, are specifically discussed. These include the hierarchical disturbance regime, disturbance legacy, multiple post-disturbance pathways, climate instability, spatial and temporal variability, and resilience.
   4. Natural disturbance regimes are complex and difficult to define. This is because some disturbances can be nested, and they interact with other qualitatively and quantitatively different disturbances, constituting a hierarchy of natural disturbances. Large temporal and spatial perspectives are therefore required to incorporate the hierarchical context of natural disturbance regimes into regional management plans.
   5. Conservation managers may often seek some kind of dynamic equilibrium based on protection of species and seral stages from extinction. However, because climate instability interrupts any shift toward an equilibrium, most terrestrial vegetation systems are inherently prone to large environmental changes and diverse disturbances, and thus, are dynamic and non-equilibrating.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Resiliency is the key to conserving ecological integrity via the ability to cope with inevitable changes. As long as ecosystems are resilient and disturbances are natural, we should not impede natural shifts in disturbance regimes and resultant ecosystem changes, even if changes are abrupt and unpredictable and thus have large consequences. If ecological resilience has already been eroded by humans, it is important that resilience should be enhanced by restoring keystone features of vegetation systems to prevent disturbance-induced undesirable ecosystem degradation.

AB Current climate change is a major threat to biodiversity. Species unable to adapt or move will face local or global extinction and this is more likely to happen to species with narrow climatic and habitat requirements and limited dispersal abilities, such as amphibians and reptiles. Biodiversity losses are likely to be greatest in global biodiversity hotspots where climate change is fast, such as the Iberian Peninsula. Here we assess the impact of climate change on 37 endemic and nearly endemic herptiles of the Iberian Peninsula by predicting species distributions for three different times into the future (2020, 2050 and 2080) using an ensemble of bioclimatic models and different combinations of species dispersal ability, emission levels and global circulation models. Our results show that species with Atlantic affinities that occur mainly in the North-western Iberian Peninsula have severely reduced future distributions. Up to 13 species may lose their entire potential distribution by 2080. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the most critical period for the majority of these species will be the next decade. While there is considerable variability between the scenarios, we believe that our results provide a robust relative evaluation of climate change impacts among different species. Future evaluation of the vulnerability of individual species to climate change should account for their adaptive capacity to climate change, including factors such as physiological climate tolerance, geographical range size, local abundance, life cycle, behavioural and phenological adaptability, evolutionary potential and dispersal ability.

AB Forests are experiencing an environment that changes much faster than during the past several hundred years. In addition, the abiotic factors determining forest dynamics vary depending on its location. Forest modeling thus faces the new challenge of supporting forest management in the context of environmental change. This review focuses on three types of models that are used in forest management: empirical (EM), process-based (PBM) and hybrid models. Recent approaches may lead to the applicability of empirical models under changing environmental conditions, such as (i) the dynamic state-space approach, or (ii) the development of productivity-environment relationships. Twenty-five process-based models in use in Europe were analyzed in terms of their structure, inputs and outputs having in mind a forest management perspective. Two paths for hybrid modeling were distinguished: (i) coupling of EMs and PBMs by developing signal-transfer environment-productivity functions; (ii) hybrid models with causal structure including both empirical and mechanistic components. Several gaps of knowledge were identified for the three types of models reviewed.
   The strengths and weaknesses of the three model types differ and all are likely to remain in use. There is a trade-off between how little data the models need for calibration and simulation purposes, and the variety of input-output relationships that they can quantify. PBMs are the most versatile, with a wide range of environmental conditions and output variables they can account for. However, PBMs require more data making them less applicable whenever data for calibration are scarce. EMs, on the other hand, are easier to run as they require much less prior information, but the aggregated representation of environmental effects makes them less reliable in the context of environmental changes. The different disadvantages of PBMs and EMs suggest that hybrid models may be a good compromise, but a more extensive testing of these models in practice is required.

AB Models for detecting the effect of adaptation on population genomic diversity are often predicated on a single newly arisen mutation sweeping rapidly to fixation. However, a population can also adapt to a new environment by multiple mutations of similar phenotypic effect that arise in parallel, at the same locus or different loci. These mutations can each quickly reach intermediate frequency, preventing any single one from rapidly sweeping to fixation globally, leading to a "soft'' sweep in the population. Here we study various models of parallel mutation in a continuous, geographically spread population adapting to a global selection pressure. The slow geographic spread of a selected allele due to limited dispersal can allow other selected alleles to arise and start to spread elsewhere in the species range. When these different selected alleles meet, their spread can slow dramatically and so initially form a geographic patchwork, a random tessellation, which could be mistaken for a signal of local adaptation. This spatial tessellation will dissipate over time due to mixing by migration, leaving a set of partial sweeps within the global population. We show that the spatial tessellation initially formed by mutational types is closely connected to Poisson process models of crystallization, which we extend. We find that the probability of parallel mutation and the spatial scale on which parallel mutation occurs are captured by a single compound parameter, a characteristic length, which reflects the expected distance a spreading allele travels before it encounters a different spreading allele. This characteristic length depends on the mutation rate, the dispersal parameter, the effective local density of individuals, and to a much lesser extent the strength of selection. While our knowledge of these parameters is poor, we argue that even in widely dispersing species, such parallel geographic sweeps may be surprisingly common. Thus, we predict that as more data become available, many more examples of intraspecies parallel adaptation will be uncovered.

AB P>1. A number of recent studies have demonstrated that plant traits play a crucial role in determining the success or failure of species in a given environment. However, whether traits play a role in determining species' abundance and rarity among the co-occurring species within a community remains an unresolved question.
   2. To address this, we analysed the abundance of California coastal woody plant species at landscape and local scales in relation to 11 leaf, wood and seed traits.
   3. At the landscape scale, we found no significant relationship between traits and abundance. In contrast, at the local scale we found significant relationships between abundance and four traits: specific leaf area (SLA), height, lumen fraction and wood density. For SLA and height, the relationship was linear; for lumen fraction, it was quadratic. For wood density, the direction of the trait-abundance relationship was dependant on the abiotic context, that is, it shifted across a gradient in soil water content.
   4.Synthesis. Understanding the connections between traits and abundance is important for two reasons. First, there is an ongoing debate about the degree to which commonness and rarity are the result of drift among ecologically equivalent species or niche processes. These results suggest that there are non-random, trait-based processes affecting abundance and rarity. Secondly, species' traits have been shown to have a strong effect on photosynthesis and decomposition rates, mediated by the abundance of the species. The connections between traits and abundance presented here are crucial for scaling from measurements of species' traits to ecosystem-level processes.

AB Landscape fragmentation has often been seen as an only ecological problem. However, fragmentation also has a societal perspective, namely, in how humans perceive landscape fragmentation and in how landscape fragmentation potentially influences human well-being. These latter aspects have rarely been addressed so far. The inter-relationship of ecological and human dimensions of landscape fragmentation becomes especially evident when looking at the landscape where most people in industrial countries live, namely in suburban and urban areas. In these areas, landscape planners and environmental managers are confronted with the problem that landscapes should fullfil various functions, often with conflicting goals, e.g. nature reserves to enhance species richness vs. recreational areas for city-dwellers. We reviewed the ecological and sociological literature relevant for fragmentation in suburban and urban landscapes. In an interdisciplinary approach, we evaluated whether there are similarities and dissimilarities between the ecological and the human aspects of landscape fragmentation. We found important similarities. An example is that for both, humans and biodiversity, the loss of semi-natural areas has more drastic effects than the fragmentation of these areas per se. However, there are also relevant differences. We concluded that in densely populated landscapes a shift from responsive planning to an intentional design of environments is therefore needed.

AB Theory predicts that reproductive isolation may be due to intrinsic genetic incompatibilities or extrinsic ecological factors. Therefore, an understanding of the genetic basis of isolation may require analyses of evolutionary processes in situ to include environmental factors. Here we study genetic isolation between populations of sculpins (Cottus) at 168 microsatellites. Genomic clines were fit using 480 individuals sampled across independent natural hybrid zones that have formed between one invading species and two separate populations of a resident species. Our analysis tests for deviations from neutral patterns of introgression at individual loci based on expectations given genome-wide admixture. Roughly 51% of the loci analysed displayed significant deviations. An overall deficit of interspecific heterozygotes in 26% and 21% of the loci suggests that widespread underdominance drives genomic isolation. At the same time, selection promotes introgression of almost 30% of the markers, which implies that hybridization may increase the fitness of admixed individuals. Cases of overdominance or epistatic interactions were relatively rare. Despite the similarity of the two hybrid zones in their overall genomic composition, patterns observed at individual loci show little correlation between zones and many fit different genotypic models of fitness. At this point, it remains difficult to determine whether these results are due to differences in external selection pressures or cryptic genetic differentiation of distinct parental populations. In the future, data from mapped genetic markers and on variation of ecological factors will provide additional insights into the contribution of these factors to variation in the evolutionary consequences of hybridization.

AB The in dividual-based (aka agent-based) approach is now well established in ecological modeling. Traditionally, most applications have been to organisms at higher trophic levels, where the importance of population heterogeneity (intra-population variability), complete life cycles and behavior adapted to internal and external conditions has been recognized for some time, However, advances in molecular biology and biochemistry have brought about an increase in the application of individual-based modeling (IBM) to microbes as well. This literature review summarizes 46 IBM papers for bacteria in wastewater treatment plants, phytoplankton in ocean and inland waters, bacteria in biofilms, bacteria in food and other environs, and "digital organisms" and "domesticated computer viruses" in silico. The use of IBM in these applications was motivated by population heterogeneity (45%), emergence (24%), absence of a continuum (5%), and other unknown reasons (26%). In general, the challenges and concepts of IBM modeling for microbes and higher trophic levels are similar. However, there are differences in the microbe population dynamics and their environment that create somewhat different challenges, which have led to somewhat different modeling concepts. Several topics are discussed, including producing, maintaining and changing population heterogeneity (different life histories, internal variability, positive feedback, inter-generation memory), dealing with very large numbers of individuals (different up-scaling methods, including representative space vs. super-individual, number vs. biomass based, discrete vs. continuous kinetics, various agent accounting methods), handling space, simulating interactions with the extracellular environment (hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian approach), modeling agent-agent interaction (self-shading, predation, shoving) and passive transport (random walk with spatially variable diffusivity, well-mixed reactors). overall, the literature indicates that the application of IBM to microbes is developing into a mature field. However, several challenges remain, including simulating various types of agent-agent interactions (formation and function of colonies or filaments, sexual reproduction) and even smaller individuals (viruses, genes). Further increases in intracellular detail and complexity in microbe IBMs may be considered the combination of systems biology and systems ecology, or the new field of systems bioecology (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB We investigated whether the inclusion of topographical heterogeneity in bioclimatic envelope models would significantly alter predictions of climate change - induced broad-scale butterfly species range size changes in Europe. Using generalized additive models, and data on current climate and species distributions and two different climate scenarios (HadCM3A2 and HadCM3B2) for the period 2051-2080, we developed predictions of the currently suitable area and potential range size changes of 100 European butterfly species. The inclusion of elevation range increased the predictive accuracy of climate-only models for 86 of the 100 species. The differences in projected future distributions were most notable in mountainous areas, where the climate-topography models projected only ca. half of the species losses than the climate-only models. By contrast, climate-topography models estimated double the losses of species than climate-only models in the flatlands regions. Our findings suggest that disregarding topographical heterogeneity may cause a significant source of error in broad-scale bioclimatic modelling. Mountainous regions are likely to be even more important for future conservation of species than had until now been predicted, based on bioclimatic envelope models that did not take an explicit account of elevational range of grid squares.

AB 1. Interspecific niche differences have long been identified as a major explanation for the occurrence of species-rich communities. However, much fieldwork studying variation in local species richness has focused upon physical habitat attributes or regional factors, such as the size of the regional species pool.
   2. We applied indices of functional diversity and niche overlap to data on the species niche to examine the importance of interspecific niche differentiation for species richness in French lake fish communities. We combined this information with environmental data to test generalizations of the physiological tolerance and niche specialization hypotheses for species-energy relationships.
   3. We found evidence for a largely non-saturating relationship (relative to random expectation) between species richness and functional evenness (evenness of spacing between species in niche space), while functional richness (volume of niche space occupied) peaked at moderate levels of species richness and niche overlap showed an initial decrease followed by saturation. This suggests that increased niche specialization may have allowed species to coexist in the most species-rich communities.
   4. We tested for evidence that increased temperature, local habitat area, local habitat diversity and immigration affected species richness via increased niche specialization. Temperature explained by far the largest amount of variation in species richness, functional diversity and niche overlap. These results, combined with the largely non-saturating species richness-functional evenness relationship, suggest that increased temperature may have permitted increased species richness by allowing increased niche specialization.
   5. These results emphasize the importance of niche differences for species coexistence in species-rich communities, and indicate that the conservation of functional diversity may be vital for the maintenance of species diversity in biological communities. Our approach may be applied readily to many types of community, and at any scale, thus providing a flexible means of testing niche-based hypotheses for species richness gradients.

AB The use of a DNA-based identification system (DNA barcoding) founded on the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) was investigated for updating the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulatory Fish Encyclopedia (RFE; http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/similar to frf/rfe0.html). The RFE is a compilation of data used to identify fish species. It was compiled to help regulators identify species substitution that could result in potential adverse health consequences or could be a source of economic fraud. For each of many aquatic species commonly sold in the United States, the RFE includes high-resolution photographs of whole fish and their marketed product forms and species-specific biochemical patterns for authenticated fish species. These patterns currently include data from isoelectric focusing studies. In this article, we describe the generation of DNA barcodes for 172 individual authenticated fish representing 72 species from 27 families contained in the RFE. These barcode sequences can be used as an additional identification resource. In a blind study, 60 unknown fish muscle samples were barcoded, and the results were compared with the RFE barcode reference library. All 60 samples were correctly identified to species based on the barcoding data. Our study indicates that DNA barcoding can be a powerful tool for species identification and has broad potential applications.

AB 1. Shade tolerance, defined as the ability to survive and grow under low light, varies markedly among tree species. However, the role of low-light growth responses in determining shade tolerance is unclear, as are the effects of non-light resources such as soil nutrients.
   2. A conceptually simple field measure of shade tolerance is the whole-plant light compensation point (WPLCP), evaluated as the x-intercept of the relationship between growth and incident light integrated over a long time interval. Here we compare WPLCP for growth and survivorship of saplings of Bornean tree species differing in shade tolerance, and evaluate the importance of various physiological and morphological traits in predicting WPLCP. We also examine both phenotypic and evolved differences in WPLCP between tree saplings growing on two distinct soil types at Sepilok Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysia.
   3. Growth-based estimates of WPLCP showed essentially a 1 : 1 correspondence to threshold light levels for survivorship. At higher light, more light-demanding species showed higher growth, resulting in a steeper slope of the relationship between relative growth rate (RGR) and light availability than in more shade-tolerant species. This resulted in significant crossovers in the RGR-light relationship among species.
   4. Dark respiration (R-d) was the single best predictor of WPLCP; other leaf traits such as leaf nitrogen and photosynthetic capacity were correlated with, but excluded as predictors of, WPLCP in multiple regression analyses.
   5. Although soil type had no consistent phenotypic effect on WPLCP, evolved responses among species were pronounced: species associated with the nutrient-poor, drought-prone, sandstone-derived soils had higher WPLCP values than alluvial soil specialists in phylogenetically controlled comparisons.
   6. Our results indicate that minimum light levels for growth do not diverge from those for survivorship, and do not support the view that low-light survivorship solely determines shade tolerance. Our analyses also suggest that R-d is the strongest determinant of whole-plant light requirements in tropical tree saplings, and thus may be an easily measured surrogate of WPLCP and shade tolerance.
   7. Prediction of tree species resource requirements is crucial for understanding forest dynamics and promoting ecology-based forest management and restoration, particularly in diverse tropical forests where data on the resource requirements of most species are not available. Easily measured surrogates of resource requirements (e.g. R-d as a predictor of shade tolerance) will contribute to this goal, as will an improved understanding of the interactive effects of multiple resources on tree performance.

AB Ecological and genetic studies of marine turtles generally support the hypothesis of natal homing, but leave open the question of the geographical scale of genetic exchange and the capacity of turtles to shift breeding sites. Here we combine analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation and recapture data to assess the geographical scale of individual breeding populations and the distribution of such populations through Australasia. We conducted multiscale assessments of mtDNA variation among 714 samples from 27 green turtle rookeries and of adult female dispersal among nesting sites in eastern Australia. Many of these rookeries are on shelves that were flooded by rising sea levels less than 10 000 years (c. 450 generations) ago. Analyses of sequence variation among the mtDNA control region revealed 25 haplotypes, and their frequency distributions indicated 17 genetically distinct breeding stocks (Management Units) consisting either of individual rookeries or groups of rookeries in general that are separated by more than 500 km. The population structure inferred from mtDNA was consistent with the scale of movements observed in long-term mark-recapture studies of east Australian rookeries. Phylogenetic analysis of the haplotypes revealed five clades with significant partitioning of sequence diversity (Phi = 68.4) between Pacific Ocean and Southeast Asian/Indian Ocean rookeries. Isolation by distance was indicated for rookeries separated by up to 2000 km but explained only 12% of the genetic structure. The emerging general picture is one of dynamic population structure influenced by the capacity of females to relocate among proximal breeding sites, although this may be conditional on large population sizes as existed historically across this region.

AB A number of biological approaches are commonly used to assess the ecological integrity of stream ecosystems. Recently, it is becoming increasingly common to use multiple organism groups in bioassessment. Advocates of the multiple organism approach argue that the use of different organism groups should strengthen inference-based models and ultimately result in lower assessment error, while opponents argue that organism groups often respond similarly to stress implying a high degree of redundancy. Using fish, macroinvertebrate, macrophyte and benthic diatom data, site-specific parameters (e.g., water chemistry and substratum) and catchment variables from European mountain (n = 77) and lowland (n = 85) streams we evaluated the discriminatory power and uncertainty associated with the use of a number of biological metrics commonly used in stream assessment. The primary environmental gradient for both streams types was land use and nutrient enrichment. Secondary and tertiary gradients were related to habitat quality or alterations in hydromorphology. Benthic diatom and macroinvertebrate metrics showed high discriminatory power (R-2 values often > 0.50) and low error (< 30%) with the primary (nutrient) gradient, while both fish and macrophyte metrics performed relatively poorly. Conversely, both fish and macrophyte metrics showed higher response (high coefficients of determination) than either benthic diatom or macroinvertebrate metrics to the second (e.g., alteration in habitat/hydromorphology) gradient. However, the discriminatory power and error associated with individual metrics varied markedly, indicating that caution should be exercised when selecting the 'best' organism group or metric to monitor stress.

AB The availability of suitable climate space across Europe for the distributions of 47 species chosen to encompass a range of taxa (including plants, insects, birds and mammals) and to reflect dominant and threatened species from 10 habitats was modelled for the current climate and three climate change scenarios using the SPECIES neural network model. The present European distribution was satisfactorily simulated for 45 species, which showed good statistics of fit between observed species' distributions and derived models. The predicted responses to climate change demonstrate that the distribution of many species in Europe may be affected by climate change, but that the effects are likely to differ between species. The general pattern is of a south-west to north-east shift in suitable climate space, with gains balancing losses for many species. Based on the total change in potential climate space in Europe, the species most sensitive to climate change were Rubus chamaemorus (Cloudberry; negatively affected) and Genista acanthoclada (Hairy greenweed; positively affected). This disparity in species' response has important implications for EU biodiversity policy as the significance of different countries changes in terms of their future contribution to the conservation of habitats and species.

AB Ranunculus is a large genus with a worldwide distribution. Phylogenetic analyses of c. 200 species of Ranunculus s.l. based on sequences of the nrITS using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference yielded high congruence with previous cpDNA restriction site analyses, but strongly contradict previous classifications. A large core clade including Ranunculus subg. Ranunculus, subg. Batrachium, subg. Crymodes p.p., Ceratocephala, Myosurus, and Aphanostemma is separated from R. subg. Ficaria, subg. Pallasiantha, subg. Coptidium, subg. Crymodes p.p., Halerpestes, Peltocalathos, Callianthemoides, and Arcteranthis. Within the core clade, 19 clades can be described with morphological and karyological features. Several sections are not monophyletic. Parallel evolution of morphological characters in adaptation to climatic conditions may be a reason for incongruence of molecular data and morphology-based classifications. In some mountainous regions, groups of closely related species may have originated from adaptive radiation and rapid speciation. Split decomposition analysis indicated complex patterns of relationship and suggested hybridization in the apomictic R. auricomus complex, R. subg. Batrachium, and the white-flowering European alpines. The evolutionary success of the genus might be due to a combination of morphological plasticity and adaptations, hybridization and polyploidy as important factors for regional diversification, and a broad range of reproductive strategies.

AB This study compares the continental phylogeographic patterns of two wild European species linked by a host-parasite relationship: the field mouse Apodemus sylvaticus and one of its specific parasites, the nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus. A total of 740 base pairs (bp) of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene were sequenced in 122 specimens of H.polygyrus and compared with 94 cyt b gene sequences (974bp) previously acquired for A. sylvaticus. The results reveal partial spatial and temporal congruences in the differentiation of both species' lineages: the parasite and its host present three similar genetic and geographical lineages, i.e. Western European, Italian and Sicilian, and both species recolonized northwestern Europe from the Iberian refuge at the end of the Pleistocene. However, H. polygyrus presents three particular differentiation events. The relative rate of molecular evolution of the cyt b gene was estimated to be 1.5-fold higher in the parasite than in its host. Therefore, the use of H. polygyrus as a biological magnifying glass is discussed as this parasite may highlight previously undetected historical events of its host. The results show how incorporating phylogeographic information of an obligate associate can help to better understand the phylogeographic pattern of its host.

AB The allocation into T-cell-mediated immunocompetence was experimentally increased in 68 out of 139 nestlings by supplementary feeding methionine to half of the nestlings in 15 blue tit nests. Methionine-supplemented nestlings had an increased T-cell-mediated immunocompetence, but a reduced growth compared with control siblings. Nestlings that had low initial weights and nestlings that were supplemented with methionine had an increased mortality risk. The investment that nestling blue tits make in immunocompetence appears to be tightly controlled by survival costs paid through a trade-off between immunocompetence and growth.

AB The present study provides an analysis of soil, vegetation types as well as structure and species distribution in 19 sites in El-Qaa plain along the Gulf of Suez (south Sinai, Egypt), and focuses on the environmental factors that control the species distribution. A total of 203 species belonging to 39 families of the vascular plants are recorded. Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Chenopodiaceae and Poaceae are the largest families. Grasses constitute only 9% of the recorded species, while the woody perennials (shrubs and sub-shrubs) are highly dominated (46%). Therophytes and chamaephytes are the most frequent, denoting a typical desert lifeform spectrum. Floristic composition in the different geomorphologic landscape units showed differences in species richness. The highest mean species richness of 19.7 +/- 1.7 is recorded in the wadi channels. The lowest species richness values are recorded in the coastal shore and playas (6.0 +/- 1.4) and in the alluvial fans (mean of 8.4 +/- 1.6 species). Chorological analysis revealed that 46% of the studied species are uniregional, being native to the Saharo-Arabian region. On the other hand, about 50% of the recorded species are biregional and pluritegional, extending their distribution all over the Saharo-Arabian, Sudano-Zambezian, Irano-Turanian and Mediterranean regions. Classification of the vegetation is analysed using two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) techniques resulted in the recognition of five vegetation groups, each of definite vegetation and soil characters, and could be linked to a specific geomorphologic unit. Capparis spinosa var. spinosa occupied the terraces, Cornulaca monacantha, Convolvulus lanatus and Deverra tortuosa inhabited the alluvial plains, Launaea nudicaulis and Artemisia judaica characterized the wadi channels, Acacia tortilis subsp. raddiana and Leptadenia pyrotechnica characterized the alluvial fans and Tamarix nilotica, Zygophyllum album and Nitraria retusa on the playas and the coastal shore. Ordination techniques as detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) are used to examine the relationship between the vegetation and studied soil parameters. Nine soil variables are included: electrical conductivity, pH, calcium carbonate, gypsum, organic matter, gravel, fine soil fractions and soil saturation percentage. Analysis with DCA gave results similar to CCA, suggesting that there is a relatively high correspondence between vegetation and soil factors. DCA axis I showed significant positive correlation with CaCO3, pH, soil saturation and organic matter, and interpreted as a calcium carbonate-soil saturation gradient. DCA axis 2 showed significant correlation with pH, gypsum and electric conductivity, and interpreted as an electric conductivity-gypsum gradient. Application of CCA indicated that soil surface sediment, CaCO3, soil saturation, pH and organic matter are the main operating edaphic gradients in the area. These gradients are related closely to the first three canonical axes, and accounted for 67% of the species-environment relationship among the sites. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB 1 Relatively few studies have looked for patterns of invasion by non-native species within communities. We tested the hypotheses that: (i) some types of microhabitats within a community are more invasible than others; (ii) microhabitat types that differ in invasion also differ in resource availability; and (iii) invasibility is mediated by effects of these resources on competition between native and non-native species.
   2 To test the first two hypotheses, we measured plant cover and soils in a coastal grassland in northern California. Consistent with these hypotheses, cover of non-native plants was consistently high where nitrogen-fixing shrubs had recently grown, in the bottoms and sides of gullies and on deep soils, and these microhabitats tended to have relatively high nitrogen or water availability.
   3 Cover and number of native species tended to be lower where cover of non-native species was higher, indicating that non-native species as a group negatively affected native species. However, the number of non-native species also tended to be lower where the total cover of non-natives was higher. This suggests that a few non-native species excluded natives and other non-natives alike.
   4 To test the third hypothesis, we grew a common non-native, the annual grass Lolium multiflorum , and a common native, the perennial grass Hordeum brachyantherum , at different levels of water and nitrogen. The relative competitive ability of the native was higher at lower nitrogen availability but not at lower water availability. When 10-week-old native plants were grown with non-native seedlings and nitrogen was relatively low, the native out-competed the non-native. However, the non-native out-competed the native at all resource levels when species were both grown as seedlings. Competition between native and non-native grasses in this system may thus help prevent invasion by non-natives in microhabitats where nitrogen availability is low, but invasion may be relatively irreversible.

AB 1. It is often assumed that, in migratory birds, males of highest phenotypic quality are the first to arrive at breeding grounds, as only males in good body condition can afford the costs of early arrival. Here it is argued that variation in how much an individual can gain from being early may sometimes override these patterns of condition dependence. Benefits from early arrival will depend on how good the chances of an individual are of successfully occupying and defending a high-quality territory. Other studies have shown that these chances depend on male resource-holding power (RHP) and on value asymmetries (VA), as resulting from prior ownership.
   2. Patterns of spring arrival were studied in a polygynous population of the dusky warbler Phylloscopus fuscatus Blyth, a species with high breeding-site tenacity. During the period of postnuptial moult, just before departure to winter quarters, about half of the males preoccupied and vigorously defended high-quality territories. Apparently these males enhanced their success in competition over these territories in the following breeding season by taking advantage of having prior ownership.
   3. Males with good chances of obtaining a high-quality territory (i.e. males that had occupied such territories before) were the first to arrive in spring, suggesting that high motivation drives early arrival. In contrast, there was no indication for male quality or body condition to affect arrival patterns.
   4. Interestingly, males of small body size, possibly reflecting low RHP, invested more in gaining prior ownership than did large males.
   5. The present study suggests that, in some species, individual variation in benefits rather than in costs resulting from early arrival determine which males are the first to arrive.

AB 1 A long-term experiment was established in 1990 in which seeds of 54 native species, not originally present at the site, were sown into a fertility x disturbance matrix established in unproductive limestone grassland at the Buxton Climate Change Impacts Laboratory (BCCIL). The objective was to examine the roles of productivity and disturbance as major factors controlling the invasibility of plant communities, and to identify the functional characteristics of successful invaders in response to different types of invasion opportunity. The results of the first 2 years of the study have already been published.
   2 After 2 years, invasion was strongly promoted by disturbance and less so by increased fertility. Three years later the cover of invaders had declined over most of the matrix, and the greatest cover of sown species was where the highest levels of fertility and disturbance coincided. However, no part of the fertility-disturbance matrix was immune to invasion and the area of the matrix occupied by each of the sown species that successfully established was unique. Abundance of invaders was reduced by low soil pH.
   3 The identity and distribution of the successful invaders changed as the early stages of invasion gave way to a later stage of consolidation. After 2 years regenerative traits (seed mass and germination characteristics) were the best predictors of success. After 5 years these traits were unrelated to success of the invaders, the most successful invaders were perennial grasses, and no single trait was a good predictor of invasiveness.
   4 Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that invasions are promoted by an increase in the availability of resources, either through addition of extra resources or a reduction in their use by the resident vegetation.

AB We studied dispersal movements in 12 enclosed, patchy populations of root voles (Microtus occonomus) during the breeding season. The habitat was manipulated experimentally so that there were four replicates of three types of habitat patch configuration: two large patches, six small isolated patches, and six small patches of which two patch triplets were connected by corridors. The total habitat area (1350 m(2)) and the distance to nearest neighboring patch (15 m) were the same in the three different configurations. The matrix area between the patches was kept open and uninhabitable for voles by weekly mowing. Dispersal was defined as shifts between patches. Movements across the open matrix habitat to traps located along the edge of the enclosures were also recorded.
   The frequency of shifts between patches was higher among small than among large patches. Corridors channeled dispersal between corridor-connected patches but did not enhance the frequency of shifts between patches at the population level. Dispersal was strongly density dependent, and most so for subadult animals. High-density patches had low emigration rates. Root voles immigrated onto patches with a smaller number of individuals, especially of their own sex and reproductive state, than were present in the patch they left. Thus most shifts between patches took place from patches with relatively low density to patches with even lower density. Small patches had higher spatiotemporal variability in density and demographic composition than large patches, and this probably caused the higher dispersal rate among small patches. Emigration and immigration contributed most to the demographic turnover in small patches. In particular, emigration was the main demographic parameter behind declining numbers and patch extinction in small patches with few individuals.
   Our study highlights the importance of taking patch-specific conditions such as patch size, demographic composition, and spatiotemporal demographic variability into account when studying dispersal rates. Moreover, the kind of density-dependent emigration-immigration dynamics found in our study does not match the common perception that dispersal works primarily to reduce extinction probabilities through rescue effects. In particular, the impact of emigration as a factor that may increase the extinction probability of small, isolated patches with few individuals needs to be considered in future studies.

AB With the ever-burgeoning spread of nonindigenous plants, often facilitated by human activities, it is imperative to conduct case studies of particular invasive plants and the sites they invade in order to develop effective and efficient habitat management strategies, Alliaria petiolata is a native European biennial mustard that has become a serious invasive pest in many North American forests. In order to better characterize habitat vulnerability to invasion by A. petiolata, we conducted an experiment to test the effects of environmental heterogeneity in the form of habitat, microenvironment, and small-scale litter disturbance on A. petiolata germination, survival, growth, and reproduction. Treatments consisted of two habitats (upland and lowland), two microenvironments (forest edge and forest interior), and three small-scale litter disturbance treatments (control, litter completely removed, and litter partially removed). Seeds were sown into plots in November, and plots were monitored for two years. Lowland plots had greater soil moisture and less litter per unit area than upland plots. In general, forest edge plots had greater understory cover and light availability and lower overstory cover than forest interior plots. Rosette survival, mature plant survival, plant biomass, height, and fruit and seed production were significantly greater for plants in the lowland compared with plants in the upland. Germination, rosette survival, mature plant survival, and reproduction were significantly greater in the forest edge plots when compared with interior plots. Litter disturbance had no significant effect on germination, growth, or reproduction. It is apparent that site colonization by A. petiolata was not dependent on the creation of patches of bare soil by disturbance, since plants were capable of invading sites with an intact litter layer. Alliaria petiolata growth and reproduction was greatest in plots with adequate soil moisture and increased light availability. Therefore, mesic forests with a more open canopy structure and forest trails or edges may be the most vulnerable to invasion and the most difficult sites to manage. Drier upland forest interiors, which were more resistant to invasion, may be more responsive to management techniques.

AB Recent floristic surveys of the French islands of the southern Indian Ocean (Ile de la Possession, in the Crozet archipelago, Iles Kerguelen and Ile Amsterdam) allow a comparison of the status of the alien vascular plant species in contrasted environmental and historical situations. Four points are established: (1) the current numbers of alien plant species are almost the same on Amsterdam (56) and La Possession (58), slightly higher on Kerguelen (68); (2) some of these species are common to two or three islands but a high number of them are confined to only one island (18, 28 and 28 on La Possession, Kerguelen and Amsterdam, respectively); (3) all the alien plant species are very common species in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere and belong to the European flora; and (4) a high proportion of the introduced species are present on the research stations or their surroundings (100, 72 and 84% on La Possession, Kerguelen and Amsterdam, respectively). These results are discussed in term of propagule pressure (mainly attributed to ships visiting these islands), invasibility of such ecosystems (in relation to climatic conditions and degree of disturbance by previous or current human activities such as sheep farming or waste deposits) and invasion potential of alien plant species.

AB Genetic variation at 59 protein coding loci (16 polymorphic) and 25 microsatellite loci was analysed for 11 indigenous south-east Asian goat populations, and the Australian feral population, to determine the magnitude of genetic differentiation and the genetic relationships among the populations. Significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were detected in one or more populations for eight of the nine protein loci with codominant alleles, and for microsatellites for all except the two Sri Lankan populations and for all but four loci. For both marker types, average inbreeding coefficients (F(IS)) were exceptionally high. Heterogeneity of deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the microsatellites showed no differences for among loci within populations as compared with among populations within loci. For protein loci, however, the former was higher, indicating selection affecting allele frequencies at some loci. The variance among protein loci was significantly higher than among microsatellite loci, further indicating selection at some protein loci. There was significant differentiation among populations for both protein and microsatellite loci, most likely reflecting the geography of south-east Asia, and the presumed spread of goats throughout the region. Phylogenies derived from pair-wise genetic distance estimates show some similar clustering for the microsatellite and protein based trees, but bootstrap support was generally low for both. A phylogeny based on the combined set of 38 protein and microsatellite loci showed better consistency with geography and higher bootstrap values. The genetic distance phylogeny and the Weitzman diversity tree derived from microsatellite data showed some identical clusters, and both identified the Ujung Pandang and Australia populations as contributing most to overall genetic diversity.

AB In most groups of organisms, the species richness decreases from the tropics to the poles. The mechanisms causing this latitudinal diversity gradient are still controversial. We present data from a comprehensive weighted meta-analysis on the strength of the latitudinal gradient in relation to body size. We sampled literature data on the correlation between species richness and latitude for a variety of organisms, ranging from trees to protozoa. In addition, own data on the presence of large-scale diversity patterns for diatoms were included, both for local and regional species richness. The strength of the latitudinal gradient was positively correlated to the size of the organisms. Strongest decreases of species richness to the poles was found for large organisms like trees and vertebrates, whereas meiofauna, protozoa and diatoms showed weak or no correlations between species richness and latitude. These results imply that latitudinal gradients are shaped by non-equilibrium (regional) processes and are persistent under conditions of dispersal limitation.

AB We developed and tested a combined foraging and bioenergetics model for predicting growth over the lifetime of drift-feeding brown trout. The foraging component estimates gross energy intake within a fish- and prey size-dependent semicircular foraging area that is perpendicular to the flow, with options for fish feeding across velocity differentials. The bioenergetics component predicts how energy is allocated to growth, reproduction, foraging costs,nd basal metabolism. The model can reveal the degree to which growth is limited by the density and size structure of invertebrate drift within the physiological constraints set by water temperature. We tested the model by predicting growth based on water temperature and on drift density and size structure data from postemergence to age 12, and we compared the predictions with observed size at age as determined from otoliths and scales for a New Zealand river brown trout population. The model produced realistically shaped growth curves in relation to the observed data, accurately predicting mean size at age over the lifetime of the trout, assuming 24-h maximum rations and including diurnal drift-foraging costs (predicted versus observed weight r(2) = 0.94; length r(2) = 0.97). The model predicted that, within a given water-temperature regime, growth is limited primarily by reproduction costs but also by increasing foraging costs as trout grow (a phenomenon that is associated with the increasing foraging time that is required in order to feed to satiation on small invertebrate drift prey). Invertebrate drift size structure significantly influenced predicted growth, especially maximum size, through its effect on foraging time. The model has potential in terms of the exploration of growth-limiting factors and has associated use as an environmental-impact tool and as an aid for hypothesis generation in studies of salmonid growth processes.

AB This study examines relationships between hydrothermal vent species and their surrounding physical and chemical environment on 2 high-temperature sulfide edifices of the Juan de Fuca Ridge (northeast Pacific). Video imagery and in situ temperature and chemical information were acquired during 2 remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dive programs in 1993 and 1995, for a total of 78 scans. Statistical analyses of environmental and faunal data reveal a heterogeneous distribution (cor respondence analyses) of hydrothermal species and demonstrate a significant influence of local physical and chemical conditions on species distributions (canonical correspondence analyses). Results confirm the importance of hydrogen sulfide to the distribution of vent species as well as the importance of complex variables such as visible flow intensity and substratum type. Since less than 30% of the variance in species distribution could be explained by the measured in situ factors, we conclude by stressing the need to evaluate effects of other unmeasured environmental factors such as dissolved oxygen, nitrogen compounds, food availability and biological interactions.

AB 1. The structure of bryophyte communities in streams in relation to habitat characteristics, especially disturbance, is described. Disturbance in rivers is quantified as movement of the stream bed, whereas in small streams water level fluctuation is used as an indicator of disturbance frequency.
   2. Canonical correspondence analysis differentiated frequently disturbed sites from more stable ones. The existence of a disturbance gradient was confirmed in a subset of the study sites using long-term records of discharge variation. A parallel change was detected in the species composition of bryophyte communities with low-statured, potentially fast colonizers dominating the disturbed end and large perennial species the stable end of the gradient.
   3. A consistent pattern of zonation of bryophyte species was found along the gradient from continually submersed to persistently dry conditions in small streams and lake outlets. An abrupt increase in species richness occurred at or just above the water line, where facultatively aquatic species tolerant of both conditions formed the bulk of the community.
   4. The relationship between species richness and standing crop in stream bryophyte communities was consistent with the hump-backed model of Grime (1979), especially at the within-habitat scale. Quadrats of low and very high standing crop were characterized by low species richness, while peak richness was observed at intermediate standing crops.
   5. A few perennial species (e.g. Fontinalis spp. and Rhynchostegium riparioides) capable of monopolizing space dominated the most stable habitats. Species composition in low biomass sites was more variable, yet only one basic growth-form (small-statured species with high allocation to spore production) seemed possible in these highly disturbed streams. In habitats of intermediate biomass, small-scale disturbances apparently allow the formation of a more varied bryophyte community.
   6. A habitat templet for stream bryophyte life strategies and community structure is presented. Disturbance is proposed to be the factor filtering out traits unsuitable for a given environment. The potential of stream bryophytes for testing and developing general ecological theory is emphasized.

AB Variation in assemblages of birds and carabid beetles in southern Finnish coniferous forest is described (1) within forest stands, (2) across the successional gradient from recently cut sites to mature forest, and (3) over a period of years. For birds, variation within a mature forest area was mainly due to nonsynchronous fluctuations of species and stochasticity in the site selection of individual breeding pairs. For carabid beetles, small-scale aggregations within a forest presumably reflected movement patterns of individuals. Both birds and carabids included some old-growth specialists and species inhabiting mainly, or exclusively, open habitats in young forest stages. The grain-patterning of silvicultural mosaics differ: birds put together their home ranges in a small-grained fashion, whereas for carabids the environment is coarse-grained. Maintenance of ecological heterogeneity at various scales relevant to different organisms in the taiga depends on how human-induced change and natural change compare with each other. The observed patterns are related to natural disturbance dynamics, and ecologically sound management approaches are discussed.

AB Remote sensing of far-red sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has emerged as an important tool for studying gross primary productivity (GPP) at the global scale. However, the relationship between SIF and GPP at the canopy scale lacks a clear mechanistic explanation. This is largely due to the poorly characterized role of the relative contributions from canopy structure and leaf physiology to the variability of the top-of-canopy, observed SIF signal. In particular, the effect of the canopy structure beyond light absorption is that only a fraction (f(esc)) of the SIF emitted from all leaves in the canopy can escape from the canopy due to the strong scattering of near-infrared radiation. We combined rice, wheat and corn canopy-level in-situ datasets to study how the physiological and structural components of SIF individually relate to measures of photosynthesis. At seasonal time scales, we found a considerably strong positive correlation (R-2 = 0.4-0.6) of fesc to the seasonal dynamics of the photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUEP), while the estimated physiological SIF yield was almost entirely uncorrelated to LUEP both at seasonal and diurnal time scales, with the partial exception of wheat. Consistent with these findings, the canopy structure and radiation component of SIF, defined as the product of APAR and f(esc), explained the relationship of observed SIF to GPP and even outperformed GPP estimation based on observed SIF at two of the three sites investigated. These results held for both half-hourly and daily mean values. In contrast, the total emitted SIF, obtained by normalizing observed SIF for f(esc), improved only the relationship to APAR but considerably decreased the correlation to GPP for all three crops. Our findings demonstrate the dominant role of canopy structure in the SIF-GPP relationship and establish a strong, mechanistic link between the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV) and the relevant canopy structure information contained in the SIF signal. These insights are expected to be useful in improving remote sensing based GPP estimates.

AB Having recognized the limitations in spatial representativeness and/or temporal coverage of (i) current ground ETa observations and (ii) land surface model-and remote sensing-based ETa estimates due to uncertainties in soil and vegetation parameters, a calibration-free nonlinear complementary relationship (CR) model is employed with inputs of air and dew-point temperature, wind speed, and net radiation to estimate 0.1 degrees, monthly ETa over China during 1982-2012. The modeled ETa rates were first validated against 13 eddy-covariance measurements, producing Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values in the range of 0.72-0.94. On the basin scale, the modeled ETa values yielded a relative bias of 6%, and a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency value of 0.80 in comparison with water-balance-derived evapotranspiration rates across 10 major river basins in China, indicating the CR-simulated ETa rates reliable over China. Further evaluations suggest that the CR-based ETa product is more accurate than seven other mainstream ETa products. The 31-year mean annual ETa value decreases from the southeast to the northwest in China, resulting in a country average of 406 +/- 15 mm/year. The country-representative annual ETa rates slightly decreased with a rate of -0.5 mm/year (p = 0.86) during 1982-2012. Annual ETa increased significantly over most parts of western and northeastern China but decreased significantly in many regions of the North China Plain as well as in the eastern and southern coastal regions. The present CR-based method, with its calibration-free nature and minimal data requirement, could help future calibrations/verifications of the more complex and more data-intensive land surface model-and remote sensing-based models.

AB The effect of a pollutant on the base of the food web can have knock-on effects for trophic structure and ecosystem functioning. In this study we assess the effect of microplastic exposure on juveniles of a planktivorous fish ( Acanthochromis polyacanthus), a species that is widespread and abundant on Indo-Pacific coral reefs. Under five different plastic concentration treatments, with plastics the same size as the natural food particles ( mean 2mm diameter), there was no significant effect of plastic exposure on fish growth, body condition or behaviour. The amount of plastics found in the gastro-intestinal ( GI) tract was low, with a range of one to eight particles remaining in the gut of individual fish at the end of a 6-week plastic-exposure period, suggesting that these fish are able to detect and avoid ingesting microplastics in this size range. However, in a second experiment the number of plastics in the GI tract vastly increased when plastic particle size was reduced to approximately one quarter the size of the food particles, with a maximum of 2102 small (<300 mu m diameter) particles present in the gut of individual fish after a 1-week plastic exposure period. Under conditions where food was replaced by plastic, there was a negative effect on the growth and body condition of the fish. These results suggest plastics could become more of a problem as they break up into smaller size classes, and that environmental changes that lead to a decrease in plankton concentrations combined with microplastic presence is likely have a greater influence on fish populations than microplastic presence alone.

AB 1. Forest dieback caused by drought-induced tree mortality has been observed world-wide. Forecasting which trees in which locations are vulnerable to drought-induced mortality is important to predict the consequences of drought on forest structure, biodiversity and ecosystem function.
   2. In this paper, our central aim was to compile a synthesis of tree traits and associated abiotic variables that can be used to predict drought-induced mortality.
   3. We reviewed the literature that specifically links drought mortality to functional traits and site conditions (i.e. edaphic variables and biotic conditions), targeting studies that show clear use of tree traits in drought analysis. We separated the review into five climatic zones to determine global vs. regionally restricted relationships between traits and mortality.
   4. Our synthesis identifies a number of traits that have clear relationships with drought-induced mortality (e.g. wood density at the species level and tree size and growth at the individual level). However, the lack of direct relationships between most traits and drought-induced mortality highlights areas where future research should focus to broaden our understanding.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our synthesis highlights established relationships between traits and drought-induced mortality, presents knowledge gaps for future research focus and suggests monitoring and research avenues for improving our understanding of drought-induced mortality. It is intended to assist ecologists and natural resource managers choose appropriate and measurable parameters for predicting local and regional scale tree mortality risk in different climatic zones within constraints of time and funding availability.

AB The theory of evolution links random variation and selection to incremental adaptation. In a different intellectual domain, learning theory links incremental adaptation (e.g., from positive and/or negative reinforcement) to intelligent behaviour. Specifically, learning theory explains how incremental adaptation can acquire knowledge from past experience and use it to direct future behaviours toward favourable outcomes. Until recently such cognitive learning seemed irrelevant to the 'uninformed' process of evolution. In our opinion, however, new results formally linking evolutionary processes to the principles of learning might provide solutions to several evolutionary puzzles - the evolution of evolvability, the evolution of ecological organisation, and evolutionary transitions in individuality. If so, the ability for evolution to learn might explain how it produces such apparently intelligent designs,

AB The size of an individual organism is a key trait to characterize its physiology and feeding ecology. Size-based scaling laws may have a limited size range of validity or undergo a transition from one scaling exponent to another at some characteristic size. We collate and review data on size-based scaling laws for resource acquisition, mobility, sensory range, and progeny size for all pelagic marine life, from bacteria to whales. Further, we review and develop simple theoretical arguments for observed scaling laws and the characteristic sizes of a change or breakdown of power laws. We divide life in the ocean into seven major realms based on trophic strategy, physiology, and life history strategy. Such a categorization represents a move away from a taxonomically oriented description toward a trait-based description of life in the oceans. Finally, we discuss life forms that transgress the simple size-based rules and identify unanswered questions.

AB Functional diversity is critical for ecosystem dynamics, stability and productivity. However, dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) which are increasingly used to simulate ecosystem functions under global change, condense functional diversity to plant functional types (PFTs) with constant parameters. Here, we develop an individual- and trait-based version of the DGVM LPJmL (Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land) called LPJmL- flexible individual traits (LPJmL-FIT) with flexible individual traits) which we apply to generate plant trait maps for the Amazon basin. LPJmL-FIT incorporates empirical ranges of five traits of tropical trees extracted from the TRY global plant trait database, namely specific leaf area (SLA), leaf longevity (LL), leaf nitrogen content (N-area), the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco per leaf area (vcmaxarea), and wood density (WD). To scale the individual growth performance of trees, the leaf traits are linked by trade-offs based on the leaf economics spectrum, whereas wood density is linked to tree mortality. No preselection of growth strategies is taking place, because individuals with unique trait combinations are uniformly distributed at tree establishment. We validate the modeled trait distributions by empirical trait data and the modeled biomass by a remote sensing product along a climatic gradient. Including trait variability and trade-offs successfully predicts natural trait distributions and achieves a more realistic representation of functional diversity at the local to regional scale. As sites of high climatic variability, the fringes of the Amazon promote trait divergence and the coexistence of multiple tree growth strategies, while lower plant trait diversity is found in the species-rich center of the region with relatively low climatic variability. LPJmL-FIT enables to test hypotheses on the effects of functional biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and to apply the DGVM to current challenges in ecosystem management from local to global scales, that is, deforestation and climate change effects.

AB Microbial activities that affect global oceanographic and atmospheric processes happen throughout the water column, yet the long-term ecological dynamics of microbes have been studied largely in the euphotic zone and adjacent seasonally mixed depths. We investigated temporal patterns in the community structure of free-living bacteria, by sampling approximately monthly from 5m, the deep chlorophyll maximum (similar to 15-40 m), 150, 500 and 890 m, in San Pedro Channel (maximum depth 900 m, hypoxic below similar to 500 m), off the coast of Southern California. Community structure and biodiversity (inverse Simpson index) showed seasonal patterns near the surface and bottom of the water column, but not at intermediate depths. Inverse Simpson's index was highest in the winter in surface waters and in the spring at 890 m, and varied interannually at all depths. Biodiversity appeared to be driven partially by exchange of microbes between depths and was highest when communities were changing slowly over time. Meanwhile, communities from the surface through 500m varied interannually. After accounting for seasonality, several environmental parameters co-varied with community structure at the surface and 890 m, but not at the intermediate depths. Abundant and seasonally variable groups included, at 890 m, Nitrospina, Flavobacteria and Marine Group A. Seasonality at 890m is likely driven by variability in sinking particles, which originate in surface waters, pass transiently through the middle water column and accumulate on the seafloor where they alter the chemical environment. Seasonal subeuphotic groups are likely those whose ecology is strongly influenced by these particles. This surface-to-bottom, decade-long, study identifies seasonality and interannual variability not only of overall community structure, but also of numerous taxonomic groups and near-species level operational taxonomic units.

AB The emerging field of ecological genomics contains several broad research areas. Comparative genomic and conservation genetic analyses are providing great insight into adaptive processes, species bottlenecks, population dynamics and areas of conservation priority. Now the same technological advances in high-throughput sequencing, coupled with taxonomically broad sequence repositories, are providing greater resolution and fundamentally new insights into functional ecology. In particular, we now have the capacity in some systems to rapidly identify thousands of species-level interactions using non-invasive methods based on the detection of trace DNA. This represents a powerful tool for conservation biology, for example allowing the identification of species with particularly inflexible niches and the investigation of food-webs or interaction networks with unusual or vulnerable dynamics. As they develop, these analyses will no doubt provide significant advances in the field of restoration ecology and the identification of appropriate locations for species reintroduction, as well as highlighting species at ecological risk. Here, I describe emerging patterns that have come from the various initial model systems, the advantages and limitations of the technique and key areas where these methods may significantly advance our empirical and applied conservation practices.

AB Background: The pathogenesis of dengue shock syndrome (DSS, grade 3 and 4) is not yet completely understood. Several factors are reportedly associated with DSS, a more severe form of dengue infection that reportedly causes 50 times higher mortality compared to that of dengue patients without DSS. However, the results from these reports remain inconclusive. To better understand the epidemiology, clinical manifestation, and pathogenesis of DSS for development of new therapy, we systematically reviewed and performed a meta-analysis of relevant studies that reported factors in both DSS and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF, grade 1 and 2) patients.
   Methods and Findings: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, Dengue Bulletin, Cochrane Library, Virtual Health Library, and a manual search of reference lists of articles published before September 2010 were used to retrieve relevant studies. A meta-analysis using fixed-or random-effects models was used to calculate pooled odds ratios (OR) or event rate with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Assessment of heterogeneity and publication bias, meta-regression analysis, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and analysis of factor-specific relationships were further performed. There were 198 studies constituting 203 data sets that met our eligibility criteria. Our meta-regression analysis showed a sustained reduction of DSS/dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) ratio over a period of 40 years in Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand. The meta-analysis revealed that age, female sex, neurological signs, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, hemoconcentration, ascites, pleural effusion, hypoalbuminemia, hypoproteinemia, hepatomegaly, levels of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase, thrombocytopenia, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level, primary/secondary infection, and dengue virus serotype-2 were significantly associated with DSS when pooling all original relevant studies.
   Conclusions: The results improve our knowledge of the pathogenesis of DSS by identifying the association between the epidemiology, clinical signs, and biomarkers involved in DSS.

AB Disturbances are widespread and may affect community assembly, species composition, (functional) diversity and hence ecosystem processes. It remains still unclear to what extent disturbance-mediated species changes scale-up to changes in community functional properties, especially for species-rich tropical forests. A large-scale field experiment was performed in which the dynamics of 15 000 stems >10 cm in diameter was monitored for 8 years in 44 one-ha forest plots. Twelve functional effect and response traits were measured for the most dominant tree species. The effects of different intensities of disturbance caused by logging and silvicultural treatments on the species and functional diversity of a Bolivian tropical forest community were evaluated, along with how these changes were driven by underlying demographic processes. Disturbance treatments did not affect species diversity or functional diversity indices based on multiple traits related to primary productivity and decomposition rate. This result suggests that species richness is conserved, and trait variation is maintained, which can buffer the community against environmental change. In contrast, disturbance intensity affected the average plant trait values in the community (the community-weighted mean) for seven of 12 traits evaluated. At high disturbance intensity, the community had a lower wood density of stem and branches, lower leaf toughness and dry matter content, but higher specific leaf area and leaf N- and P concentration, with the value of these traits changing on average 6% over the 8-year period. The functional spectrum of the community changed, therefore, from slow, conservative, shade-tolerant species towards fast, acquisitive, light-demanding species. These functional changes in mean trait values may enhance primary productivity and decomposition rate in the short term. Temporal changes in community functional properties were mainly driven by recruitment, and little by mortality or survival. Synthesis. Moderate levels of (logging) disturbance neither affected species diversity nor functional diversity per se in the 8-year period after logging. Disturbance did, however, change the functional community composition towards fast species with more acquisitive traits, thus potentially fuelling primary productivity and nutrient and carbon cycling. In conclusion, tropical forest management may contribute to conserving functional biodiversity of trees while providing forest resources.

AB The Czech Republic has a strong tradition of research on synanthropic and alien plants, both historically and recently, which results in a good knowledge of alien flora and invasion patterns. In this paper the currect situation of plant invasions in the country is reviewed from the viewpoint of the composition of the country's alien flora (based on a recently published checklist of alien taxa) and that of the level of habitat invasions, expressed as the proportion of alien species among all species recorded, and large-scale patterns of invasions in landscapes. At present there are 1454 alien taxa recorded in the national flora, consisting of 350 archaeophytes, introduced since the beginning of Neolithic agriculture until the end of the Medieval Period, and 1104 neophytes, introduced in the Modern Period. In the last two centuries there was a steady increase in the number of alien taxa without a decelerating trend. Arrivals of neophytes from the Mediterranean region and extra-Mediterranean Europe proceeded at the same speed until ca the 1870s; thereafter the Mediterranean region started to be the main donor of the country's alien flora. Most species native to more distant areas such as extra-Mediterranean Asia and North America were arriving later. Of the total number of alien taxa, 985 (67.7%) are classified as casual, 408 (28.1%) as naturalized but non-invasive, and 61 (4.2%) as invasive. Alien taxa contribute 33.3% to the total plant diversity ever recorded in the country, or 14.6% to the permanently present flora (excluding extinct natives and including only naturalized alien taxa). These figures are within the range reported from other European countries. Currently there are 11 archaeophytes and 50 neophytes with invasive populations in the Czech Republic. Factsheets of the invasive neophytes are provided with information on their invasion history, ecology, habitat affinities and impact, and the map of current distribution. The highest invasive species densities (illustrated by a map) as well as the highest levels of invasion in plant communities are found in cities and villages and their surroundings, floodplains of large rivers, disturbed regions in the north, and agricultural landscapes and forestry plantations in warm lowlands, especially in southern Moravia, and central and eastern Bohemia. The level of invasion in the country decreases with altitude, with neophytes responding to this factor more strongly than archaeophytes. A new quantification of the level of invasion for all phytosociological alliances of the Czech Republic is presented. The habitats and vegetation types harbouring the highest proportions of alien species in the Czech Republic are generally either those with a high level of disturbance or with fluctuating input of resources, especially nutrients, in some cases also water or light. Habitats with limited fluctuation of resource availability such as dry, wet and saline grasslands, base-rich fens, and broad-leaved deciduous woodlands appear to be rather resistant to invasion. Future spread of alien species will mainly depend on changing land use and climate.

AB Gene duplication is a key mechanism for the adaptive evolution and neofunctionalization of gene families. Large multigene families often exhibit complex evolutionary histories as a result of frequent gene duplication acting in concordance with positive selection pressures. Alterations in the domain structure of genes, causing changes in the molecular scaffold of proteins, can also result in a complex evolutionary history and has been observed in functionally diverse multigene toxin families. Here, we investigate the role alterations in domain structure have on the tempo of evolution and neofunctionalization of multigene families using the snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) as a model system. Our results reveal that the evolutionary history of viperid (Serpentes: Viperidae) SVMPs is repeatedly punctuated by domain loss, with the single loss of the cysteine-rich domain, facilitating the formation of P-II class SVMPs, occurring prior to the convergent loss of the disintegrin domain to form multiple P-I SVMP structures. Notably, the majority of phylogenetic branches where domain loss was inferred to have occurred exhibited highly significant evidence of positive selection in surface-exposed amino acid residues, resulting in the neofunctionalization of P-II and P-I SVMP classes. These results provide a valuable insight into the mechanisms by which complex gene families evolve and detail how the loss of domain structures can catalyze the accelerated evolution of novel gene paralogues. The ensuing generation of differing molecular scaffolds encoded by the same multigene family facilitates gene neofunctionalization while presenting an evolutionary advantage through the retention of multiple genes capable of encoding functionally distinct proteins.

AB Homoploid hybrid speciation is thought to require unusual circumstances to yield reproductive isolation from the parental species, and few examples are known from nature. Here, we present genetic evidence for this mode of speciation in birds. Using Bayesian assignment analyses of 751 individuals genotyped for 14 unlinked, nuclear microsatellite loci, we show that the phenotypically intermediate Italian sparrow (Passer italiae) does not form a cluster of its own, but instead exhibits clear admixture (over its entire breeding range) between its putative parental species, the house sparrow (P. domesticus) and the Spanish sparrow (P. hispaniolensis). Further, the Italian sparrow possesses mitochondrial (mt) DNA haplotypes identical to both putative parental species (although mostly of house sparrow type), indicating a recent hybrid origin. Today, the Italian sparrow has a largely allopatric distribution on the Italian peninsula and some Mediterranean islands separated from its suggested parental species by the Alps and the Mediterranean Sea, but co-occurs with the Spanish sparrow on the Gargano peninsula in southeast Italy. No evidence of interbreeding was found in this sympatric population. However, the Italian sparrow hybridizes with the house sparrow in a sparsely populated contact zone in the Alps. Yet, the contact zone is characterized by steep clines in species-specific male plumage traits, suggesting that partial reproductive isolation may also have developed between these two taxa. Thus, geographic and reproductive barriers restrict gene flow into the nascent hybrid species. We propose that an origin of hybrid species where the hybrid lineage gets geographically isolated from its parental species, as seems to have happened in this system, might be more common in nature than previously assumed.

AB Ecological theory predicts that animals with similar foraging strategies should not be able to coexist without segregating either in space, time or diet. In communities, intra-specific competition is thought to be more intense than the competition among species, because of the lack of niche partitioning between conspecifics. Hence, while different seabird species can overlap in their foraging distribution, intra-specific competition can drive the neighboring populations of the same species to spatial segregation of foraging areas. To investigate ecological segregation within and among species of diving seabirds, we used a multi-species GPS-tracking approach of seabirds of four species on a small island in the Southwest Atlantic. The present study goes beyond previous work by analyzing simultaneous effects of species and colonies. We observed strikingly strong spatial foraging segregation among birds of the same species, breeding in colonies as close as 2 km from each other. Conspecifics from neighboring colonies used foraging places adjacent to their own colony, and there was little or no overlap with birds from the other colony. A zone with increased predator concentration was completely avoided during foraging trips, likely contributing to the spatial segregation. In addition to spatial segregation, we also observed intra-specific differences in other components of foraging behavior, such as time of day, dive depth and diet. These were most likely caused by optimal foraging of individuals in relation to habitat differences on a local scale, leading to a complex pattern of interactions with environmental covariates, in particular foraging daytime, foraging water layer temperature and depth, distance to coast and bathymetric depth of foraging areas. As mechanisms leading to the spatial segregation we propose a combination of optimal foraging and avoidance of predation.

AB Aim
   We test how productivity, disturbance rate, plant functional composition and species richness gradients control changes in the composition of high-latitude vegetation during recent climatic warming.
   Location
   Northern Fennoscandia, Europe.
   Methods
   We resampled tree line ecotone vegetation sites sampled 26 years earlier. To quantify compositional changes, we used generalized linear models to test relationships between compositional changes and environmental gradients.
   Results
   Compositional changes in species abundances are positively related to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based estimate of productivity gradient and to geomorphological disturbance. Competitive species in fertile sites show the greatest changes in abundance, opposed to negligible changes in infertile sites. Change in species richness is negatively related to initial richness, whereas geomorphological disturbance has positive effects on change in richness. Few lowland species have moved towards higher elevations.
   Main conclusions
   The sensitivity of vegetation to climate change depends on a complex interplay between productivity, physical and biotic disturbances, plant functional composition and richness. Our results suggest that vegetation on productive sites, such as herb-rich deciduous forests at low altitudes, is more sensitive to climate warming than alpine tundra vegetation where grazing may have strong buffering effects. Geomorphological disturbance promotes vegetation change under climatic warming, whereas high diversity has a stabilizing effect.

AB Evolutionary community ecology is an emerging field of study that includes evolutionary principles such as individual trait variation and plasticity of traits to provide a more mechanistic insight as to how species diversity is maintained and community processes are shaped across time and space. In this review we explore phenotypic plasticity in functional traits and its consequences at the community level. We argue that resource requirement and resource uptake are plastic traits that can alter fundamental and realised niches of species in the community if environmental conditions change. We conceptually add to niche models by including phenotypic plasticity in traits involved in resource allocation under stress. Two qualitative predictions that we derive are: (1) plasticity in resource requirement induced by availability of resources enlarges the fundamental niche of species and causes a reduction of vacant niches for other species and (2) plasticity in the proportional resource uptake results in expansion of the realized niche, causing a reduction in the possibility for coexistence with other species. We illustrate these predictions with data on the competitive impact of invasive species. Furthermore, we review the quickly increasing number of empirical studies on evolutionary community ecology and demonstrate the impact of phenotypic plasticity on community composition. Among others, we give examples that show that differences in the level of phenotypic plasticity can disrupt species interactions when environmental conditions change, due to effects on realized niches. Finally, we indicate several promising directions for future phenotypic plasticity research in a community context. We need an integrative, trait-based approach that has its roots in community and evolutionary ecology in order to face fast changing environmental conditions such as global warming and urbanization that pose ecological as well as evolutionary challenges.

AB In Switzerland, the traditional three-stage grassland farming system consists of grazed or cut grasslands along a gradient from lowland to alpine elevations. We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes at three grassland sites (400, 1000, and 2000 m elevation) and estimated carbon sequestration for two different but exceptionally warm years (2006 and 2007). Grasslands at higher elevations (>1000 m), managed at lower intensities, exhibited a larger net CO2 uptake compared to intensively managed grasslands at lower elevations (400 m). Taking into account harvest outputs as well as manure inputs, we calculated the carbon stocks and their changes for grasslands at 400 m and 1000 m during two years. Similar to the cumulative net ecosystem CO2 fluxes, the seasonal course of carbon stock changes were strongly driven by management intensity, in particular by timing and amount of manure applications. Despite differences in environmental and management conditions with elevation, both grassland sites were carbon sinks during 2006 and 2007 (between 25 and 150 g C m(-2) yr(-1)).

AB Debate surrounding the integration of phenotypic plasticity within the neo-Darwinian paradigm has recently intensified, but is largely dominated by conceptual abstractions. Advances in our capacities to identify candidate genes, and quantify their levels of expression, now facilitate the study of natural variation in inherently plastic traits, and may lead to a more concrete understanding of plasticity's role in adaptive evolution. We present data from parapatric threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) demes inhabiting geologically recent, freshwater and saltwater zones of a large estuary. Reaction norms for survival confirm adaptation to local salinity conditions. Analysis of osmoregulatory candidate gene expression within an ecological quantitative genetics framework suggests putative mechanisms underlying adaptive variation, and provides insights into the role of ancestral trait plasticity in this divergence. A sodium-potassium ATPase (ATP1A1) is identified as a candidate gene for freshwater adaptation. In addition to heritable variation for gene expression, we infer significant correlation between measures of expression and individual fitness. Overall results indicate a loss of plasticity in the freshwater deme. We discuss how this is consistent with adaptation facilitated by ancestral plasticity as a heuristic example that may prove useful for future, explicit tests of the genetic assimilation hypothesis.

AB Human-mediated seed dispersal is recognised as an important, but under-researched, issue. To assess the potential for tourists to act as unintentional seed dispersal agents, we reviewed published and unpublished data on seed dispersal via clothing, vehicles (cars) and in/on horses and donkeys, all of which can be used by tourists. Seeds from 754 species of terrestrial plants have been collected from these vectors, 15% of which are internationally recognised environmental weeds. Seeds were collected from personal clothing and equipment (228 species), the fur of donkeys and horses (42 species), horse dung (216 species) and vehicles (505 species). Most were herbs (429 species) or graminoids (237 species) and native to Europe. Annual Poa, White Clover, Kentucky Bluegrass and Yorkshire Fog were the most frequent species. There have been eight studies specifically on tourists, which identified 12 species on clothing, 26 on vehicles and 133 from horse dung. Methods that minimise the risk of tourists as human-mediated dispersal agents may therefore be appropriate for some tourism activities/destinations: suggestions are made. Further sampling using standardised experimental techniques is required to assess the relative risk associated with specific tourist activities and locations and determine which, and how much, seed is transported.

AB Ecological models suggest that high diversity can be generated by purely niche-based, purely neutral or by a mixture of niche-based and neutral ecological processes. Here, we compare the degree to which four contrasting hypotheses for coexistence, ranging from niche-based to neutral, explain species richness along a body mass niche axis. We derive predictions from these hypotheses and confront them with species body-mass patterns in a highly sampled marine phytoplankton community. We find that these patterns are consistent only with a mechanism that combines niche and neutral processes, such as the emergent neutrality mechanism. In this work, we provide the first empirical evidence that a niche-neutral model can explain niche space occupancy pattern in a natural species-rich community. We suggest this class of model may be a useful hypothesis for the generation and maintenance of species diversity in other size-structured communities.

AB Roadside habitats are important for a range of taxa including plants, insects, mammals, and birds, particularly in developed countries in which large expanses of native vegetation have been cleared for agriculture or urban development. Although roadside vegetation may provide suitable habitat for many species, resident animals can be exposed to high levels of traffic noise, visual disturbance from passing vehicles, and the risk of collision with cars and trucks. Traffic noise can reduce the distance over which acoustic signals such as song can be detected, an effect known as acoustic interference or masking. Studies from the northern hemisphere show that the singing behavior of birds changes in the presence of traffic noise. We investigated the impact of traffic noise and traffic volume on two species of birds, the Grey Shrike-thrush (Colluricincla harmonica) and the Grey Fantail (Rhipidura fuliginosa), at 58 roadside sites on the Mornington Peninsula, southeastern Australia. The lower singing Grey Shrike-thrush sang at a higher frequency in the presence of traffic noise, with a predicted increase in dominant frequency of 5.8 Hz/dB of traffic noise, and a total effect size of 209 Hz. In contrast, the higher singing Grey Fantail did not appear to change its song in traffic noise. The probability of detecting each species on a visit to a site declined substantially with increasing traffic noise and traffic volume, with several lines of evidence supporting a larger effect of traffic noise. Traffic noise could hamper detection of song by conspecifics, making it more difficult for birds to establish and maintain territories, attract mates and maintain pair bonds, and possibly leading to reduced breeding success in noisy roadside habitats. Closing key roads during the breeding season is a potential, but untested, management strategy to protect threatened bird species from traffic noise and collision with vehicles at the time of year when they are most vulnerable to their impacts. Other management options include reducing the speed and/or volume of traffic on such roads to an acceptably low level. Ours is the first study to investigate the effect of traffic noise on the singing behavior of birds in the southern hemisphere.

AB Male frogs call to attract females for mating and to defend territories from rival males. Female frogs of some species prefer lower-pitched calls, which indicate larger, more experienced males. Acoustic interference occurs when background noise reduces the active distance or the distance over which an acoustic signal can be detected. Birds are known to call at a higher pitch or frequency in urban noise, decreasing acoustic interference from low-frequency noise. Using Bayesian linear regression, we investigated the effect of traffic noise on the pitch of advertisement calls in two species of frogs, the southern brown tree frog (Litoria ewingii) and the common eastern froglet (Crinia signifera). We found evidence that L. ewingii calls at a higher pitch in traffic noise, with an average increase in dominant frequency of 4.1 Hz/dB of traffic noise, and a total effect size of 123 Hz. This frequency shift is smaller than that observed in birds, but is still large enough to be detected by conspecific frogs and confer a significant benefit to the caller. Mathematical modelling predicted a 24% increase in the active distance of a L. ewingii call in traffic noise with a frequency shift of this size. Crinia signifera may also call at a higher pitch in traffic noise, but more data are required to be confident of this effect. Because frog calls are innate rather than learned, the frequency shift demonstrated by L. ewingii may represent an evolutionary adaptation to noisy conditions. The phenomenon of frogs calling at a higher pitch in traffic noise could therefore constitute an intriguing trade-off between audibility and attractiveness to potential mates.

AB Linkages among leaf traits and environment have most often been tested across communities but infrequently within lineages. We studied seven endemic Hawaiian Plantago taxa radiated across elevations, climates, and habitats. We grew plants of six taxa in controlled conditions for 1-2 yr and collected leaves from a seventh in the field. For all taxa, we measured 46 leaf traits and tested hypotheses for trait-environment and trait-trait associations. Because of the rarity of the study plants, our study included low replication within taxa and multiple growth locations; despite these limitations, given reasonable assumptions, our analyses pointed to genetic differentiation among taxa. The leaves of bog taxa were smaller and thicker than those of woodland taxa, with higher leaf mass per area (LMA), stomatal pore area per leaf area, and carbon isotope discrimination (delta C-13). Taxa from higher elevations had thicker leaves and higher LMA, as well as lower nitrogen per mass and higher adaxial stomatal distribution. Taxa of drier sites had higher vein density and delta C-13. Many traits were allometrically related to leaf area, including stomatal density, major vein densities, and xylem conduit numbers and dimensions. Stomatal and xylem traits were correlated, indicating a matching of hydraulic supply and demand. Leaf diversification in Hawaiian Plantago involved coordinated trait shifts, generating strong, apparently adaptive trait linkages.

AB 1. The Yangtze floodplain (SE China) is characterized by a number of large shallow lakes, many of which have undergone eutrophication due to the intensification of agriculture and urban growth over recent decades. As monitoring data are limited and in order to determine lake baseline nutrient concentrations, 49 lakes were sampled, covering a total phosphorus (TP) gradient (c. 30-550 mu g L-1) to develop a diatom-based inference model.
   2. There are three dominant diatom assemblages in these shallow lakes with a marked change in assemblage structure near the boundary between eutrophic and hypereutrophic nutrient levels (as indicated by their TP value). Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that TP was the most important and significant variable in explaining the diatom distributions, independently accounting for 9.5% variance of diatoms.
   3. Forty-three lakes were used to generate a transfer function using weighted averaging (WA) with inverse deshrinking. This model had low predictive error (root mean squared error of prediction; RMSEPjack = 0.12) and a high coefficient of prediction (R-jack(2) = 0.82), comparable with regional TP models elsewhere. The good performance of this TP model may reflect the low abundance of benthic diatom species which are commonly regarded as the main error source in European shallow lake WA models.
   4. The WA model was used to reconstruct the past-TP concentrations for Taibai Lake, a shallow hypereutrophic lake in Hubei province. The results showed that TP concentration varied slightly (43-62 mu g L-1) prior to the 1920s, indicating an eutrophic state since the 1800s. A period of sustained eutrophication occurred after 1950, because of the development of agriculture, reflecting by maximum values of Aulacoseira alpigena and increased abundance of Cyclotella meneghiniana, C. atomus and Cyclostephanos dubius. The steep increase in nutrient concentration after 1970 was related to the overuse of chemical fertilizer and fish farming in the catchment.
   5. The shift in fossil diatoms from epiphytic to planktonic forms in the lake sediment core during 1950-70 provides useful information on the transformation from macrophyte-dominated to alga-dominated states. It is plausible that the TP concentration of 80-110 mu g L-1 observed in this study is the critical range for switching between the two stable states in the lake.
   6. The regional diatom-TP model developed in this study allows, therefore, the possibility of reconstructing historical background nutrient concentrations in lakes. It will provide an indication of the onset and development of eutrophication at any site. This is particularly important for the many lakes in the Yangtze floodplain where information about historical changes in water quality is lacking.

AB 'Who comes first' is decisive for plant community assembly and ecosystem properties. Early arrival or faster initial development of a species leads to space occupancy both above and below ground and contributes to species success. However, regular disturbance (e.g. biomass removal) might permit later-arriving or slower-developing species to catch up.
   Here, artificial communities of grassland species belonging to the plant functional types (PFTs) herb, grass and legume were used to test the effect of stepwise arrival (sowing) of PFTs.
   Dramatic effects were found as a result of a 3 wk arrival difference on composition and above-ground biomass that persisted over four harvests and two seasons. Priority effects, such as unequal germination time (arrival), and thus differences in community age structure, had lasting effects on PFT biomass contribution and associated ecosystem functioning. These effects were robust against above-ground disturbance. Benefits of earlier root formation outweighed above-ground species interaction.
   Earlier space occupancy and bigger reserve pools are the likely causes. Natural populations commonly exhibit age diversity and asynchrony of development among taxa. In experiments, artificial synchrony of arrival (sowing) may thus induce assembly routes favouring faster-establishing taxa, with consequences for ecosystem functioning (e.g. productivity). Founder effects, such as those observed here, could be even greater in communities of slow-growing species or forests, given their longer generation time and minor disturbance.

AB Many fundamental traits of species measured at different levels of biological organization appear to scale as a power law to body mass (M) with exponents that are multiples of 1/4. Recent work has united these relationships in a "metabolic theory of ecology'' (MTE) that explains the pervasiveness of quarter-power scaling by its dependence on basal metabolic rate ( B), which scales as M-0.75. Central to the MTE is theory linking the observed -0.25 scaling of maximum population growth rate (r(m)) and body mass to the 0.75 scaling of metabolic rate and body mass via relationships with age at first reproduction (alpha) derived from a general growth model and demographic theory. We used this theory to derive two further predictions: that age at first reproduction should scale inversely to mass-corrected basal metabolic rate alpha proportional to ( B/M)(-1) such that r(m) proportional to (B/M)(1). We then used phylogenetic generalized least squares and model selection methods to test the predicted scaling relationships using data from 1197 mammalian species. There was a strong phylogenetic signal in these data, highlighting the need to account for phylogeny in allometric studies. The 95% confidence intervals included, or almost included, the scaling exponent predicted by MTE for B proportional to M-0.75, r(m) proportional to M-0.25, and r(m) proportional to alpha(-1), but not for alpha proportional to M-0.25 or the two predictions that we generated. Our results highlight a mismatch between theory and observation and imply that the observed -0.25 scaling of maximum population growth rate and body mass does not arise via the mechanism proposed in the MTE.

AB Microsatellites have gained wide application for elucidating population structure in nonmodel organisms. Since they are generally noncoding, neutrality is assumed but rarely tested. In Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.), microsatellite studies have revealed highly heterogeneous estimates of genetic differentiation among loci. In particular one locus, Gmo 132, has demonstrated elevated genetic differentiation. We investigated possible hitchhiking selection at this and other microsatellite loci in Atlantic cod. We employed 11 loci for analysing samples from the Baltic Sea, North Sea, Barents Sea and Newfoundland covering a large part of the species' distributional range. The 'classical' Lewontin-Krakauer test for selection based on variance in estimates of F-ST and G'(ST) (standardized genetic differentiation) revealed only one significant pairwise test (North Sea-Barents Sea), and the source of the elevated variance could not be ascribed exclusively to Gmo 132. In contrast, different variants of the recently developed ln R theta. test for selective sweeps at microsatellite loci revealed a high number of significant outcomes of pair-wise tests for Gmo 132. Further, the presence of selection was indicated in at least one other locus. The results suggest that many previous estimates of genetic differentiation in cod based on microsatellites are inflated, and in some cases relationships among populations are obscured by one or more loci being the subject to hitch-hiking selection. Likewise, temporal estimates of effective population sizes in Atlantic cod may be flawed. We recommend, generally, to use a higher number of microsatellite loci to elucidate population structure in marine fishes and other nonmodel species to allow for identification of outlier loci that are subject to selection.

AB 1. In migratory species, early arrival on the breeding grounds can often enhance breeding success. Timing of spring migration is therefore a key process that is likely to be influenced both by factors specific to individuals, such as the quality of winter and breeding locations and the distance between them, and by annual variation in weather conditions before and during migration.
   2. The Icelandic black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa islandica population is currently increasing and, throughout Iceland, is expanding into poorer quality breeding areas. Using a unique data set of arrival times in Iceland in different years for individuals of known breeding and wintering locations, we show that individuals breeding in lower quality, recently occupied and colder areas arrive later than those from traditionally occupied areas. The population is also expanding into new wintering areas, and males from traditionally occupied winter sites also arrive earlier than those occupying novel sites.
   3. Annual variation in timing of migration of individuals is influenced by large-scaleweather systems (the North Atlantic Oscillation), but between-individual variation is a stronger predictor of arrival time than the NAO. Distance between winter and breeding sites does not influence arrival times.
   4. Annual variation in timing of migration is therefore influenced by climatic factors, but the pattern of individual arrival is primarily related to breeding and winter habitat quality. These habitat effects on arrival patterns are likely to operate through variation in individual condition and local-scale density-dependent processes. Timing of migration thus appears to be a key component of the intricate relationship between wintering and breeding grounds in this migratory system.

AB Brazilian peppertree (Schinus terebinthifolius) is a woody perennial that has invaded much of Florida. This native of northeastern Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil was brought as an ornamental to both the west and east coasts of Florida at the end of the 19th century. It was recorded as an invader of natural areas in the 1950s, and has since extended its range to cover over 280 000 ha. Our goals were to understand the history of this invasion, as one step toward understanding why this exotic was so successful, and ultimately to improve development of biological control agents. We sampled plants from the native and exotic ranges, particularly Florida, and genotyped these individuals at nuclear and chloroplast loci. Nuclear microsatellite and cpDNA loci reveal strong genetic population structure consistent with limited dispersal in the introduced and native ranges. Bayesian clustering of microsatellite data separates the east and west coast plants in Florida into distinct populations. The two chloroplast haplotypes found in Florida are also concordant with this separation: one predominates on the east coast, the other on the west coast. Analysis of samples collected in South America shows that haplotypes as distinct as the two in Florida are unlikely to have come from a single source population. We conclude that the genetic evidence supports two introductions of Brazilian peppertree into Florida and extensive hybridization between them. The west coast genotype likely came from coastal Brazil at about 27 south, whereas the east coast genotype probably originated from another, as yet unidentified site. As a result of hybridization, the Florida population does not exhibit low genetic variation compared to populations in the native range, possibly increasing its ability to adapt to novel environments. Hybridization also has important consequences for the selection of biocontrol agents since it will not be possible to identify closely co-adapted natural enemies in the native range, necessitating more extensive host testing.

ID HONEST SIGNAL; PREFERENCE; SELECTION
AB Developmental stress has recently been shown to have adverse effects upon adult male song structure in birds, which may well act as an honest signal of male quality to discriminating females. However, it still remains to be shown if females can discriminate between the songs of stressed and non-stressed males. Here we use a novel experimental design using an active choice paradigm to investigate preferences in captive female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Nine females were exposed to ten pairs of songs by previously stressed and non-stressed birds that had learned their song from the same tutor. Song pairs differed significantly in terms of song complexity, with songs of stressed males exhibiting lower numbers of syllables and fewer different syllables in a phrase. Song rate and peak frequency did not differ between stressed and non-stressed males. Females showed a significant preference for non-stressed songs in terms of directed perching activity and time spent on perches. Our results therefore indicate that developmental stress affects not only the structure of male song, but that such structural differences are biologically relevant to female mate choice decisions.

AB Palaeoecological studies are yielding fresh insights into slow forest ecosystem processes that are rarely observed using standard ecological methods, yet have major impacts on ecosystem function. Regional pollen data describe the broad features of the regional spread of trees but yield few insights into the processes of stand invasion and the facilitating role of disturbance. Pollen and charcoal data from small forest hollows are used to complement regional data in the study of the spread of Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica into southern Scandinavia during the last 4000 years. P. abies spread as a migrating front and preferentially invaded successional Betula stands, which had become particularly widespread in the region during the last 1000 years as a result of human activity. The spread of P. abies also closely tracked the changing area of suitable regional climate. The spread of F. sylvatica was more directly linked to anthropogenic activities and disturbance by fire prior to stand establishment. F. sylvatica preferentially invaded rich deciduous stand types that had declined in abundance during the last 2000 years. A recent range reduction of F. sylvatica can also be ascribed to human activity. The stand-scale palaeoecological data show how site conditions and disturbance are more important rate-limiting factors for F. sylvatica than for P. abies and help explain why F. sylvatica spread shows a patchy dynamic rather than the smoother migrating front of P. abies.

AB Species-area relationships have been observed for virtually all major groups of macroorganisms that have been studied to date but have not been explored for microscopic phytoplankton algae, which are the dominant producers in many freshwater and marine ecosystems. Our analyses of data from 142 different natural ponds, lakes, and oceans and 239 experimental ecosystems reveal a strong species-area relationship with an exponent that is invariant across ecosystems that span > 15 orders of magnitude in spatial extent. A striking result is that the species-area relationship derived from small-scale experimental studies correctly scales up to natural aquatic ecosystems. These results significantly broaden our knowledge of the effects of island size on biodiversity and also confirm the relevance of experimentally derived data to the analysis and understanding of larger-scale ecological patterns. In addition, they confirm that patterns in microbial diversity are strongly consistent with those that have been repeatedly reported in the literature for macroorganisms.

AB Reconstructions of mean July temperature (T-jul) and winter precipitation (P-w) for the last 11/500 years on the Folgefonna peninsula are presented. T-jul was reconstructed using pollen-climate transfer functions and P-w was reconstructed based on the exponential relationship between mean solid winter precipitation and ablation-season temperature at the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) with a reconstructed former ELA, using T-jul as the proxy for ablation-season temperature. The reconstructions from the Folgefonna peninsula suggest that the early Holocene was relatively cool and dry until c. 8000 cal. yr BP, followed by a warm and humid mid-Holocene until c. 4000 cal. yr BP with inferred T-jul above 12 degrees C and P-w reaching as high as 225% of the present day. Subsequent to c. 4000 cal. yr BP a reduction is seen in both inferred T-jul and P-w with large fluctuations during the last 500 years. In addition, new calculations of P-w from two glaciers ( Hardangerjokulen and Jostedalsbreen) in southern Norway are presented. The results show that P-w varied in phase at all glaciers, probably as a response to the same climate forcing factor. During the early Holocene a major shift is suggested between winds from the west and the east.

AB Patellid limpets are dominant grazers on intertidal rocky shores of NW Europe with a key role in structuring the eulittoral community. Localised loss of limpets and the subsequent reduction in grazing pressure is known to result in important changes in community structure, through the development of canopy-forming macroalgae, and an associated increase in species diversity and community complexity. The level of determinism in the community level response to localised loss of patellid limpets was assessed at spatial scales from 100s of kilometres to 10s of metres and temporal scales from weeks to months at mid-tide level of exposed rocky shores, Limpets were removed and excluded from experimental plots to simulate localised limpet loss and appropriate controls established. Experimental plots were established in replicate patches at 2 shores at each of 2 regional locations, separated by approximately 500 km: the Isle of Man and SW England. Removals were conducted on 2 dates within each of 2 seasons (summer and winter) and the community level response monitored for a period of 12 mo. There was a clear effect of limpet loss at all spatial and temporal scales, with rapid development of green ephemeral algae followed by a fucoid canopy. However, the degree of determinism in the development of canopy-forming algae differed markedly between the 2 locations. At the northerly location, the Isle of Man, fucoid algae developed quickly and dominated all areas of limpet exclusion; there was little variability between plots. In contrast, in SW England, the abundance of fucoid algae was significantly lower and much more variable. Such geographic changes in the development of macroalgae in the absence of the dominant grazer are discussed in relation to rocky shore community dynamics and the latitudinal change in balance between grazers and algae over the wave exposure gradient.

AB 1. Patterns of species richness along latitudinal, elevational and depth gradients often exhibit a mid-gradient peak. Similar patterns with a mid-domain peak in richness are produced, as a result of geometric constraints on species distributions, by models that randomize species range size and placement over a bounded gradient.
   2. Proponents of these so-called mid-domain models argue that they provide an appropriate null hypothesis for examining species richness patterns along spatial gradients. Furthermore, some claim that because these models seem to explain a large proportion of the large-scale spatial variation in richness, geometric constraints on species distribution are in fact the cause of these patterns.
   3. A critical examination of model assumptions reveals that some are unrealistic, conceptually flawed or internally inconsistent. Additionally, tests of mid-domain models have suffered from methodological deficiencies derived from arbitrariness and circularity in the definition of domain boundaries, collapsing two-dimensional (2-D) patterns into a single dimension (1-D), and the use of interpolated ranges, all of which can bias test results in favour of the models. Tests have also been statistically naive by using fairly insensitive measures of deviation between observed and predicted patterns and ignoring the increased probability of Type I error that can result in analyses of spatially autocorrelated data.
   4. In spite of this, a review of the empirical evidence indicates that most studies do not show a high degree of concordance between observed and predicted species richness patterns, particularly in 2-D. Additionally, spatial patterns of variation in range size and species turnover do not unequivocally support mid-domain models. Thus, the models do not adequately describe observed species richness gradients and thus fail to explain them.
   5. Although mid-domain models have served a useful purpose in drawing attention to the need to clarify the null expectation in the study of species richness gradients, their use appears to be severely limited by difficulties associated with the treatment of ranges, boundary definitions and a lack of clarity regarding the extent to which the observed data should be used to generate the null patterns.

AB Adult aquatic insects emerging from streams are a fundamental resource sustaining riparian bird communities in broad-leaved deciduous forests. We investigated how stream geomorphology affects the aquatic insect flux and insectivorous bird abundance in 26 riparian-forest plots during spring season in northern Japan. Lateral dispersal of emergent aquatic insects into the riparian forest exponentially decreased with distance from the stream. Similar to aquatic insect distribution, flycatchers and gleaners concentrated their foraging attacks around the stream channel, preying intensively upon emergent aquatic insects. In contrast, bark probers consumed fewer emergent aquatic insects. The abundance of flycatchers and gleaners was closely related to stream geomorphology, whereas that of bark probers was associated with snag density in the study plots. A path analysis showed that the study plots with longer stream channels had greater aquatic insect abundance. This can be interpreted as a consequence of the increased amount of both stream edge and stream surface, where emergent aquatic insects readily penetrate. The increased flux of aquatic insects by stream meanders elevated gleaner abundance in the study plots. In addition, their abundance was directly affected by stream length per se. On the other hand, flycatcher abundance was only directly affected by stream length. Flycatchers, which mainly consumed emergent aquatic insects in the air, may have increased in response to the increase in suitable foraging sites (i.e., open spaces adjacent to perches) accompanying longer stream channels. Although the causal links affecting bird abundance differed among guilds, meandering streams apparently support abundant insectivorous birds in riparian forests. Therefore, to conserve riparian bird communities, it will be necessary to maintain the functions of stream geomorphology that affect the magnitude of energy transfer across the forest-stream interface.

AB Simile is a visual modelling environment that has been developed to overcome the problems involved in implementing agro-ecological simulation models using conventional programming languages: problems such as the effort and skill needed to program the models, the lack of transparency in models implemented as programs, and the lack of reuseability of models and submodels. It combines the familiar System Dynamics (compartment-flow) paradigm with an object-based paradigm, allowing many forms of disaggregation to be handled, as well as spatial modelling and individual-based modelling. Its visual modelling interface makes it accessible to non-programmers, at the same time allowing models to be largely self-documenting. Models can be run very efficiently as compiled C ++ programs, and users can develop new visualisation tools for displaying model results. Simile has been used in international research programmes, including the modelling of Mediterranean vegetation dynamics and modelling the interaction between households and land at the forest margin in developing countries. Simile has been developed in a spirit of open standards for model sharing. Models are saved as a text file in a structured format, with a view to enable model sharing with other modelling environments and to encourage others to develop additional tools for working with models.

AB In this study, the dynamics of soil thermal, hydrologic, and ecosystem processes were coupled to project how the carbon budgets of boreal forests will respond to changes in atmospheric CO2, climate, and fire disturbance. The ability of the model to simulate gross primary production and ecosystem respiration was verified for a mature black spruce ecosystem in Canada, the age-dependent pattern of the simulated vegetation carbon was verified with inventory data on aboveground growth of Alaskan black spruce forests, and the model was applied to a postfire chronosequence in interior Alaska. The comparison between the simulated soil temperature and field-based estimates during the growing season (May to September) of 1997 revealed that the model was able to accurately simulate monthly temperatures at 10 cm (R>0. 93) for control and burned stands of the fire chronosequence. Similarly, the simulated and field-based estimates of soil respiration for control and burned stands were correlated (R=0.84 and 0.74 for control and burned stands, respectively). The simulated and observed decadal to century-scale dynamics of soil temperature and carbon dynamics, which are represented by mean monthly values of these variables during the growing season, were correlated among stands (R=0.93 and 0.71 for soil temperature at 20- and 10-cm depths, R=0.95 and 0.91 for soil respiration and soil carbon, respectively). Sensitivity analyses indicate that along with differences in fire and climate history a number of other factors influence the response of carbon dynamics to fire disturbance. These factors include nitrogen fixation, the growth of moss, changes in the depth of the organic layer, soil drainage, and fire severity.

AB The structure of North Sea benthic invertebrate and fish communities is an important indicator of anthropogenic and environmental impacts. Although North Sea fish stocks are monitored regularly, benthic fauna are not. Here, we report the results of a survey carried out in 2000, in which five nations sampled the epibenthic and fish fauna at 270 stations throughout the North Sea. The aim of the survey was to investigate the diversity and community structure of epibenthic and fish communities and to identify relationships with environmental factors, including the frequency of commercial otter and beam trawling disturbance. Epibenthic species diversity was lower in the southern North Sea than in central and northern areas. Fish, conversely, were more diverse in the south. The 50 m, 100 m and 200 m depth contours broadly defined the boundaries of benthic and fish communities. The abundance of epibenthos of the southern North Sea was dominated by free-living species, whilst north of the 50 m contour sessile species prevailed. A hybrid area, with sessile species typical of the north and free-living species characteristic of the south, was found off the Norfolk and Flamborough coast stretching towards the Dogger Bank.
   Large-scale hydrodynamic phenomena were most likely to be responsible for the main divisions between communities, especially the boundary between mixed and stratified water masses. However, bottom temperature, sediment parameters and beam trawling were closely correlated with species richness and diversity, as well as community patterns, and may modify regional species composition.
   Our study shows that effective large-scale sampling of benthic communities can be conducted during existing fisheries surveys. Since annual fisheries surveys are conducted throughout the northeast Atlantic shelf seas, concurrent benthic surveys would allow benthic sampling on unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. The samples would help to monitor the environmental impacts of trawling disturbance, climate change, pollution and other natural and anthropogenic factors.

AB Infauna diversity is reported from the Sabellaria alveolata reefs in the bay of Mont Saint-Michel in France, known as the greatest European reef formation. Polychactes dominate the fauna, but other species also play a role in terms of reef functioning. Species richness of the associated infauna is much higher than that of the surrounding sediments and is concentrated mainly on the reef surface. Species richness clearly varied according to the three stages of reef evolution: the 'degraded' reef stage is different from the 'ball-shaped structure' and 'platform' stages. Multivariate analyses indicate that three species communities can be distinguished, each corresponding to a different stage of reef development. The number of species is very high, but only a few species are restricted to a particular reef stage. Variations of surface topography and spatial heterogeneity can explain unusual associations of species that make infauna associated with S. alveolata reefs very unique.
   Moreover, the high densities of S. alveolata (up to 60,000 ind m(-2)) raise questions regarding the role of the reefs in the ecosystem of the bay. Anthropogenic influences, notably mechanical disturbances due to fishing activity, show a steady increase and may have a serious impact on the assemblage diversity and the ecological stability of the reef, even though recolonization of S. alveolata is possible in degraded reef areas. An important question that must be addressed is whether human activities could influence the role of S. alveolata reefs in the bay of Mont Saint-Michel.

AB There are many reports on a positive relationship between tallness and socioeconomic success, and between tallness and health in the human male. Accordingly, tallness is an explanatory variable in many studies on health or behavior. Recently, a positive correlation of tallness with fitness has been reported. However, whether this fitness advantage is the effect of the socioeconomic success of tall men (making them good providers) or of body height itself (tallness being directly associated with some genes, i.e., not requiring the father's presence, that are favorable for offspring number or survival) remains unclear. The exact type of selection (against short men, favoring men around some above-average height, favoring only very tall men) also remains unclear. Here, for a cohort of military officers, we show that tallness had a indirect effect on male lifetime fitness, independent of socioeconomic success. The crucial factor was not that tall men had more fecund wives, but that tall men more often had a second family. Selection worked strongly in favor of very tall men, not just against short men. Since there were no hints of any evolutionary check on this selection, these findings suggest unconstrained directional selection for tallness in men.

AB Field boundaries and fields on 22 pairs of organic and conventional farms in England and Wales were surveyed over three breeding seasons (April-July) and two autumn (September-November) and winter (December-February) periods in order to ascertain whether organic and conventional farms differed in the size and diversity of their associated bird populations. Species diversity was significantly higher on organic farms in the 1994 breeding season, but in no other year or season. Of 18 species, eight showed a significantly higher density on organic field boundaries in at least one season/year, with a greater number of significant results being detected in the autumn. There were very few significant differences in bird density in fields outside the breeding season. The density of breeding skylarks Alauda arvensis, the principal field nesting species, was significantly greater on organic farms in one breeding season. Hedges tended to be higher and wider, field boundaries tended to have more trees and field sizes tended to be smaller on organic farms. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that components of habitat structure were important in explaining differences in bird density between farm types for certain species.

AB A transplant experiment was carried out on the Moor House National Nature Reserve, Cumbria, UK, and two sites with different climatic characteristics were selected for determining how Enchytraeids, Diptera larvae and Tardigrades respond to changes in climate. The soil was a cambic stagnohumic gley, characterized by a high organic matter content and low pH. Vegetated soil cores were taken from near the summit of Great Dun Fell (GDF) and used for the transplant experiment. Cores were then placed back at GDF (845 m) and also transplanted to Sink Beck (SNK, 480 m), providing a mean annual temperature increase of 2.5 degrees C. In order to discriminate between the effects of temperature and rainfall on the size and vertical distribution patterns of the fauna, a further series of lysimeters were established at SNK, and rainfall inputs were manipulated, intending to provide a total input equivalent to the ambient rainfall at the top site. At regular intervals, a number of cores were destructively sampled from each treatment (top site-GDF; lower site-SNK; enhanced rainfall inputs-SNK) and the vertical distribution of the soil fauna determined. Enchytraeidae, Tardigrada and Diptera were commonly found in soil samples at the Reserve and appeared sensitive to the imposed changes in temperature and moisture. Different species of enchytraeids responded differently: numbers of Cognettia sphagnetorum were correlated positively with temperature, whereas their vertical distribution was determined by moisture. Cernosvitoviella atrata was unable to avoid dry conditions which apparently caused severe mortality when exposed to the elevated temperatures; Achaeta eiseni was a more tolerant species, increasing in numbers with increasing temperature. Diptera larvae appeared to be dependent on the moisture status of the upper soil layers and their populations were reduced at higher temperatures and lower moisture contents. By contrast, tardigrades were able to survive adverse conditions by entering an anhydrobiotic stage, recovering when seasonal climate improved. General trends in soil faunal responses to climatological changes in the UK are predicted. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB A method for structural analysis of multivariate data is proposed that combines features of regression analysis and principal component analysis. In this method, the original data are first decomposed into several components according to external information. The components are then subjected to principal component analysis to explore structures within the components. It is shown that this requires the generalized singular value decomposition of a matrix with certain metric matrices. The numerical method based on the QR decomposition is described, which simplifies the computation considerably. The proposed method includes a number of interesting special cases, whose relations to existing methods are discussed. Examples are given to demonstrate practical uses of the method.

AB More than 200 years ago, Alexander von Humboldt reported that tropical plant species richness decreased with increasing elevation and decreasing temperature. Surprisingly, coordinated patterns in plant, bacterial, and fungal diversity on tropical mountains have not yet been observed, despite the central role of soil microorganisms in terrestrial biogeochemistry and ecology. We studied an Andean transect traversing 3.5 km in elevation to test whether the species diversity and composition of tropical forest plants, soil bacteria, and fungi follow similar biogeographical patterns with shared environmental drivers. We found coordinated changes with elevation in all three groups: species richness declined as elevation increased, and the compositional dissimilarity among communities increased with increased separation in elevation, although changes in plant diversity were larger than in bacteria and fungi. Temperature was the dominant driver of these diversity gradients, with weak influences of edaphic properties, including soil pH. The gradients in microbial diversity were strongly correlated with the activities of enzymes involved in organic matter cycling, and were accompanied by a transition in microbial traits towards slower-growing, oligotrophic taxa at higher elevations. We provide the first evidence of coordinated temperature-driven patterns in the diversity and distribution of three major biotic groups in tropical ecosystems: soil bacteria, fungi, and plants. These findings suggest that interrelated and fundamental patterns of plant and microbial communities with shared environmental drivers occur across landscape scales. These patterns are revealed where soil pH is relatively constant, and have implications for tropical forest communities under future climate change.

AB Aging has been assumed to go along with deficient inhibitory processes in cognitive performance. According to this inhibition deficit hypothesis, older adults are less able to suppress or ignore irrelevant thoughts and actions than young adults are. This hypothesis has been investigated in a large number of studies. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether there is an inhibition deficit in older age and whether this deficit is general or task-specific. We selected 176 studies in which young and older adults were tested on tasks commonly assumed to measure inhibition (i.e., the color Stroop, flanker, Simon, stop-signal, go/no-go, global-local, positive and negative compatibility tasks, as well as the paradigm assessing n-2 repetition costs in task switching). For most tasks (i.e., the color Stroop, flanker, and local tasks, as well as the n-2 repetition costs), the results speak against an inhibition deficit in older age. Only in a few tasks (i.e., the go/no-go and stop-signal tasks), older adults showed impaired inhibition. Moreover, for four tasks (i.e., the Simon, global, positive and negative compatibility tasks), the results suggest that more studies are necessary to draw a firm conclusion. Together, the present findings call into question the hypothesis of a general inhibition deficit in older age.

AB Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SiF) is increasingly used as a proxy for vegetation canopy photosynthesis. While ground-based, airborne, and satellite observations have demonstrated a strong linear relationship between SiF and gross primary production (GPP) at seasonal scales, their relationships at high temporal resolution across diurnal to seasonal scales remain unclear. In this study, far-red canopy SiF, GPP, and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) were continuously monitored using automated spectral systems and an eddy flux tower over an entire growing season in a rice paddy. At half-hourly resolution, strong linear relationships between SiF and GPP (R-2 = 0.76) and APAR and GPP (R-2 = 0.76) for the whole growing season were observed. We found that relative humidity, diffuse PAR fraction, and growth stage influenced the relationships between SiF and GPP, and APAR and GPP, and incorporating those factors into multiple regression analysis led to improvements up to R-2 = 0.83 and R-2 = 0.88, respectively. Relationships between LUEp ( = GPP/APAR) and LUEf ( = SiF/APAR) were inconsistent at half-hourly and weak at daily resolutions (R 2 = 0.24). Both at diurnal and seasonal time scales with half-hourly resolution, we found considerably stronger linear relationships between SiF and APAR than between either SiF and GPP or APAR and GPP. Overall, our results indicate that for subdiurnal temporal resolution, canopy SiF in the rice paddy is above all a very good proxy for APAR at diurnal and seasonal time scales and that therefore SiF-based GPP estimation needs to take into account relevant environmental information to model LUEp. These findings can help develop mechanistic links between canopy SiF and GPP across multiple temporal scales.

AB Forest ecosystems are an integral component of the global carbon cycle as they take up and release large amounts of C over short time periods (C flux) or accumulate it over longer time periods (C stock). However, there remains uncertainty about whether and in which direction C fluxes and in particular C stocks may differ between forests of high versus low species richness. Based on a comprehensive dataset derived from field-based measurements, we tested the effect of species richness (3-20 tree species) and stand age (22-116 years) on six compartments of above-and below-ground C stocks and four components of C fluxes in subtropical forests in southeast China. Across forest stands, total C stock was 149 +/- 12 Mg ha(-1) with richness explaining 28.5% and age explaining 29.4% of variation in this measure. Species-rich stands had higher C stocks and fluxes than stands with low richness; and, in addition, old stands had higher C stocks than young ones. Overall, for each additional tree species, the total C stock increased by 6.4%. Our results provide comprehensive evidence for diversity-mediated above-and below-ground C sequestration in species-rich subtropical forests in southeast China. Therefore, afforestation policies in this region and elsewhere should consider a change from the current focus on monocultures to multi-species plantations to increase C fixation and thus slow increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and global warming.

AB Many municipalities assert bicycle sharing systems (BSS) as having many benefits, justifying their adoption, yet few explicitly state the purpose of their system making comparison or determination of success impossible. In addition, the apprehension of many BSS operators to share data further hinders comparison. This paper estimates the number of daily trips from publicly available data for 75 BSS case studies across the world and provides trips per bike per day scores as a comparison of performance and success. Results reveal that a third of case studies have fewer than the psychologically important one trip per bicycle per day. To ascertain what factors are associated with this metric we estimate models with independent variables related to system attributes, station density, weather, geography and transportation infrastructure. Our analysis provides strong evidence undermining the 'network effect' promoted by influential BSS policy makers that expanding system size increases performance. Finally our results describe and discuss causal variables associated with higher BSS performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biochar has been increasingly recommended for world agriculture, but the effects on microbial activities in agricultural soils has not yet thoroughly assessed. In this study, using a meta analysis of experiment data retrieved from literature published up to March 1, 2015, changes were examined in microbial biomass and soil respiration in agricultural soils with biochar addition. Microbial responses to biochar addition were quantified in soil respiration quotient (RQ), microbial quotient (MQ) and metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) and their differences were evaluated between with and without biochar addition, and among groups of biochar production conditions and experiment conditions. There was an overall increase by 25% in soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) and nitrogen (SMBN) but a decrease by 13% in qCO(2), under biochar compared to the control. Whereas, microbial biomass carbon was increased by 26% but total soil CO2 production unchanged, across all short term experiments up to 6 months following a single biochar addition. A significant reduction (by <20%) in qCO(2) was found under crop residue and manure biochars in term of feedstock, and biochars pyrolyzed at high temperature over 500 degrees C in term of pyrolysis temperature. Whereas, the reduction was great (by over 30%) both in clay soils and in neutral soils but moderate (by 15%) in soil organic carbon (SOC) depleted soils, respectively in terms of soil texture, reaction and SOC level. Thus, soil conditions exerted great impacts on microbial metabolic quotient changes compared to biochar conditions. Nevertheless, microbial responses to biochar addition to agricultural soils were much uncertain with respect to both biochar and experiment conditions. Long term field experiments are still deserved to monitor soil microbial processes as long as sustainable soil managements are concerned with biochar technology in agriculture. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The elevational diversity pattern for microorganisms has received great attention recently but is still understudied, and phylogenetic relatedness is rarely studied for microbial elevational distributions. Using a bar-coded pyrosequencing technique, we examined the biodiversity patterns for soil bacterial communities of tundra ecosystem along 2000-2500 m elevations on Changbai Mountain in China. Bacterial taxonomic richness displayed a linear decreasing trend with increasing elevation. Phylogenetic diversity and mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD) exhibited a unimodal pattern with elevation. Bacterial communities were more phylogenetically clustered than expected by chance at all elevations based on the standardized effect size of MNTD metric. The bacterial communities differed dramatically among elevations, and the community composition was significantly correlated with soil total carbon (TC), total nitrogen, C:N ratio, and dissolved organic carbon. Multiple ordinary least squares regression analysis showed that the observed biodiversity patterns strongly correlated with soil TC and C:N ratio. Taken together, this is the first time that a significant bacterial diversity pattern has been observed across a small-scale elevational gradient. Our results indicated that soil carbon and nitrogen contents were the critical environmental factors affecting bacterial elevational distribution in Changbai Mountain tundra. This suggested that ecological niche-based environmental filtering processes related to soil carbon and nitrogen contents could play a dominant role in structuring bacterial communities along the elevational gradient.

AB We propose a general methodology for the construction and analysis of essentially minimax estimators for a wide class of functionals of finite dimensional parameters, and elaborate on the case of discrete distributions, where the support size S is unknown and may be comparable with or even much larger than the number of observations n. We treat the respective regions where the functional is nonsmooth and smooth separately. In the nonsmooth regime, we apply an unbiased estimator for the best polynomial approximation of the functional whereas, in the smooth regime, we apply a bias-corrected version of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). We illustrate the merit of this approach by thoroughly analyzing the performance of the resulting schemes for estimating two important information measures: 1) the entropy H(P) = Sigma(S)(i=1)-p(i) ln p(i) and 2) F-alpha(P) = Sigma(S)(i=1) p(i)(alpha), alpha > 0. We obtain the minimax L-2 rates for estimating these functionals. In particular, we demonstrate that our estimator achieves the optimal sample complexity n similar to S/ln S for entropy estimation. We also demonstrate that the sample complexity for estimating F-alpha(P), 0 < alpha < 1, is n similar to S-1/alpha/ln S, which can be achieved by our estimator but not the MLE. For 1 < alpha < 3/2, we show the minimax L-2 rate for estimating F-alpha(P) is (n ln n)(-2(alpha-1)) for infinite support size, while the maximum L-2 rate for the MLE is n(-2(alpha-1)). For all the above cases, the behavior of the minimax rate-optimal estimators with n samples is essentially that of the MLE (plug-in rule) with n ln n samples, which we term "effective sample size enlargement." We highlight the practical advantages of our schemes for the estimation of entropy and mutual information. We compare our performance with various existing approaches, and demonstrate that our approach reduces running time and boosts the accuracy. Moreover, we show that the minimax rate-optimal mutual information estimator yielded by our framework leads to significant performance boosts over the Chow-Liu algorithm in learning graphical models. The wide use of information measure estimation suggests that the insights and estimators obtained in this paper could be broadly applicable.

AB Polymorphic species, in which multiple variants coexist within a population, are often used as model systems in evolutionary biology. Recent research has been dominated by the hypothesis that polymorphism can be a precursor to speciation. To date, the majority of research regarding polymorphism and speciation has focused on whether polymorphism is maintained within a population or whether morphs within populations may diverge to form separate species (sympatric speciation); however, the geographical context of speciation in polymorphic systems is likely to be both diverse and complex. In this review, we draw attention to the geographic variation in morph composition and frequencies that characterises many, if not most polymorphic species. Recent theoretical and empirical developments suggest that such variation in the number, type and frequency of morphs present among populations can increase the probability of speciation. Thus, the geographical context of a polymorphism requires a greater research focus. Here, we review the prevalence, causes and evolutionary consequences of geographic variation in polymorphism in colour-polymorphic animal species. The prevalence and nature of geographic variation in polymorphism suggests that polymorphism may be a precursor to and facilitate speciation more commonly than appreciated previously. We argue that a better understanding of the processes generating geographic variation in polymorphism is vital to understanding how polymorphism can promote speciation.

AB The present study analyses the effects of the physical characteristics of the visual landscape on sound-scape perception in city parks, based on information gathered in field surveys using a specifically designed soundwalk method in five city parks in China. Three soundscape parameters were conceived, including perceived loudness of individual sounds (PLS), perceived occurrences of individual sounds (POS) and soundscape diversity index (SDI), which were found to correlate and should thus be applied in concert. Physical characteristics of the visual landscape were analysed from two perspectives, i.e., by on-site landscape composition and local landscape spatial patterns. The results suggest that the percentage of buildings, vegetation and sky in panoramic views (here photos) were effective landscape elements influencing soundscape perception. The landscape shape index of buildings and water areas (LSI_B, LSI_W) and the patch cohesion index of water areas (COHESION_W) showed positive effects on the perception of human sounds. The percentage of roads (PLAND_R) and the largest patch index of roads (LPI_R) were related to traffic sounds. Both the PLS and POS of biological sounds were negatively related to LPI_W and LSI_B, respectively, whilst the POS of biological sounds was positively related to PLAND_R, and LSI_R. COHESION_R was the only index negatively related to both the PLS and POS of geophysical sounds. SDI only showed positive relationship with PLAND_W. Overall, the results reveal that local landscape spatial patterns could be more influential on soundscape perception than on-site landscape composition. The study proposed introducing soundscape information from different sources into landscape management. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Recent advances in spring arrival dates have been reported in many migratory species but the mechanism driving these advances is unknown. As population declines are most widely reported in species that are not advancing migration, there is an urgent need to identify the mechanisms facilitating and constraining these advances. Individual plasticity in timing of migration in response to changing climatic conditions is commonly proposed to drive these advances but plasticity in individual migratory timings is rarely observed. For a shore-bird population that has significantly advanced migration in recent decades, we show that individual arrival dates are highly consistent between years, but that the arrival dates of new recruits to the population are significantly earlier now than in previous years. Several mechanisms could drive advances in recruit arrival, none of which require individual plasticity or rapid evolution of migration timings. In particular, advances in nest-laying dates could result in advanced recruit arrival, if benefits of early hatching facilitate early subsequent spring migration. This mechanism could also explain why arrival dates of short-distance migrants, which generally return to breeding sites earlier and have greater scope for advance laying, are advancing more rapidly than long-distance migrants.

AB In temperate ecosystems, acidic forest soils are among the most nutrient-poor terrestrial environments. In this context, the long-term differentiation of the forest soils into horizons may impact the assembly and the functions of the soil microbial communities. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the ecology and functional potentials of these microbial communities, a suite of analyses including comparative metagenomics was applied on independent soil samples from a spruce plantation (Breuil-Chenue, France). The objectives were to assess whether the decreasing nutrient bioavailability and pH variations that naturally occurs between the organic and mineral horizons affects the soil microbial functional biodiversity. The 14 Gbp of pyrosequencing and Illumina sequences generated in this study revealed complex microbial communities dominated by bacteria. Detailed analyses showed that the organic soil horizon was significantly enriched in sequences related to Bacteria, Chordata, Arthropoda and Ascomycota. On the contrary the mineral horizon was significantly enriched in sequences related to Archaea. Our analyses also highlighted that the microbial communities inhabiting the two soil horizons differed significantly in their functional potentials according to functional assays and MG-RAST analyses, suggesting a functional specialisation of these microbial communities. Consistent with this specialisation, our shotgun metagenomic approach revealed a significant increase in the relative abundance of sequences related glycoside hydrolases in the organic horizon compared to the mineral horizon that was significantly enriched in glycoside transferases. This functional stratification according to the soil horizon was also confirmed by a significant correlation between the functional assays performed in this study and the functional metagenomic analyses. Together, our results suggest that the soil stratification and particularly the soil resource availability impact the functional diversity and to a lesser extent the taxonomic diversity of the bacterial communities.

AB This is the first complete inventory of alien vascular plant taxa for the Slovak Republic. The presented database contains information on family affiliation, residence status, invasion status, time of introduction, mode of introduction, planting purpose, abundance and distribution within phytogeographic regions, types of invaded habitats and syntaxa, and life forms and geographical origin of the alien taxa. In total, 21.5% of the total flora is made of up of alien taxa, comprised of 282 archaeophytes that make up 6.6% and 634 neophytes 14.9% of the total number of taxa, respectively. The majority of the alien taxa are casuals (57.6%), 39.1% are naturalized and 3.3% invasive. Most of them come from Europe (32.8%) and Asia (32.8%), followed by Africa (12.2%) and North America (10.8%). The database contains members of 98 families of which the Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Poaceae, Amaranthaceae and Rosaceae are the most represented. Almost 50% of the alien taxa are therophytes. Hemicryptophytes (26.3%) and phanerophytes (15.6%) are also abundant. More of the alien taxa were introduced deliberately (49.0%) than unintentionally (43.9%), and the majority were introduced as ornamental plants (55.9%). Of the total number of alien taxa, 45.2% are recorded from less than five localities. Most of them prefer human-made habitats; they are found in 137 phytosociological alliances, with those richest in alien taxa categorized as synanthropic vegetation.

AB Gene tree topologies have proven a powerful data source for various tasks, including species tree inference and species delimitation. Consequently, methods for computing probabilities of gene trees within species trees have been developed and widely used in probabilistic inference frameworks. All these methods assume an underlying multispecies coalescent model. However, when reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization occur, these methods are inadequate, as they do not account for such events. methods that account for both hybridization and deep coalescence in computing the probability of a gene tree topology currently exist for very limited cases. However, no such methods exist for general cases, owing primarily to the fact that it is currently unknown how to compute the probability of a gene tree topology within the branches of a phylogenetic network. Here we present a novel method for computing the probability of gene tree topologies on phylogenetic networks and demonstrate its application to the inference of hybridization in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting. We reanalyze a Sarcharomyces species data set for which multiple analyses had converged on a species tree candidate. Using our method, though, we show that an evolutionary hypothesis involving hybridization in this group has better support than one of strict divergence. A similar reanalysis on a group of three Drosophila species shows that the data is consistent with hybridization. Further, using extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the power of gene tree topologies at obtaining accurate estimates of branch lengths and hybridization probabilities of a given phylogenetic network. Finally, we discuss identifiability issues with detecting hybridization, particularly in cases that involve extinction or incomplete sampling of taxa.

AB Growth and development rates are fundamental to all living organisms. In a warming world, it is important to determine how these rates will respond to increasing temperatures. It is often assumed that the thermal responses of physiological rates are coupled to metabolic rate and thus have the same temperature dependence. However, the existence of the temperature-size rule suggests that intraspecific growth and development are decoupled. Decoupling of these rates would have important consequences for individual species and ecosystems, yet this has not been tested systematically across a range of species. We conducted an analysis on growth and development rate data compiled from the literature for a well-studied group, marine pelagic copepods, and use an information-theoretic approach to test which equations best describe these rates. Growth and development rates were best characterized by models with significantly different parameters: development has stronger temperature dependence than does growth across all life stages. As such, it is incorrect to assume that these rates have the same temperature dependence. We used the best-fit models for these rates to predict changes in organism mass in response to temperature. These predictions follow a concave relationship, which complicates attempts to model the impacts of increasing global temperatures on species body size.

AB Fibroblasts from patients with the severe laminopathy diseases, restrictive dermopathy (RD) and Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), are characterized by poor growth in culture, the presence of abnormally shaped nuclei and the accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). Here we show that the accumulation of DSB and poor growth of the fibroblasts but not the presence of abnormally shaped nuclei are caused by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and greater sensitivity to oxidative stress. Basal levels of ROS and sensitivity to H(2)O(2) were compared in fibroblasts from normal, RD and HGPS individuals using fluorescence activated cell sorting-based assays. Basal levels of ROS and stimulated levels of ROS were both 5-fold higher in the progeria fibroblasts. Elevated levels of ROS were correlated with lower proliferation indices but not with the presence of abnormally shaped nuclei. DSB induced by etoposide were repaired efficiently in normal, RD and HGPS fibroblasts. In contrast, DSB induced by ROS were repaired efficiently in normal fibroblasts, but in RD and HGPS fibroblasts many ROS-induced DSB were un-repairable. The accumulation of ROS-induced DSB appeared to cause the poor growth of RD and HGPS fibroblasts, since culture in the presence of the ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) reduced the basal levels of DSB, eliminated un-repairable ROS-induced DSB and greatly improved population-doubling times. Our findings suggest that un-repaired ROS-induced DSB contribute significantly to the RD and HGPS phenotypes and that inclusion of NAC in a combinatorial therapy might prove beneficial to HGPS patients.

AB P>Understanding the adaptive basis of life history variation is a central goal in evolutionary ecology. The use of model species enables the combination of molecular mechanistic knowledge with ecological and evolutionary questions, but the study of life history variation in natural environments is required to merge these disciplines.
   Here, we tested for clinal variation in life history and associated traits along an environmental and altitudinal gradient in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. Seventeen natural populations of A. thaliana were geo-referenced in north-eastern Spain on a gradient in which precipitation increases but maximum spring temperature and minimum winter temperature decrease with altitude.
   One hundred and eighty-nine genotypes from the 17 populations were grown under uniform controlled conditions. Variations in traits related to biomass allocation, fecundity, phenology and vegetative growth were tested for relationships with the altitude and climatic variables associated with the home sites. Above-ground mass, number of rosette leaves at bolting, developmental time and seed weight increased with the home site's altitude. Root allocation, vegetative growth during winter and number of seeds decreased with altitude.
   We suggest that the differences among home sites provide clues to the variation in adaptive strategies associated with the climatic gradient. We compared these results with adaptations and clinal relationships reported for other species and with molecular mechanisms described in Arabidopsis.

AB Radiocarbon-dated pollen and diatom records from Lake Kotokel in southern Siberia help to reconstruct the environmental history of the area since similar to 47 kyr BP. Pollen spectra composition and reconstructed biome scores suggest predominance of a tundra-steppe vegetation and variable woody cover (5-20%) between similar to 47 and 30 kyr BP, indicating generally a harsh and unstable climate during this interval, conventionally regarded as the interstadial within the last glacial. The short-term climate amelioration episodes in the glacial part of the records are marked by the peaks in taiga and corresponding minima in steppe biome scores and appear synchronously with the hemispheric temperature and precipitation changes recorded in the Greenland ice cores and Chinese stalagmites. Transition to full glacial environments occurred between 32 and 30 kyr BP. The interval at similar to 30-24 kyr BP was probably the driest and coldest of the whole record, as indicated by highest scores for steppe biome, woody coverage <5%, absence of diatoms and reduced size of the lake. A slight amelioration of the regional climate at similar to 24-22 kyr BP was followed by a shorter than the previous and less pronounced deterioration phase. The late-glacial (similar to 17-11.65 kyr BP) is marked by a gradual increase in tree/shrub pollen percentages and re-appearance of diatoms. After 14.7 kyr BP the climate became warmer and wetter than ever during similar to 47-14.7 kyr BP, resulting in the deepening of the lake and increase in the woody coverage to 20-30% similar to 14.5-14 kyr and similar to 13.3-12.8 kyr BP. These two intervals correspond to the Meiendorf and Altered interstadials, which until now were interpreted as part of the undifferentiated Bolling/Allerod interstadial complex in the Lake Baikal region. The increase in tundra biome scores and pronounced change in the diatom composition allow (for the first time) the unambiguous identification of the Younger Dryas (YD) in the Lake Baikal region at similar to 12.7-11.65 kyr BP, in agreement with the formal definition and dating of the YD based on the Greenland NGRIP ice core records. The maximal spread of the taiga communities in the region is associated with a warmer and wetter climate than the present prior to similar to 7 kyr BP. This was followed by a wide spread of Scots pine, indicating the onset of modern environments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Invasions of non-native species are considered to have significant impacts on native species, but few studies have quantified the direct effects of invasions on native community structure and composition. Many studies on the effects of invasions fail to distinguish between (1) differential responses of native and non-native species to environmental conditions, and (2) direct impacts of invasions on native communities. In particular, invasions may alter community assembly following disturbance and prevent recolonization of native species. To determine if invasions directly impact native communities, we established 32 experimental plots (27.5 m(2)) and seeded them with 12 native species. Then, we added seed of a non-native invasive grass (Microstegium vimineum) to half of the plots and compared native plant community responses between control and invaded plots. Invasion reduced native biomass by 46, 64, and 58%, respectively, over three growing seasons. After the second year of the experiment, invaded plots had 43% lower species richness and 38% lower diversity as calculated from the Shannon index. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination showed a significant divergence in composition between invaded and control plots. Further, there was a strong negative relationship between invader and native plant biomass, signifying that native plants are more strongly suppressed in densely invaded areas. Our results show that a non-native invasive plant inhibits native species establishment and growth following disturbance and that native species do not gain competitive dominance after multiple growing seasons. Thus, plant invaders can alter the structure of native plant communities and reduce the success of restoration efforts.

AB P>1. A positive interspecific abundance-occupancy relationship is one of the most robust patterns in macroecology. Yet, the mechanisms driving this pattern are poorly understood. Here, we use biological traits of freshwater macroinvertebrates to gain a mechanistic understanding and disentangle the various explanations. We ask whether mechanisms underlying the abundance-occupancy relationship differ between species, and whether information on individual species can be used to explain their contribution to the interspecific relationship.
   2. We test the hypothesis that the importance of metapopulation dynamics or niche differences in explaining the relationship differs between species, varying in relation to their habitat breadth. In addition, we analyse how a species' biological traits shape its habitat breadth and its abundance and occupancy.
   3. The abundance and occupancy of the 234 different aquatic macroinvertebrate species were strongly and positively related. Marked differences were found between habitat specialists and habitat generalists in the goodness-of-fit of abundance-occupancy relationships. The occupancy-frequency distribution was bimodal for habitat generalists, allowing 'satellite species' to be distinguished from 'core species'.
   4. Habitat generalists appeared to be more widespread but less abundant than habitat specialists, suggesting that the jack-of-all-trades may be master-of-none. Species traits (trophic position and other life-history traits) explained a significant part of the variation around the general relationship. Among habitat specialists, more species showed synchronized life cycles, a low dispersal capacity or clustered oviposition, being better adapted to predictable habitats. Among habitat generalists, more species had long-lived adults, spreading reproductive effort in time and space, and were strong dispersers, being better adapted to unpredictable habitats.
   5. Interspecific abundance-occupancy relationships can be best understood by examining the contribution of individual species. For habitat specialists, the interplay between niche differences (diet and habitat use) and the underlying spatial distribution of environmental conditions result in competitive displacement and differences in species' success. For habitat generalists, differences in colonization and extinction rates between species are more important. Therefore, both metapopulation dynamics and niche differences can operate simultaneously but apply to different species, thus constituting different endpoints of the same continuum.

AB P>Climate change will very likely affect most forests in Amazonia during the course of the 21st century, but the direction and intensity of the change are uncertain, in part because of differences in rainfall projections. In order to constrain this uncertainty, we estimate the probability for biomass change in Amazonia on the basis of rainfall projections that are weighted by climate model performance for current conditions.
   We estimate the risk of forest dieback by using weighted rainfall projections from 24 general circulation models (GCMs) to create probability density functions (PDFs) for future forest biomass changes simulated by a dynamic vegetation model (LPJmL).
   Our probabilistic assessment of biomass change suggests a likely shift towards increasing biomass compared with nonweighted results. Biomass estimates range between a gain of 6.2 and a loss of 2.7 kg carbon m-2 for the Amazon region, depending on the strength of CO2 fertilization.
   The uncertainty associated with the long-term effect of CO2 is much larger than that associated with precipitation change. This underlines the importance of reducing uncertainties in the direct effects of CO2 on tropical ecosystems.

AB Tests for comparing the locations of two independent populations are associated with different null hypotheses, but results are often interpreted as evidence for or against equality of means or medians. We examine the appropriateness of this practice by investigating the performance of five frequently used tests: the two-sample T test, the Welch U test, the Yuen-Welch test, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, and the Brunner-Munzel test. Under combined violations of normality and variance homogeneity, the true significance level and power of the tests depend on a complex interplay of several factors. In a wide ranging simulation study, we consider scenarios differing in skewness, skewness heterogeneity, variance heterogeneity, sample size, and sample size ratio. We find that small differences in distribution properties can alter test performance markedly, thus confounding the effort to present simple test recommendations. Instead, we provide detailed recommendations in Appendix A. The Welch U test is recommended most frequently, but cannot be considered an omnibus test for this problem. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Precipitation plays an important role in the dynamics of species found in arid and semiarid environments. However, population fluctuations generally are driven by a combination of multiple factors whose relative contribution may vary through time and among species. We monitored fluctuations of species in three trophic levels for >17 years at a semiarid community in north-central Chile. The region is strongly affected by the El Nino Southern Oscillation, resulting in high variation in rainfall that triggers dramatic changes in food resource availability, with strong effects on upper trophic levels. We focused our analyses on the role played by endogenous and exogenous (climatic) factors on the dynamics of two important rodent species in the community, Octodon degus and Phyllotis darwini. We documented population fluctuations of several orders of magnitude in response to wet and dry episodes of different strength and duration. P. darwini reached similar maximum densities, regardless of the duration of high-rainfall events, whereas O. degus showed additive effects of multiple wet years. Time series diagnostic tools revealed oscillations with a 5-year periodicity in rainfall, which may be the cause of the same periodicity and a weak second-order signal observed in the rodent dynamics. However, the dynamics of both rodent species were dominated by strong first-order processes, suggesting an important role of direct density dependence. Intraspecific competition, expressed as the ratio of rodent density/rainfall (or food resources) explained more than two-thirds of the variation in the population rate of change, whereas less than one-third was explained by lagged rainfall (or food resources). We detected no significant effects of predation. Our results contribute to a growing number of examples of dynamics governed by the combined effect of density dependence and climatic forcing. They also reveal strong bottom-up regulation that may be common in other arid environments.

AB Restoration of habitats invaded by non-native plants should include both the removal of invasive plants and re-establishment of native plant communities. To develop appropriate restoration strategies and quantify the effects of invasions, experiments that evaluate multiple removal methods and native community responses to those removal methods are needed.
   We evaluated the response of native plant communities to removal of the invasive grass Microstegium vimineum (Japanese stiltgrass) in eastern forests in the USA. At eight field sites in southern Indiana, we applied three common removal treatments and compared native community responses among treatments and to untreated reference plots.
   After 2 years of treatment, native community responses to Microstegium removal varied significantly among methods and plant functional groups in autumn 2006. Graminoid richness was greater when the invader was removed with hand-weeding, while graminoid biomass was lower in plots treated with post-emergent herbicide compared to reference plots. Forb richness was greater with hand-weeding and post-emergent herbicide compared to plots treated with post-emergent plus pre-emergent herbicides or untreated plots. Forb biomass was greater across all removal treatments. Overall native community diversity was 24% greater when the invasion was removed with hand-weeding and 21% greater with post-emergent herbicide compared to reference plots. No positive response in plant diversity occurred with post-emergent plus pre-emergent herbicide.
   By spring 2007, graminoid percentage cover was greater with hand-weeding but not with herbicide treatments compared to untreated plots. However, forb cover was greater across all removal treatments compared to plots where the invader was not removed. The density of native tree seedlings was 123% greater in post-emergent herbicide treated plots than in untreated plots, indicating that the invasion was inhibiting tree recruitment.
   Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that multiple techniques can be used to control invasive plants but that the responses of native plant communities vary among removal methods. Further, greater native plant diversity and biomass following removal shows that invasions were suppressing native plant communities. Management of plant invasions should consider not only the effectiveness of removal methods but also how different methods influence native plant responses.

AB Interactions between gene flow, spatially variable selection, and genetic drift have long been a central focus of evolutionary research. In contrast, only recently has the potential importance of interactions between these factors for coevolutionary dynamics and the emergence of parasite local adaptation been realized. Here we study host-parasite coevolution in a metapopulation model when both the biotic and the abiotic components of the environment vary in space. We provide a general expression for parasite local adaptation that allows local adaptation to be partitioned into the contributions of spatial covariances between host and parasite genotype frequencies within and between habitats. This partitioning clarifies how relative rates of gene flow, spatially variable patterns of selection, and genetic drift interact to shape parasite local adaptation. Specifically, by using this expression in conjunction with coevolutionary models, we show that genetic drift can dramatically increase the level of parasite local adaptation under some models of specificity. We also show that the effect of migration on parasite local adaptation depends on the geographic mosaic of selection. We discuss how these predictions could be tested empirically or experimentally using microbial systems.

AB Protists, and among them the picoeukaryotes (cells <3 mu m), have been described as significant contributors to both carbon biomass and production in oligotrophic regions of the oceans. However, protist assemblages remain largely undescribed in pelagic ecosystems and in particular in the Indian Ocean. In the present work, we investigated protists along an eastward transect across the sub-tropical gyre of the Indian Ocean (from South Africa to Australia), with a particular focus on picoeukaryotes. We combined inverted and epifluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, pigment analysis, denaturing get gradient electrophoresis (DGGE), 18S rDNA clone libraries, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Overall the picophytoplankton fraction contributed 88% and 90% of total Chl a at the surface and DCM, respectively, with picoeukaryotes accounting for 38% and 50% of total Chl a at the surface and DCM. Considering only the Indian South Subtropical Gyre (ISSG) province, we observed greater shifts in the picoeukaryotic assemblage throughout the upper 200 in of the water column than along the ca. 10,000 kin cruise track. In terms of taxonomic diversity and contribution of each taxon to the picoeukaryotic community, prasinophytes were well represented at more coastal stations with the genus Micromonas reaching densities up to 750 cell mL(-1) in coastal waters and less than 100 cell mL(-1) at open ocean stations. Haptophytes (56% and 45% of picoeukaryotic pigments at surface and DCM, respectively) and possibly pelagophytes (28% and 40% of picoeukaryotic pigments at surface and DCM, respectively) appeared to be dominant at open ocean stations. Other groups and in particular organisms affiliated to chrysophytes, and to a lesser extent to cryptophytes, appear as clear targets for future qualitative and quantitative studies. Moreover, the occurrence of many sequences related to radiolarians (5% and 27% at surface and DCM, respectively) will require further investigation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study addresses the causes and evolutionary consequences of introgressive hybridization in the sympatric species of Darwin's ground finches ( Geospiza) on the small island of Daphne Major in the Gala ' pagos archipelago. Hybridization occurs rarely ( less than 2% of breeding pairs) but persistently across years, usually as a result of imprinting on the song of another species. Hybrids survive well under some ecological conditions, but not others. Hybrids mate according to song type. The resulting introgression increases phenotypic and genetic variation in the backcrossed populations. Effects of introgression on beak shape are determined by the underlying developmental genetic pathways. Introgressive hybridization has been widespread throughout the archipelago in the recent past, andmay have been a persistent feature throughout the early history of the radiation, episodically affecting both the speed and direction of evolution. We discuss how fission through selection and fusion through introgression in contemporary Darwin's finch populations may be a reflection of processes occurring in other young radiations. We propose that introgression has the largest effect on the evolution of interbreeding species after they have diverged in morphology, but before the point is reached when genetic incompatibilities incur a severe fitness cost.

AB Organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) are essential for heterotrophic soil microorganisms, and their bioavailability strongly influences ecosystem C and N cycling. We show here that the natural N-15 abundance of the soil microbial biomass is affected by both the availability of C and N and ecosystem N processing. Microbial N-15 enrichment correlated negatively with the C : N ratio of the soil soluble fraction and positively with net N mineralization for ecosystems spanning semiarid, temperate and tropical climates, grassland and forests, and over four million years of ecosystem development. In addition, during soil incubation, large increases in microbial N-15 enrichment corresponded to high net N mineralization rates. These results support the idea that the N isotope composition of an organism is determined by the balance between N assimilation and dissimilation. Thus N-15 enrichment of the soil microbial biomass integrates the effects of C and N avalbility on microbial metabolism and ecosystem process.

AB Evidence is accumulating that the continued provision of essential ecosystem services is vulnerable to land-use change. Yet, we lack a strong scientific basis for this vulnerability as the processes that drive ecosystem-service delivery often remain unclear. In this paper, we use plant traits to assess ecosystem-service sensitivity to land-use change in subalpine grasslands. We use a trait-based plant classification (plant functional types, PFTs) in a landscape modeling platform to model community dynamics under contrasting but internally consistent land-use change scenarios. We then use predictive models of relevant ecosystem attributes, based on quantitative plant traits, to make projections of ecosystem-service delivery. We show that plant traits and PFTs are effective predictors of relevant ecosystem attributes for a range of ecosystem services including provisioning (fodder), cultural (land stewardship), regulating (landslide and avalanche risk), and supporting services (plant diversity). By analyzing the relative effects of the physical environment and land use on relevant ecosystem attributes, we also show that these ecosystem services are most sensitive to changes in grassland management, supporting current agri-environmental policies aimed at maintaining mowing of subalpine grasslands in Europe.

AB The high altitude treeline phenomenon is discussed with a global perspective. If one disregards local/regional (including anthropogenic) reasons for the absence of trees, the high elevation treeline is found at surprisingly uniform growing season temperatures worldwide, while other types of thresholds (including the warmest month temperature) do not work on a global scale. This phenomenon is explained by the close aerodynamic coupling between tree crowns and atmospheric conditions. It is shown that the treeline position can be predicted well by thermal thresholds alone, which makes it an ideal biogeographic reference line in modelling, for instance to estimate the global mountain forest area.

AB We quantified in the garden warbler (Sylvia borin) and the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), two long-distance migratory songbirds, the early oxidative damage (ROMs) and plasma anti-oxidant capacity (OXY) variation of individuals caught at a stop-over site after a sustained flight across the sea, during spring migration. Our main goal was to quantify the oxidative damage and anti-oxidant capacity variation in these two migratory species in relation to fat and muscle stores. The birds were sampled in Ponza, a small island along the migratory route of these species. The levels of ROMs and OXY did not show any differences between the two species and in general were higher in individuals with higher fat and protein stores. Nevertheless, the balance between ROMs and OXY was better in individuals in good condition. These patterns were similar in both species. No sex differences emerged for both ROMs and OXY in the barn swallow, the only species that could be sexed. Both markers of oxidative stress did not show any significant variation across a 30-min restrained experiment. These data are the first of this kind in wild birds in a migratory context and suggest that individuals in better condition are exposed to lower oxidative stress, providing an indirect evidence of the oxidative cost caused by prolonged flights.

AB It has been hypothesized that tropical trees partition forest light environments through a life history trade-off between juvenile growth and survival; however, the generality of this trade-off across life stages and functional groups has been questioned. We quantified trade-offs between growth and survival for trees and lianas on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama using first-year seedlings of 22 liana and 31 tree species and saplings (10 mm < dbh < 39 mm) of 30 tree species. Lianas showed trade-offs similar to those of trees, with both groups exhibiting broadly overlapping ranges in survival and relative growth rates as seedlings. Life history strategies at,the seedling stage were highly correlated with those at the sapling stage among tree species, with all species showing an increase in survival with size. Only one of 30 tree species demonstrated a statistically significant ontogenetic shift, having a relatively lower Survival rate at the sapling stage than expected. Our results indicate that similar life history trade-offs apply across two functional groups (lianas and trees), and that life history strategies are largely conserved across seedling and sapling life-stages for most tropical tree species.

AB We quantified broad-scale patterns of species richness and species density ( mean # species/km(2)) for native and non-indigenous plants, birds, and fishes in the continental USA and Hawaii. We hypothesized that the species density of native and non-indigenous taxa would generally decrease in northern latitudes and higher elevations following declines in potential evapotranspiration, mean temperature, and precipitation. County data on plants (n = 3004 counties) and birds (n = 3074 counties), and drainage (6 HUC) data on fishes (n = 328 drainages) showed that the densities of native and non-indigenous species were strongly positively correlated for plant species (r = 0.86, P < 0.0001), bird species (r = 0.93, P < 0.0001), and fish species (r = 0.41, P < 0.0001). Multiple regression models showed that the densities of native plant and bird species could be strongly predicted (adj. R-2 = 0.66 in both models) at county levels, but fish species densities were less predictable at drainage levels ( adj. R-2 = 0.31, P < 0.0001). Similarly, non-indigenous plant and bird species densities were strongly predictable (adj. R-2 = 0.84 and 0.91 respectively), but non-indigenous fish species density was less predictable (adj. R-2 = 0.38). County level hotspots of native and non-indigenous plants, birds, and fishes were located in low elevation areas close to the coast with high precipitation and productivity ( vegetation carbon). We show that ( 1) native species richness can be moderately well predicted with abiotic factors; ( 2) human populations have tended to settle in areas rich in native species; and ( 3) the richness and density of non-indigenous plant, bird, and fish species can be accurately predicted from biotic and abiotic factors largely because they are positively correlated to native species densities. We conclude that while humans facilitate the initial establishment, invasions of non-indigenous species, the spread and subsequent distributions of non-indigenous species may be controlled largely by environmental factors.

AB The level of genetic differentiation within and between evolutionary lineages of the common vole (Microtus arvalis) in Europe was examined by analyzing mitochondrial sequences from the control region (mtDNA) and 12 nuclear microsatellite loci (nucDNA) for 338 voles from IS populations. The distribution of evolutionary lineages and the affinity of populations to lineages were determined with additional sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Our analyses demonstrated very high levels of differentiation between populations (overall F-ST: mtDNA 70%; nucDNA 17%). The affinity of populations to evolutionary lineages was strongly reflected in mtDNA but not in nucDNA variation. Patterns of genetic structure for both markers visualized in synthetic genetic maps suggest a postglacial range expansion of the species into the Alps, as well as a potentially more ancient colonization from the northeast to the southwest of Europe. This expansion is supported by estimates for the divergence times between evolutionary lineages and within the western European lineage, which predate the last glacial maximum (LGM). Furthermore, all measures of genetic diversity within populations increased significantly with longitude and showed a trend toward increase with latitude. We conclude that the detected patterns are difficult to explain only by range expansions from separate LGM refugia close to the Mediterranean. This suggests that some M. arvalis populations persisted during the LGM in suitable habitat further north and that the gradients in genetic diversity may represent traces of a more ancient colonization of Europe by the species.

AB Epiphytes contribute up to over 30% of the vascular plant diversity of old-growth tropical rain forests, but little is known about their occurrence in exploited forests that are structurally altered. Here, I estimate epiphyte species richness and biomass on 35 oak host trees, equally divided over several trunk diameter classes, in each of 16 sites in anthropogenic disturbed montane pine-oak forests at similar elevations. The sites vary in their amount of disturbance from scarcely to heavily disturbed, related to the structure of the forest, and in their underlying distance in the landscape with a maximum of ca. 25 km. The explainable variation in the epiphyte vegetation is partitioned between environmental and spatial variables, using multivariate data analysis. In total, 74 species of epiphytes were encountered. Bromeliads dominate at all sites in terms of their biomass. Forest disturbance, measured as the proportion of sprouted oaks, has an expected negative effect on the epiphyte biomass and alpha diversity per ground surface area, but also on the epiphytes on the remaining and re-grown trees. This pattern was sustained after corrections for differences in host-tree size were made. Nevertheless, the epiphytes show resilience to disturbance if forests are selectively logged to spare big trees. Such remnant trees are essential for epiphytes that require the presence of accumulated suspended soil and they may also serve as nearby epiphyte seed sources for the re-growing trees. Anthropogenic disturbances also force a shift from mesic to more drought tolerant species. Hence, disturbance exerts an influence on the regional distribution of epiphytes, but a similar amount of variation (20-30%, depending on the used spatial descriptors) could entirely be attributed to the geographic position of the sites, independent from the influence of environmental variables. Nearby sites are more similar in epiphytes than distant sites (Mantel's r = 0.44, P = 0.002) and I postulate that this relates to differences in seed supply, viewing the development of the epiphyte community from a dispersal assembly perspective. For epiphyte conservation purposes, it is recommended to adopt a management of selective logging instead of cyclic clear-cutting and to spare large trees during logging. In addition, it is wise to try to attain a homogeneous distribution of epiphyte protective reserves within a uniform physiographic region. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The case with which arbitrarily amplified dominant (AAD) markers such as RAPD, AFLP and ISSR could be used to generate vast quantities of data led to their rapid application addressing a diverse range of biological questions. The most significant uses of AAD markers remain in genetic mapping, diagnostic fingerprinting and in the study of genetic structure within and between populations of individual species. AAD markers may also be utilised for phylogenetics and systematics, but have commonly been used inappropriately in such analyses due primarily to poor consideration of potential homoplasy. This review discusses the properties of AAD markers (including potential artefacts) that relate to their interpretation as characters for phylogenetic and systematic analysis. Although useful markers are those for which heritability and homology have been demonstrated, this is rarely done because it is potentially time consuming and expensive. A consequence of this is that homology, appropriate taxonomic level, and the resolving capacities of commonly employed hierarchical analyses are often not addressed. A pragmatic approach suggests that tangible monomorphism (e.g. 20%) across all taxa studied should be a minimum requirement before AAD markers could be considered for phylogenetic analyses. This would help to prevent comparison of taxa that are too divergent. Rather than being transferable across widely diverged taxa, AAD polymorphisms can provide useful discriminatory information for phylogenetic and systematic studies of closely related species and non-reticulating, subspecific lineages. Below these levels of taxon divergence, population genetic effects may swamp hierarchical signal in the data, while at greater levels of divergence, homoplasy is likely to be significant.

AB Long-term forest landscape dynamics are determined by a set of driving forces including large-scale natural disturbances, land-use, the physical environment, and stand-scale succession processes. Landscape models have an important role as tools for synthesizing existing information and making projections of possible future vegetation dynamics on large spatial scales. However, current landscape models cannot readily be used to study: (1) the change from weakly to strongly disturbed landscapes; (2) the impact of changing climatic parameters on landscape-scale dynamics; and (3) the effects of such changes on vegetation structure. Using European mountain forests as a case study, this paper focuses on improving the well-established LANDIS landscape model so that it can be applied to study these research questions.
   We integrated a simple tree succession sub-model in LANDIS, which incorporates quantitative descriptions of forest structure, and included sub-models to capture the influences of competition as well as climatic and edaphic parameters on tree population dynamics.
   The new model was subjected to a number of quantitative tests against measured data. It accurately predicted the altitudinal distribution of vegetation properties under managed as well as unmanaged conditions in the Dischma valley (Switzerland), and it provided realistic and accurate patterns of vegetation recovery following wind disturbance events, in spite of the very simple model formulations.
   To demonstrate the utility of the added detail, we applied the model in scenario mode under a range of changes in climatic and disturbance parameters, assuming a continuation of the current management regime. The simulations showed that the various driving forces have quite different effects on different species, and that their combined effect differs from one scenario to the next. Notably, there are few models that integrate forest growth and succession with disturbance dynamics in a semi-mechanistic manner. Our version of LANDIS achieves this integration based on simple concepts and methods that do not require many parameter estimates. We conclude that the new model has the potential to provide an integrated picture of the impacts of both direct and indirect effects of climate change on forest landscape dynamics.

AB 1. Comparative studies of distinct, but not ecologically isolated, systems such as lakes and streams may improve our understanding of the importance of ecological linkages in aquatic ecosystems.
   2. In this study we compared the macroinvertebrate benthos of stony habitats in Swedish lakes and streams. Community composition was used to evaluate zoogeographic patterns and functional feeding guilds were used to identify mechanisms potentially affecting such patterns.
   3. Stream communities were generally more diverse and species-rich and had a higher proportion of grazers, shredders and passive-filter feeders than lakes. Lake communities had a higher proportion of predators and collector-gatherers. Of the 10 most common taxa, only Leptophlebia mayflies, clams (Sphaeriidae) and the isopod Asellus aquaticus were recorded in both lakes and streams.
   4. Among-site variance in macroinvertebrate communities accounted for by regional-scale variables was low (6.4% for lakes and 10.1% for streams), compared with that by local-scale variables (21% for lakes and 37.6% for streams). For lakes, the among-site variance in macroinvertebrate communities was best explained by habitat-scale characteristics followed by ecosystem, riparian, catchment, geographic position and ecoregion. For streams, the variance in macroinvertebrate communities was best explained by ecosystem characteristics followed by habitat, catchment, riparian, ecoregion and geographic position.
   5. Conspicuous differences in spatial pattern were revealed between lakes and streams. For lakes, the most unequivocal differences in community composition and function occurred at the transition zone between the mixed forests in the south and the boreal coniferous forests in the north. Surprisingly, streams did not respond as strongly to profound landscape-level differences in climate and vegetation cover.
   6. The spatial differences noted between macroinvertebrate communities of lakes and streams may be because of differences in retention of detrital matter. Our findings imply that detrital inputs are qualitatively similar, but that the retention and processing of coarse particulate organic matter was presumably higher in lake littoral regions than in stream riffle habitats.
   7. Although our findings support the conjecture that species distribution is determined fundamentally by conditions prevailing at the local-scale, regional factors such as land use/type and the role of history were important and seemingly act as strong determinants of large-scale patterns in biodiversity.

AB Migratory strategies of birds require complex orientation mechanisms, morphological adaptations, and life-history adjustments. From an evolutionary perspective, it is important to know how fast this complex combination of traits can evolve. We analyzed mitochondrial control-region DNA sequences in 241 blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) from 12 populations with different migratory behaviors. The sample included sedentary populations in Europe and Atlantic archipelagos and migratory populations with different distances of migration, from regional to intercontinental migrations, and different heading directions (due to a migratory divide in central Europe). There was no genetic structure between migratory and sedentary populations, or among populations from different biogeographic areas (Atlantic islands, the Iberian Peninsula, or the continent), however we found evidence of a genetic structure when comparing populations located on either side of the migratory divide. These findings support an independent evolution of highly divergent migratory strategies in blackcaps, occurring after a postglacial colonization of the continent along western and eastern routes. Accordingly, mismatch-distribution analyses suggested an expansion of blackcaps from a very small population size, and time estimates dated such an expansion during the last postglacial period. However, the populations in Gibraltar, located in a putative Mediterranean refuge, appeared to be independent of these processes, showing evidence of restricted gene flow with other populations and demonstrating insignificant historical changes in effective population size. Our results show that the interruption of gene flow between migratory and sedentary populations is not necessary for the maintenance of such a polymorphism, and that even the most divergent migratory strategies of a bird species are susceptible to evolution in response to historical environmental changes.

AB Species - climate 'envelope' models are widely used to evaluate potential climate change impacts upon species and biodiversity. Previous studies have used a variety of methods to fit models making it difficult to assess relative model performance for different taxonomic groups, life forms or trophic levels. Here we use the same climatic data and modelling approach for 306 European species representing three major taxa ( higher plants, insects and birds), and including species of different life form and from four trophic levels. Goodness-of-fit measures showed that useful models were fitted for > 96% of species, and that model performance was related neither to major taxonomic group nor to trophic level. These results confirm that such climate envelope models provide the best approach currently available for evaluating reliably the potential impacts of future climate change upon biodiversity.

AB Current neutral theory in community ecology views local biodiversity as a result of the interplay between speciation, extinction and immigration. Simulations and a mean-field approximation have been used to study this neutral theory. As simulations have limitations of convergence and the mean-field approximation ignores dependencies between species' abundances when applied to species-abundance data, there is still no final conclusion whether the neutral theory or the traditional lognormal model describes community structure best. We present a novel analytical framework, based on the genealogy of individuals in the local community, to overcome the problems of previous approaches, and show, using Bayesian statistics, that the lognormal model provides a slightly better fit to the species-abundance distribution of a much-discussed tropical tree community. A key feature of our approach is that it shows the tight link between genetic and species diversity, which creates important perspectives to future integration of evolutionary and community ecological theory.

AB 1. The long-term fitness consequences of conditions during development are receiving growing attention: they are at the interface between ecological and evolutionary processes. We addressed the influence of the length of the rearing period and 'rank' on fitness components in a long-lived seabird species with deferred breeding: the kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla ). Rank, which depends on hatching order, was used as a surrogate for dominance status in the brood. Rank could be viewed as a random factor affecting individuals regardless of their possible 'intrinsic quality' at birth. The length of the rearing period was used as a surrogate for parental effort. It reflects the interaction between numerous factors such as environmental conditions, parental quality, reproductive decisions and effort, and also offspring decisions and intrinsic quality at birth.
   2. There was evidence of an influence of the length of the rearing period on local survival before recruitment. Individuals with shorter rearing periods had lower local survival during the first winter (e.g. the relationship was positive). They may incur higher mortality. In rank 1 prebreeders, this relationship was negative in older age-classes. Longer rearing periods and better condition at independence may be associated with stronger migrating ability, and prebreeders that have not yet made settlement decisions may emigrate permanently to distant locations. Such a complex pattern may reflect age-related changes in the relative contribution of mortality and permanent emigration to local survival.
   3. The length of the rearing period had long-term consequences on reproductive performance. The relationship was positive but the rate of increase decreased slightly at higher values of the covariate.
   4. There was an unambiguously negative influence of rank on survival before recruitment and recruitment probability, but not on demographic parameters specific to the reproductive stage. Juniors recruited later than elder siblings. The disadvantage of juniors may be expressed mainly in terms of higher mortality and disappearance from the population before recruitment.

AB 1. In the deserts of the south-western United States of America, as in many ecoregions around the world, invasion of non-native plants is modifying the structure and composition of riparian vegetation.
   2. Restoration of native plant species frequently proves to be ecologically and economically difficult. In the Muddy River drainage in the Mojave Desert (Nevada, USA), eradication of one the most aggressive invasive plants, Tamarix ramosissima (salt-cedar), often reduces the structural and compositional diversity of the remaining vegetation. This can have negative effects on native animals, including birds.
   3. The objectives of our work were (i) to examine relationships between avian diversity and measures of vegetational diversity (species richness, dominance of non-native plants and vegetation structure [total vegetation volume]), (ii) to explore the extent to which avian community composition was associated with vegetation composition (floristics) or vegetation structure (physiognomy), and (iii) to consider the potential effects of alternative land management and ecological restoration strategies on the biodiversity of birds and other native fauna in watersheds in the arid south-western USA.
   4. Species richness of all birds and of breeding birds was best modelled by total vegetation volume alone. Neither species richness of plants nor dominance of non-native plants had a statistically significant effect on species richness, abundance or evenness of birds.
   5. Species composition of birds between sites was more similar when floristics was more similar, and vice versa. Species composition of birds was not correlated with physiognomy.
   6. Species richness of native birds in the Muddy River drainage appears not to suffer from invasion of non-native plants, provided that the vegetational community retains sufficient structural diversity.
   7. The composition of the bird community is closely related to floristics, and other taxonomic groups may exhibit different responses to vegetation structure and composition. Therefore, explicit strategies for landscape-scale management, restoration and maximization of native faunal diversity should consider how removal of invasive plants may affect physiognomy and floristics of the vegetational community as a whole.

AB The distribution of genetic diversity at 10 highly polymorphic microsatellite loci within the European freshwater fish, Cottus gobio , L. was examined. The sampling range comprised a large geographical scale including lineages known to be highly divergent at both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and allozymes. An analysis of genetic variability within populations showed that expected heterozygosity and allelic richness could be explained largely by current effective population sizes. Evidence was found, however, that historical processes predating the last major glaciation affected allelic richness. In addition to confirming the large-scale patterns from earlier studies, the microsatellite data revealed new insights into recent processes by analysing genetic structure within ancient lineages defined by mtDNA data. Stepwise mutation model (SMM) and nonSMM-based methods demonstrated a clear genetic structuring within the Northwestern European lineage comprising populations from Britain and Belgium, and within the Central European lineage populations from the rivers Danube, Elbe and Main. Supported by an analysis of genetic variability within populations these results showed that the bullhead populations most probably persisted throughout the last major glaciation within the British Isles and within the drainages of the rivers Elbe and Main. Such observations provide the first genetic evidence for a glacial refugium in such close proximity to the European glacial margins.

AB 1. Surface sediment samples of subfossil chironomid head capsules from 47 lakes in southern West Greenland were analysed using multivariate numerical methods in order to explore the relationship between chironomid assemblages and selected environmental variables. The study lakes are located along a climate gradient ranging from coastal maritime conditions near the Davis Strait to a continental climate near the margin of the Greenland ice sheet.
   2. High-resolution surface water temperatures were measured through the summer season using automatic data loggers in 21 of the study lakes. The mean July surface water temperature (1999) ranged from 7.3 to 16.5 degreesC in the data set.
   3. In all lakes, a total of 24 chironomid taxa were recorded; Micropsectra, Psectrocladius, Chironomus and Procladius were the dominant genera. There was a strong correlation between the trophic variables [total nitrogen and total phosphorus (TN, TP)] and temperature, and in redundancy analysis (RDA) the three variables explained almost equal significant amounts of variation in the chironomid data (19.8-22.3%). However, temperature lost significant explanatory power when the effect of TN was partialled out in RDA.
   4. The lakes were classified using two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) into eight groups defined by temperature, trophic variables, salinity (conductivity) and lake-morphometric data. Fourteen chironomid taxa showed significant differences in percentage abundances among groups, with Heterotrissocladius, Micropsectra, Ablabesmyia and Chironomus as the most robust group-indicator taxa. Forward selection of taxa in multiple discriminant analysis was used to fit chironomid assemblages into lake groups. Using only eight taxa, 95% of lakes were correctly classified at a second TWINSPAN division level (four groups) and 85% of lakes at a third division level (eight groups).
   5. This study showed that there is considerable potential in using subfossil chironomid head capsules as paleoenvironmental indicators in both short- and long-term (down-core) studies of lake ontogeny and palaeoclimate conditions in West Greenland. However, because of the strong correlation between temperature and trophic variables, a quantitative reconstruction of lake- and habitat-type is recommended, in combination with direct reconstruction of single variables such as temperature.

AB Recently, aquatic and terrestrial ecologists have put forward several hypotheses regarding similarities and differences in food-web structure and function among these ecosystem types. Although many of these hypotheses explore why strong top-down effects and trophic cascades might be less common in terrestrial than in aquatic ecosystems, there is little theoretical or empirical evidence available to support or refute these hypotheses. Many unanswered questions remain about potential differences across ecosystem types: progress will require empirical studies designed within a broader context that allows for more direct comparisons.

AB Little is known about how small-scale Variation in neighbor biomass can influence the strength of root competition experienced by an individual plant. In this study, modified root exclusion tubes were used to vary the accessibility of the soil space surrounding Amaranthus retroflexus target plants to the neighboring plants. A gradient of root accessibility was created by drilling varying numbers of holes into standard root exclusion tubes, made of 15 cm diameter PVC pipe. Belowground competitive intensity, defined as biomass reduction due to root interactions alone: relative to growth in the absence of neighbors, was then measured along the resulting gradient of neighbor root densities. At low neighbor root abundances the strength of belowground competition was proportional to neighbor root biomass, consistent with prior evidence that belowground competition is symmetric. If belowground competition were asymmetric, neighbor roots should have had little effect on target plants when they are rare relative to those of the target plant. Ar higher neighbor root abundances, belowground competitive intensity should increase rapidly. The strong relationship found between neighbor root biomass and belowground competitive intensity suggests relatively small variations in root biomass could lead to large variations in belowground competition. Reduced belowground competition in areas with low root biomass could have important implications for the establishment and growth of poor belowground competitors, suggesting a mechanism by which species coexistence may occur despite extremely intense root competition.

AB The root and rhizome biomass of the seagrass species present in 3 mixed and 2 monospecific meadows representative of different floras (Spanish Mediterranean, Mexican Caribbean, Kenyan coast, and the South China Sea off The Philippines) was examined to test for the existence of general patterns in the distribution of their biomass in the sediments, and to test a simple approach based on age determinations to estimate root production. The thickness of the roots was scaled to the thickness of the seagrass rhizomes (r = 0.92, p < 0.001). Root and rhizome biomass were high (>100 and >200 g DW m(-2), respectively) for the mixed meadows examined; these belowground structures had a projected surface area often exceeding 1 m(2) m(-2) when roots and rhizomes were considered together, and they formed a dense web of root material comprising several hundred meters per square meter. Belowground biomass showed considerable vertical stratification within the sediments, with a tendency for the larger species to extend deeper into the sediments than smaller ones. This tendency for segregation should reduce the potential interspecific competition for sediment resources, which is likely to be greater in the uppermost layers, where the belowground biomass is more evenly distributed among species. The rate of adventitious root production on vertical shoots varied from species that produced a root on almost every node to species that produced 1 adventitious root for every 10 nodes. Root production-both on horizontal rhizomes and Vertical shoots-was substantial, with the combined root production approaching, or exceeding, 1000 g DW m(-2) yr(-1). The resulting root turnover was quite high, with most Values ranging between 2 and 10 yr(-1), indicative of a characteristic turnover time of months for the root compartment. The estimates of root production derived here often exceed those of rhizome production and reach Values comparable to leaf production, clearly demonstrating that root production is an important component (up to 50%) of total seagrass production.

AB Most population models incorporate density dependence in a manner that implies the effects of density set in at increasingly higher rates as population densities decrease to zero. For many populations, it may be more plausible to assume chat the effects of density set in at a maximum rate around some characteristic density K > 0: that is, the per capita rate of increase of the population has an inverted sigmoidal farm as a function of population density. In the model discussed here, the rate at which density dependence sets in around K is governed by a parameter gamma, which I refer to as the ''abruptness'' parameter: the larger the parameter gamma, the weaker the effects of density dependence are for population densities below K, the more rapidly density dependence sets in around K, and the more severe the effects of density dependence are beyond K. Results obtained from an Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS) analysis of the abruptness parameter gamma suggest the hypothesis that populations with a density-independent growth rate of <100% from one generation to the next (i.e., a reproductive value of <2) will exhibit a relatively high level of abruptness in their response to density, while the reverse will be true for populations with a density-independent growth rate of >100%. Further, if true, this hypothesis suggests that females with high reproductive tales who deposit young on resources and provide no further maternal care should clump their young to reduce the level of abruptness in density dependence. Also, this hypothesis, together with the fact that high levels of abruptness promote oscillations in populations, implies that we are more likely to observe cyclic and chaotic behavior in relatively slower growing populations than previously thought.

AB 1. Canonical correspondence analysis of a diatom and water chemistry dataset from fifty-nine maritime Antarctic lakes situated on Signy and Livingston Islands showed that nutrients and functions of nutrients (NH4+, chlorophyll a) accounted for a significant fraction of the variance in the diatom data.
   2. Weighted averaging regression was used to construct a diatom-based transfer function for inferring chlorophyll a concentrations from sediment core diatom assemblages.
   3. The transfer function was applied to Pb-210-dated sediment cores from three lakes (Moss, Sombre and Heywood) receiving different levels of nutrient input from fur seal populations, i.e, low, medium and high, respectively.
   4. Moss Lake showed relatively stable reconstructed chlorophyll a values, and no evidence of recent eutrophication, agreeing with measured chlorophyll a concentrations at the site.
   5. Changes in diatom assemblages and results of chlorophyll a reconstructions at Sombre Lake suggested that nutrient enrichment had occurred, which could be clearly linked to fluctuations in the measured water chemistry over the last 10-14 years.
   6. Despite recorded increases in recent nutrient inputs there was no apparent diatom response at Heywood Lake.

AB 1. Sex-based differences in diets are widespread among animals, but may often reflect sex differences in body size or in the times and places that feeding occurs. rather than sex-specific prey-selection behaviour. We examined these hypotheses with detailed information on the types and sizes of fishes consumed by filesnakes, Acrochordus arafurae McDowell, 1979, based on a 4-year field study in the Wet-Dry tropics of northern Australia.
   2. These aquatic snakes show extreme sexual dimorphism in body length, body shape, relative head size, head shape, foraging habitat and diet. The composition of the diet varied seasonally and with the size as well as the gender of the snakes. Both sexes ate more frequently during the Wet season, apparently because of higher prey availability at this time.
   3. Both sexes showed significant selectivity of prey species, but differed profoundly in food habits. Female filesnakes generally consumed only a single large prey item at a time, whereas the stomachs of males typically contained many small prey items.
   4. Males were relatively unselective foragers, with little evidence of ontogenetic shifts in prey size or prey type. In contrast, large females ate larger prey items, and showed an ontogenetic shift from a generalized (male-like) diet to 'sleepy cod' (eleotrids) and finally to plotosid catfish.
   5. When comparison was restricted to snakes of the same head length, males and females differed significantly in dietary composition and in prey sizes, but not in feeding frequencies or the relative numbers of snakes containing single versus multiple prey items.

AB Neonicotinoid insecticides are widely used in both urban and agricultural settings around the world. Historically, neonicotinoid insecticides have been viewed as ideal replacements for more toxic compounds, like organophosphates, due in part to their perceived limited potential to affect the environment and human health. This critical review investigates the environmental fate and toxicity of neonicotinoids and their metabolites and the potential risks associated with exposure. Neonicotinoids are found to be ubiquitous in the environment, drinking water, and food, with low-level exposure commonly documented below acceptable daily intake standards. Available toxicological data from animal studies indicate possible genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, impaired immune function, and reduced growth and reproductive success at low concentrations, while limited data from ecological or cross-sectional epidemiological studies have identified acute and chronic health effects ranging from acute respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological symptoms to oxidative genetic damage and birth defects. Due to the heavy use of neonicotinoids and potential for cumulative chronic exposure, these insecticides represent novel risks and necessitate further study to fully understand their risks to humans.

AB Urgent environmental issues are testing the limits of current management approaches and pushing demand for innovative approaches that integrate across traditional disciplinary boundaries. Practitioners, scholars, and policy-makers alike call for increased integration of natural and social sciences to develop new approaches that address the range of ecological and societal impacts of modern environmental issues. From a theoretical perspective, social-ecological systems (SES) science offers a compelling approach for improved environmental management through the application of transdisciplinary and resilience concepts. A framework for translating SES theory into practice, however, is lacking. In this paper, we define the key components of an SES-based environmental management approach. We offer recommendations for integrating an SES approach into existing environmental management practices. Results presented are useful for management professionals that seek to employ an SES environmental management approach and scholars aiming to advance the theoretical foundations of SES science for practical application.

AB The integration of functional traits into vulnerability assessments is a promising approach to quantitatively capture differences in species sensitivity and adaptive capacity to climate change, allowing the refinement of tree species distribution models. In response to a clear need to identify traits that are responsive to climate change and applicable in amanagement context, we review the state of knowledge of the main mechanisms, and their associated traits, that underpin the ability of boreal and temperate tree species to persist and (or) shift their distribution in a changing climate. We aimed to determine whether current knowledge is sufficiently mature and available to be used effectively in vulnerability assessments. Marshalling recent conceptual advances and assessing data availability, our ultimate objective is to guide modellers and practitioners in finding and selecting sets of traits that can be used to capture differences in species' ability to persist and migrate. While the physiological mechanisms that determine sensitivity to climate change are relatively well understood (e.g., drought-induced cavitation), manyassociated traits have not been systematically documented for North American trees and differences in methodology preclude their widespread integration into vulnerability assessments (e.g., xylem recovery capacity). In contrast, traits traditionally associated with the ability to migrate and withstand fire are generally well documented, but new key traits are emerging in the context of climate change that have not been as well characterized (e.g., age of optimum seed production). More generally, lack of knowledge surrounding the extent and patterns in intraspecific trait variation, as well as co-variation and interaction among traits, limit our ability to use this approach to assess tree adaptive capacity. We conclude by outlining research needs and potential strategies for the development of trait-based knowledge applicable in large-scale modelling efforts, sketching out important aspects of trait data organization that should be part of a coordinated effort by the forest science community.

AB Community ecology and paleoecology are both concerned with the composition and structure of biotic assemblages but are largely disconnected. Community ecology focuses on existing species assemblages and recently has begun to integrate history (phylogeny and continental or intercontinental dispersal) to constrain community processes. This division has left a "missing middle": Ecological and environmental processes occurring on timescales from decades to millennia are not yet fully incorporated into community ecology. Quaternary paleoecology has a wealth of data documenting ecological dynamics at these timescales, and both fields can benefit from greater interaction and articulation. We discuss ecological insights revealed by Quaternary terrestrial records, suggest foundations for bridging between the disciplines, and identify topics where the disciplines can engage to mutual benefit.

AB Soils represent a significant reservoir of biological diversity that underpins a broad range of key processes and moderate ecosystem service provision. Our understanding of the role that soil organisms play in ecosystems is still developing, but the increased investigation into biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in soils over the past couple of decades has provided insights that have greatly enhanced our ability to sustainably manage soil biodiversity. In this review, we synthesize emerging knowledge of soil biodiversity as a natural resource that supports the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems and their delivery of ecosystem services. We explore how environmental changes alter soil biodiversity and how this in turn can affect ecosystem processes as well as resistance and resilience to environmental changes. We then discuss ways to include soil biodiversity in management strategies for sustainable production and biodiversity conservation. We conclude by highlighting key research challenges to further improve our knowledge of soil biodiversity and its management.

AB Citizen science is a research practice that relies on public contributions of data. The strong recognition of its educational value combined with the need for novel methods to handle subsequent large and complex data sets raises the question: Is citizen science effective at science? A quantitative assessment of the contributions of citizen science for its core purpose scientific research - is lacking. We examined the contribution of citizen science to a review paper by ornithologists in which they formulated ten central claims about the impact of climate change on avian migration. Citizen science was never explicitly mentioned in the review article. For each of the claims, these ornithologists scored their opinions about the amount of research effort invested in each claim and how strongly the claim was supported by evidence. This allowed us to also determine whether their trust in claims was, unwittingly or not, related to the degree to which the claims relied primarily on data generated by citizen scientists. We found that papers based on citizen science constituted between 24 and 77% of the references backing each claim, with no evidence of a mistrust of claims that relied heavily on citizen-science data. We reveal that many of these papers may not easily be recognized as drawing upon volunteer contributions, as the search terms "citizen science'' and "volunteer'' would have overlooked the majority of the studies that back the ten claims about birds and climate change. Our results suggest that the significance of citizen science to global research, an endeavor that is reliant on long-term information at large spatial scales, might be far greater than is readily perceived. To better understand and track the contributions of citizen science in the future, we urge researchers to use the keyword "citizen science'' in papers that draw on efforts of non-professionals.

AB In trees exposed to prolonged drought, both carbon uptake (C source) and growth (C sink) typically decrease. This correlation raises two important questions: (i) to what degree is tree growth limited by C availability; and (ii) is growth limited by concurrent C storage (e.g., as nonstructural carbohydrates, NSC)? To test the relationships between drought, growth and C reserves, we monitored the changes in NSC levels and constructed stem growth chronologies of mature Pinus halepensis Miller trees of three drought stress levels growing in Yatir forest, Israel, at the dry distribution limit of forests. Moderately stressed and stressed trees showed 34 and 14% of the stem growth, 71 and 31% of the sap flux density, and 79 and 66% of the final needle length of healthy trees in 2012. In spite of these large reductions in growth and sap flow, both starch and soluble sugar concentrations in the branches of these trees were similar in all trees throughout the dry season (2-4% dry mass). At the same time, the root starch concentrations of moderately stressed and stressed trees were 47 and 58% of those of healthy trees, but never <2% dry mass. Our results show that all the studied trees maintain a fairly good coordination between C supply and demand, and even during prolonged drought there is more than one way for a tree to maintain a positive C balance.

AB The taxa-area relationship (TAR) and the distance-decay relationship (DDR) both describe spatial turnover of taxa and are central patterns of biodiversity. Here, we compared TAR and DDR of bacterial communities across different marine realms and ecosystems at the global scale. To obtain reliable global estimates for both relationships, we quantified the poorly assessed effects of sequencing depth, rare taxa removal and number of sampling sites. Slope coefficients of bacterial TARs were within the range of those of plants and animals, whereas slope coefficients of bacterial DDR were much lower. Slope coefficients were mostly affected by removing rare taxa and by the number of sampling sites considered in the calculations. TAR and DDR slope coefficients were overestimated at sequencing depth <4000 sequences per sample. Noticeably, bacterial TAR and DDR patterns did not correlate with each other both within and across ecosystem types, suggesting that (i) TAR cannot be directly derived from DDR and (ii) TAR and DDR may be influenced by different ecological factors. Nevertheless, we found marine bacterial TAR and DDR to be steeper in ecosystems associated with high environmental heterogeneity or spatial isolation, namely marine sediments and coastal environments compared with pelagic ecosystems. Hence, our study provides information on macroecological patterns of marine bacteria, as well as methodological and conceptual insights, at a time when biodiversity surveys increasingly make use of high-throughput sequencing technologies.

AB Although phylogenetic approaches are useful for providing insights into the processes underlying biodiversity patterns, the studies of microbial phylogenetic relatedness are rare, especially for elevational gradients. Using high-throughput pyrosequencing, we examined the biodiversity patterns for biofilm bacterial communities that were scraped from stream stones along an elevational gradient from 1820 to 4050 m in China. The patterns of bacterial species richness and phylogenetic diversity were hollow towards higher elevations. The bacterial communities consisted of closer relatives than expected and displayed increasing terminal phylogenetic clustering towards mountain top. The increasing phylogenetic clustering with elevation contrasts reports for macro-organisms that revealed phylogenetic overdispersion at low or intermediate elevations. Because water temperature showed the strongest correlation with phylogenetic relatedness (r(2) = 0.516), the elevational pattern in the bacterial phylogenetic structure indicated that environmental filtering possibly due to lower temperature or more frequent temperature fluctuations increased towards higher elevations. Evidence supporting the environmental filtering on bacteria was also reflected by the orderly succession in the relative abundance of different bacterial phyla along the elevational gradient and in the high evenness of bacterial taxa at higher elevations. Overall, our results indicated that ecological processes possibly related to temperature may play a dominant role in structuring bacterial biodiversity along the elevational gradient.

AB We compiled light utilization traits for 56 species of freshwater phytoplankton to analyze group differences, trait trade-offs, and allometric scaling relationships. We also used these traits to explain differences in major group distributions along the light availability gradient in 527 lakes in the continental United States. Major taxonomic groups differed significantly in their light utilization traits. Cyanobacteria had the highest initial slope of the growth-irradiance curve (alpha) and low irradiance at the onset of photoinhibition, indicating adaptation to low light environments. Green algae had the highest maximal growth rates and low alpha, indicating adaptation to higher light environments. Groups capable of mixotrophy had traits indicative of poor light competitive abilities and high light requirements. Key light utilization traits scaled allometrically with cell size and exhibited trade-offs leading to contrasting ecological strategies; alpha and cell size were conserved at the highest taxonomic level (domain), indicating a fundamental trait divergence between prokaryotic and eukaryotic phytoplankton. In line with these trait differences, major groups showed different responses to light availability in natural conditions. The relative abundances of low light-adapted groups declined with increasing light availability and vice versa. The genera mean values of the initial slopes of the growth-irradiance curves were significantly negatively correlated with the slopes of the relationships between the genus's relative abundance and light availability characterized by Secchi depth in 527 lakes. This indicates that light utilization traits can be used to explain phytoplankton distributions in nature.

AB Aim Data and analyses of elevational gradients in diversity have been central to the development and evaluation of a range of general theories of biodiversity. Elevational diversity patterns have, however, been severely understudied for microbes, which often represent decomposer subsystems. Consequently, generalities in the patterns of elevational diversity across different trophic levels remain poorly understood. Our aim was to examine elevational gradients in the diversity of macroinvertebrates, diatoms and bacteria along a stony stream that covered a large elevational gradient.
   Location Laojun Mountain, Yunnan province, China.
   Methods The sampling scheme included 26 sites spaced at elevational intervals of 89 m from 1820 to 4050 m elevation along a stony stream. Macroinvertebrate and diatom richness were determined based on the morphology of the specimens. Taxonomic richness for bacteria was quantified using a molecular fingerprinting method. Over 50 environmental variables were measured at each site to quantify environmental variables that could correlate with the patterns of diversity. We used eigenvector-based spatial filters with multiple regressions to account for spatial autocorrelation.
   Results The bacterial richness followed an unexpected monotonic increase with elevation. Diatoms decreased monotonically, and macroinvertebrate richness showed a clear unimodal pattern with elevation. The unimodal richness pattern for macroinvertebrates was best explained by the mid-domain effect (r(2) = 0.72). The diatom richness was best explained by the variation in nutrient supply, and the increase in bacterial richness with elevation may be related to an increased carbon supply.
   Main conclusions We found contrasting patterns in elevational diversity among the three studied multi-trophic groups comprising unicellular and multicellular aquatic taxa. We also found that there may be fundamental differences in the mechanisms underlying these species diversity patterns.

AB Since Darwin first noted that the process of speciation was indeed the "mystery of mysteries," scientists have tried to develop testable models for the development of reproductive incompatibilities-the first step in the formation of a new species. Early theorists proposed that chromosome rearrangements were implicated in the process of reproductive isolation; however, the chromosomal speciation model has recently been questioned. In addition, recent data from hybrid model systems indicates that simple epistatic interactions, the Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities, are more complex. In fact, incompatibilities are quite broad, including interactions among heterochromatin, small RNAs, and distinct, epigenetically defined genomic regions such as the centromere. In this review, we will examine both classical and current models of chromosomal speciation and describe the "evolving" theory of genetic conflict, epigenetics, and chromosomal speciation.

AB Male animals are typically more elaborately ornamented than females(1). Classic sexual selection theory notes that because sperm are cheaper to produce than eggs(2), and because males generally compete more intensely for reproductive opportunities and invest less in parental care than females(3), males can obtain greater fitness benefits from mating multiply(2,4). Therefore, sexual selection typically results in male-biased sex differences in secondary sexual characters(1,4). This generality has recently been questioned, because in cooperatively breeding vertebrates, the strength of selection on traits used in intra-sexual competition for access to mates (sexual selection(1,4)) or other resources linked to reproduction (social selection(5,6)) is similar in males and females(7,8). Because selection is acting with comparable intensity in both sexes in cooperatively breeding species, the degree of sexual dimorphism in traits used in intrasexual competition should be reduced in cooperative breeders(6). Here we use the socially diverse African starlings (Sturnidae) to demonstrate that the degree of sexual dimorphism in plumage and body size is reduced in cooperatively breeding species as a result of increased selection on females for traits that increase access to reproductive opportunities, other resources, or higher social status. In cooperative breeders such as these, where there is unequal sharing of reproduction (reproductive skew) among females, and where female dominance rank influences access to mates and other resources, intrasexual competition among females may be intense(7) and ultimately select for female trait elaboration(9). Selection is thereby acting with different intensities on males and females in cooperatively versus non-cooperatively breeding species, and female-female interactions in group-living vertebrates will have important consequences for the evolution of female morphological, physiological and behavioural traits.

AB The ecological impacts of forest plantations are a focus of intense debate, from studies that consider plantations as "biological deserts" to studies showing positive effects on plant diversity and dynamics. This lack of consensus might be influenced by the scarcity of studies that examine how the ecological characteristics of plantations vary along abiotic and biotic gradients. Here we conducted a large-scale assessment of plant regeneration and diversity in plantations of southern Spain. Tree seedling and sapling density, plant species richness, and Shannon's (H') diversity index were analyzed in 442 pine plantation plots covering a wide gradient of climatic conditions, stand density, and distance to natural forests that act as seed sources.
   Pronounced variation in regeneration and diversity was found in plantation understories along the gradients explored. Low-to mid-altitude plantations showed a diverse and abundant seedling bank dominated by Quercus ilex, whereas high-altitude plantations showed a virtually monospecific seeding bank of Pinus sylvestris. Regeneration was null in plantations with stand densities exceeding 1500 pines/ha. Moderate plantation densities (500-1000 pines/ha) promoted recruitment in comparison to low or null canopy cover, suggesting the existence of facilitative interactions. Quercus ilex recruitment diminished exponentially with distance to the nearest Q. ilex forest. Richness and H' index values showed a hump-shaped distribution along the altitudinal and radiation gradients and decreased monotonically along the stand density gradient.
   From a management perspective, different strategies will be necessary depending on where a plantation lies along the gradients explored. Active management will be required in high-density plantations with arrested succession and low diversity. Thinning could redirect plantations toward more natural densities where facilitation predominates. Passive management might be recommended for low-to moderate-density plantations with active successional dynamics (e. g., toward oak or pine-oak forests at low to mid altitudes). Enrichment planting will be required to overcome seed limitation, especially in plantations far from natural forests. We conclude that plantations should be perceived as dynamic systems where successional trajectories and diversity levels are determined by abiotic constraints, complex balances of competitive and facilitative interactions, the spatial configuration of native seed sources, and species life-history traits.

ID CLIMATE; LEAVES
AB Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP) is a versatile technique for obtaining quantitative estimates for multiple terrestrial palaeoclimate variables from woody dicot leaf assemblages. To date it has been most widely applied to the Late Cretaceous and Tertiary of the mid- to high latitudes because of concerns over the relative dearth of calibration sites in modern low-latitude warm climates, and the loss of information associated with the lack of marginal teeth on leaves in paratropical to tropical vegetation. This limits CLAMP's ability to quantify reliably climates at low latitudes in greenhouse worlds of the past.
   One of the reasons for the lack of CLAMP calibration samples from warm environments is the paucity of climate stations close to potential calibration vegetation sites at low latitudes. Agriculture and urban development have destroyed most lowland sites and natural vegetation is now largely confined to mountainous areas where climate stations are few and climatic spatial variation is high due to topographic complexity To attempt to overcome tills we have utilised a 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees grid of global interpolated climate data based on the data set of New et al (1999) supplemented by the ERA40 re-analysis data for atmospheric temperature at upper levels. For each location. the 3-D climatology of temperature from the ECMWF re-analysis project was used to calculate the mean lower tropospheric lapse rate for each month of the year. The gridded data were then corrected to the altitude of the plant Site using the monthly lapse rates. Corrections for humidity were also made. From this the commonly returned CLAMP climate variables were calculated A bilinear interpolation scheme was then used to calculate the climate parameters at the exact lat/long of the site.
   When CLAMP analyses using the PHYSG3BR physiognomic data calibrated with the climate station based MET3BR were compared to analyses using the gridded data at the same locations (GRIDMET3BR), the results were indistinguishable in that they fell within the range of statistical uncertainty determined for each analysis. This opens the way to including natural vegetation anywhere in the world irrespective of the proximity of a meteorological station. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB We quantified livestock (cattle, shoats, horses and donkeys) losses to lions (Panthera leo) and attitudes to lions, livestock losses and tourism among livestock owners, village residents and tourism workers around Makgadikgadi Pans National Park in Botswana. Losses were not correlated with the size or structure of livestock enclosures, numbers of dogs or herders. Rather losses increased with the amount of livestock owned. Most were stray animals preyed upon at night. Attitudes to wildlife, conservation and lions were also not consistently distributed within the society we studied. Negative attitudes to lions were almost ubiquitous among cattleposts but less widespread among people living in the more urbanized society of villages or among people working in tourism.
   Although four tourist camps were operating in the area, benefits from these operations were largely limited to employees. Despite considerable sums of money being paid to Botswana by local tourist facilities few respondents viewed tourism as valuable and most felt that the government and not they or their community was the main beneficiary of tourism. Tourism employees made up a small sub-section of the adult population drawn predominately from larger villages while the costs of livestock losses were spread among cattleposts near the park boundary. These same cattlepost respondents were not prepared to improve stock care to protect livestock, but indicated a willingness to kill lions instead. If tourism is to play a role in reducing human-wildlife conflict, communities must not be regarded as homogenous entities into which to distribute benefits evenly. Benefits might usefully be distributed in relation to the costs of coexisting with wildlife or used as incentives to better protect livestock or other human resources. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Despite biological invasions being a worldwide phenomenon causing significant ecological, economic, and human welfare impacts, there is limited understanding regarding how environmental managers perceive the problem and subsequently manage alien species. Spanish environmental managers were surveyed using questionnaires to (1) analyze the extent to which they perceive plant invasions as a problem; (2) identify the status, occurrence, and impacts of noxious alien plant species; (3) assess current effort and expenditure targeting alien plant management; and, finally, (4) identify the criteria they use to set priorities for management. In comparison to other environmental concerns, plant invasions are perceived as only moderately problematic and mechanical control is the most valued and frequently used strategy to cope with plant invasions in Spain. Based on 70 questionnaires received, 193 species are considered noxious, 109 of which have been the subject of management activities. More than 90% of species are found in at least one protected area. According to respondents, the most frequently managed species are the most widespread across administrative regions and the ones perceived as causing the highest impacts. The perception of impact seems to be independent of their invasion status, since only half of the species identified as noxious are believed to be invasive in Spain, while 43% of species thought to only be casual aliens are causing a high impact. Records of management costs are poor and the few data indicate that the total actual expenditure amounted to 50,492,437 a,not sign in the last decade. The majority of respondents stated that management measures are insufficient to control alien plants due to limited economic resources, lack of public awareness and support, and an absence of coordination among different public administrations. Managers also expressed their concern about the fact that much scientific research is concerned with the ecology of alien plants rather than with specific cost-efficient strategies to manage alien species.

AB Quantitative methods were used to examine soil properties and their spatial heterogeneity in a 0-year fenced mobile dune (MD0), an 11-year fenced mobile dune (MD11) and a 20-year fenced mobile dune (MD20) in Horqin Sandy Land, Northern China. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of vegetation restoration on heterogeneity of soil properties in sand dunes and to provide a concept model to describe the relationship between vegetation succession and spatial heterogeneity variation of soil properties in the dunes. The results showed that the average values of vegetation cover, species number and diversity, soil organic carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), and electrical conductivity (EC) increased with the increase in fenced age of mobile dunes, while soil water content (0-20 cm) showed the reverse trend. Geostatistical analysis revealed that the spatial heterogeneity of soil organic C, total N, EC, very fine sand content, and soil water content (0-20 cm) increased from MD0 to MD11 with succession from sand pioneer plant to shrub species then decreased from MD11 to MD20 due to continuous development of herbaceous plants. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that there was a relatively high correspondence between vegetation and soil factors, suggesting that the major gradients relating soil organic C, total N, EC, pH, slope, very fine sand content, and soil water content are the main factors for the distribution of dune plants and account for 68.1% of the species-environment relationship among the three sites. In addition, the distribution of the sand pioneer plant was positively related to the relative height of the sampling site and soil water content, and that of most herbaceous plants were determined by soil organic C, total N, EC, pH, and very fine sand content in mobile dunes. The conceptual model of relationship between vegetation succession and spatial heterogeneity of soil properties in mobile dunes suggests spatial patterns of soil properties are most strongly related to plant-induced heterogeneity in dune ecosystems prone to wind erosion, and conversely, the magnitude and degree of spatial heterogeneity in soil properties can influence the plant distribution pattern and vegetation succession of mobile dunes.

   CONTEXT
AB The concept of behavioural syndromes hypothesizes that consistent behaviours across various situations mediate important life history trade-offs, and predicts correlations among behavioural traits. We studied the consistency of behavioural responses across three ecological situations (exploration of an environment altered with a novel object, aggression towards conspecifics, risk taking) in male collared flycatchers. We developed behavioural tests that could be applied in the birds' natural habitat, thus not requiring the capture of animals. Across individuals, we found positive covariation between exploration, aggression and risk taking, but the magnitude of these relationships varied. Variation in behaviour was also related to capture probability. Exploratory and risk-taking individuals were more likely to enter a trap than individuals with averse characteristics. Moreover, with the trapped birds, there was an association between the time needed for successful capture and exploration, and we found stronger correlations between behaviours in comparison with effects calculated from the whole sample of individuals. These patterns were independent of territory quality, male age, condition and breeding experience. Consequently, behavioural responses to different ecosocial challenges are determined by individual-specific characteristics that are manifested in correlative behaviours. Hence, behavioural types may be potential subjects for reproductive and life history adaptations. Our results have important implications for field studies of animals, because they suggest that capturing protocols may not randomly sample the observed population.

AB The CEFLES2 campaign during the Carbo Europe Regional Experiment Strategy was designed to provide simultaneous airborne measurements of solar induced fluorescence and CO2 fluxes. It was combined with extensive ground-based quantification of leaf- and canopy-level processes in support of ESA's Candidate Earth Explorer Mission of the 'Fluorescence Explorer' (FLEX). The aim of this campaign was to test if fluorescence signal detected from an airborne platform can be used to improve estimates of plant mediated exchange on the mesoscale. Canopy fluorescence was quantified from four airborne platforms using a combination of novel sensors: (i) the prototype airborne sensor AirFLEX quantified fluorescence in the oxygen A and B bands, (ii) a hyperspectral spectrometer (ASD) measured reflectance along transects during 12 day courses, (iii) spatially high resolution georeferenced hyperspectral data cubes containing the whole optical spectrum and the thermal region were gathered with an AHS sensor, and (iv) the first employment of the high performance imaging spectrometer HYPER delivered spatially explicit and multi-temporal transects across the whole region. During three measurement periods in April, June and September 2007 structural, functional and radiometric characteristics of more than 20 different vegetation types in the Les Landes region, Southwest France, were extensively characterized on the ground. The campaign concept focussed especially on quantifying plant mediated exchange processes (photosynthetic electron transport, CO2 uptake, evapotranspiration) and fluorescence emission. The comparison between passive sun-induced fluorescence and active laser-induced fluorescence was performed on a corn canopy in the daily cycle and under desiccation stress. Both techniques show good agreement in detecting stress induced fluorescence change at the 760 nm band. On the large scale, airborne and ground-level measurements of fluorescence were compared on several vegetation types supporting the scaling of this novel remote sensing signal. The multi-scale design of the four airborne radiometric measurements along with extensive ground activities fosters a nested approach to quantify photosynthetic efficiency and gross primary productivity (GPP) from passive fluorescence.

AB We present niche-based modelling to project the distribution of 845 European plant species for Germany using three different models and three scenarios of climate and land use changes up to 2080. Projected changes suggested large effects over the coming decades, with consequences for the German flora. Even under a moderate scenario (approx. + 2.2 degrees C), 15-19% (across models) of the species we studied could be lost locally-averaged from 2995 grid cells in Germany. Models projected strong spatially varying impacts on the species composition. In particular, the eastern and southwestern parts of Germany were affected by species loss. Scenarios were characterized by an increased number of species occupying small ranges, as evidenced by changes in range-size rarity scores. It is anticipated that species with small ranges will be especially vulnerable to future climate change and other ecological stresses.

AB Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous human fungal pathogen that causes meningoencephalitis in predominantly immunocompromised hosts. The fungus is typically haploid, and sexual reproduction involves two individuals with opposite mating types/sexes, alpha and a. However, the overwhelming predominance of mating type (MAT) alpha over a in C. neoformans populations limits alpha-a mating in nature. Recently it was discovered that C. neoformans can undergo same-sex mating under laboratory conditions, especially between a isolates. Whether same-sex mating occurs in nature and contributes to the current population structure was unknown. In this study, natural alpha AD alpha hybrids that arose by fusion between two a cells of different serotypes (A and D) were identified and characterized, providing definitive evidence that same-sex mating occurs naturally. A novel truncated allele of the mating-type-specific cell identity determinant SXI1 alpha was also identified as a genetic factor likely involved in this process. In addition, laboratory-constructed alpha AD alpha strains exhibited hybrid vigor both in vitro and in vivo, providing a plausible explanation for their relative abundance in nature despite the fact that AD hybrids are inefficient in meiosis/sporulation and are trapped in the diploid state. These findings provide insights on the origins, genetic mechanisms, and fitness impact of unisexual hybridization in the Cryptococcus population.

AB Female baboons (Papio hamadryas spp.) must contend with myriad potential stressors on a daily basis. In a previous study on female chacma baboons, Papio hamadryas ursinus, living in the Okavango Delta of Botswana, increases in glucocorticoid (GC) concentrations were associated with female reproductive stage, male immigration and the threat of infanticide. Here, we extend this previous analysis to a larger data set with several additional potential stressors, including actual infanticide and instability in the female dominance hierarchy. A general linear mixed model showed that reproductive state, male immigration, infanticide, female rank instability and predation all had significant effects on GC levels. Lactating females' GC levels increased in response to the arrival of immigrant males and increased even further when infanticide occurred. In contrast, cycling and pregnant females' GC levels did not change. Females also showed elevated GCs in response to instability within their own dominance hierarchy, especially if their own ranks were at risk. Females' stress responses were frequent, but specific to events that threatened their own lives, the lives of their offspring, or their dominance ranks.

AB Here, we investigated the origin and genetic diversity of four alpine plant species co-occurring in the Spanish Sierra Nevada and other high mountains in south-western Europe by analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs).
   In Kernera saxatilis, Silene rupestris and Gentiana alpina we found intraspecific phylogroups corresponding to mountain regions as predicted by the vicariance hypothesis. Moreover, genetic distances between Sierra Nevada and Pyrenees populations were always higher than those between populations from the Pyrenees and the south-western Alps/Massif Central. This suggests successive disruption of gene exchange between mountain ranges as postglacial climatic warming proceeded from south to north.
   In Papaver alpinum, our data indicate that a central Pyrenean population arose via long-distance dispersal from the Sierra Nevada, and that vicariant separation events between the Sierra Nevada and the Pyrenees and between the Pyrenees and the south-western Alps occurred simultaneously.
   Overall, Sierra Nevada populations of all species investigated here preserve unexpectedly high (or not exceptionally reduced) genetic diversity. This testifies to the important influence of long-term isolation, i.e. vicariance, on genetic diversity through fostering the accumulation of new mutations and/or the fixation of ancestral ones.

AB Aim Our aims were to quantify climatic and soil controls on net primary productivity (NPP) and leaf area index (LAI) along subtropical to alpine gradients where the vegetation remains relatively undisturbed, and investigate whether NPP and LAI converge towards threshold-like logistic patterns associated with climatic and soil variables that would help us to verify and parameterize process models for predicting future ecosystem behaviour under global environmental change.
   Location Field data were collected from 22 sites along the Tibetan Alpine Vegetation Transects (TAVT) during 1999-2000. The TAVT included the altitudinal transect on the eastern slope of the Gongga Mountains in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau, with altitudes from 1900 m to 3700 m, and the longitudinal-latitudinal transect in the Central Tibetan Plateau, of approximately 1000 km length and 40 km width.
   Methods LAI was measured as the product of foliage biomass multiplied by the ratio of specific leaf area. NPP in forests and shrub communities was estimated as the sum of increases in standing crops of live vegetation using recent stem growth rate and leaf lifespan. NPP in grasslands was estimated from the above-ground maximum live biomass. We measured the soil organic carbon (C) and total and available nitrogen (N) contents and their pool sizes by conventional methods. Mean temperatures for the year, January and July and annual precipitation were estimated from available meteorological stations by interpolation or simulation. The threshold-like logistic function was used to model the relationships of LAI and NPP with climatic and soil variables.
   Results Geographically, NPP and LAI both significantly decreased with increasing latitude (P < 0.02), but increased with increasing longitude (P < 0.01). Altitudinal trends in NPP and LAI showed different patterns. NPP generally decreased with increasing altitude in a linear relationship (r(2) = 0.73, P < 0.001), whereas LAI showed a negative quadratic relationship with altitude (r(2) = 0.58, P < 0.001). Temperature and precipitation, singly or in combination, explained 60-68% of the NPP variation with logistic relationships, while the soil organic C and total N variables explained only 21-46% of the variation with simple linear regressions of log-transformed data. LAI showed significant logistic relationships with both climatic and soil variables, but the data from alpine spruce-fir sites diverged greatly from the modelled patterns associated with temperature and precipitation. Soil organic C storage had the strongest correlation with LAI (r(2) = 0.68, P < 0.001).
   Main conclusions In response to climatic gradients along the TAVT, LAI and NPP across diverse vegetation types converged towards threshold-like logistic patterns consistent with the general distribution patterns of live biomass both above-ground and below-ground found in our earlier studies. Our analysis further revealed that climatic factors strongly limited the NPP variations along the TAVT because the precipitation gradient characterized not only the vegetation distribution but also the soil N conditions of the natural ecosystems. LAI generally increased with increasing precipitation and was well correlated with soil organic C and total N variables. The interaction between LAI growth and soil N availability would appear to have important implications for ecosystem structure and function of alpine spruce-fir forests. Convergence towards logistic patterns in dry matter production of plants in the TAVT suggests that alpine plant growth would increase in a nonlinear response to global warming.

AB In this paper, dynamic factor analysis is used to estimate common trends in time series of squid catch per unit effort in Scottish (UK) waters. Results indicated that time series of most months were related to sea surface temperature measured at Millport (UK) and a few series were related to the NAO index. The DFA methodology identified three common trends in the squid time series not revealed by traditional approaches, which suggest a possible shift in relative abundance of summer- and winter-spawning populations.

AB Responses to successive drought and re-watering cycles (1-3 cycles) were compared in greenhouse-grown cuttings of Populus x canadensis (Moench) clones, 'Luisa_ Avanzo' and 'Dorskamp.' Total leaf number increment rate, duration of leaf expansion, total and individual leaf area expansion rates and stomatal conductance were recorded periodically during the experiment. Soil water content (SWC) and predawn leaf water potential (psi(WP)) were measured four times during each drought cycle. In parallel, relative leaf water content (RWC) and specific leaf area (SLA) were estimated on leaves collected from the top to bottom of each cutting. Under well-watered conditions, 'Luisa-Avanzo' and 'Dorskamp' differed in their patterns of leaf area expansion. Although duration of leaf expansion was similar between clones, 'Luisa_ Avanzo' exhibited higher total leaf number increment rates and individual leaf area increases than 'Dorskamp.' As a result, 'Luisa-Avanzo' cuttings reached larger individual and total leaf areas than 'Dorskamp.' 'Dorskamp' leaves had lower SLA than 'Luisa-Avanzo' leaves. In response to successive drought cycles, both clones underwent decreases in total leaf number increment rates and in total leaf area expansion rates, but both whole-plant and individual leaf areas were drastically reduced only in 'Luisa_Avanzo.' 'Dorskamp' maintained a constant leaf area as a result of an increase in the duration of leaf expansion during drought and a significant stimulation of individual leaf area expansion rate and total leaf number increment rate in response to re-watering. Drought caused a greater decrease in SLA in 'Luisa-Avanzo' than in 'Dorskamp.' Expanded leaves of 'Dorskamp' were constitutively dense or thick, or both, whereas leaves of 'Luisa-Avanzo' became dense or thick, or both, only in response to drought. In both clones, re-watering caused partial recovery of SLA to control values. Our data confirm previous field and greenhouse observations that 'Dorskamp' is more tolerant to successive drought and re-watering cycles than 'Luisa_Avanzo.' We conclude that this difference is mainly attributable to the plasticity of 'Dorskamp' after re-watering, rather than to clonal differences in drought responses.

AB We investigated the role of matrix type as a determinant of change in bird densities with forest patch area (patch area effect) in two different Fennoscandian landscape types: mature forest fragments surrounded by cut-over or regenerating forest and true forested islands surrounded by water. Since the matrix of forested archipelagoes offers no resources to and impedes movement of forest birds, we predict that patch area effects on bird densities should be stronger on forested islands than in forest patches fragmented by forestry. We compiled correlation estimates of the bird density-patch area relationship from the literature and analyzed the data using meta-analysis. Combined correlation coefficients were significantly positive on islands but were not significantly different from 0 in fragments. Within-species comparisons also showed that correlations were consistently more positive on islands than in fragments. On islands but not in fragments, the densities of forest specialist species were more sensitive to area than were the densities of forest generalists, suggesting that specialists are more sensitive to changes in matrix quality. Migration status was only weakly associated with bird responses to island or fragment area. Thus, forest fragments do not function as true islands. We interpret this as the result of compensatory effects of the surrounding matrix in terms of availability of resources and enhanced connectivity (matrix quality hypothesis). A purely patch-centered approach seems an unrealistic framework to analyze population processes occurring in complex landscapes. The characteristics of the habitat matrix should therefore be explicitly incorporated into the assessment of species' responses to habitat fragmentation.

AB We characterized recent historical and current vegetation composition and structure of a representative sample of subwatersheds on all ownerships within the interior Columbia River basin and portions of the Klamath and Great Basins. For each selected subwatershed, we constructed historical and current vegetation maps from 1932 to 1966 and 1981 to 1993 aerial photos, respectively. Using the raw vegetation attributes, we classified and attributed cover types, structural classes, and potential vegetation types to individual patches within subwatersheds. We characterized change in vegetation spatial patterns using a suite of class and landscape metrics, and a spatial pattern analysis program. We then translated change in vegetation patterns to change in patterns of vulnerability to wildfires, smoke production, and 21 major forest pathogen and insect disturbances. Results of change analyses were reported for province-scale ecological reporting units (ERUs). Here, we highlight significant findings and discuss management implications.
   Twentieth century management activities significantly altered spatial patterns of physiognomies, cover types and structural conditions, and vulnerabilities to fire, insect, and pathogen disturbances. Forest land cover expanded in several ERUs, and woodland area expanded in most. Of all physiognomic conditions, shrubland area declined most due to cropland expansion, conversion to semi- and non-native herblands, and expansion of forests and woodlands. Shifts from early to late seral conifer species were evident in forests of most ERUs; patch sizes of forest cover types are now smaller, and current land cover is more fragmented. Landscape area in old multistory, old single story, and stand initiation forest structures declined with compensating increases in area and connectivity of dense, multilayered, intermediate forest structures. Patches with medium and large trees, regardless of their structural affiliation are currently less abundant on the landscape. Finally, basin forests are now dominated by shade-tolerant conifers, and exhibit elevated fuel loads and severe fire behavior attributes indicating expanded future roles of certain defoliators, bark beetles, root diseases, and stand replacement fires. Although well intentioned, 20th-century management practices did not account for landscape-scale patterns of living and dead vegetation that enable forest ecosystems to maintain their structure and organization through time, or for the disturbances that create and maintain them. Improved understanding of change in vegetation spatial patterns, causative factors, and links with disturbance processes will assist managers and policymakers in making informed decisions about how to address important ecosystem health issues.

AB The host-tree and habitat requirements of an endangered saproxylic beetle species, Pytho kolwensis, which inhabits fallen spruce (Picea abies) trunks were studied. Host-tree quality of 150 potential host trees, 60 of which were inhabited, and stand characteristics were measured at six sites in eastern Finland. All of the P. kolwensis habitats were virgin spruce-mire forests with a stand continuity of at least 170-300 years, and a high volume of dead wood (73-111 m(3)/ha). Decay-class distribution of large-diameter logs was very even, indicating that the recruitment rare of large, fallen trunks had remained nearly constant for at least 100 years. Microclimate and host-tree quality were not likely factors explaining the habitat confinement of the species. We suggest that P. kolwensis is mainly restricted to spruce-mire forests because of the long-term continuous availability of suitable host trees in these habitats. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Applied conservation biology must provide solutions for the conservation of species in modern landscapes, where prime habitats are being continuously fragmented and altered and animals are restricted to small, nonviable populations. We studied habitat selection in a fragmented population of endangered Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) by examining 14 years of radiotracking data obtained from lynx trapped in two different source areas. Habitat selection was studied independently for predispersal lynx in the source areas, for dispersing individuals through the region, and for postdispersing animals, most of which settled far from their point of origin. A multivariate analysis of variance showed that habitat use differed significantly among these phases and between area of origin, but not between sexes. The habitat type most used, and best represented within home ranges, was the mediterranean scrubland. Pine plantations were also important during and after dispersal. The rest of the habitats were either avoided (open habitats) or used according to availability (pine and eucalyptus plantations) by dispersing lynx. Differences due to lynx origin were detected only during predispersal and dispersal and were observed because animals from each area had different habitat availability. Lynx with established territories did not use areas at random. They occupied patches of mediterranean scrubland more often than would be expected form scrubland availability during predispersal; the rest of the habitats were included within home ranges less than would be expected from their availability in the landscape. Results indicate that dispersing animals may use habitats of lower quality than habitats used by resident individuals, which suggests that conservation strategies applied across regions might be a viable objective.

AB In order to assess Early Cretaceous nannoplankton biogeography, we studied a series of sites which provide a north-south transect across the Atlantic Ocean, supplemented by sections from the North Sea Basin, Barents Sea, Falkland Plateau, Weddell Sea (Antarctica), Argo Abyssal Plain (NW of Australia) and Neuquen Basin (Argentina). Quantitative assemblage data were gathered from each site for seven time-slices within the Berriasian to Barremian interval, each horizon being determined by a nannofossil datum. Trends in species relative abundance and measures of diversity, evenness and richness provide revealing biogeographic information. A broad, low- to mid-palaeolatitude zone (50 degrees N-50 degrees S) is flanked in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres by distinct high-palaeolatitude zones. Major changes in assemblage abundance and composition occur across a sharp biogeographic 'front' at around 50 degrees N and S palaeolatitude. High-palaeolatitude assemblages are lower in species richness and diversity and characterised by the presence of abundant, typically bipolar, taxa (e.g. Crucibiscutum salebrosum). A less distinct biogeographic boundary at similar to 40 degrees N is distinguished by the presence/absence of rarer, but biogeographically significant, taxa, many of which have previously been assigned to Boreal or Tethyan provinces. Continental shelf sites are characterised by lower-diversity assemblages with common to dominant diagnostic taxa, which vary with palaeolatitude: Nannoconus and Micrantholithus at low palaeolatitudes, and Biscutum constans and Zeugrhabdotus spp. at higher palaeolatitudes. The latter two taxa are considered to be indicative of elevated surface-water fertility and the former two may have been similarly adapted. The genus Watznoueria is ubiquitously dominant, giving the populations an unevenness, which appears to be a common feature throughout coccolithophore history.

AB Defining 'plants' inclusively as 'photosynthetic eukaryotes', four basic body plans are identifiable among plant lineages (unicellular, siphonous, colonial and multicellular). All of these body plans occur in most plant lineages, but only the multicellular body plan was carried onto land by the embryophytes. Extensive morphological and anatomical homoplasy is evident among species with different body plans. This is ascribed to the facts that the acquisition of nutrients and radiant energy is affected by plant body size, shape and geometry, and that, with the exception of the unicellular body plan, each of the other body plans involves an 'open and indeterminate' ontogeny capable of modifying body size, shape and geometry regardless of how organized growth is achieved. In terms of unicellular species, the available data indicate that size-dependent variations in surface area, metabolic constituents (e.g. photosynthetic pigments), and reproductive rates limit maximum body size in nutrient poor habitats or those that change rapidly or unpredictably. This maximum size can be exceeded in more stable niches by either the cooperation of conspecific cells sharing a common extracellular matrix (i.e. the 'colonial' body plan) or by repeated mitotic cellular division associated with sustained cytoplasmic (symplastic) continuity (i.e. multicellularity). The siphonous plant body plan may have been evolutionarily derived from a unicellular or multicellular ancestral life form. Each of the plant body plans is reviewed in terms of its biomechanical advantages and disadvantages. Variants of the multicellular body plan, especially those of the Chlorophyta, Charophyta, and Embryophyta, are given special emphasis. (C) 2000 Annals of Botany Company.

AB Expansion of western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis spp. occidentalis Hook.) woodlands in the sagebrush steppe has the potential to change composition, structure, and productivity of understory vegetation. Cutting of western juniper woodland can potentially restore understory productivity and diversity. Understory responses were assessed after cutting a juniper woodland in southeastern Oregon in 1991. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with eight, 0.8 ha sized blocks and 2 treatments, cut and uncut woodland. Understory cover, density, diversity, biomass, and nitrogen (N) status were compared between treatments after cutting. Plants were separated into 5 functional groups: bluegrass (Poa spp.), perennial bunchgrass, perennial forb, annual forb, and annual grass. Cutting of juniper reduced belowground interference for soil water and N. Leaf water potentials were less negative (P<0.01) and understory N concentration and biomass N were greater (P<0.05) in the cut versus woodland treatment. Cutting of juniper trees was effective in increasing total understory biomass, cover, and diversity. In the second year post-cutting total understory biomass and N uptake were nearly 9 times greater in cut versus woodland treatments. Perennial plant basal cover was 3 times greater and plant diversity was 1.6 times greater in the cut versus woodland treatments. In the cut, perennial bunchgrass density increased by 1 plant m(-2) in both duff and interspace zones and bluegrass increased by 3 plants m(-2) in interspaces. Plant succession was dominated by plants present on the site prior to juniper cutting suggesting that pre-treatment floristics may be useful in predicting early successional understory response. Early plant dynamics on this site supports the multiple entrance point model of succession as perennial grasses and bluegrass made up the majority of total herbaceous biomass and cover.

AB The study of evolution has increasingly incorporated considerations of history, scale, and hierarchy, in terms of both the origin of variation and the sorting of that variation. Although the macroevolutionary exploration of developmental genetics has lust begun, considerable progress has been made in understanding the origin of evolutionary novelty in terms of the potential for coordinated morphological change and the potential for imposing uneven probabilities on different evolutionary directions. Global or whole-organism heterochrony, local heterochrony (affecting single structures, regions, or organ systems) and heterotopies (changes in the location of developmental events), and epigenetic mechanisms (which help to integrate the developing parts of an organism into a functional whole) together contribute to profound nonlinearities between genetic and morphologic change, by permitting the generation and accommodation of evolutionary novelties without pervasive, coordinated genetic changes; the limits of these developmental processes are poorly understood, however. The discordance across hierarchical levels in the production of evolutionary novelties through time, and among latitudes and environments, is an intriguing paleontological pattern whose explanation is controversial, in part because separating effects of genetics and ecology has proven difficult. At finer scales, species in the fossil record tend to be static over geologic time, although this stasis-to which there are gradualistic exceptions-generally appears to be underlain by extensive, nondirectional change rather than absolute invariance. Only a few studies have met the necessary protocols for the analysis of evolutionary tempo and mode at the species level, and so the distribution of evolutionary patterns among clades, environments, and modes of life remains poorly understood. Sorting among taxa is widely accepted in principle as an evolutionary mechanism, but detailed analyses are scarce; if geographic range or population density can be treated as traits above the organismic level, then the paleontological and macroecological literature abounds in potential raw material for such analyses. Even if taxon sorting operates on traits that are not emergent at the species level, the differential speciation and extinction rates can shape large-scale evolutionary patterns in ways that are not simple extrapolations from shortterm evolution at the organismal level. Changes in origination and extinction rates can evidently be mediated by interactions with other clades, although such interactions need to be studied in a geographically explicit fashion before the relative roles of biotic and physical factors can be assessed. Incumbency effects are important at many scales, with the most dramatic manifestation being the postextinction diversifications that follow the removal of incumbents. However, mass extinctions are evolutionarily important not only for the removal of dominant taxa, which can occur according to rules that differ from those operating during times of lower extinction intensity, but also for the dramatic diversifications that follow upon the removal or depletion of incumbents. Mass extinctions do not entirely reset the evolutionary clock, so survivors can exhibit unbroken evolutionary continuity trends that suffer setbacks but then resume, or failure to participate in the recovery.

AB Predators can have highly variable effects on the abundance and composition of food webs, ranging from strong to weak effects of top predators. Typical food web models assume that individual prey are identical in their susceptibility to predators throughout their lives, but many prey species become less vulnerable to predators through ontogeny. A simple set of models is explored where prey must pass through a vulnerable stage prior to achieving a predator-invulnerable size refuge. As productivity of the environment increases, the proportional impact of predators decreases because more individuals become and remain in the invulnerable adult stage. The addition of a competitor prey species that can not achieve size refuge results in contrasting outcomes. At low productivity the small species wins in competition, and the system is strongly consumer controlled At high productivity, the large species wins due to the presence of predators, and the system becomes less consumer controlled. At intermediate productivity either the small or the large species can win depending on initial conditions, and the system can be either strongly or weakly consumer controlled Such alternative stable equilibria derived from models with prey size refugia may help to explain many natural situations.

AB The differences between the composition of butterfly communities in gaps created by illegal logging and in closed canopy habitat were studied in montane forest in the Tam Dao Mountains, northern Vietnam. Methods of constrained ordination (canonical correspondence analysis, redundancy analysis) were used for data analysis. The species composition in the two habitats differs significantly. stenotopic species confined to the closed canopy habitat usually have a smaller geographic range. Although the species richness and diversity was higher in gaps, the conservation value of closed canopy habitat lies in the presence of species with restricted range. The creation of gaps by local people changes the natural disturbance regime and causes a threat to biota confined to the closed canopy forest. Bioindicator importance of the local butterfly fauna (Papilionoidea) was evaluated and a list of species is presented. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The distribution and abundance of Littoral ascidians were analyzed with respect to their possible relationships with environmental stress. As part of a multidisciplinary research project on the benthic communities in Algeciras Bay, southern Spain, a suite of environmental variables was measured (hydrodynamism, silting, suspended solids and organic matter). After displaying the similarities of fauna through clustering and ordination of sampling sites, the relationships between community differences and changes in the abiotic component were established based on the BIO-ENV procedure and Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Hydrodynamism and the percentage of organic matter in the silt is the variable combination that best explains (Spearman correlation of 0.82) the biotic structure. While all ascidians show a certain tolerance to diverse environmental factors, some species such as Ciona intestinalis, Diplosoma spongiforme, Phallusia mammillata, Microcosmus squamiger, Styela plicata and Synoicum argus could be considered as indicators of areas which have been subject to intense stress (substrate transformation, water stagnation and sedimentation excess) over long periods of time, whereas others such as Aplidium conicum, Aplidium punctum, Clavelina dellavallei, Halocynthia papillosa and Stolonica socialis, which live only in natural and non-perturbed rock areas, could be categorized as species very sensitive to stress, as well as indicators of good conditions.

AB A classic problem in population genetics is the characterization of discrete population structure in the presence of continuous patterns of genetic differentiation. Especially when sampling is discontinuous, the use of clustering or assignment methods may incorrectly ascribe differentiation due to continuous processes (e.g., geographic isolation by distance) to discrete processes, such as geographic, ecological, or reproductive barriers between populations. This reflects a shortcoming of current methods for inferring and visualizing population structure when applied to genetic data deriving from geographically distributed populations. Here, we present a statistical framework for the simultaneous inference of continuous and discrete patterns of population structure. The method estimates ancestry proportions for each sample from a set of two-dimensional population layers, and, within each layer, estimates a rate at which relatedness decays with distance. This thereby explicitly addresses the "clines versus clusters" problem in modeling population genetic variation, and remedies some of the overfitting to which nonspatial models are prone. The method produces useful descriptions of structure in genetic relatedness in situations where separated, geographically distributed populations interact, as after a range expansion or secondary contact. We demonstrate the utility of this approach using simulations and by applying it to empirical datasets of poplars and black bears in North America.

AB Ongoing climate change is modifying climatic conditions worldwide, with a trend towards drier conditions in most regions. Vegetation will respond to these changes, eventually adjusting to the new climate. It is unclear, however, how dose different ecosystems are to climate-related tipping points and, thus, how dramatic these vegetation changes will be in the short- to mid-term, given the existence of strong, stabilizing processes. Here, we review the published evidence for recent drought-induced vegetation shifts worldwide, addressing the following questions: (i) what are the necessary conditions for vegetation shifts to occur? (ii) How much evidence of drought-induced vegetation shifts do we have at present and where are they occurring? (iii) What are the main processes that favor/oppose the occurrence of shifts at different ecological scales? (iv) What are the complications in detecting and attributing drought-induced vegetation shifts? (v) What ecological factors can interact with drought to promote shifts or stability? We propose a demographic framework to classify the likely outcome of instances of drought-induced mortality, based upon the survival of adults of potential replacement species and the regeneration of both formerly dominant affected species and potential replacement species. Out of 35 selected case studies only eight were clearly consistent with the occurrence of a vegetation shift (species or biome shift), whereas three corresponded to self-replacements in which the affected, formerly dominant species was able to regenerate after suffering drought-induced mortality. The other 24 cases were classified as uncertain, either due to lack of information or, more commonly, because the initially affected and potential replacement species all showed similar levels of regeneration after the mortality event. Overall, potential vegetation transitions were consistent with more drought-resistant species replacing less resistant ones. However, almost half (44%) of the vegetation trajectories associated to the 35 case studies implied no change in the functional type of vegetation. Of those cases implying a functional type change, the most common one was a transition from tree- to shrub-dominated communities. Overall, evidence for drought-induced vegetation shifts is still limited. In this context, we stress the need for improved, long-term monitoring programs with sufficient temporal resolution. We also highlight the critical importance of regeneration in determining the outcome of drought induced mortality events, and the crucial role of co-drivers, particularly management. Finally, we illustrate how placing vegetation shifts in a biogeographical and successional context may support progress in our understanding of the underlying processes and the ecosystem-level implications.

AB To make progress scientists need to know what other researchers have found and how they found it. However, transparency is often insufficient across much of ecology and evolution. Researchers often fail to report results and methods in detail sufficient to permit interpretation and meta-analysis, and many results go entirely unreported. Further, these unreported results are often a biased subset. Thus the conclusions we can draw from the published literature are themselves often biased and sometimes might be entirely incorrect. Fortunately there is a movement across empirical disciplines, and now within ecology and evolution, to shape editorial policies to better promote transparency. This can be done by either requiring more disclosure by scientists or by developing incentives to encourage disclosure.

ID CONSERVATION; MAMMALS; POPULATIONS; PREDATORS; DECLINES; ECOLOGY
AB Large terrestrial carnivores are an ecologically important, charismatic and highly endangered group of species. Here, we assess the importance of prey depletion as a driver of large carnivore endangerment globally using lists of prey species for each large carnivore compiled from the literature. We consider spatial variation in prey endangerment, changes in endangerment over time and the causes of prey depletion, finding considerable evidence that loss of prey base is a major and wide-ranging threat among large carnivore species. In particular, the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi), tiger (Panthera tigris), dhole (Cuon alpinus) and Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis) all have at least 40% of their prey classified as threatened on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and, along with the leopard (Panethra pardus), all of these species except the Ethiopian wolf have at least 50% of their prey classified as declining. Of the 494 prey species in our analysis, an average of just 6.9% of their ranges overlap protected areas. Together these results show the importance of a holistic approach to conservation that involves protecting both large carnivores directly and the prey upon which they depend.

AB Modelling the economics of climate change is daunting. Many existing methodologies from social and physical sciences need to be deployed, and new modelling techniques and ideas still need to be developed. Existing bread-and-butter micro-and macroeconomic tools, such as the expected utility framework, market equilibrium concepts and representative agent assumptions, are far from adequate. Four key issues-along with several others-remain inadequately addressed by economic models of climate change, namely: (1) uncertainty, (2) aggregation, heterogeneity and distributional implications (3) technological change, and most of all, (4) realistic damage functions for the economic impact of the physical consequences of climate change. This paper assesses the main shortcomings of two generations of climate-energy-economic models and proposes that a new wave of models need to be developed to tackle these four challenges. This paper then examines two potential candidate approaches-dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models and agent-based models (ABM). The successful use of agent-based models in other areas, such as in modelling the financial system, housing markets and technological progress suggests its potential applicability to better modelling the economics of climate change.

ID BLACKPOLL WARBLERS; AUTUMN MIGRATION; ROUTE
AB Many fundamental aspects of migration remain a mystery, largely due to our inability to follow small animals over vast spatial areas. For more than 50 years, it has been hypothesized that, during autumn migration, blackpoll warblers (Setophaga striata) depart northeastern North America and undertake a non-stop flight over the Atlantic Ocean to either the Greater Antilles or the northeastern coast of South America. Using miniaturized light-level geolocators, we provide the first irrefutable evidence that the blackpoll warbler, a 12 g boreal forest songbird, completes an autumn transoceanic migration ranging from 2270 to 2770 km (mean +/- s.d.: 2540 +/- 257) and requiring up to 3 days (62 h +/- 10) of non-stop flight. This is one of the longest non-stop overwater flights recorded for a songbird and confirms what has long been believed to be one of the most extraordinary migratory feats on the planet.

AB An organism's phenotype can be influenced by maternal cues and directly perceived environmental cues, as well as by its genotype at polymorphic loci, which can be interpreted as a genetic cue. In fluctuating environments, natural selection favors organisms that efficiently integrate different sources of information about the likely success of phenotypic alternatives. In such situations, it can be beneficial to pass on maternal cues that offspring can respond to. A maternal cue could be based on environmental cues directly perceived by the mother but also partly on cues that were passed on by the grandmother. We have used a mathematical model to investigate how the passing of maternal cues and the integration of different sources of information evolve in response to qualitatively different kinds of temporal and spatial environmental fluctuations. The model shows that the passing of maternal cues and the transgenerational integration of sources of information readily evolve. Factors such as the degree of temporal autocorrelation, the predictive accuracy of different environmental cues, and the level of gene flow strongly influence the expression of adaptive maternal cues and the relative weights given to different sources of information. We outline the main features of the relation between the characteristics of environmental fluctuations and the adaptive systems of phenotype determination and compare these predictions with empirical studies on cue integration.

AB Sexual selection hypotheses stipulate that the major histocompatibility complex genes (MHC) constitute a key molecular underpinning for mate choice in vertebrates. The last four decades saw growing empirical literature on the role of MHC diversity and dissimilarity in mate choice for a wide range of vertebrate animals, but with mixed support for its significance in natural populations. Using formal phylogenetic meta-analysis and meta-regression techniques, we quantitatively review the existing literature on MHC-dependent mating preferences in nonhuman vertebrates with a focus on the role of MHC diversity and dissimilarity. Overall, we found small, statistically nonsignificant, average effect sizes for both diversity- and dissimilarity-based mate choice (r=0.113 and 0.064, respectively). Importantly, however, meta-regression models revealed statistically significant support regarding female choice for diversity, and choice for dissimilarity (regardless of choosy sex) only when dissimilarity is characterized across multiple loci. Little difference was found among vertebrate taxa; however, the lack of statistical power meant statistically significant effects were limited to some taxa. We found little sign of publication bias; thus, our results are likely to be robust. In light of our quantitative assessment, methodological improvements and fruitful future avenues of research are highlighted.

AB Context The knowledge on cambial activity in water-limited environments, such as the Mediterranean, is still fragmentary. Dendrochronological studies have determined that spring precipitation plays an important part in determining tree-ring width and the properties of tracheids. However, the complex relation between cambial phenology and climate is still far from understood.
   Aims We studied the influence of climate, especially water stress, on maritime pine wood formation with the aim of determining the influence of drought on cambial activity.
   Methods A plantation of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) was selected in the west coast of Portugal, to monitor cambial activity and wood formation using anatomical observations and band dendrometers. The trees were monitored weekly over 2 years (2010 and 2011).
   Results Xylem differentiation started earlier when warmer late winter temperatures were observed. Water stress triggered an earlier stop of wood formation and also the formation of tracheids with smaller lumen area. In both years a bimodal pattern of stem radial increment was registered by band dendrometers with two periods of increment: one in spring and another in autumn. The xylem anatomy study suggests that the autumnal increment period corresponded mostly to stem rehydration, since the differentiation of new xylem cells by the cambium was not observed.
   Conclusion Maritime pine cambial activity appears to be under a double climatic control: temperature influences cambial onset and water availability growth cessation.

AB Animal biometrics is an emerging field that develops quantified approaches for representing and detecting the phenotypic appearance of species, individuals, behaviors, and morphological traits. It operates at the intersection between pattern recognition, ecology, and information sciences, producing computerized systems for phenotypic measurement and interpretation. Animal biometrics can benefit a wide range of disciplines, including biogeography, population ecology, and behavioral research. Currently, real-world applications are gaining momentum, augmenting the quantity and quality of ecological data collection and processing. However, to advance animal biometrics will require integration of methodologies among the scientific disciplines involved. Such efforts will be worthwhile because the great potential of this approach rests with the formal abstraction of phenomics, to create tractable interfaces between different organizational levels of life.

AB MaxEnt is one of the most widely used tools in ecology, biogeography, and evolution for modeling and mapping species distributions using presence-only occurrence records and associated environmental covariates. Despite its popularity, the exponential model implemented by MaxEnt does not directly estimate occurrence probability, the natural quantity of interest when modeling species distributions. Instead, MaxEnt generates an index of relative habitat suitability. MaxLike, a newly introduced maximum-likelihood technique, has been shown to overcome the problem of directly estimating the probability of occurrence using presence-only data. However, the performance and relative merits of MaxEnt and MaxLike remain largely untested, especially when modeling species with relatively few occurrence data that encompass only a portion of the geographic range of the species. Using geo-referenced occurrence records for six species of ants in New England, we provide comparisons of MaxEnt and MaxLike. We show that by most quantitative metrics, the performance of MaxLike exceeds that of MaxEnt, regardless of whether MaxEnt models account for sampling bias and include greater model complexity than implemented in MaxLike. More importantly, for most species, the relative suitability index estimated by MaxEnt often was poorly correlated with the probability of occurrence estimated by MaxLike, suggesting that the two methods are estimating different quantities. For species distribution modeling, MaxLike, and similar models that are based on an explicit sampling process and that directly estimate probability of occurrence, should be considered as important alternatives to the widely-used MaxEnt framework.

AB Climate affects the timing, rate and dynamics of tree growth, over time scales ranging from seconds to centuries. Monitoring how a tree's stem radius varies over these time scales can provide insight into intra-annual stem dynamics and improve our understanding of climate impacts on tree physiology and growth processes. Here, we quantify the response of radial conifer stem size to environmental fluctuations via a novel assessment of tree circadian cycles. We analyze four years of sub-hourly data collected from 56 larch and spruce trees growing along a natural temperature gradient of similar to 6 degrees C in the central Swiss Alps. During the growing season, tree stem diameters were greatest at mid-morning and smallest in the late evening, reflecting the daily cycle of water uptake and loss. Along the gradient, amplitudes calculated from the stem radius cycle were similar to 50% smaller at the upper site (similar to 2200 m a.s.1.) relative to the lower site (similar to 800 m a.s.1.). We show changes in precipitation, temperature and cloud cover have a substantial effect on typical growing season diurnal cycles; amplitudes were nine times smaller on rainy days (>10 mm), and daily amplitudes are approximately 40% larger when the mean daily temperature is 15-20 degrees C than when it is 5-10 degrees C. We find that over the growing season in the sub-alpine forests, spruce show greater daily stem water movement than larch. However, under projected future warming, larch could experience up to 50% greater stem water use, which may severely affect future growth on already dry sites. Our data further indicate that because of the confounding influences of radial growth and short-term water dynamics on stem size, conventional methodology probably overstates the effect of water-linked meteorological variables (i.e. precipitation and relative humidity) on intra-annual tree growth. We suggest future studies use intra-seasonal measurements of cell development and consider whether climatic factors produce reversible changes in stem diameter. These study design elements may help researchers more accurately quantify and attribute changes in forest productivity in response to future warming. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Passerine Birds Breeding under Chronic Noise Experience Reduced Fitness

DT Article
ID HOUSE SPARROWS; ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE; RESPONSIVENESS; BLACKBIRD; SUCCESS;
   IMPACT; CALLS; SIZE; SEX
AB Background: Fitness in birds has been shown to be negatively associated with anthropogenic noise, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. It is however crucial to understand the mechanisms of how urban noise impinges on fitness to obtain a better understanding of the role of chronic noise in urban ecology. Here, we examine three hypotheses on how noise might reduce reproductive output in passerine birds: (H1) by impairing mate choice, (H2) by reducing territory quality and (H3) by impeding chick development.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We used long-term data from an island population of house sparrows, Passer domesticus, in which we can precisely estimate fitness. We found that nests in an area affected by the noise from large generators produced fewer young, of lower body mass, and fewer recruits, even when we corrected statistically for parental genetic quality using a cross-fostering set-up, supporting H3. Also, individual females provided their young with food less often when they bred in the noisy area compared to breeding attempts by the same females elsewhere. Furthermore, we show that females reacted flexibly to increased noise levels by adjusting their provisioning rate in the short term, which suggests that noise may be a causal factor that reduces reproductive output. We rejected H1 and H2 because nestbox occupancy, parental body mass, age and reproductive investment did not differ significantly between noisy and quiet areas.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest a previously undescribed mechanism to explain how environmental noise can reduce fitness in passerine birds: by acoustically masking parent-offspring communication. More importantly, using a cross-fostering set-up, our results demonstrate that birds breeding in a noisy environment experience significant fitness costs. Chronic noise is omnipresent around human habitation and may produces similar fitness consequences in a wide range of urban bird species.

AB Premise of study: There is increasing evidence that many plant invaders interfere with native plants through allelopathy. This allelopathic interference may be a key mechanism of plant invasiveness. One of the most aggressive current plant invaders is the clonal knotweed hybrid Fallopia x bohemica, which often forms monocultures in its introduced range. Preliminary results from laboratory studies suggest that allelopathy could play a role in this invasion.
   Methods: We grew experimental communities of European plants together with F. x bohemica. We used activated carbon to test for allelopathic effects, and we combined this with single or repeated removal of Fallopia shoots to examine how mechanical control can reduce the species' impact.
   Key results: Addition of activated carbon to the soil significantly reduced the suppressive effect of undamaged F. x bohemica on native forbs. The magnitude of this effect was similar to that of regular cutting of Fallopia shoots. Regular cutting of Fallopia shoots efficiently inhibited the growth of rhizomes, together with their apparent allelopathic effects.
   Conclusions: The ecological impact of F. x bohemica on native forbs is not just a result of competition for shared resources, but it also appears to have a large allelopathic component. Still, regular mechnical control successfully eliminated allelopathic effects. Therefore, allelopathy will create an additional challenge to knotweed management and ecological restoration only if the allelochemicals are found to persist in the soil. More research is needed to examine the mechanisms underlying Fallopia allelopathy, and the long-term effects of soil residues.

AB Temporal variation in species abundances occurs in all ecological communities. Here, we explore the role that this temporal turnover plays in maintaining assemblage diversity. We investigate a three-decade time series of estuarine fishes and show that the abundances of the individual species fluctuate asynchronously around their mean levels. We then use a time-series modelling approach to examine the consequences of different patterns of turnover, by asking how the correlation between the abundance of a species in a given year and its abundance in the previous year influences the structure of the overall assemblage. Classical diversity measures that ignore species identities reveal that the observed assemblage structure will persist under all but the most extreme conditions. However, metrics that track species identities indicate a narrower set of turnover scenarios under which the predicted assemblage resembles the natural one. Our study suggests that species diversity metrics are insensitive to change and that measures that track species ranks may provide better early warning that an assemblage is being perturbed. It also highlights the need to incorporate temporal turnover in investigations of assemblage structure and function.

AB Understanding the genetic basis of adaptation in response to environmental variation is fundamental as adaptation plays a key role in the extension of ecological niches to marginal habitats and in ecological speciation. Based on the assumption that some genomic markers are correlated to environmental variables, we aimed to detect loci of ecological relevance in the alpine plant Arabis alpina L. sampled in two regions, the French (99 locations) and the Swiss (109 locations) Alps. We used an unusually large genome scan [825 amplified fragment length polymorphism loci (AFLPs)] and four environmental variables related to temperature, precipitation and topography. We detected linkage disequilibrium among only 3.5% of the considered AFLP loci. A population structure analysis identified no admixture in the study regions, and the French and Swiss Alps were differentiated and therefore could be considered as two independent regions. We applied generalized estimating equations (GEE) to detect ecologically relevant loci separately in the French and Swiss Alps. We identified 78 loci of ecological relevance (9%), which were mainly related to mean annual minimum temperature. Only four of these loci were common across the French and Swiss Alps. Finally, we discuss that the genomic characterization of these ecologically relevant loci, as identified in this study, opens up new perspectives for studying functional ecology in A. alpina, its relatives and other alpine plant species.

AB The ongoing and projected warming in the northern high latitudes (NHL; poleward of 60 degrees N) may lead to dramatic changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle. On the one hand, warming and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration stimulate vegetation productivity, taking up CO2. On the other hand, warming accelerates the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), releasing carbon into the atmosphere. Here, the NHL terrestrial carbon storage is investigated based on 10 models from the Coupled Carbon Cycle Climate Model Intercomparison Project. Our analysis suggests that the NHL will be a carbon sink of 0.3 +/- 0.3 Pg C yr-1 by 2100. The cumulative land organic carbon storage is modeled to increase by 38 +/- 20 Pg C over 1901 levels, of which 17 +/- 8 Pg C comes from vegetation (43%) and 21 +/- 16 Pg C from the soil (8%). Both CO2 fertilization and warming enhance vegetation growth in the NHL. Although the intense warming there enhances SOM decomposition, soil organic carbon (SOC) storage continues to increase in the 21st century. This is because higher vegetation productivity leads to more turnover (litterfall) into the soil, a process that has received relatively little attention. However, the projected growth rate of SOC begins to level off after 2060 when SOM decomposition accelerates at high temperature and then catches up with the increasing input from vegetation turnover. Such competing mechanisms may lead to a switch of the NHL SOC pool from a sink to a source after 2100 under more intense warming, but large uncertainty exists due to our incomplete understanding of processes such as the strength of the CO2 fertilization effect, permafrost, and the role of soil moisture. Unlike the CO2 fertilization effect that enhances vegetation productivity across the world, global warming increases the productivity at high latitudes but tends to reduce it in the tropics and mid-latitudes. These effects are further enhanced as a result of positive carbon cycle-climate feedbacks due to additional CO2 and warming.

AB Background: The foraging behavior of blood-sucking arthropods is the defining biological event shaping the transmission cycle of vector-borne parasites. It is also a phenomenon that pertains to the realm of community ecology, since blood-feeding patterns of vectors can occur across a community of vertebrate hosts. Although great advances in knowledge of the genetic basis for blood-feeding choices have been reported for selected vector species, little is known about the role of community composition of vertebrate hosts in determining such patterns.
   Methods & Results: Here, we present an analysis of feeding patterns of vectors across a variety of locations, looking at foraging patterns of communities of mosquitoes, across communities of hosts primarily comprised of mammals and birds. Using null models of species co-occurrence, which do not require ancillary information about host abundance, we found that blood-feeding patterns were aggregated in studies from multiple sites, but random in studies from a single site. This combination of results supports the idea that mosquito species in a community may rely primarily on host availability in a given landscape, and that contacts with specific hosts will be influenced more by the presence/absence of hosts than by innate mosquito choices. This observation stresses the importance of blood-feeding plasticity as a key trait explaining the emergence of many zoonotic mosquito transmitted diseases.
   Discussion: From an epidemiological perspective our observations support the idea that phenomena promoting synchronization of vectors and hosts can promote the emergence of vector-borne zoonotic diseases, as suggested by observations on the linkages between deforestation and the emergence of several human diseases.

AB The nature of plant behaviour is discussed, and it is concluded that it is best described as what plants do. The possibility that plant behaviour is simply signal-induced phenotypic plasticity is outlined, and some limitations of this assumption are considered. Natural environments present many challenges to growing plants, and the consequent signalling that plants perceive is becoming extremely complex. Plant behaviour is active, purposeful and intentional, and examples are discussed. Much plant behaviour, concerned with stress and herbivory, is also based on an assessment of the future likelihood of further damaging episodes and is therefore predictive. Plant behaviour involves the acquisition and processing of information. Informational terminology provides a suitable way of incorporating the concepts of learning, memory and intelligence into plant behaviour, capabilities that plants are rarely credited with. Finally, trade-offs, cost-benefit assessments and decision making are common plant behavioural attributes. It is suggested that intelligent assessments that involve the whole plant are essential to optimize these adaptive capabilities.

AB The remaining Atlantic Forest fragments are structurally isolated by a matrix of pastures, plantations, or urban areas, and most remnants are small (<100 ha). Island biogeography theory has been used to predict the effects of such fragmentation in the remaining fragments, but human activities and land use around fragments may be equally important. A related question is which aspects of land use have a strong effect on biodiversity. We compare the relative importance of fragment size and isolation vs. land use around fragments as determinants of composition and richness of small mammals in Atlantic Forest fragments. We also compare two aspects of land use around fragments, economic activity (peri-urban, agriculture, cattle), and property ownership (peri-urban, low income rural producers, affluent rural producers). Small mammals were surveyed in 21 fragments varying from 12 to 250 ha, and in two sites of continuous forest in the Macacu River watershed. State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 1999 to 2007. The effects of land use, fragment size and isolation were formulated as eleven candidate models, compared by Akaike Information Criteria. In the models selected, species composition was associated more strongly with fragment size, followed by isolation, with a smaller effect of property ownership. Species richness was determined mostly by fragment isolation, but also by a negative effect of agriculture when it was the dominant economic activity. Regardless of the critics to island biogeography theory, fragment isolation and size were by far the most important determinants of species composition. Economic activity and property ownership allowed the detection of subtle but important effects of land use on species composition and richness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The question of whether ecological assemblages are structured by stochastic and deterministic (e. g. interspecific competition) processes is controversial, but it is difficult to design sampling regimes and experiments that can dissect the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes in natural assemblages. Using null models, we tested communities of arthropod decomposers in tropical epiphytes for patterns of species co-occurrence, while controlling for habitat gradients, seasonal variations and ecological succession. When environmental conditions were controlled, our analysis showed that the communities were structured stochastically. However, analysing mixed sets of communities that were deliberately created either from two distinct heights or two successional stages revealed that communities were structured deterministically. These results confirm that habitat gradients and dispersal/competition trade-offs are capable of generating non-random patterns within decomposer arthropod communities, but reveal that when such effects are accounted for, species co-occurrence is fundamentally random.

AB Accurate predictions of future shifts in species diversity in response to global change are critical if useful conservation strategies are to be developed. The most widely used prediction method is to model individual species niches from point observations and project these models forward using future climate scenarios. The resulting changes in individual ranges are then summed to predict diversity changes; multiple models can be combined to produce ensemble forecasts. Predictions based on environment-richness regressions are rarer. However, richness regression models, based on macroecological diversity theory, have a long track record of making reliable spatial predictions of diversity patterns. If these empirical theories capture true functional relationships between environment and diversity, then they should make consistent predictions through time as well as space and could complement individual species-based predictions. Here, we use climate change throughout the 20th century to directly test the ability of these different approaches to predict shifts of Canadian butterfly diversity. We found that all approaches performed reasonably well, but the most accurate predictions were made using the single best richness-environment regression model, after accounting for the effects of spatial autocorrelation. Spatially trained regression models based on macroecological theory accurately predict diversity shifts for large species assemblages. Global changes provide pseudo-experimental tests of those macroecological theories that can then generate robust predictions of future conditions.

AB Some 1339 trees from 48 Pinus pinaster stands were characterized by five chloroplast microsatellites, detecting a total of 103 distinct haplotypes. Frequencies for the 16 most abundant haplotypes (p(k) > 0.01) were spatially interpolated over a lattice made by 430 grid points. Fitting of spatially interpolated values on raw haplotype frequencies at the same geographical location was tested by regression analysis. A range-wide 'diversity map' based on interpolated haplotype frequencies allowed the identification of one 'hotspot' of diversity in central and southeastern Spain, and two areas of low haplotypic diversity located in the western Iberian peninsula and Morocco. Principal component analysis (PCA) carried out on haplotypes frequency surfaces allowed the construction of a colour-based 'synthetic' map of the first three PC components, enabling the detection of the main range-scale genetic trends and the identification of three main 'gene pools' for the species: (i) a 'southeastern' gene pool, including southeastern France, Italy, Corsica, Sardinia, Pantelleria and northern Africa; (ii) an 'Atlantic' gene pool, including all the western areas of the Iberian peninsula; and (iii) a 'central' gene pool, located in southeastern Spain. Multivariate and amova analyses carried out on interpolated grid point frequency values revealed the existence of eight major clusters ('gene zones'), whose genetic relationships were related with the history of the species. In addition, demographic models showed more ancient expansions in the eastern and southern ranges of maritime pine probably associated to early postglacial recolonization. The delineation of the gene zones provides a baseline for designing conservation areas in this key Mediterranean pine.

AB Spartina alterniflora is an invasive C-4 perennial grass, native to North America, and has spread rapidly along the east coast of China since its introduction in 1979. Since its intentional introduction to the Jiuduansha island in the Yangtze River estuary, Spartina alterniflora community has become one of the dominant vegetation types. We investigated the soil carbon in the Spartina alterniflora community and compared it with that of the native C-3 Scirpus mariqueter community by measuring total soil carbon (TC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total soil nitrogen (TN), and the stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) of various fractions. TC and SOC were significantly higher in Spartina alterniflora in the top 60 cm of soil. However, there was no significant difference in soil inorganic carbon (IC) between the two communities. Stable carbon isotopic analysis suggests that the fraction of SOC pool contributed by Spartina alterniflora varied from 0.90% to 10.64% at a soil depth of 0-100cm with a greater percentage between 20 and 40cm deep soils. The delta C-13 decreased with increasing soil depth in both communities, but the difference in delta C-13 among layers of the top 60cm soil was significant (p < 0.05), while that for the deeper soil layers (> 60 cm) was not detected statistically. The changes in delta C-13 with depth appeared to be associated with the small contribution of residues from Spartina alterniflora at greater soil depth that was directly related to the vertical root distribution of the species.

AB Despite an academic shift from dualistic to hybrid frameworks of culture/nature relations, separationist paradigms of environmental management have great resilience and vernacular appeal. The conditions under which they are reinforced, maintained or ruptured need more detailed attention because of the urgent environmental challenges of a humanly transformed earth. We draw on research in 265 Australian backyard gardens, focusing on two themes where conceptual and material bounding practices intertwine; spatial boundary-making and native plants. We trace the resilience of separationist approaches in the Australian context to the overlay of indigeneity/ non-indigeneity atop other dualisms, and their rupture to situations of close everyday engagement between people, plants, water and birds. Our ethnographic methods show that gardens are places where both attitudes and practices can change in the process of such engagements. In a world where questions of sustainability are increasingly driven by cities and their residents, these chains of agency help identify areas of hope and transformative potential as well as concern.

AB That empirical evidence is replicable is the foundation of science. Ronald Fisher, a founding father of biostatistics, recommended that a null hypothesis be rejected more than once because "no isolated experiment, however significant in itself, can suffice for the experimental demonstration of any natural phenomenon" (Fisher 1974:14). Despite this demand, animal behaviorists and behavioral ecologists seldom replicate studies. This practice is not part of our scientific culture, as it is in chemistry or physics, due to a number of factors, including a general disdain by journal editors and thesis committees for unoriginal work. I outline why and how we should replicate empirical studies, which studies should be given priority, and then elaborate on why we do not engage in this necessary endeavor. I also explain how to employ various statistics to test the replicability of a series of studies and illustrate these using published studies from the literature.

AB The signaling hypothesis of eggshell coloration in birds is based on the assumption that females of species with blue-green eggs signal their phenotypic quality to their mates through deposition of the antioxidant biliverdin as pigment. Egg pigmentation may be an expression of the condition of females at laying or of genetic linkages between egg color and female performance variables. We have supplemented 16 pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, females with mealworms before and during laying and compared the mass and color of their eggs as measured on the day of laying to those of 16 control females with the same nest construction and laying dates and clutch sizes. Supplemented females laid significantly heavier and more intensely blue-green eggs than control females. Egg blue-green chroma was significantly associated with the amount of biliverdin in eggshells. Egg color, and thus biliverdin content, is an expression of female condition at laying.

AB A wildfire burned through a previously sampled research site, allowing pre- and post-burn measurements of the forest floor, soils, and soil leaching near Lake Tahoe, Nevada. Fire and post-fire erosion caused large and statistically significant (P <= 0.05) losses of C, N, P, S, Ca, and Mg from the forest floor. There were no statistically significant effects on mineral soils aside from a decrease in total N in the surface (All) horizon, an increase in pH in the All horizon, and increases in water-extractable SO42- in the All and A12 horizons. Burning caused consistent but nonsignificant increases in exchangeable Ca 21 in most horizons, but no consistent or statistically significant effects on exchangeable K+ or Mg2+, or on Bray-, bicarbonate-, or water-extractable P concentrations. Before the burn, there were no significant differences in leaching, but during the first winter after the fire, soil solution concentrations of NH4+, NO3-, ortho-P, and (especially) SO42- were elevated in the burned area, and resin lysimeters showed significant increases in the leaching of NH4+ and mineral N. The leaching losses of mineral N were much smaller than the losses from the forest floor and All horizons, however. We conclude that the major short-term effects of wildfire were on leaching whereas the major long-term effect was the loss of N from the forest floor and soil during the fire.

AB Changes in competitive interactions under conditions of enhanced resource availability could explain the invasion success of some problematic plant species. For one invader of North American grasslands, Centaurea diffusa (diffuse knapweed), we test three hypotheses: (1) under ambient (high resource) conditions, C. diffusa is better able to tolerate competition from the resident community (competitive response), (2) under ambient conditions, C. diffusa strong impacts the competitive environment (competitive effect), and (3) reductions in nitrogen and/or phosphorus availability diminish these advantages. In support of our first hypothesis, C. diffusa was the most tolerant to neighbor competition of the four focal species under current resource conditions. In opposition to our second hypothesis, however, neighborhoods that contained C. diffusa and those where C. diffusa had been selectively removed did not differ in their impact on the performance of target transplant individuals or on resource conditions. Reduction in resource availability influenced competitive tolerance but not competitive impact, in partial support of our last hypothesis. Reduction in soil nitrogen (via sucrose carbon addition) enhanced the degree of neighbor competition experienced by all species but did not change their relative rankings; C. diffusa remained the best competitor under low nitrogen conditions. Reduction of soil phosphorus (via gypsum addition) weakened the ability of C. diffusa to tolerate neighbor competition proportionately more than the other focal species. Consequently, under low phosphorus conditions, C. diffusa lost its competitive advantage and tolerated neighbor competition similarly to the other focal species. We conclude that C. diffusa invasion may be double-edged: C. diffusa is less limited by nitrogen than the other focal species and is better able to utilize phosphorus to its competitive advantage.

AB 1. Web-location cannot be designed simply to optimize foraging success, but must be a compromise between competing factors, including microhabitat parameters (physical structure, microclimate) and predator avoidance.
   2. We tested the hypothesis that, despite these compromises, linyphiid spiders managed to locate their webs within microsites with enhanced prey resources.
   3. We tested further the 'equilibrium' hypothesis that spiders, within a community of species, occupy different, relatively narrow niche axes and despite being generalists do not simply aggregate to the same resources.
   4. In the first study of its kind, prey resources at web-sites were compared with those at matched non-web-sites with the same microhabitat properties. This was carried out for two subfamilies of Linyphiidae, one of which (Linyphiinae) is web-dependent and locates its web just above the ground, and the other (Erigoninae) is less web-dependent, locating its web on the ground and often hunting away from its web. We hypothesized that these subfamilies would locate their webs at microsites with enhanced densities of the prey most likely to be captured by their contrasting foraging strategies. We used spider weights as a surrogate for nutritional state, and compared spiders in webs with those without webs.
   5. We found that even within a relatively uniform crop of wheat, spiders located their webs at microsites with greater prey resources. The most numerous prey, Collembola, were at significantly greater density at web-sites of both subfamilies of spider. However, there were significantly more Collembola at web-sites of the surface-hunting Erigoninae. By contrast, significantly more non-Collembola prey, especially aphids and Thysanoptera, were found at web-sites of the Linyphiinae, whose aerial webs might be expected to intercept such prey more efficiently.
   6. These differences were also present at matched non-web-sites, suggesting that microsite selection by the spiders was determined by the spectra of prey present. Comparison of the weights of web-owning and non-web-owning Tenuiphantes tenuis (Linyphiinae) demonstrated the nutritional benefits of web-owning.
   7. The results suggested that the spiders used a combination of web-location strategies at the microhabitat level, foraging behaviour and (known) high-intensity intraspecific competition, to exploit prey-rich microsites efficiently within fields in a dynamic manner.

AB Dispersal can strongly influence local population dynamics and may be critical to species persistence in fragmented landscapes. Theory predicts that dispersal by resident stream organisms is necessary to offset the loss of individuals to downstream drift. However, there is a lack of empirical data linking dispersal and drift to local population dynamics in streams, leading to uncertainty regarding the general demographic significance of these processes and the power of drift to explain observed dispersal patterns. I assessed the contribution of dispersal along a first-order stream to population dynamics of the headwater salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus (Plethodontidae). I conducted mark-recapture surveys of two contiguous 500 in long sections of a study stream in June, July, and August of 1999, 2000, and 2001. Movement by G. porphyriticus larvae and adults showed a strong upstream bias in the study stream, as well as in 11 other streams that I surveyed. Using mark-recapture models and Akaike's information criterion for model selection, monthly probability of dispersal from the downstream section to the upstream section of the study stream (mean +/- I SE) was estimated to be 0.02 +/- 0.01. The probability of dispersal from the upstream section to the downstream section was 0.00 +/- 0.00. Monthly survival probabilities did not differ between sections. Estimated monthly population growth rates were 1.01 +/- 0.01 in both sections. Net dispersal from the downstream section to the upstream section contributed to the equality of population growth rates. Additionally, reproduction and individual condition were lower in the upstream section, suggesting that population stability and growth there (i.e., lambda greater than or equal to 1.0) may have been dependent on immigration from downstream. Similar interactions between dispersal and variation in local demographic rates along the stream continuum may underlie the distribution and abundance patterns of other organisms at multiple spatial scales. Greater empirical understanding of these interactions will improve conservation of stream biota. The strong upstream bias of G. porphyriticus movement suggests that dispersal is not a response to downstream drift. I propose an alternative model for the evolution of directionally biased dispersal based on the landscape-scale distribution of headwater habitats.

AB Root exclusion experiments demonstrated the importance of belowground competition between grasses and Prosopis glandulosa (honey mesquite) during the critical seeding establishment phase of the woody plant life cycle. Belowground available volume accounted for 67% and 79% of the variance in first- and second-year Prosopis seedling growth and survival, respectively. Available volume in the vertical dimension was more important than that in the horizontal dimension. Trials spanned years with contrasting annual precipitation, suggesting that root competition occurs in years of near-average as well as below-average annual rainfall. Spatial heterogeneity in canopy gaps and belowground biomass was also quantified in a Schizachayriuim-Paspalum grassland matrix and evaluated with respect to Prosopis seedling establishment. Of the 100 grid points encountered in four grass stands, 62% were unoccupied; and 50% of these exceeded 80 cm(2) (similar to10 cm diameter). Gaps greater than or equal to 10 cm in diameter were sufficient for successful Prosopis germination and survival after one (40%) and two (15%) growing seasons. Herbaceous root biomass was statistically comparable among stands, but point-specific biomass varied three orders of magnitude (<50 g/m(2) to >3000 g/m(2)). In addition, root biomass was temporally variable, ranging from a mean (+/-1 SE; g/m(2)) of 768 (86) in a year of below-average annual rainfall (1996; 721 mm) to 1108 (104) in a year of roughly average annual rainfall (1995; 1032 rum). It is often assumed that grasslands dominated by productive, late seral species will be resistant to woody plant encroachment; and that grazing, by reducing the ability of grasses to competitively exclude woody seedlings, makes grasslands susceptible to tree/shrub invasion. However, given the substantial annual variation in belowground biomass observed in this study, it seems reasonable that ungrazed grasslands may be more susceptible to woody plant encroachment in some years and more resistant in others. Furthermore, given the substantial spatial variation in aboveground gap area and belowground biomass, there may be numerous low-competition microsites for woody plant seedlings within ungrazed grasslands. A high degree of temporal and spatial variability in gap area and belowground biomass may therefore help explain successful establishment of woody seedlings in ungrazed or lightly grazed, late seral grasslands in the absence of fire. We found no correlation between aboveground structure and belowground biomass at scales of 1-10 m(2). Thus, readily quantifiable attributes such as grass basal area or gap area could not be used to infer site susceptibility to woody plant seedling establishment.

AB I hypothesized that for saproxylic insects, a habitat is fragmented when spatial connectivity of dead wood pieces (coarse woody debris) Is low. In a two-year study, I investigated the influence of volume and connectivity of pieces of dead wood on species richness and species composition of saproxylic Diptera and Coleoptera in a mixed beech-spruce forest reserve in Switzerland. Saproxylic insects are dependent during some part of their life cycle on dead wood, wood-inhabiting fungi, or on the presence of other saproxylic species. Volume and spatial distribution of dead wood pieces were recorded on scales ranging from 50-200 m around the plots where the insects were collected. Relationships between dead wood connectivity and species richness existed only on the 150 m scale. Plots with high dead wood connectivity had more species than plots with clumped distributions of dead wood pieces. Different species of saproxylic Diptera and Coleoptera were caught in plots with high versus low dead wood connectivity. Hence, for saproxylic insects, habitat fragmentation occurs at a local scale through the isolation of single dead wood pieces. Dead wood spatial distribution is therefore crucial fur the survival of these insects and should be considered in forest management plans.

AB The contribution of vegetation ecology to the study of biodiversity depends on better communication between the different research paradigms in ecology. Recent developments in vegetation theory and associated statistical modelling techniques are reviewed for their relevance to biodiversity. Species composition and collective properties such as species richness vary as a continuum in a multi-dimensional environmental space; a concept which needs to be incorporated into biodiversity studies. Different kinds of environmental gradients can be recognised and species responses to them vary. Species response curves of eucalypts to an environmental gradient of mean annual temperature have been shown to exhibit a particular pattern of skewed response curves. Generalised linear modelling (GLM) and generalised additive modelling (GAM) techniques are important tools for biodiversity studies. They have successfully distinguished the contribution of environmental (climatic) and spatial (history and species dispersal ability) variables in determining forest tree composition in New Zealand.
   Species richness studies are examined at global, regional and local scales. At all scales, direct and resource environmental gradients need to be incorporated into the analysis rather than indirect gradients e.g. latitude which have no direct physiological influence on biota. Evidence indicates that species richness at the regional scale is sensitive to environment, confounding current studies on local/regional species richness relationships. Plant community experiments require designs based on environmental gradients rather than dependent biological properties such as productivity or species richness to avoid confounding the biotic components. Neglect of climatic and other environmental gradients and the concentration on the collective properties of species assemblages has limited recent biodiversity studies. Conservation evaluation could benefit from greater use of the continuum concepts and statistical modelling techniques of vegetation ecology. The future development of ecology will depend on testing the different assumptions of competing research paradigms and a more inclusive synthesis of ecological theory.

AB Seven sites on three tributaries with intermittent flow regimes in the middle reaches of the Guadiana, i.e. Xevora, Caia and Degebe, were sampled approximately every 3 months from April 1995 to April 1997. The density and biomass of fish were greater in downstream rivers and sites. Along the Xevora River, a series of point abundance samples showed evidence of fish zonation along the river. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) suggested a simple relationship between the different species and their preferred habitat. The small-sized Rutilus alburnoides and Leucisus pyrenaicus used most or all of the habitats with some cover and flowing water. Greater concentrations of larger fish were found in downstream reaches which generally had greater depths as stream width increased: large Barbus microcephalus, B. steindachneri and B. comiza preferred such sites on the Degebe River. Droughts in seasonal Mediterranean streams such as the Guadiana River are a predictable natural disturbance. In the summer, flow ceases and some stretches of river consist of isolated pools. This results in intense aggregations of fish and possible competition for food and/or space. Although some species are well adapted to natural droughts, habitat degradation and possibly the introduction of exotic species contribute to marked variability in species composition.

AB The psychrotrophic bacterium Arthrobacter globiformis SI55 was grown at 4 and 25 degrees C, and the cell protein contents were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Cells subjected to cold shocks of increasing magnitude were also analyzed. Correspondence analysis of protein appearance distinguished four groups of physiological significance. Group I contained cold shock proteins (Csps) overexpressed only after a large temperature downshift. Group II contained Csps with optimal expression after mild shocks. Group III contained proteins overexpressed after all cold shocks. These last proteins were also overexpressed in cells growing at 4 degrees C and were considered to be early cold acclimation proteins (Caps). Group IV contained proteins which were present at high concentrations only in 4 degrees C steady-state cells and appeared to be late Caps. A portion of a gene very similar to the Escherichia coli cspA gene (encoding protein CS7.4) was identified. A synthetic peptide was used to produce an antibody which detected a CS7.4-like protein (A9) by immunoblotting two-dimensional electrophoresis gels of A. globiformis SI55 total proteins. Unlike mesophilic microorganisms, this CS7.4-like protein was still produced during prolonged growth at low temperature, and it might have a particular adaptive function needed for balanced growth under harsh conditions. However, A9 was induced at high temperature by chloramphenicol, suggesting that CS7.4-like proteins have a more general role than their sole implication in cold acclimation processes.

AB Predation by wolves Canis lupus Linnaeus, 1758 in ungulate communities in Europe, with special reference to the multi-species system of Bialowieza Primeval Forest (Poland/Belarus), was assessed on the basis results of original research and literature. In historical times (post-glacial period), the geographical range of the wolf and most ungulate species in Europe decreased considerably. Community richness of ungulates and potential prey for wolves, decreased over most of the continent from 5-6 species to 2-3 species. The wolf is typically an opportunistic predator with a highly diverse diet; however, cervids are its preferred prey. Red deer Cervus elaphus are positively selected from ungulate communities in all localities, moose Alces alces are the major prey only where middle-sized species are scarce. Poe deer Capreolus capreolus are locally preyed on intensively, especially where they have high density, co-exist mainly with moose or wild boar Sus scrofa, and red deer is scarce or absent. Wild boar are generally avoided, except in a few locations; and European bison Bison bonasus are not preyed upon by wolves. Wolf predation contributes substantially to the total natural mortality of ungulates in Europe: 42.5% for red deer, 34.5% for moose, 25.7% for roe der, and only 16% for wild boar. Food niche breadth (B) of wolves in Europe, calculated only for the ungulates considered in this study, increases with the number of ungulate species in the community. There is also a significant relationship between ungulate community breadth and food niche breadth of wolves. Food niche breadth of wolves, however, does not achieve very high values even in the richest ungulate communities. Wolves easily adapt to locally abundant food of anthropogenic origin (livestock, garbage). The level of predation on livestock may be a result of different husbandry practices (eg use of livestock guarding dogs) rather than of differences in availability of wild and domestic prey. Available data from Europe suggest that wolves likely limit density of red deer and moose in some areas. Poe deer density can be decreased locally by wolves but is limited mainly by lynx Lynx lynx. Wild boar density is more influenced by mast crops of Quercus spp. and Fagus silvatica (and to a lesser extent by snow depth) than by wolf predation.

AB As part of an integrated forest vegetation and soil survey, tree species composition (DBH greater than or equal to 10 cm) was recorded in 95 plots of 0.1 ha, distributed over the principal physiographic units in the middle Caqueta area, Colombian Amazonia. A total of 1077 tree species was found, classified into 271 genera and 60 families. Leguminosae and Sapotaceae show high familial importance values in all physiographic units. Lauraceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Moraceae, and Lecythidaceae are more important on well drained (flood plain or upland) soils, while Palmae, Guttiferae, Bombacaceae, and Apocynaceae are more important in swamps and on podzolised ('white sand') soils. Plots on well drained soils show a lower degree of dominance than plots in swamps or on podzolised ('white sand') soils. The composition of the most dominant species in the plots changes continuously. Most species (59%) are only recorded in one plot. Individual plot pairs generally show a low overlap of about 2-5 tree species, resulting in Jaccard coefficients below 20%.
   Complementary to a previous forest classification based on TWINSPAN analyses, detrended and canonical correspondence analyses were carried out, using CANOCO 3.1. Despite of a low amount of tree species variance explained (only 6.2% by the first two canonical axes), meaningful patterns of tree species composition were recognised. These are most strongly related to drainage, flooding, humus forms, and soil nutrient status. Forest types are well separated in the CCA ordination diagram. The most frequently found tree species are listed according to their preference with respect to drainage, flooding, and soil nutrient status.
   Tree species composition in the well drained upland forests was analysed separately. In view of the model explaining high NW Amazonian tree species diversity on the basis of dense community packing and high beta diversity along soil gradients, the canonical analysis here focused on the effect of soils. By means of partial canonical ordination it was found that patterns of tree species composition depended significantly on soil properties, even though the edaphic component explains only a small fraction of the tree species variance. The results show that the well drained uplands of the middle Caqueta area are covered by a complex of two intergrading tree species assemblages. The first assemblage (community of Goupia glabra-Clathrotropis macrocarpa) is associated to somewhat less poor, clayey soils developed in Andean origin deposits or Tertiary sediments from the Pebas formation. The second assemblage (community of Swartzia schomburgkii-Clathrotropis macrocarpa) shows affinities to very poor, loamy soils developed in parent materials derived from the Guiana shield. This simple dichotomous pattern of geology, soils, and forest types is incompatible with concepts of high soil heterogeneity and associated beta diversity controlling tree species diversity in well drained uplands of NW Amazonia. The gradient length of tree species in the detrended correspondence analysis was low (3.7 SD), also suggesting a low beta diversity.

TI How belowground interactions contribute to the coexistence of

AB Mycorrhizal strategies are very effective in enhancing plant acquisition of poorly-mobile nutrients, particularly phosphorus (P) from infertile soil. However, on very old and severely P-impoverished soils, a carboxylate-releasing and P-mobilising cluster-root strategy is more effective at acquiring this growth-limiting resource. Carboxylates are released during a period of only a few days from ephemeral cluster roots. Despite the cluster-root strategy being superior for P acquisition in such environments, these species coexist with a wide range of mycorrhizal species, raising questions about the mechanisms contributing to their coexistence.
   We surmise that the coexistence of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal strategies is primarily accounted for by a combination of belowground mechanisms, namely (i) facilitation of P acquisition by mycorrhizal plants from neighbouring cluster-rooted plants, and (ii) interactions between roots, pathogens and mycorrhizal fungi, which enhance the plants' defence against pathogens. Facilitation of nutrient acquisition by cluster-rooted plants involves carboxylate exudation, making more P available for both themselves and their mycorrhizal neighbours. Belowground nutrient exchanges between carboxylate-exuding plants and mycorrhizal N-2-fixing plants appear likely, but require further experimental testing to determine their nutritional and ecological relevance. Anatomical studies of roots of cluster-rooted Proteaceae species show that they do not form a complete suberised exodermis.
   The absence of an exodermis may well be important to rapidly release carboxylates, but likely lowers root structural defences against pathogens, particularly oomycetes. Conversely, roots of mycorrhizal plants may not be as effective at acquiring P when P availability is very low, but they are better defended against pathogens, and this superior defence likely involves mycorrhizal fungi. Taken together, we are beginning to understand how an exceptionally large number of plant species and P-acquisition strategies coexist on the most severely P-impoverished soils.

AB Loss of biodiversity caused by intensive agriculture is a major worldwide concern. Crop rotation can enhance crop productivity and increase soil microbial diversity. However, the functional significances of changes in soil microbial communities are poorly understood.
   Soil microbial communities from a cucumber monoculture system and the cucumber season of a two-year rotation system (tomato-celery-cucumber-Chinese cabbage) were analyzed by quantitative PCR and high throughput amplicon sequencing. Then, feedback effects of soil biota on cucumber seedlings were evaluated through soil sterilization, addition of soil inoculum, and application of bactericide and fungicide.
   Crop rotation increased cucumber yield and bacterial diversity, but decreased fungal diversity and abundance. The bacterial and fungal community compositions also differed between the two cropping systems. Abundances of potential plant pathogens and antagonistic microorganisms were lower while potential plant-growth-promoting microorganisms were higher in the rotation system. The overall effect of soil biota was positive on cucumber seedling growth, and was stronger in the rotation system.
   Increasing temporal plant diversity can change soil microbial communities and enhance crop productivity through positive plant-soil feedbacks mediated by soil biota.

AB Conservation corridors must facilitate long-distance dispersal movements to promote gene flow, prevent inbreeding, and allow animals to shift ranges with climate change. Least-cost models are used to identify areas that support long-distance movement. These models rely on estimates of landscape resistance, which are typically derived from habitat suitability.
   We examine two key steps in estimating resistance from habitat suitability: choosing a procedure to estimate habitat suitability, and choosing a transformation function to translate habitat suitability into resistance.
   We used linear and nonlinear functions to convert three types of habitat suitability estimates (from expert opinion, resource selection functions, and step selection functions) into resistances for elk (Cervus canadensis) and desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni). We evaluated the resulting resistance maps on an independent set of observed long-distance, prospecting movements.
   A negative exponential function best described the relationship between resistance values and habitat suitability for desert bighorn sheep indicating long-distance movers readily travel through moderately-suitable areas and avoid only the least suitable habitat. For desert bighorn sheep, all three suitability estimates performed better than chance, and resource and step selection functions outperformed expert opinion. For elk, all three suitability estimates performed the same as chance.
   When designing corridors to facilitate long-distance movements of mobile animals, we recommend transforming habitat suitability into resistance with a negative exponential function. Use of an exponential transformation means that larger fractions of the landscape offer low resistance, allowing greater flexibility in where a corridor is located.

AB Exotic plant invasions present a global threat to natural ecosystems, yet the efficacy of management efforts in mitigating invader impacts remains unclear. A rapidly emerging problem is that of secondary invasion - an increase in abundance of non-target exotics following treatment of targeted invasive plants. Here, we present a global literature review and meta-analysis directed at quantifying the magnitude of secondary invasion effects and identifying possible causes. Of 168 studies examining the efficacy of exotic plant management in terrestrial habitats, 29% quantified community responses sufficiently to evaluate secondary invasion. Meta-analysis of 60 cases from 38 studies showed that control efforts strongly reduced target invader abundance overall, but secondary invaders increased, with a mean effect size double what was found for native plants, which increased only weakly. Moreover, 89% of the secondary invaders identified were classified as noxious or invasive plants. Increases in secondary invaders were correlated with target invader reductions, but control method and target invader growth form failed to explain variation in secondary invader responses. These results suggest that target invader suppression is the key factor driving release of secondary invaders. However, management side effects, target invader legacy effects, provenance effects, and shifting environmental conditions may all facilitate secondary invasion. Invasive plant management often successfully suppresses target invaders, but the result is largely secondary invasion. Addressing this problem requires management strategies that anticipate and suppress secondary invaders while rapidly restoring native plants to fill the space vacated by the target weed. Accomplishing the latter will require improved re-vegetation techniques. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Global climate change is likely to modify the ecological consequences of currently acting stressors, but potentially important interactions between climate warming and land-use related stressors remain largely unknown. Agriculture affects streams and rivers worldwide, including via nutrient enrichment and increased fine sediment input. We manipulated nutrients (simulating agricultural run-off) and deposited fine sediment (simulating agricultural erosion) (two levels each) and water temperature (eight levels, 0-6 degrees C above ambient) simultaneously in 128 streamside mesocosms to determine the individual and combined effects of the three stressors on macroinvertebrate community dynamics (community composition and body size structure of benthic, drift and insect emergence assemblages). All three stressors had pervasive individual effects, but in combination often produced additive or antagonistic outcomes. Changes in benthic community composition showed a complex interplay among habitat quality (with or without sediment), resource availability (with or without nutrient enrichment) and the behavioural/physiological tendency to drift or emerge as temperature rose. The presence of sediment and raised temperature both resulted in a community of smaller organisms. Deposited fine sediment strongly increased the propensity to drift. Stressor effects were most prominent in the benthic assemblage, frequently reflected by opposite patterns in individuals quitting the benthos (in terms of their propensity to drift or emerge). Of particular importance is that community measures of stream health routinely used around the world (taxon richness, EPT richness and diversity) all showed complex three-way interactions, with either a consistently stronger temperature response or a reversal of its direction when one or both agricultural stressors were also in operation. The negative effects of added fine sediment, which were often stronger at raised temperatures, suggest that streams already impacted by high sediment loads may be further degraded under a warming climate. However, the degree to which this will occur may also depend on in-stream nutrient conditions.

AB Soil invertebrates are assumed to play a major role in ecosystem dynamics, since they are involved in soil functioning. Functional traits represent one of the main opportunities to bring new insights into the understanding of soil invertebrate responses to environmental changes. They are properties of individuals which govern their responses to their environment. As no clear conceptual overview of soil invertebrate trait definitions is available, we first stress that previously-described concepts of trait are applicable to soil invertebrate ecology after minor modification, as for instance the inclusion of behavioural traits. A decade of literature on the use of traits for assessing the effects of the environment on soil invertebrates is then reviewed. Trait-based approaches may improve the understanding of soil invertebrate responses to environmental changes as they help to establish relationships between environmental changes and soil invertebrates. Very many of the articles are dedicated to the effect of one kind of stress at limited spatial scales. Underlying mechanisms of assembly rules were sometimes assessed. The patterns described seemed to be similar to those described for other research fields (e.g. plants). The literature suggests that trait-based approaches have not been reliable over eco-regions. Nevertheless, current work gives some insights into which traits might be more useful than others to respond to a particular kind of environmental change. This paper also highlights methodological advantages and drawbacks. First, trait-based approaches provide complementary information to taxonomic ones. However the, literature does not allow us to differentiate between trait-based approaches and the use of a priori functional groups. It also reveals methodological shortcomings. For instance, the ambiguity of the trait names can impede data gathering, or the use of traits at a species level, which can hinder scientific interpretation as intra-specific variability is not taken into account and may lead to some biases. To overcome these shortcomings the last part aims at proposing some solutions and prospects. It concerns notably the development of a trait database and a thesaurus to improve data management.

AB Frequency, duration, and intensity of hot-weather events are all predicted to increase with climate warming. Despite this, mechanisms by which temperature increases affect individual fitness and drive population-level changes are poorly understood. We investigated the link between daily maximum air temperature (t(max)) and breeding success of Kalahari common fiscals (Lanius collaris) in terms of the daily effect on nestling body-mass gain, and the cumulative effect on size and age of fledglings. High t(max) reduced mass gain of younger, but not older nestlings and average nestling-period t(max) did not affect fledgling size. Instead, the frequency with which t(max) exceeded critical thresholds (t(crit)s) significantly reduced fledging body mass (t(crit)= 33 degrees C) and tarsus length (t(crit)= 37 degrees C), as well as delaying fledging (t(crit) = 35 degrees C). Nest failure risk was 4.2% per day therefore delays reduced fledging probability. Smaller size at fledging often correlates with reduced lifetime fitness and might also underlie documented adult body-size reductions in desert birds in relation to climate warming. Temperature thresholds above which organisms incur fitness costs are probably common, as physiological responses to temperature are non-linear. Understanding the shape of the relationship between temperature and fitness has implications for our ability to predict species' responses to climate change.

TI Decline in Kelp in West Europe and Climate
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID LAMINARIA-DIGITATA; PATTERNS; SEAWEEDS; MACROALGAE; TEMPERATE; IMPACT;
   ERRORS
AB Kelp ecosystems form widespread underwater forests playing a major role in structuring the biodiversity at a regional scale. Some seaweeds such as Laminaria digitata are also economically important, being exploited for their alginate and iodine content. Although some studies have shown that kelp ecosystems are regressing and that multiple causes are likely to be at the origin of the disappearance of certain populations, the extent to which global climate change may play a role remains speculative. Here we show that many populations of L. digitata along European coasts are on the verge of local extinction due to a climate-caused increase in sea temperature. By modeling the spatial distribution of the seaweed, we evaluate the possible implications of global climate change for the geographical patterns of the species using temperature data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). Projections of the future range of L. digitata throughout the 21st century show large shifts in the suitable habitat of the kelp and a northward retreat of the southern limit of its current geographic distribution from France to Danish coasts and the southern regions of the United Kingdom. However, these projections depend on the intensity of warming. A medium to high warming is expected to lead to the extirpation of the species as early as the first half of the 21st century and there is high confidence that regional extinction will spread northwards by the end of this century. These changes are likely to cause the decline of species whose life cycle is closely dependent upon L. digitata and lead to the establishment of new ecosystems with lower ecological and economic values.

AB The genomic architecture underlying ecological divergence and ecological speciation with gene flow is still largely unknown for most organisms. One central question is whether divergence is genome-wide or localized in genomic mosaics' during early stages when gene flow is still pronounced. Empirical work has so far been limited, and the relative impacts of gene flow and natural selection on genomic patterns have not been fully explored. Here, we use ecotypes of Atlantic cod to investigate genomic patterns of diversity and population differentiation in a natural system characterized by high gene flow and large effective population sizes, properties which theoretically could restrict divergence in local genomic regions. We identify a genomic region of strong population differentiation, extending over approximately 20cM, between pairs of migratory and stationary ecotypes examined at two different localities. Furthermore, the region is characterized by markedly reduced levels of genetic diversity in migratory ecotype samples. The results highlight the genomic region, or genomic island', as potentially associated with ecological divergence and suggest the involvement of a selective sweep. Finally, we also confirm earlier findings of localized genomic differentiation in three other linkage groups associated with divergence among eastern Atlantic populations. Thus, although the underlying mechanisms are still unknown, the results suggest that genomic mosaics' of differentiation may even be found under high levels of gene flow and that marine fishes may provide insightful model systems for studying and identifying initial targets of selection during ecological divergence.

AB According to the insurance hypothesis, more diverse plant communities are more likely to be resistant to drought. Whilst many experiments have been carried out to determine the effects of plant diversity on plant community insurance, the results are still contradictory. Here, we conducted a drought experiment where we tested whether the presence of subordinate species increases plant community insurance. In Swiss Jura grassland, we combined a removal experiment of subordinate species with a summer drought event using rainout shelters. Plant community composition was determined after the drought and based on biomass measurements; we estimated resistance, recovery and resilience of the plant community for each combination of treatments. Moreover, to assess drought impacts on water-use efficiency (WUE), we analysed carbon isotope ratios (13C values) in plant leaves of two dominants and two subordinates collected at the end of the drought period. We showed that subordinate species are more resistant to drought and increased community resistance by enhancing their above-ground biomass production during the imposed drought. These patterns were associated with decreased competitiveness of dominant species whose biomass decreased during drought. Significant increase in 13C values in plant tissue under drought indicated a better WUE for the measured species. Interestingly, the WUE was significantly higher in plots where subordinates were removed. Recovery and resilience were not affected by the summer drought, but the absence of subordinates reduced overall above-ground biomass in both watered and drought plots. Synthesis. We demonstrated that, independent of plant diversity, the presence of drought-resistant subordinate species increases plant community insurance against drought and, hence, is important for the functioning of grassland ecosystems.

AB Background: Elucidating the process of speciation requires an in-depth understanding of the evolutionary history of the species in question. Studies that rely upon a limited number of genetic loci do not always reveal actual evolutionary history, and often confuse inferences related to phylogeny and speciation. Whole-genome data, however, can overcome this issue by providing a nearly unbiased window into the patterns and processes of speciation. In order to reveal the complexity of the speciation process, we sequenced and analyzed the genomes of 10 wild pigs, representing morphologically or geographically well-defined species and subspecies of the genus Sus from insular and mainland Southeast Asia, and one African common warthog.
   Results: Our data highlight the importance of past cyclical climatic fluctuations in facilitating the dispersal and isolation of populations, thus leading to the diversification of suids in one of the most species-rich regions of the world. Moreover, admixture analyses revealed extensive, intra-and inter-specific gene-flow that explains previous conflicting results obtained from a limited number of loci. We show that these multiple episodes of gene-flow resulted from both natural and human-mediated dispersal.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the importance of past climatic fluctuations and human mediated translocations in driving and complicating the process of speciation in island Southeast Asia. This case study demonstrates that genomics is a powerful

AB Changes in livestock grazing regimes are among the most important drivers of species loss and decrease in functional diversity world-wide. However, taxonomic and functional diversities (TD and FD) can respond differently to changes in grazing regime or productivity. We surveyed plant communities from 67 sites under different grazing regimes (from heavy grazing to grazing abandonment) in wet and dry habitats, in both wet and dry years. We tested the influence of grazing intensity, habitat type and rainfall on TD, FD and the relationship between them. We also partitioned diversity to examine the effects of grazing on TD and FD across scales (within communities, within grazing levels and between grazing levels). The effect of grazing within and across communities was modulated by water availability, with grazing showing the strongest effects in dry habitats. The relationship between FD and TD varied between habitat types and years and revealed high functional similarity between species (i.e. redundancy) in dry habitats. TD was reduced in the driest conditions across all the observation levels, contrasting with the high temporal stability of FD, suggesting that FD was decoupled from TD, especially in dry habitats. However, despite the high temporal and spatial stability of FD, results show that under severely limited water availability, high grazing pressure can reduce FD, revealing a convergence in traits under the combined effect of grazing and drought conditions. Synthesis and applications. Results highlight the dependence of functional diversity on the combined effect of water availability and grazing regime. Under severely limited water availability, grazing intensification reduced the functional diversity of these grasslands. Because of the foreseeable reduction in water availability in Mediterranean environments, we recommend the adoption of flexible grazing management schemes that take species and functional diversities into account simultaneously and adapt the level of grazing pressure to water availability.

AB Net primary productivity (NPP) is a key flux in the terrestrial ecosystem carbon balance, as it summarizes the autotrophic input into the system. Forest NPP varies predictably with stand age, and quantitative information on the NPP-age relationship for different regions and forest types is therefore fundamentally important for forest carbon cycle modeling. We used four terms to calculate NPP: annual accumulation of live biomass, annual mortality of aboveground and belowground biomass, foliage turnover to soil, and fine root turnover in soil. For U. S. forests the first two terms can be reliably estimated from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data. Although the last two terms make up more than 50% of total NPP, direct estimates of these fluxes are highly uncertain due to limited availability of empirical relationships between aboveground biomass and foliage or fine root biomass. To resolve this problem, we developed a new approach using maps of leaf area index (LAI) and forest age at 1 km resolution to derive LAI-age relationships for 18 major forest type groups in the USA. These relationships were then used to derive foliage turnover estimates using species-specific trait data for leaf specific area and longevity. These turnover estimates were also used to derive the fine root turnover based on reliable relationships between fine root and foliage turnover. This combination of FIA data, remote sensing, and plant trait information allows for the first empirical and reliable NPP-age relationships for different forest types in the USA. The relationships show a general temporal pattern of rapid increase in NPP in the young ages of forest type groups, peak growth in the middle ages, and slow decline in the mature ages. The predicted patterns are influenced by climate conditions and can be affected by forest management. These relationships were further generalized to three major forest biomes for use by continental-scale carbon cycle models in conjunction with remotely sensed land cover types.

The article discusses advances in the last decade in the use of BNs as applied to environmental and resource management. We highlight progress in computational methods, best-practices for model design and model communication. We review several research challenges to the use of BNs in environmental and resource management that we think may find a solution in the near future with further research attention.

AB 1. The timing of seasonal activity (i.e. phenology) may play an important role in plant invasions. In ecosystems characterized by seasonal rainfall, early-active exotic species may pre-empt resources and attain competitive dominance via a seasonal priority advantage. Exotic annual grasses in California are often active earlier than native species, potentially because they possess greater germination plasticity. While these problematic invaders may usually benefit from having early phenology, their flexible germination cues might be manipulated as a restoration strategy to germinate seeds far in advance of favourable growing conditions, leading to a priority disadvantage.
   2. We manipulated the start of the growing season in an invaded California coastal sage scrub community characterized by a Mediterranean-type climate to (i) identify whether early-season phenology confers a performance advantage and (ii) test whether rainfall timing could be manipulated to favour native species. We compared the performance of seeded native and exotic focal species under ambient rainfall timing (winter rains) vs. with a pre-growing season (late-summer) watering event.
   3. Under ambient rainfall timing, exotic annual grasses and forbs germinated earlier and reached higher levels of abundance than native species, consistent with a seasonal priority advantage. Many exotic annual grasses germinated with pre-season watering, but none survived until the onset of natural rains. Observations suggest that early-germinating seedlings suffered mortality via herbivory. The watering pulse thus depleted the exotic seedbank, fewer exotic individuals germinated with winter rains, and exotic species attained lower abundance than under the natural rainfall timing.
   4. Native species, whether annual or perennial, did not germinate with the pre-season watering pulse, suggesting they may have more constrained germination cues than the exotic species.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that phenology is an important factor influencing invasion success, and that this could be manipulated to favour native species. Manipulation of the start of the growing season, for example through a pre-growing season watering event, could be a successful restoration strategy for native species in some ecosystems.

AB The ecological impact stemming from a biological invasion is the most poorly understood aspect of the invasion process. While forecasting methods are generally lacking, a potential means of predicting future impacts is to examine the effects caused by a nonindigenous species (NIS) at previously invaded locations, i.e., its invasion history. However, given the context dependence of impact and the scarcity of data, it is uncertain whether invasion history can in fact be used to forecast the effects of most introduced species. Using a sample of 19 aquatic NIS listed with the IUCN's 100 World's Worst Alien Invasive Species, we reviewed the literature to determine (1) the amount of information currently available concerning their ecological impacts, (2) if the effects reported to be caused by each NIS are consistent across multiple studies, and (3) whether their invasion histories provide sufficient quantitative information to assess and forecast the severity of their impacts on recipient environments. As a case study, we conducted a meta-analysis and developed models that relate the severity of the impacts of a well-documented invader, common carp (Cyprinus carpio), to two potential predictor variables: biomass and time since introduction. We then tested whether models developed from one set of observations can predict the severity of impacts reported at other sites. Models incorporating biomass and pre-impact conditions explained 91% of the variation in carp impact severity at new locations (i.e., those not used to build the models). For most other NIS, limited availability of comparable quantitative data currently prevents the development of similar empirical models for predicting the severity of future impact. Nonetheless, invasion history can often be used to develop informative predictions concerning the type and direction of impacts to be expected at novel recipient sites.

AB Understanding the factors related to invasive exotic species distributions at broad spatial scales has important theoretical and management implications, because biological invasions are detrimental to many ecosystem functions and processes. Housing development facilitates invasions by disturbing land cover, introducing nonnative landscaping plants, and facilitating dispersal of propagules along roads. To evaluate relationships between housing and the distribution of invasive exotic plants, we asked (1) how strongly is housing associated with the spatial distribution of invasive exotic plants compared to other anthropogenic and environmental factors; (2) what type of housing pattern is related to the richness of invasive exotic plants; and (3) do invasive plants represent ecological traits associated with specific housing patterns? Using two types of regression analysis (best subset analysis and hierarchical partitioning analysis), we found that invasive exotic plant richness was equally or more strongly related to housing variables than to other human (e. g., mean income and roads) and environmental (e. g., topography and forest cover) variables at the county level across New England. Richness of invasive exotic plants was positively related to area of wildland-urban interface (WUI), low-density residential areas, change in number of housing units between 1940 and 2000, mean income, plant productivity (NDVI), and altitudinal range and rainfall; it was negatively related to forest area and connectivity. Plant life history traits were not strongly related to housing patterns. We expect the number of invasive exotic plants to increase as a result of future housing growth and suggest that housing development be considered a primary factor in plans to manage and monitor invasive exotic plant species.

TI Bacterial Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning Relations Are Modified by
   Environmental Complexity

   SELECTION; CONSUMER; RATHER
AB Background: With the recognition that environmental change resulting from anthropogenic activities is causing a global decline in biodiversity, much attention has been devoted to understanding how changes in biodiversity may alter levels of ecosystem functioning. Although environmental complexity has long been recognised as a major driving force in evolutionary processes, it has only recently been incorporated into biodiversity-ecosystem functioning investigations. Environmental complexity is expected to strengthen the positive effect of species richness on ecosystem functioning, mainly because it leads to stronger complementarity effects, such as resource partitioning and facilitative interactions among species when the number of available resource increases.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we implemented an experiment to test the combined effect of species richness and environmental complexity, more specifically, resource richness on ecosystem functioning over time. We show, using all possible combinations of species within a bacterial community consisting of six species, and all possible combinations of three substrates, that diversity-functioning (metabolic activity) relationships change over time from linear to saturated. This was probably caused by a combination of limited complementarity effects and negative interactions among competing species as the experiment progressed. Even though species richness and resource richness both enhanced ecosystem functioning, they did so independently from each other. Instead there were complex interactions between particular species and substrate combinations.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our study shows clearly that both species richness and environmental complexity increase ecosystem functioning. The finding that there was no direct interaction between these two factors, but that instead rather complex interactions between combinations of certain species and resources underlie positive biodiversity ecosystem functioning relationships, suggests that detailed knowledge of how individual species interact with complex natural environments will be required in order to make reliable predictions about how altered levels of biodiversity will most likely affect ecosystem functioning.

AB There is now unequivocal evidence for global climate change; however, its potential impacts on evolutionary processes remain unclear. Many species have responded to contemporary climate change through shifts in their geographic range. This could lead to increased sympatry between recently diverged species; likely increasing the potential for hybridization. Recently, following a series of warm winters, southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans) in Ontario, Canada rapidly expanded their northern range limit resulting in increased sympatry with the closely related northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus). This provided the opportunity to test the prediction that contemporary climate change can act as a catalyst creating conditions for the formation of hybrid zones. Following extensive sampling and molecular analyses (nuclear and mitochondrial DNA), we identified the occurrence of hybridization between sympatric G. sabrinus and G. volans. There was evidence of backcrossing but not of extensive introgession, consistent with the hypothesis of recent rather than historic hybridization. To our knowledge, this is the first report of hybrid zone formation following a range expansion induced by contemporary climate change. This is also the first report of hybridization between North American flying squirrel species.

AB In this paper we aim to investigate the problems and potentialities of species distribution modeling (SDM) as a tool for conservation planning and policy development and implementation in tropical regions. We reviewed 123 studies published between 1995 and 2007 in five of the leading journals in ecology and conservation, and examined two tropical case studies in which distribution modeling is currently being applied to support conservation planning. We also analyzed the characteristics of data typically used for fitting models within the specific context of modeling tree species distribution in Central America. The results showed that methodological papers outnumbered reports of SDMs being used in an applied context for setting conservation priorities, particularly in the tropics. Most applications of SDMs were in temperate regions and biased towards certain organisms such as mammals and birds. Studies from tropical regions were less likely to be validated than those from temperate regions. Unpublished data from two major tropical case studies showed that those species that are most in need of conservation actions, namely those that are the rarest or most threatened, are those for which SDM is least likely to be useful. We found that only 15% of the tree species of conservation concern in Central America could be reliably modelled using data from a substantial source (Missouri Botanical Garden VAST database). Lack of data limits model validation in tropical areas, further restricting the value of SDMs. We concluded that SDMs have a great potential to support biodiversity conservation in the tropics, by supporting the development of conservation strategies and plans, identifying knowledge gaps, and providing a tool to examine the potential impacts of environmental change. However, for this potential to be fully realized, problems of data quality and availability need to be overcome. Weaknesses in current biological datasets need to be systematically addressed, by increasing collection of field survey data, improving data sharing and increasing structural integration of data sources. This should include use of distributed databases with common standards, referential integrity, and rigorous quality control. Integration of data management with SDMs could significantly add value to existing data resources by improving data quality control and enabling knowledge gaps to be identified.

AB Most echinoderms display seasonal or other temporal cycles of reproduction that presumably result from the complex interplay of endogenous and exogenous signals. Various environmental, chemical and hormonal factors, acting directly or indirectly, individually or in combination, have been proposed to cue, favour or modulate a suite of reproductive functions from the onset of gametogenesis to gamete release. From as early as the nineteenth century, an astonishing array of studies has been published on topics related to the control of reproduction in echinoderms, ranging from fortuitous behavioural observations to complex experimental demonstrations and molecular analyses. Although the exact pathways involved in the perception of external signals and their transduction into coordinated spawning events remain obscure for most species, significant advances have been made that shed new light on the information gathered over decades of research. By compiling the existing literature (over 1000 references), interpreting the main results, critically assessing the methodologies used and reviewing the emerging hypotheses, we endeavour to draw a clearer picture of the existing knowledge and to provide a framework for future investigation of the mechanisms that underlie reproductive strategies in echinoderms and, by extension, in other marine invertebrates.

TI Long-term effects of plant diversity and composition on soil nematode
   communities in model grasslands

AB An important component of plant-soil feedbacks is how plant species identity and diversity influence soil organism communities. We examine the effects of grassland plant species growing alone and together up to a richness of 12 species on nematode diversity and feeding group composition, eight years after the establishment of experimental grassland plots at the BIODEPTH site in northern Sweden. This is a substantially longer time than most other experimental studies of plant effects on soil fauna. We address the hypotheses that (1a) higher species or functional diversity of plants increases nematode diversity, as well as influences nematode community composition. Alternatively, (1b) individual plant species traits are most important for nematode diversity and community composition. (2) Plant effects on soil organisms will decrease with increasing number of trophic links between plants and soil fauna.
   Plant species identity was often more important than plant diversity for nematode community composition, supporting hypothesis 1b. There was a weak positive relation between plant and nematode richness, which could be attributed to the presence of the legume Trifolium pratense, but also to some other plant species, suggesting a selection or sampling effect. Several plant species in different functional groups affected nematode community composition. For example, we found that legumes increased bacterial-feeding nematodes, most notably r-selected Rhabditida, while fungal-feeding nematodes were enhanced by forbs. Other bacterial feeders and obligate root feeders were positively related to grasses. Plant effects were usually stronger on plant-, bacterial- and fungal-feeding nematodes than on omnivores/predators, which supports hypothesis 2.
   Our study suggests that plant identity has stronger effects than plant diversity on nematode community composition, but when comparing our results with similar previous studies the effects of particular plant species appear to vary. We also found that more productive plant species affected bacterial- feeding nematodes more than fungal feeders. Moreover, we observed stronger effects the fewer the number of trophic links there were between a nematode feeding group and plants. Although we found clear effects of plants on soil nematodes, these were probably not large enough to result in strong and persistent plant- soil-organism-plant feedback loops.

AB We measured leaf water relations and leaf structural traits of 20 species from three communities growing along a topographical gradient. Our aim was to assess variation in seasonal responses in leaf water status and leaf tissue physiology between sites and among species in response to summer water deficit. Species from a ridge-top heath community showed the greatest reductions in pre-dawn leaf water potentials (Psi(leaf)) and stomatal conductance during summer; species from a valley-floor woodland and a midslope mallee community showed less reductions in these parameters. Heath species also displayed greater seasonal reduction in turgor-loss point (Psi(TLP)) than species from woodland or mallee communities. In general, species that had larger reductions in Psi(leaf) during summer showed significant shifts in either their osmotic potential at full turgor (Psi(pi 100); osmotic adjustment) or in tissue elasticity (epsilon(max)). Psi(pi 100) and epsilon(max) were negatively correlated, during both spring and summer, suggesting a trade-off between these different mechanisms to cope with water stress. Specific leaf area varied greatly among species, and was significantly correlated with seasonal changes in Psi(TLP) and pre-dawn Psi(leaf). These correlations suggest that leaf structure is a prerequisite for cellular mechanisms to be effective in adjusting to water deficit.

AB Divergent natural selection drives evolutionary diversification. It creates phenotypic diversity by favoring developmental plasticity within populations or genetic differentiation and local adaptation among populations. We investigated phenotypic and genetic divergence in the livebearing fish Poecilia mexicana along two abiotic environmental gradients. These fish typically inhabit nonsulfidic surface rivers, but also colonized sulfidic and cave habitats. We assessed phenotypic variation among a factorial combination of habitat types using geometric and traditional morphometrics, and genetic divergence using quantitative and molecular genetic analyses. Fish in caves (sulficlic or not) exhibited reduced eyes and slender bodies. Fish from sulficlic habitats (surface or cave) exhibited larger heads and longer gill filaments. Common-garden rearing suggested that these morphological differences are partly heritable. Population genetic analyses using microsatellites as well as cytochrome b gene sequences indicate high population differentiation over small spatial scale and very low rates of gene flow, especially among different habitat types. This suggests that divergent environmental conditions constitute barriers to gene flow. Strong molecular divergence over short distances as well as phenotypic and quantitative genetic divergence across habitats in directions classic to fish ecomorphology suggest that divergent selection is structuring phenotypic variation in this system.

AB Biotic interactions in the rhizosphere are biologically important, and although many of those interactions have been well studied, the role of secreted proteins in the cross-talk between microbes and roots has not been investigated. Here, protein secretion was studied during the communication between the roots of two plants (Medicago sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana) and the bacterial symbiont of one of these species (Sinorhizobium meliloti strain Rm1021) and an opportunistic bacterial pathogen of A. thaliana (Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000) using a proteomic approach. It was found that protein exudation in the M. sativa-S. meliloti interaction caused an increase in the secretion of seven plant proteins, such as hydrolases, peptidases, and peroxidases among others in two or more time points compared with the plant control. In addition, four proteins, all of bacterial origin, were increased 1.5-fold more in this interaction compared with S. meliloti alone. However, these proteins were not induced when M. sativa was inoculated with P. syringae DC3000. The interaction between A. thaliana and P. syringae DC3000 highly induced the secretion of several plant proteins related to defense soon after initial contact with P. syringae, but these proteins were not secreted in the incompatible interaction with S. meliloti. The results of this study reveal a specific, protein level cross-talk between roots and microbes. These results suggest that secreted proteins may be a critical component in the process of signaling and recognition that occurs between compatible and incompatible interactions.

AB Projection of species-response to climate change scenarios is a key tool in conservation strategy. Previous studies have projected climate change impacts for animal and vascular plant species using the 'bioclimatic envelope' approach. In this study we apply the principles of the bioclimatic envelope approach to examine the response of 26 lichen species whose distributions are well characterised within the British Isles. Lichen species were subjectively selected based on their contrasting distributions, and their ecological traits, which fulfilled as closely as possible the assumptions of the bioclimatic envelope method. We used a split-sampling approach to model the species-response to present-day climate using confirmed records and pseudo-absences as input data, and testing each model against an 'independent' calibration dataset. Predictive models were projected using standard climate change scenarios comprising the UKCIP02 data. Projections indicate broad trends in the response of species placed into contrasting biogeographic groups, and point to the potential for significant change in the spatial distribution of the British lichen flora. We highlight putative threats to montane and Boreal elements of the lichen flora, and emphasise significant uncertainty in projected response of the UK's internationally important oceanic flora.

AB A spatially referenced biophysical model, the water and nitrogen management model (WNMM), was developed and shown to simulate dynamic soil water movement and soil-crop carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling under a given agricultural management, for the purpose of identifying optimal strategies for managing water and fertiliser N under intensive cropping systems (mainly wheat-maize) in the North China Plain and other regions in the world. A uniform data structure, ARC GRID ASCII format, was used both in GIS and WNMM for achieving a close Model-GIS coupling. A significant part of WNMM adopts and modifies concepts and components from widely used models, with a focus on soil N transformations. WNMM simulates the key processes of water dynamics in the surface and subsurface of soils: including evapotranspiration, canopy interception, water movement and groundwater fluctuations; heat transfer and solute transport; crop growth; C and N cycling in the soil-crop system; and agricultural management practices (crop rotation, irrigation, fertiliser application, harvest and tillage). The model runs on a daily time step at any desired scale and is driven by lumped variables (meteorological and crop biological data) in text data format, and spatial variables (soil and agricultural management) in ARC GRID ASCII format. In particular, WNMM simulates all key N transformations in agricultural fields, including mineralisation of fresh crop residue N and soil organic N, formation of soil organic N, immobilisation in biomass, nitrification, ammonia (NH3) volatilisation, denitrification and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. WNMM has been successfully applied in Fengqiu County, Henan Province and Luancheng County, Hebei Province, China at site and regional scales. The key WNMM components were intensively calibrated and verified against comprehensive field measurements of soil water content, evapotranspiration, crop leaf area index and yield, NH3 volatilisation, denitrification and N2O emissions as well as nitrate (NO3-)-N concentrations in the soil solution. A sensitivity analysis showed that WNMM was sensitive to changes in meteorological variables, soil hydraulic properties, land use and agricultural management. At the site scale, WNMM simulated well soil water content, crop growth and yield, NH3 volatilisation and soil NO3--N concentration. There was uncertainty in simulating soil denitrification and N2O emissions, when the predicted peaks of denitrification and N2O emissions at very wet conditions could not be confirmed because of limitations in the acetylene-inhibition method for measuring denitrification. At county scale, WNMM simulation of crop yield in Fengqiu County explained 22% of the variation in observed crop yields, and 31% of crop yield variation in Luancheng County where soil variation was less. These results are considered acceptable because factors such as soil salinity and other nutrient deficiencies, which have not been considered in this version of WNMM, may play a role. The source code for the WNMM is available on request. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports a bioclimatic envelope model study of the potential distribution of 19 tree species in the Iberian Peninsula during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21 000 yr BP) and the Mid-Holocene (6000 yr BP). Current patterns of tree species richness and distributions are believed to have been strongly influenced by the climate during these periods. The modelling employed novel machine learning techniques, and its accuracy was evaluated using a threshold-independent method. Two atmospheric general circulation models, UGAMP and ECHAM3 (generated by the Palaeoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project, PMIP), were used to provide climate scenarios under which the distributions of the 19 tree species were modelled. The results obtained for these scenarios were assessed by agreement measure analysis; they differed significantly for the LGM, but were more similar for the Mid-Holocene.
   The results for the LGM support the inferred importance of pines in the Iberian Peninsula at this time, and the presence of evergreen Quercus in the south. Important differences in the altitude at which the modelled species grew were also predicted. During the LGM, some normally higher mountain species potentially became re-established in the foothills of the Pyrenees. The warm Mid-Holocene climate is clearly reflected in the predicted expansion of broad-leaved forests during this period, including the colonization of the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula by evergreen Quercus species.

AB Because of tropical forests' disproportionate importance for world biodiversity and for the global carbon cycle, we urgently need to understand any effects on these ecosystems from the ongoing changes in climate and atmosphere. This review, intended to complement existing data reviews on this topic, focuses on three major classes of challenges that we currently face when trying to detect and interpret directional changes in tropical forests. One is the very limited existing information on the historical context of study sites. Lasting effects from past climate, natural disturbances, and/or human activities could be significantly affecting current-day processes in tropical forests and need to be investigated for all active field sites. Second, while progress has been made in recent years on standardizing and refining research approaches, a number of methods- and data-limitations continue to affect efforts both to detect within-forest changes and to relate them to ongoing environmental change. Important outstanding needs are improved sampling designs, longer time-series of observations, filling key data gaps, and data access. Finally, forest responses to ongoing environmental change are complex. The effects of many simultaneously changing environmental factors are integrated by the plants, and their responses can involve significant lags, carryovers, and non-linearities. Specifying effects of individual environmental changes, however, is required for accurate ecosystem-process models and thus for projecting future impacts on these forests. After discussing these several types of challenges and ways to address them, I conclude with a priority agenda for this critical area of research.

AB Valuable conservation research on the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) has identified that its current endangerment is primarily due to human persecution, although habitat alteration, interference competition with other large predators, and disease also are factors. Numerous studies have thus determined what should be avoided to sustain an African wild dog population, yet in this study we identify what is needed to conserve a wild dog population by using Jacobs' index to determine its preferred prey species. Twenty-four assessments of wild dog prey preference were calculated from 18 studies involving 4,874 kills of 45 species from throughout its distributional range. Wild dogs prefer prey within a bimodal body mass range of 16-32 kg and 120-140 kg, which is abundant and less likely to cause injury when hunted. This bimodal range follows that of optimal wild dog pack sizes based on energetic costs and benefits. Greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) and Thomson's gazelle (Gazella thomsonii) are killed by wild dogs wherever they coexist and are significantly preferred. Impala (Aepyceros melampus) and bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) also are significantly preferred. Our results allow wildlife managers to more accurately assess the survival chances of reintroduced or small wild dog populations by determining if sufficient preferred prey are available. These techniques are applicable to all adequately studied large predators.

AB Unique to South-east Asia, Lao People's Democratic Republic contains extensive habitat for tigers and their prey within a multiple-use protected area system covering 13% of the country. Although human population density is the lowest in the region, the impact of human occurrence in protected areas on tiger Panthera tigris and prey populations was unknown. We examined the effects of human-carnivore conflict on tiger and prey abundance and distribution in the Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area on the Lao-Vietnam border. We conducted intensive camera-trap sampling of large carnivores and prey at varying levels of human population and monitored carnivore depredation of livestock across the protected area. The relative abundance of large ungulates was low throughout whereas that of small prey was significantly higher where human density was lower. The estimated tiger density for the sample area ranged from 0.2 to 0.7 per 100 km(2). Tiger abundance was significantly lower where human population and disturbance were greater. Three factors, commercial poaching associated with livestock grazing followed by prey depletion and competition between large carnivores, are likely responsible for tiger abundance and distribution. Maintaining tigers in the country's protected areas will be dependent on the spatial separation of large carnivores and humans by modifying livestock husbandry practices and enforcing zoning.

AB 1. The many thousands of potential invasive species pose one of the greatest threats to global biodiversity world-wide. In this study we propose that assemblages of well-known global invasive pest species, irrespective of whether they arise by anthropogenic means, are non-random species groupings that contain hidden predictive information. Such information can assist the identification and prioritization of species that have the potential to pose an invasive threat in regions where they are not normally found.
   2. Data comprising the presence and absence of 844 insect pest species recorded over 459 geographical regions world-wide were analysed using a self-organizing map (SOM), a well-known artificial neural network algorithm. The SOM analysis classified the high dimensional data into two-dimensional space such that geographical areas that had similar pest species assemblages were organized as neighbours on a map or grid.
   3. The SOM analysis allowed each species to be ranked in terms of its risk of invasion in each area based on the strength of its association with the assemblage that was characteristic for each geographical region. A risk map for example species was produced to illustrate how such a map can be compared with the species' actual distribution and used with other information, such as the species' biotic characteristics and interactions with the abiotic environment, to improve pest risk assessments further.
   4. Synthesis and applications. This study presents a new approach to the identification of potentially high-risk invasive pest species based on the hypothesis that global insect pest assemblages are non-random species groupings that can be subjected to traditional community analysis. A well-known data mining and knowledge discovery method for high dimensional data, SOM, was used to determine pest species assemblages for global regions. Species were ranked according to their potential for establishment based on their strength of association with the species assemblage that characterizes a particular region. Such an analysis can then be used to support additional risk assessment of potential invasive species, giving invasive species researchers, conservation managers, quarantine and biosecurity scientists a means for prioritizing species as candidates for further research.

AB The extraordinary drought during the summer of 2003 in Central Europe allowed to examine responses of adult beech trees (Fagus sylvatica) to co-occurring stress by soil moisture deficit and elevated O-3 levels under forest conditions in southern Germany. The study comprised tree exposure to the ambient O-3 regime at the site and to a twice-ambient O-3 regime as released into the canopy through a free-air O-3 fumigation system. Annual courses of photosynthesis (A (max)), stomatal conductance (g (s)), electron transport rate (ETR) and chlorophyll levels were compared between 2003 and 2004, the latter year representing the humid long-term climate at the site. ETR, A (max) and g (s) were lowered during 2003 by drought rather than ozone, whereas chlorophyll levels did not differ between the years. Radial stem increment was reduced in 2003 by drought but fully recovered during the subsequent, humid year. Comparison of AOT40, an O-3 exposure-based risk index of O-3 stress, and cumulative ozone uptake (COU) yielded a linear relationship throughout humid growth conditions, but a changing slope during 2003. Our findings support the hypothesis that drought protects plants from O-3 injury by stomatal closure, which restricts O-3 influx into leaves and decouples COU from high external ozone levels. High AOT40 erroneously suggested high O-3 risk under drought. Enhanced ozone levels did not aggravate drought effects in leaves and stem.

AB Paternity in mate animals can be influenced by their phenotypic signals of quality. Accordingly, the behavior underlying patterns of paternity should be flexible as signals of quality change. To evaluate the dynamics of paternity allocation, we analyzed paternity before and after manipulating plumage coloration, a known signal of quality, in mate barn swallows Hirundo rustica. We found that, in successive breeding bouts, only mates whose plumage color was experimentally enhanced received greater paternity from their social mates, demonstrating evidence for flexible and dynamic paternity allocation and the importance for males of maintaining signals of quality wet[ after pair bond formation.

AB We compared the composition and structure of primary forest avifauna among primary forests, selectively logged forests and mixed-rural areas (e.g. villages and agricultural areas) of Peninsular Malaysia. We found that forests that were selectively logged at least 30 years ago contained only 73-75% of the 159 species of extant primary forest birds, with an increased proportion of dominant species. We estimated that only 28-32% of the primary forest species utilized the mixed-rural habitat, and that the number of species that bred in the agricultural landscapes might be even lower. The microhabitat of different species most affected their vulnerability to disturbance. Most small, arboreal frugivores and omnivores, and insectivores that fed from tree trunks, showed greater persistence in the mixed-rural habitat than ground dwelling bird species, which were affected most by disturbance. Resource abundance and variables that were closely related to forest disturbance such as the density of large trees, density of dead trees, canopy cover density and shrub volume influenced the distribution of the primary forest birds. Large primary forest reserves and a revision of short-cycle logging regimes (ca. 30 years) are needed if we are to conserve the lowland rainforest avifauna of Peninsular Malaysia and other parts of Southeast Asia.

Of the many models for species-abundance distributions (SADs), the lognormal has been the most popular and has been put forward as an appropriate null model for testing against theoretical SADs. In this paper we explore a number of reasons why the lognormal is not an appropriate null model, or indeed an appropriate model of any sort, for a SAD.
   2. We use three empirical examples, based on published data sets, to illustrate features of SADs in general and of the lognormal in particular: the abundance of British breeding birds, the number of trees > 1 cm diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) on a 50 ha Panamanian plot, and the abundance of certain butterflies trapped at Jatun Sacha, Ecuador. The first two are complete enumerations and show left skew under logarithmic transformation, the third is an incomplete enumeration and shows right skew.
   3. Fitting SADs by chi(2) test is less efficient and less informative than fitting probability plots. The left skewness of complete enumerations seems to arise from a lack of extremely abundant species rather than from a surplus of rare ones. One consequence is that the logit-normal, which stretches the right-hand end of the distribution, consistently gives a slightly better fit.
   4. The central limit theorem predicts lognormality of abundances within species but not between them, and so is not a basis for the lognormal SAD. Niche breakage and population dynamical models can predict a lognormal SAD but equally can predict many other SADs.
   5. The lognormal sits uncomfortably between distributions with infinite variance and the log-binomial. The latter removes the absurdity of the invisible highly abundant half of the individuals abundance curve predicted by the lognormal SAD. The veil line is a misunderstanding of the sampling properties of the SAD and fitting the Poisson lognormal is not satisfactory. A satisfactory SAD should have a thinner right-hand tail than the lognormal, as is observed empirically.
   6. The SAD for logarithmic abundance cannot be Gaussian.

AB A study based on AFLP markers was conducted to characterise the present population genetic structure of Carpinus betulus in Europe and to formulate guidelines for the use of this species in plantations on a local scale in Flanders. High within-population diversity and little (but significant) genetic differentiation were detected at both Flemish and European scales. However, there was a pattern of isolation by distance only at the European scale. Within-population gene diversity, a new rarefaction-based measure of number of genotypes ('band richness') and percentage of polymorphic loci are lower north of major mountain chains, suggesting that the mountain ranges formed a second bottleneck for the hornbeam during postglacial recolonisation. In Flanders, despite lower gene diversity, there were more polymorphic loci than in other European populations, a pattern that might have been caused by the mixing of material through planting, e.g. in hedges. In view of these findings, it is advised to create a single Flemish seed zone and to use preferentially reproductive material from this seed zone for new plantations in Flanders.

AB Populations of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae were sampled from two bulk soils, rhizosphere, and nodules of host legumes, fava bean (Vicia faba) and pea (Pisum sativum) grown in the same soils. Additional populations nodulating peas, fava beans, and vetches (Vicia sativa) grown in other soils and fava bean-nodulating strains from various geographic sites were also analyzed. The rhizobia were characterized by repetitive extragenomic palindromic-PCR fingerprinting and/or PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of 16S-23S ribosomal DNA intergenic spacers as markers of the genomic background and PCR-RFLP of a nodulation gene region, nodD, as a marker of the symbiotic component of the genome. Pairwise comparisons showed differences among the genetic structures of the bulk soil, rhizosphere, and nodule populations and in the degree of host specificity within the Vicieae cross-inoculation group. With fava bean, the symbiotic genotype appeared to be the preponderant determinant of the success in nodule occupancy of rhizobial genotypes independently of the associated genomic background, the plant genotype, and the soil sampled. The interaction between one particular rhizobial symbiotic genotype and fava bean seems to be highly specific for nodulation and linked to the efficiency of nitrogen fixation. By contrast with bulk soil and fava bean-nodulating populations, the analysis of pea-nodulating populations showed preferential associations between genomic backgrounds and symbiotic genotypes. Both components of the rhizobial genome may influence competitiveness for nodulation of pea, and rhizosphere colonization may be a decisive step in competition for nodule occupancy.

AB Past fire regimes may indicate under what conditions species have been able to exist in the past, but they do not provide clear and easy answers as to how the boreal landscape should be managed today. First, fire regimes have changed considerably over time through the effects of a changing climate, and sometimes even more dramatically through the influence of humans. Therefore it is unlikely that a close quantitative link exists between fire regime and biodiversity. Alternatively, if there is such a link, then biodiversity should have been highly variable in the past, even at the landscape scale. Second, it is impossible to re-enact all fire variables within forestry, particularly those operating at the landscape scale. An alternative to the superficial "emulation" of the past, which is so often claimed in today's forest management. would be to identify critical processes and habitats at the stand and landscape scale and find ways to maintain these at sufficient Levels. This requires detailed knowledge of the mechanisms involved, and will lead to very different solutions for different groups of species. For example: whereas the highly mobile fire-dependent insects can make use of randomly appearing and relatively small burns in the landscape, fire-dependent plants are typically seed bankers and require that fire returns to the same site within a reasonable time. For these and other more or less "sessile" organisms it is vital to designate selected stands and landscapes with long-term plans for the use of fire. Without such a long-term commitment to selected localities, much of the unique features associated with fire in the boreal landscape will be lost, despite a costly investment in prescribed burning.

AB Timber harvest, fire suppression, road construction, and domestic livestock grazing have transformed spatial patterns of Interior Northwest forests. As a consequence, parameters of current disturbance regimes differ radically from historical regimes; present-day wildlife habitat distributions differ from historical distributions; and long-term survival of some native terrestrial species is uncertain. Public land managers are under increasing scientific and social pressure to mold existing forest spatial patterns to reflect those resulting from natural disturbance regimes and patterns of biophysical environments. However, knowledge of the characteristics of natural spatial patterns is unavailable.
   Using a dichotomized ordination procedure, we grouped the 343 forested subwatersheds (mean area, 8000 ha) on the eastern slope of the Cascade Mountains in Washington State into ecological subregions by similarity of area in potential vegetation and climate attributes. We built spatially continuous "historical" (1938-1956) and "current" (1985-1993) vegetation maps for 48 randomly selected subwatersheds from aerial photo interpretations. From remotely sensed attributes, we classified cover types, structural classes, and potential vegetation types and attributed them to individual patches. We then estimated a reference variation (RV) in spatial patterns of patch types (cover type and structural class), by subwatersheds and five forested ecological subregions, using the 48 historical vegetation maps stratified by subregion and a spatial pattern analysis program. Finally, we compared the current pattern of an example subwatershed (MET_11) with the RV estimates of its corresponding subregion to illustrate how reference conditions can be used to evaluate the importance of spatial pattern change. By evaluating pattern changes in light of RV estimates (nominally, the sample median 80% range of a metric) and the full range of class and landscape metrics, we could identify both current and historical conditions of MET_11 that fell outside the RV. This approach gives land managers a tool to compare characteristics of present-day managed landscapes with reference conditions to reveal significant pattern departures, as well as to identify specific pattern characteristics that might be modified through management. It also provides a means to identify "outlier" conditions, relative to subregion RV estimates, that may occasionally be the object of pattern restoration activities.

ID NATURAL FIRE REGIMES; BOREAL FOREST; DIVERSITY; ALASKA
AB Managing forests for sustainable use requires that both the biological diversity of the forests and a viable forest industry be maintained. A current approach towards maintaining biological diversity is to pattern forest management practices after those of natural disturbance events. This paradigm hypothesizes that ecological processes will be maintained best where active management approximates natural disturbance events. The forest management model now used in most sub-boreal and boreal forests calls for regularly dispersed clearcuts no greater than 60-100 ha in size. However, the spatial characteristics of the landscape produced by this model are distinctly different from the historic pattern generated by wildfire, which was heretofore the dominant stand-replacing process in these forests. Wildfire creates a more complex landscape spatial pattern with greater range in patch size and more irregular disturbance boundaries. Individual wildfires are often over 500 ha put leave patches of unburned forest within them. The combination of these attributes is not present in recent clearcuts. Allowing a proportion of larger (i.e. >500 ha) harvest units may provide distinct economic advantages that could outweigh the opportunity costs of leaving some patches of forest behind. For the forest type examined, further evaluation of modelling forest harvest patterns more closely after the patterns created by wildfire is required as it may achieve a good balance and strike a suitable compromise between certain ecological and economic objectives of sustainable development.

AB 1. Based on information obtained from analysis of thirteen taxonomic groups of plants and animals occurring in the alluvial floodplain habitats of the Upper Rhone River, France, we synthesize results obtained on: (i) relationships among species traits; (ii) habitat utilization by species; (iii) the relationship between species traits and habitat utilization; (iv) trends in species traits in a framework of spatial and temporal variability; and (v) tests of trends predicted for species traits and species richness in the framework of spatial and temporal habitat variability in terms of the river habitat templet and patch dynamics concept.
   2. Species traits describing reproductive characteristics, food, and size had the closest relationships with each other in the various correspondence analyses performed. Faunal and floral separation by species traits produced groupings similar to those based on traditional taxonomy.
   3. Two major gradients appear in the utilization of the floodplain habitats: a vertical gradient from interstitial to superficial habitats; and a transverse gradient from the main channel to oxbow lakes, temporary waters, and terrestrialized habitats.
   4. For the majority of the groups examined, a statistically significant relationship was evident between the structure of the species trait and habitat utilization arrays. For these groups, the characteristics of the habitat act as a templet for species traits. Moreover, species trait modalities (i.e. categories defining traits) were significantly arranged along the axis of spatial and temporal variability for most groups, which indicates that such variability acts as a templet for species traits.
   5. Species traits did not conform to predictions of the river habitat templet because the observed modality sequences did not follow the trends predicted in a framework of spatial and temporal variability. Moreover, there was no clear pattern in the distribution of species traits along an axis of temporal variability for groups of organisms having different sizes, which is a correlate of longevity, nor did modalities of species traits that occur under conditions of low temporal variability also tend to occur under conditions of high spatial variability (or vice versa). Clearly, species traits occur as alternative suites of characteristics in various groups of organisms.
   6. The patch dynamics concept, which predicts that highest species richness occurs at intermediate levels of temporal variability and highest levels of spatial variability, was supported by observations in only two of the thirteen groups examined, and only partially (for spatial variability) when all 548 taxa were examined together.
   7. The predictions of the river habitat templet and patch dynamics concepts were not supported, perhaps because templet theories do not yet accommodate alternative suites of characteristics and trade-offs between combinations of traits, or perhaps because the single scale of variability considered in the analyses, the inhomogeneity of the available biological information, and the aggregation of species traits that were used created methodological problems.
   8. Ecologically sound river management policies eventually may be based on two key points that emerged from this synthesis: that the habitat acts as a templet for species traits, and that composite taxonomic groupings represent relatively homogeneous assemblages of species trait modalities.
   9. The use of statistical approaches developed in this project to analyse other long-term data sets may clarify questions about the applicability of habitat templet theories to river ecology, and hasten development of ecologically sound river management policies.

AB Rhizosphere bacteria were isolated from root tip segments of cucumber seedlings grown in a suppressive, slightly decomposed light-colored peat mix, a conducive, more decomposed dark-colored peat mix, and a suppressive dark peat mix amended with composted hardwood bark. The bacteria were identified by a gas chromatographic fatty acid methyl ester analysis. The total number of taxa recovered from a single root tip segment ranged from 9 to 18. No single taxon predominated on all root tip segments harvested from any of the mixes. The highest relative population density reached by a given taxon on any root tip segment was 45%. Hill's first and second diversity numbers, the modified Hill's ratio, and Hurlbert's rarefaction method, which were used as measures of species diversity, indicated that the organic matter decomposition level of the potting mixes did not affect bacterial species diversity. Bray-Curtis polar ordination and Dice resemblance functions, however, indicated that the organic matter decomposition level of a mix significantly influenced the composition of bacterial species in the rhizosphere. Pseudomonas spp. and other taxa capable of inducing suppression of pythium damping-off predominated in the suppressive mixes. These organisms were absent from the conducive mix, in which Arthrobacter and Bacillus spp. predominated. Although effective bacterial biocontrol agents were isolated from both the suppressive mixes and the conducive mix, the majority were isolated from the less decomposed suppressive mixes. Finally, the efficacy of strains was significantly greater in the slightly decomposed light peat mix than in the decomposed dark peat mix. Natural disease suppression within these mixes was associated with the organic matter decomposition level and the bacterial species compositions of the mixes.

TI MECHANISMS OF ARRESTED SUCCESSION IN SHRUBLANDS - ROOT AND SHOOT
   COMPETITION BETWEEN SHRUBS AND TREE SEEDLINGS
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Relative effects of above-ground and below-ground competition from shrubs (Cornus racemosa and Rhus glabra) on the growth of tree seedlings (Acer rubrum and Fraxinus americana) were assessed with a field experiment in the Hudson Valley, New York. Shade on tree seedlings planted in clumps of shrubs was reduced by guy-wiring back overtopping shrub crowns. Root competition was reduced by cutting a 0.5 m deep slit around the seedlings and inserting root restriction cloth. We also applied a combined treatment to some seedlings and reserved others as controls. In the field with the most severely drained and nutrient-poor soil, reduction of root competition increased relative growth rates of the seedlings while opening the canopy had no effect. Trenching and shade reduction around tree seedlings planted in shrubs clumps in a more mesic old field with a stony silt loam soil increased relative growth rates only if the treatments were combined. In a wet field with alluvial soil, guy-wiring back overtopping shrubs greatly increased seedling growth but trenching alone had no effect. Tree encroachment into shrub-dominated stands can be reduced by both root and shoot competition, but the severity of competition in these arenas varies with site conditions; below-ground competition is intense where soil resources are limited whereas the effects of shade are relatively more severe on sites with good soil.

AB (1) This study examined interspecific and intraspecific competition between plants either infected or uninfected with a fungal endophyte.  The two species used, tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) and perennial rye-grass (Lolium perenne L.), were grown at several densities and combinations in three greenhouse experiments.
   (2) In general, endophyte infection enhanced the competitive ability of tall fescue; in contrast, uninfected plants of perennial rye-grass performed better than infected plants under both interspecific and intraspecific competition.
   (3) The results suggest that the presence or absence of fungal endophytes could be an important determinant of competition success of grass species in grasslands.

AB Climate change is having a significant impact on ecosystem services and is likely to become increasingly important as this phenomenon intensifies. Future impacts can be difficult to assess as they often involve long timescales, dynamic systems with high uncertainties, and are typically confounded by other drivers of change. Despite a growing literature on climate change impacts on ecosystem services, no quantitative syntheses exist. Hence, we lack an overarching understanding of the impacts of climate change, how they are being assessed, and the extent to which other drivers, uncertainties, and decision making are incorporated. To address this, we systematically reviewed the peer-reviewed literature that assesses climate change impacts on ecosystem services at subglobal scales. We found that the impact of climate change on most types of services was predominantly negative (59% negative, 24% mixed, 4% neutral, 13% positive), but varied across services, drivers, and assessment methods. Although uncertainty was usually incorporated, there were substantial gaps in the sources of uncertainty included, along with the methods used to incorporate them. We found that relatively few studies integrated decision making, and even fewer studies aimed to identify solutions that were robust to uncertainty. For management or policy to ensure the delivery of ecosystem services, integrated approaches that incorporate multiple drivers of change and account for multiple sources of uncertainty are needed. This is undoubtedly a challenging task, but ignoring these complexities can result in misleading assessments of the impacts of climate change, suboptimal management outcomes, and the inefficient allocation of resources for climate adaptation.

AB Investigating how environmental features shape the genetic structure of populations is crucial for understanding how they are potentially adapted to their habitats, as well as for sound management. In this study, we assessed the relative importance of spatial distribution, ocean currents and sea surface temperature (SST) on patterns of putatively neutral and adaptive genetic variation among American lobster from 19 locations using population differentiation (PD) approaches combined with environmental association (EA) analyses. First, PD approaches (using BAYESCAN, ARLEQUIN and OUTFLANK) found 28 outlier SNPs putatively under divergent selection and 9770 neutral SNPs in common. Redundancy analysis revealed that spatial distribution, ocean current-mediated larval connectivity and SST explained 31.7% of the neutral genetic differentiation, with ocean currents driving the majority of this relationship (21.0%). After removing the influence of spatial distribution, no SST were significant for putatively neutral genetic variation whereas minimum annual SST still had a significant impact and explained 8.1% of the putatively adaptive genetic variation. Second, EA analyses (using Pearson correlation tests, BAYESCENV and LFMM) jointly identified seven SNPs as candidates for thermal adaptation. Covariation at these SNPs was assessed with a spatial multivariate analysis that highlighted a significant temperature association, after accounting for the influence of spatial distribution. Among the 505 candidate SNPs detected by at least one of the three approaches, we discovered three polymorphisms located in genes previously shown to play a role in thermal adaptation. Our results have implications for the management of the American lobster and provide a foundation on which to predict how this species will cope with climate change.

AB 1. The compositional complexity of an assemblage is not expressible as a single number; standard measures such as diversities (Hill numbers) and entropies (Renyi entropies and Tsallis entropies) vary in their order q which determines the measures' emphasis on rare or common species. Ranking and comparing assemblages depend on the choice of q. Rather than selecting one or a few measures to describe an assemblage, it is preferable to convey the complete story by presenting a continuous profile, a plot of diversity or entropy as a function of q >= 0. This makes it easy to visually compare the compositional complexities of multiple assemblages and to judge the evenness of the relative abundance distributions of the assemblages. In practice, the profile is plotted for all values of q from 0 to q = 3 or 4 (beyond which it generally changes little).
   2. These profiles are usually generated by substituting species sample proportions into the complexity measures. However, this empirical approach typically underestimates the true profile for low values of q, because samples usually miss some of the assemblage's species due to under-sampling. Although bias-reduction methods exist for individual measures of order q = 0, 1 and 2, there has been no analytic method that unifies these bias-corrected estimates into a continuous profile.
   3. For incomplete sampling data, this work proposes a novel analytic method to obtain accurate, continuous, low-bias diversity and entropy profiles with focus on low orders of q (0 <= q <= 3). Our approach is based on reformulating the diversity and entropy of any order q in terms of the successive discovery rates of new species with respect to sample size, that is the successive slopes of the species accumulation curve. A bootstrap method is applied to obtain approximate variances of our proposed profiles and to construct the associated confidence intervals.
   4. Extensive simulations from theoretical models and real surveys show that the proposed profiles greatly reduce under-sampling bias and have substantially lower bias and mean-squared error than the empirical profile, especially for q <= 1. Our method is also extended to deal with incidence data.

AB It is well documented that large herbivores have pronounced effects on plant communities in grassland ecosystems, and the extent and course of their effects can largely depend on both plant and herbivore characteristics. Previous studies highlighted the importance of plant productivity in predicting the impact of herbivores on grasslands. Yet, there has been little consideration of how different herbivores affect plant communities that, in turn, differ in plant diversity. In a 2-year grazing experiment, we tested the effects of large herbivores (cattle or sheep, or both together) on plant communities under high and low plant diversity levels in eastern Eurasian steppe. We found that, for high plant diversity grassland, mixed grazing by cattle and sheep significantly increases plant diversity, but we found no effect of grazing by cattle or sheep alone. Grazing by cattle or sheep alone or mixed grazing by cattle and sheep did not significantly affect plant biomass in the high diversity grassland. However, for low plant diversity grassland, grazing by cattle alone and mixed grazing by cattle and sheep significantly increased plant diversity, but significantly decreased plant biomass. There was no significant impact on both plant diversity and biomass from sheep grazing.Synthesis and applications. We conclude that the effects of grazing in grassland strongly depend on herbivore assemblages and pre-grazing plant diversity. Herbivore grazing might contribute more to the maintenance of grassland structure and ecosystem functioning under high plant diversity compared with low plant diversity. Furthermore, our data suggest that multiple-species mixed grazing regimes in grassland systems with high plant diversity could represent the optimal protocol for grazing management. This study emphasizes the importance of maintaining both plant and herbivore diversity to optimize ecosystem functioning.

AB People have been recording wildlife for centuries and the resulting datasets lead to important scientific research. The Biological Records Centre (BRC), established in 1964, is a national focus for terrestrial and freshwater species recording in the United Kingdom (UK). BRC works with the voluntary recording community (i.e. a mutualistic symbiosis) through support of national recording schemes (i.e. citizen science', but unlike most citizen science it is volunteer led) and adds value to the data through analysis and reporting. Biological recording represents a diverse range of activities, involving an estimated 70000 people annually in the UK, from expert volunteers undertaking systematic monitoring to mass participation recording. It is an invaluable monitoring tool because the datasets are long term, have large geographic extent and are taxonomically diverse (85 taxonomic groups). It supports a diverse range of outputs, e.g. atlases showing national distributions (12127 species from over 40 taxonomic groups) and quantified trends (1636 species). BRC pioneers the use of technology for data capture (online portals and smartphone apps) and verification (including automated verification) through customisable, inter-operable database systems to facilitate efficient data flow. We are confident that biological recording has a bright future with benefits for people, science, and nature.

FX Foremost, our acknowledgement go to the thousands of volunteer recorders
   and especially the volunteer experts who commit so much time as national
   recording scheme organisers and record verifiers. Without their
   contribution our knowledge of British wildlife would be so much poorer.
   The Biological Record Centre receives support from the Joint Nature
   Conservation Committee and the Natural Environment Research Council (via
   National Capability funding to the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology,
   project NEC04932). Thanks to Steph Rorke for producing the maps, to
   Richard Fox for assisting with Table 2, and to Martin Harvey and an
   anonymous reviewer for helpful comments.

TI Plant species' origin predicts dominance and response to nutrient

AB Exotic species dominate many communities; however the functional significance of species' biogeographic origin remains highly contentious. This debate is fuelled in part by the lack of globally replicated, systematic data assessing the relationship between species provenance, function and response to perturbations. We examined the abundance of native and exotic plant species at 64 grasslands in 13 countries, and at a subset of the sites we experimentally tested native and exotic species responses to two fundamental drivers of invasion, mineral nutrient supplies and vertebrate herbivory. Exotic species are six times more likely to dominate communities than native species. Furthermore, while experimental nutrient addition increases the cover and richness of exotic species, nutrients decrease native diversity and cover. Native and exotic species also differ in their response to vertebrate consumer exclusion. These results suggest that species origin has functional significance, and that eutrophication will lead to increased exotic dominance in grasslands.

AB Adverse experiences in early life can exert powerful delayed effects on adult survival and health. Telomere attrition is a potentially important mechanism in such effects. One source of early-life adversity is the stress caused by competitive disadvantage. Although previous avian experiments suggest that competitive disadvantage may accelerate telomere attrition, they do not clearly isolate the effects of competitive disadvantage from other sources of variation. Here, we present data from an experiment in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) that used cross-fostering to expose siblings to divergent early experience. Birds were assigned either to competitive advantage (being larger than their brood competitors) or competitive disadvantage (being smaller than their brood competitors) between days 3 and 12 post-hatching. Disadvantage did not affect weight gain, but it increased telomere attrition, leading to shorter telomere length in disadvantaged birds by day 12. There were no effects of disadvantage on oxidative damage as measured by plasma lipid peroxidation. We thus found strong evidence that early-life competitive disadvantage can accelerate telomere loss. This could lead to faster age-related deterioration and poorer health in later life.

AB Recent climate projections indicate substantial environmental alterations in oceanic island regions during the 21st century, setting up profound threats to insular floras. Inherent characteristics of island species and ecosystems (e.g. small population sizes, low habitat availability, isolated evolution, low functional redundancy) cause a particular vulnerability. Strong local anthropogenic pressures interact with climate change impacts and increase threats. Owing to the high degree of endemism in their floras, a disproportionally high potential for global biodiversity loss originates from climate change impacts on oceanic islands, We reviewed a growing body of research, finding evidence of emerging climate change influences as well as high potentials of future impacts on insular species and ecosystems. Threats from global climate change are not evenly distributed among the world's oceanic islands but rather vary with intrinsic (e.g. island area, structure, age and ecological complexity) and extrinsic factors (regional character, magnitude and rate of climatic alterations, local human influences). The greatest flora vulnerabilities to climate change impacts can be expected on islands of small area, low elevation and homogeneous topography. Islands of low functional redundancies will particularly suffer from high rates of co-modifications and co-extinctions due to climate-change-driven disruptions of ecological interactions. High threat potentials come from synergistic interactions between different factors, especially between climatic changes and local anthropogenic encroachments on native species and ecosystems. In addition, human responses to climate change can cause strong indirect impacts on island floras, making highly populated islands very vulnerable to secondary (derivative) effects. We provide an integrated overview of climate change-driven processes affecting oceanic island plants and depict knowledge gaps and uncertainties. The suitability of oceanic islands and their ecosystems for potential research on the field of climate change ecology is highlighted and implications for adequate research approaches are given.

AB <list list-type="1" id="mee312251-list-0001"> Information-theory procedures are powerful tools for multimodel inference and are now standard methods in ecology. When performing model averaging on a given set of models, the importance of a predictor variable is commonly estimated by summing the weights of models where the variable appears, the so-called sum of weights (SW). However, SWs have received little methodological attention and are frequently misinterpreted. We assessed the reliability of SW by performing model selection and averaging on simulated data sets including variables strongly and weakly correlated to the response variable and a variable unrelated to the response. Our aim was to investigate how useful SWs are to inform about the relative importance of predictor variables. SW can take a wide range of possible values, even for predictor variables unrelated to the response. As a consequence, SW with intermediate values cannot be confidently interpreted as denoting importance for the considered predictor variable. Increasing sample size using an alternative information criterion for model selection or using only a subset of candidate models for model averaging did not qualitatively change our results: a variable of a given effect size can take a wide range of SW values. Contrary to what is assumed in many ecological studies, it seems hazardous to define a threshold for SW above which a variable is considered as having a statistical effect on the response and SW is not a measure of effect size. Although we did not consider every possible condition of analysis, it is likely that in most situations, SW is a poor estimate of variable's importance. <doi origin="wiley" registered="yes">10.1111/(ISSN)2041-210X</doi

AB In this study, the evaluation of soil characteristics was coupled with a pyrosequencing analysis of the V2-V3 16S rRNA gene region in order to investigate the bacterial community structure and diversity in the A horizon of a natural saline soil located in Sicily (Italy). The main aim of the research was to assess the organisation and diversity of microbial taxa using a spatial scale that revealed physical and chemical heterogeneity of the habitat under investigation. The results provided information on the type of distribution of different bacterial groups as a function of spatial gradients of soil salinity and pH. The analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA showed differences in bacterial composition and diversity due to a variable salt concentration in the soil. The bacterial community showed a statistically significant spatial variability. Some bacterial phyla appeared spread in the whole area, whatever the salinity gradient. It emerged therefore that a patchy saline soil can not contain just a single microbial community selected to withstand extreme osmotic phenomena, but many communities that can be variously correlated to one or more environmental parameters. Sequences have been deposited to the SRA database and can be accessed on ID Project PRJNA241061.

AB The urbanization process affects faunal distributions and movement patterns, contributing directly to biotic homogenization and representing an important threat to biodiversity. In particular, birds, which have been well studied as indicators of anthropogenic disturbance, are especially valuable in evaluating these impacts.
   While the negative impact of these processes and structures, most notably road and railway networks, are now well appreciated (e.g. habitat loss, disturbance, noise, mortality by collisions, barrier effects), the potentially positive effects on wildlife are less appreciated (the number of documented negative effects of roads on animal abundance outnumbered the number of positive effects by a factor of 5). Here, were reviewed a total of 92 peer-reviewed publications for the period of 36 years between 1978 and 2014, which reported positive effects of roads and associated anthropogenic structures on birds. Our results show that roads, railways and several associated constructions, commonly implicated in the decline of biodiversity, may also have positive effects on certain bird species or communities. The main types of positive effects on birds identified were classified as: (1) roads: providing foraging habitat; reducing the predation pressures; and providing a warm surface assists in conserving metabolic energy; (2) lights of streets: prolonging diurnal activity; (3) powerlines, fences, etc. along roads: providing perches for hunting activities; and (4) bridges, pylons, tree lines along roadsides, bases of powerline pylons: providing nesting sites and cover from predators. From this review, we provide a useful tool for ecologists, road planners and other stakeholders engaged on conservation or landscape planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The growing interest in the effects of light pollution on daily and seasonal cycles of animals has led to a boost of research in recent years. In birds, it has been hypothesized that artificial light at night can affect daily aspects of behaviour, but one caveat is the lack of knowledge about the light intensity that wild animals, such as birds, are exposed to during the night.
   Organisms have naturally evolved daily rhythms to adapt to the 24-h cycle of day and night, thus, it is important to investigate the potential shifts in daily cycles due to global anthropogenic processes such as urbanization.
   We captured adult male European blackbirds (Turdus merula) in one rural forest and two urban sites differing in the degree of anthropogenic disturbance. We tagged these birds with light loggers and simultaneously recorded changes in activity status (active/non-active) through an automated telemetry system. We first analysed the relationship between light at night, weather conditions and date with daily activity onset and end. We then compared activity, light at night exposure and noise levels between weekdays and weekends.
   Onset of daily activity was significantly advanced in both urban sites compared to the rural population, while end of daily activity did not vary either among sites. Birds exposed to higher amounts of light in the late night showed earlier onset of activity in the morning, but light at night did not influence end of daily activity. Light exposure at night and onset/end of daily activity timing was not different between weekdays and weekends, but all noise variables were. A strong seasonal effect was detected in both urban and rural populations, such as birds tended to be active earlier in the morning and later in the evening (relative to civil twilight) in the early breeding season than at later stages.
   Our results point at artificial light at night as a major driver of change in timing of daily activity. Future research should focus on the costs and benefits of altered daily rhythmicity in birds thriving in urban areas.

AB Microbial extracellular electron transfer (EET) to solid surfaces is an important reaction for metal reduction occurring in various anoxic environments. However, it is challenging to accurately characterize EET-active microbial communities and each member's contribution to EET reactions because of changes in composition and concentrations of electron donors and solid-phase acceptors. Here, we used bioelectrochemical systems to systematically evaluate the synergistic effects of carbon source and surface redox potential on EET-active microbial community development, metabolic networks and overall electron transfer rates. The results indicate that faster biocatalytic rates were observed under electropositive electrode surface potential conditions, and under fatty acid-fed conditions. Temporal 16S rRNA-based microbial community analyses showed that Geobacter phylotypes were highly diverse and apparently dependent on surface potentials. The well-known electrogenic microbes affiliated with the Geobacter metallireducens clade were associated with lower surface potentials and less current generation, whereas Geobacter subsurface clades 1 and 2 were associated with higher surface potentials and greater current generation. An association was also observed between specific fermentative phylotypes and Geobacter phylotypes at specific surface potentials. When sugars were present, Tolumonas and Aeromonas phylotypes were preferentially associated with lower surface potentials, whereas Lactococcus phylotypes were found to be closely associated with Geobacter subsurface clades 1 and 2 phylotypes under higher surface potential conditions. Collectively, these results suggest that surface potentials provide a strong selective pressure, at the species and strain level, for both solid surface respirators and fermentative microbes throughout the EET-active community development.

AB QuestionQuantification of the effect of species traits on the assembly of communities is challenging from a statistical point of view. A key question is how species occurrence and abundance can be explained by the trait values of the species and the environmental values at the sites.
   MethodsUsing a sitesxspecies abundance table, a sitexenvironment data table and a speciesxtrait data table, we address the above question using a novel generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) approach. The GLMM overcomes problems of pseudo-replication and heteroscedastic variance by including sites and species as random factors. The method is equally applicable to presence-absence data as to count and multinomial data. We present a tiered forward selection approach for obtaining a parsimonious model and compare the results with alternative methods (the fourth corner method and RLQ ordination).
   ResultsWe illustrate the approach on a presence-absence version on two data sets. In the Dune Meadow data, species presence is parsimoniously explained by moisture and manure on the meadows in combination with seed mass and specific leaf area (SLA). In the Grazed Grassland data, species presence is parsimoniously explained by the grazing intensity and soil phosphorus in combination with the C:N ratio and flowering mode.
   ConclusionsOur GLMM approach can be used to identify which species traits and environmental variables best explain the species distribution, and which traits are significantly correlated with environmental variables. We argue that the method is better suited for providing an interpretable and predictive model than the fourth corner method and RLQ.

AB To better manage living marine resources (LMRs), it has become clear that ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) is a desired approach. To do EBFM, one of the key tools will be to use ecosystem models. To fully use ecosystem models and have their outputs adopted, there is an increasingly recognized need to address uncertainty associated with such modeling activities. Here we characterize uncertainty as applied to ecosystem models into six major factors, including: natural variability; observation error; inadequate communication among scientists, decision-makers and stakeholders; the structural complexity of the model(s) used; outcome uncertainty; and unclear management objectives. We then describe best practices to address each of these uncertainties as they particularly apply to ecosystem models being used in a LMR management context. We also present case studies to highlight examples of how these best practices have been implemented. Although we acknowledge that this work was compiled by ecosystem modelers in an LMR management context primarily for other ecosystem modelers, the principles and practices described herein are also germane for managers, stakeholders and other natural resource management communities. We conclude by emphasizing not only the need to address uncertainty in ecosystem models, but also the feasibility and benefits of doing so. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Determining the genetic structure of populations is becoming an increasingly important aspect of genetic studies. One of the most frequently used methods is the calculation of F-statistics using an Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA). However, this has the drawback that the population hierarchy has to be known a priori. Therefore, the population structure is often based on the results of a clustering analysis. Here I show how these two steps, clustering and calculation of F-statistics, can be combined in a single analysis. I do this by showing how the AMOVA framework is theoretically related to the widely used method of K-means clustering and can be used for the clustering of populations into groups. Simulations were used to show that the method performed very well both under random mating and under nonrandom mating. However, when the migration rates were high, the results were better under random mating than under predominant selfing or clonal reproduction. Two summary statistics were tested for estimating the number of clusters. Overall, pseudo-F showed the better performance, but BIC is better for detecting whether any significant structure is present. The results show that the AMOVA-based K-means clustering is useful for clustering population genetic data. Programs to perform the clustering can be downloaded from www.patrickmeirmans.com/software.

AB The world is changing at an unprecedented rate. In such a situation, we need to understand the nature of the change and to make predictions about the way in which it might affect systems of interest; often we may also wish to understand what might be done to mitigate the predicted effects. In ecology, we usually make such predictions (or forecasts) by making use of mathematical models that describe the system and projecting them into the future, under changed conditions. Approaches emphasizing the desirability of simple models with analytical tractability and those that use assumed causal relationships derived statistically from data currently dominate ecological modelling. Although such models are excellent at describing the way in which a system has behaved, they are poor at predicting its future state, especially in novel conditions. In order to address questions about the impact of environmental change, and to understand what, if any, action might be taken to ameliorate it, ecologists need to develop the ability to project models into novel, future conditions. This will require the development of models based on understanding the processes that result in a system behaving the way it does, rather than relying on a description of the system, as a whole, remaining valid indefinitely.

AB Groundwater flowing from hillslopes through riparian (near-stream) soils often undergoes chemical transformations that can substantially influence stream water chemistry. We used landscape analysis to predict total organic carbon (TOC) concentration profiles and groundwater levels measured in the riparian zone (RZ) of a 67 km(2) catchment in Sweden. TOC exported laterally from 13 riparian soil profiles was then estimated based on the riparian flow-concentration integration model (RIM). Much of the observed spatial variability of riparian TOC concentrations in this system could be predicted from groundwater levels and the topographic wetness index (TWI). Organic riparian peat soils in forested areas emerged as hotspots exporting large amounts of TOC. These TOC fluxes were subject to considerable temporal variations caused by a combination of variable flow conditions and changing soil water TOC concentrations. Mineral riparian gley soils, on the other hand, were related to rather small TOC export rates and were characterized by relatively time-invariant TOC concentration profiles. Organic and mineral soils in RZs constitute a heterogeneous landscape mosaic that potentially controls much of the spatial variability of stream water TOC. We developed an empirical regression model based on the TWI to move beyond the plot scale and to predict spatially variable riparian TOC concentration profiles for RZs underlain by glacial till.

AB Indigenous peoples now engage with many decentralized approaches to environmental management that offer opportunities for integration of Indigenous Ecological Knowledge (IEK) and western science to promote cultural diversity in the management of social-ecological system sustainability. Nevertheless, processes of combining IEK with western science are diverse and affected by numerous factors, including the adaptive co-management context, the intrinsic characteristics of the natural resources, and the governance systems. We present a typology of Indigenous engagement in environmental management, derived through comparative analysis of 21 Australian case studies, and consider its implications for the integration of IEK with western science. Sociological and rational choice institutionalism underpin our analytical framework, which differentiates on three axes: (1) power sharing, incorporating decision making, rules definition, resource values and property rights; (2) participation, incorporating participatory processes, organizations engaged, and coordination approaches; (3) intercultural purpose, incorporating purposes of environmental management, Indigenous engagement, Indigenous development and capacity building. Our typology groups engagement into four types: Indigenous governed collaborations; Indigenous-driven co-governance; agency-driven co-governance; and agency governance. From our analysis of manifestations of knowledge integration across the types, we argue that Indigenous governance and Indigenous-driven co-governance provides better prospects for integration of IEK and western science for sustainability of social-ecological systems. Supporting Indigenous governance without, or with only a limited requirement for power sharing with other agencies sustains the distinct Indigenous cultural purposes underpinning IEK, and benefits knowledge integration. We conclude by advocating that the typology be applied to test its general effectiveness in guiding practitioners and researchers to develop robust governance for Indigenous knowledge integration in environmental management.

AB The connectivity of protected area networks depends on key elements located in strategic positions within the landscape, which uphold the ecological fluxes and sustain the diversity and longterm viability of native biota. Landscape planning requires objective and quantitative approaches to identify those key elements and reinforce the spatial coherence of protected area designs and related conservation schemes. With this objective, we apply for the first time recent methodological developments that, deriving from the probability of connectivity index, allow evaluating the role of both individual protected areas and links in the intermediate landscape matrix as providers of connectivity between the rest of the sites in the network. We focus on a case study covering the forest protected areas from the Cantabrian Range to the Western Alps (N Spain, S France and NW Italy), considering different dispersal distances and the impact of highways. We show how the proposed approach is useful to identify those protected areas and links that most contribute to uphold functional connectivity in this transnational network, as well as those road sectors where the defragmentation and barrier effect mitigation measures should be prioritized. We compare our results with other more qualitative and expert-based approaches that have been reported in the same area. The methodological approach could be easily adopted in a variety of other related landscape planning applications at different scales, with the required quantitative tools being available as free and open source software packages.

AB In contrast to their rarity, the commonness of species has historically received surprisingly little explicit attention from ecologists. However, this situation is changing. Here I review the current understanding of the nature of commonness, with particular emphasis on the dynamics and causes of this state, as well as on its ecological and evolutionary implications. Depending on the focal issue, common species can variously have lower, greater, or similar per capita influences compared with rare ones. Importantly, however, these influences almost invariably remain strong because of the high numbers of individuals and local occurrences in taxonomic assemblages contributed by the relatively few species that are common. The importance of these species highlights the significance of deepening concerns over the declines of many common species and the vital need for a balanced approach to maintaining their commonness while also addressing the more familiar conservation issue of preventing the loss of rare species.

AB P>Density-dependent seedling mortality could increase with a species relative abundance, thereby promoting species coexistence. Differences among species in light-dependent mortality also could enhance coexistence via resource partitioning. These compatible ideas rarely have been considered simultaneously. We developed models of mortality as functions of irradiance and local conspecific density (LCD) for seedlings of 53 tropical woody species. Species varied in mortality responses to these factors, but mortality consistently increased with shading and LCD. Across species, density-dependent mortality on a per-neighbour basis was inversely related to species community abundance, but higher LCD in more common species resulted in a weak relationship between species abundance and density-dependent mortality scaled to species maximum LCD. Species mortality responses to shading and maximum LCD were strongly and positively correlated. Our results suggest that species differences in density-dependent mortality are more strongly related to physiologically based life-history traits than biotic feedbacks related to community abundance.

AB Climate change is affecting biodiversity worldwide inducing species to either "move, adapt or die". In this paper we propose a conceptual framework for analysing range shifts, namely a catalogue of the possible patterns of change in the distribution of a species along elevational or other environmental gradients and an improved quantitative methodology to identify and objectively describe these patterns. Patterns are defined in terms of changes occurring at the leading, trailing or both edges of the distribution: (a) leading edge expansion, (b) trailing edge retraction, (c) range expansion, (d) optimum shift, (e) expansion, (f) retraction, and (g) shift. The methodology is based on the modelling of species distributions along a gradient using generalized additive models (GAMs). Separate models are calibrated for two distinct periods of assessment and response curves are compared over five reference points. Changes occurred at these points are formalized into a code that ultimately designates the corresponding change pattern. We tested the proposed methodology using data from the Swiss national common breeding bird survey. The elevational distributions of 95 bird species were modelled for the periods 1999-2002 and 2004-2007 and significant upward shifts (all patterns confounded) were identified for 35% of the species. Over the same period, an increase in mean temperature was registered for Switzerland. In consideration of the short period covered by the case study, assessed change patterns are considered to correspond to intermediate patterns in an ongoing shifting process. However, similar patterns can be determined by habitat barriers, land use/land cover changes, competition with concurrent or invasive species or different warming rates at different elevations.

AB Issues of residual spatial autocorrelation (RSA) and spatial scale are critical to the study of species-environment relationships, because RSA invalidates many statistical procedures, while the scale of analysis affects the quantification of these relationships. Although these issues independently are widely covered in the literature, only sparse attention is given to their integration. This paper focuses on the interplay between RSA and the spatial scaling of species-environment relationships. Using a hypothetical species in an artificial landscape, we show that a mismatch between the scale of analysis and the scale of a species' response to its environment leads to a decrease in the portion of variation explained by environmental predictors. Moreover, it results in RSA and biased regression coefficients. This bias stems from error-predictor dependencies due to the scale mismatch, the magnitude of which depends on the interaction between the scale of landscape heterogeneity and the scale of a species' response to this heterogeneity. We show that explicitly considering scale effects on RSA can reveal the characteristic scale of a species' response to its environment. This is important, because the estimation of species-environment relationships using spatial regression methods proves to be erroneous in case of a scale mismatch, leading to spurious conclusions when scaling issues are not explicitly considered. The findings presented here highlight the importance of examining the appropriateness of the spatial scales used in analyses, since scale mismatches affect the rigor of statistical analyses and thereby the ability to understand the processes underlying spatial patterning in ecological phenomena.

AB A number of studies have investigated regional and continental scale patterns of carbon (C) stocks in forest ecosystems; however, the altitudinal changes in C storage in different components (vegetation, detritus, and soil) of forest ecosystems remain poorly understood. In this study, we measured C stocks of vegetation, detritus, and soil of 22 forest plots along an altitudinal gradient of 700-2,000 m to quantify altitudinal changes in carbon storage of major forest ecosystems (Pinus koraiensis and broadleaf mixed forest, 700-1,100 m; Picea and Abies forest, 1,100-1,800 m; and Betula ermanii forest, 1,800-2,000 m) on Mt Changbai, Northeast China. Total ecosystem C density (carbon stock per hectare) averaged 237 t C ha(-1) (ranging from 112 to 338 t C ha(-1)) across all the forest stands, of which 153 t C ha(-1) (52-245 t C ha(-1)) was stored in vegetation biomass, 14 t C ha(-1) (2.2-48 t C ha(-1)) in forest detritus (including standing dead trees, fallen trees, and floor material), and 70 t C ha(-1) (35-113 t C ha(-1)) in soil organic matter (1-m depth). Among all the forest types, the lowest vegetation and total C density but the highest soil organic carbon (SOC) density occurred in Betula ermanii forest, whereas the highest detritus C density was observed in Picea and Abies forest. The C density of the three ecosystem components showed distinct altitudinal patterns: with increasing altitude, vegetation C density decreased significantly, detritus C density first increased and then decreased, and SOC density exhibited increasing but insignificant trends. The allocation of total ecosystem C to each component exhibited similar but more significant trends along the altitudinal gradient. Our results suggest that carbon storage and partitioning among different components in temperate forests on Mt Changbai vary greatly with forest type and altitude.

AB Research on behavioural syndromes (consistent individual differences in suites of correlated behaviours) requires formal statistical methods to describe and compare syndrome structures. We detail the shortcomings of current methods aimed at describing variation in behavioural syndromes, such as multiple pairwise correlations and principal components analysis (PCA). In their place we propose an alternative statistical framework involving: (1) calculation of trait variance-covariance and correlation matrices within each data set; (2) statistical evaluation of specific hypotheses regarding how behaviours covary within a behavioural syndrome; and (3) statistical comparison of behavioural covariances across data sets using structural equation modelling (SEM). Given their unfamiliarity to most behavioural ecologists, we illustrate these methods using an already published data set for two groups of populations of three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, living in ponds with and without fish predators. Previous analyses suggested a lack of behavioural syndrome structure for stickleback that lived in the absence of fish predators. However, by evaluating a priori hypotheses of how behaviours might covary using SEM, we were able to demonstrate that the two types of populations differed specifically in covariance patterns for aggression, exploration of novel food sources and altered environments, but not for exploration of novel environments and activity. Such detailed inferences cannot readily be made based on conventional statistical approaches alone, and so the methods we outline here should become standard in studies concerning the evolution of behavioural syndromes within and between populations.

AB There has been a rapidly developing literature on the effects of some of the major drivers of global change on carbon (C) sequestration, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment, land use change, nitrogen (N) deposition and climate change. However, remarkably little attention has been given to one major global change driver, namely biological invasions. This is despite growing evidence that invasive species can dramatically alter a range of aboveground and belowground ecosystem processes, including those that affect C sequestration. In this review, we assess the evidence for the impacts of biological invaders on forest C stocks and C sequestration by biological invaders. We first present case studies that highlight a range of invader impacts on C sequestration in forest ecosystems, and draw on examples that involve invasive primary producers, decomposers, herbivores, plant pathogens, mutualists and predators. We then develop a conceptual framework for assessing the effects of invasive species on C sequestration impacts more generally, by identifying the features of biological invaders and invaded ecosystems that are thought to most strongly regulate C in forests. Finally we assess the implications of managing invasive species on C sequestration. An important principle that emerges from this review is that the direct effects of invaders on forest C are often smaller and shorter-term than their indirect effects caused by altered nutrient availability, primary productivity or species composition, all of which regulate long-term C pools and fluxes. This review provides a conceptual basis for improving our general understanding of biological invaders on ecosystem C, but also points to a paucity of primary data that are needed to determine the quantitative effects of invaders on ecosystem processes that drive C sequestration.

AB The relationship between solar radiation capture and potential plant growth is of theoretical and practical importance. The key processes constraining the transduction of solar radiation into phyto-energy (i.e. free energy in phytomass) were reviewed to estimate potential solar-energy-use efficiency. Specifically, the output : input stoichiometries of photosynthesis and photorespiration in C-3 and C-4 systems, mobilization and translocation of photosynthate, and biosynthesis of major plant biochemical constituents were evaluated. The maintenance requirement, an area of important uncertainty, was also considered. For a hypothetical C-3 grain crop with a full canopy at 30 degrees C and 350 ppm atmospheric [CO2], theoretically potential efficiencies (based on extant plant metabolic reactions and pathways) were estimated at c. 0.041 J J(-1) incident total solar radiation, and c. 0.092 J J(-1) absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). At 20 degrees C, the calculated potential efficiencies increased to 0.053 and 0.118 J J(-1) (incident total radiation and absorbed PAR, respectively). Estimates for a hypothetical C-4 cereal were c. 0.051 and c. 0.114 J J(-1), respectively. These values, which cannot be considered as precise, are less than some previous estimates, and the reasons for the differences are considered. Field-based data indicate that exceptional crops may attain a significant fraction of potential efficiency.

AB Sperm swimming speed is an important determinant of male fertility and sperm competitiveness. Despite its fundamental biological importance, the underlying evolutionary processes affecting this male reproductive trait are poorly understood. Using a comparative approach in a phylogenetic framework, we tested the predictions that sperm swim faster with (1) increased risk of sperm competition, (2) shorter duration of female sperm storage, and (3) increased sperm length. We recorded sperm swimming speed in 42 North American and European free-living passerine bird species, representing 35 genera and 16 families. We found that sperm swimming speed was positively related to the frequency of extrapair paternity (a proxy for the risk of sperm competition) and negatively associated with clutch size (a proxy for the duration of female sperm storage). Sperm swimming speed was unrelated to sperm length, although sperm length also increased with the frequency of extrapair paternity. These results suggest that sperm swimming speed and sperm length are not closely associated traits and evolve independently in response to sperm competition in passerine birds. Our findings emphasize the significance of both sperm competition and female sperm storage duration as evolutionary forces driving sperm swimming speed.

AB Invasive species, biological control and climate change are driving demand for tools to estimate species' potential ranges in new environments. Flawed results from some tools are being used to inform policy and management in these fields. Independent validation of models is urgently needed so we compare the performance of the ubiquitous, logistic regression and the CLIMEX model in predicting recent range extensions of the livestock tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, in Africa. Both models have been applied to the tick so new, independent data can be used to test their ability to model non-equilibrium distributions. Logistical regression described the spatial data well but failed to predict the range extensions. CLIMEX correctly predicted the extensions without fitting the non-equilibrium data accurately. Our results question the validity of using descriptive, statistical models to predict changes in species ranges with translocation and climate change. More test cases that include independent validation are needed.

AB The African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae is undergoing speciation, being split into the M and S molecular forms. Speciation is the main process promoting biological diversity, thus, new vector species might complicate disease transmission. Genetic differentiation between the molecular forms has been extensively studied, but phenotypic differences between them, the evolutionary forces that generated divergence, and the mechanisms that maintain their genetic isolation have only recently been addressed. Here, we review recent studies suggesting that selection mediated by larval predation and competition promoted divergence between temporary and permanent freshwater habitats. These differences explain the sharp discontinuity in distribution of the molecular forms between rice fields and surrounding savanna, but they can also explain the concurrent cline between humid and and environments due to the dependence on permanent habitats in the latter. Although less pronounced, differences in adult body size, reproductive output, and longevity also suggest that the molecular forms have adapted to distinct niches. Reproductive isolation between the molecular forms is achieved by spatial swarm segregation, although within-swarm mate recognition appears to play a role in certain locations. The implications of these results to disease transmission and control are discussed and many of the gaps in our understanding are highlighted. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Spermatozoa are among the most diversified cells in the animal kingdom, but the underlying evolutionary forces affecting intraspecific variation in sperm morphology are poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that sperm competition is a potent selection pressure on sperm variation within species. Here, we examine intraspecific variation in total sperm length of 22 wild passerine bird species (21 genera, 11 families) in relation to the risk of sperm competition, as expressed by the frequency of extrapair paternity and relative testis size. We demonstrate, by using phylogenetic comparative methods, that between-male variation in sperm length within species is closely and negatively linked to the risk of sperm competition. This relationship was even stronger when only considering species in which data on sperm length and extrapair paternity originated from the same populations. Intramale variation in sperm length within species was also negatively, although nonsignificantly, related to sperm competition risk. Our findings suggest that postcopulatory sexual selection is a powerful evolutionary force reducing the intraspecific phenotypic variation in sperm-size traits, potentially driving the diversification of sperm morphology across populations and species.

AB In comparison with most animal behaviours, circadian rhythms have a well-characterized molecular genetic basis. Detailed studies of circadian clock genes in 'model' organisms provide a foundation for interpreting the functional and evolutionary significance of polymorphic circadian clock genes found within free-living animal populations. Here, we describe allelic variation in a region of the avian Clock orthologue which encodes a functionally significant polyglutamine repeat (ClkpolyQcds), within free-living populations of two passerine birds, the migratory bluethroat (Luscinia svecica) and the predominantly nonmigratory blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus). Multiple ClkpolyQcds alleles were found within populations of both species (bluethroat: 12 populations, 7 alleles; blue tit: 14 populations, 9 alleles). Some populations of both species were differentiated at the ClkpolyQcds locus as measured by F-ST and R-ST values. Among the blue tit, but not bluethroat populations, we found evidence of latitudinal clines in (i) mean ClkpolyQcds repeat length, and (ii) the proportions of three ClkpolyQcds genotype groupings. Parallel analyses of microsatellite allele frequencies, which are considered to reflect selectively neutral processes, indicate that interpopulation allele frequency variation at the ClkpolyQcds and microsatellite loci does not reflect the same underlying demographic processes. The possibility that the observed interpopulation ClkpolyQcds allele frequency variation is, at least in part, maintained by selection for microevolutionary adaptation to photoperiodic parameters correlated with latitude warrants further study.

AB Studies on Neotropical phylogeography have largely focused on lowland organisms. Because lowland and highland biotas have different histories and are likely affected by different processes influencing population differentiation, understanding Neotropical diversification requires detailed studies on montane taxa. We present the most comprehensive analysis of population differentiation conducted so far on a widespread group of Neotropical montane organisms, focusing on the evolutionary relationships and phylogeography of Buarremon brush-finches (Aves: Emberizidae) in montane areas from Mexico through Argentina. Sequences of mitochondrial and nuclear genes demonstrate that Buarremon is not monophyletic with respect to Arremon and Lysurus. Genetic structure revealed by mtDNA is strong in both B. brunneinucha and B. torquatus. Gene genealogies and nucleotide diversity indicate that B. brunneinucha originated in Mexico and later expanded to South America, where it followed one colonization route through the east, and one through the west of the continent. Differentiation among populations of B. torquatus was substantial, reaching 8% uncorrected sequence divergence within South America. Relationships among major lineages of B. torquatus were not fully resolved owing to rapid differentiation, but the occurrence of closely related taxa in distant locations suggests a complex history of diversification. Some Colombian populations of B. brunneinucha have affinities with populations from Venezuela and the East Andean slope of Ecuador and Peru, and others with those from the Pacific slope of Ecuador. Moreover, five divergent lineages of B. torquatus occur within Colombia, highlighting the importance of dense sampling in northwest South America for studies on diversification of widespread Neotropical lineages.

Furthermore, the model accounts for stage-specific differences in resource use and mortality between juvenile and adult consumers. Without such differences, the model reduces to the Yodzis and Innes ( 1992) bioenergetics model, for which we show that model equilibria are characterized by a symmetry property that reproduction and maturation are equally limited by food density. As a consequence, biomass production rate exactly equals loss rate through maintenance and mortality in each consumer stage. Stage-specific differences break up this symmetry and turn specific stages into net producers and others into net losers of biomass. As a consequence, the population in equilibrium can be regulated in two distinct ways: either through total population reproduction or through total population maturation as limiting process. In the case of reproduction regulation, increases in mortality may lead to an increase of juvenile biomass. In the case of maturation regulation, increases in mortality may increase adult biomass. This overcompensation in biomass occurs with increases in both stage-independent and stage-specific mortality, even when the latter targets the stage exhibiting overcompensation.

AB The black throat patch or bib of male house Sparrows, Passer domesticus, is often referred to as a "badge of status" or a "badge" because previous studies have shown bib size to be correlated with the social status of males. Yet, little is known about how strong and robust this relationship is and how the strength of this relationship compares with that of other associations. We conducted a meta-analysis for 6 well-studied correlates of bib size: fighting ability, parental ability (egg incubation and food provisioning), age, body condition, cuckoldry, and reproductive Success. We introduce a flexible meta-analysis method in this study that is better suited in the biological sciences than the methods usually employed in popular meta-analysis software because our method accounts for a common form of nonindependence of the data. The relationship between fighting ability and bib size was found to be strong and robust, and the relationship between age and bib size was moderate and robust. Also, body condition was weakly but significantly correlated with badge size. The other parameters showed nonsignificant small effects and/or large confidence intervals. Therefore, we conclude that bib size signals dominance and to a lesser extent age and possibly reflects body condition in house sparrows. There was weak evidence that bib size is currently tinder sexual selection because there was little association between reproductive success and bib size. This is surprising as the bib size probably affects the outcome of male-male competition. Empirical data on sparrow bib size Could not be reconciled with sexual selection theory, although there is ample evidence that it is a condition-dependent trait.

AB Isolated granitic rock outcrops or 'inselbergs' may provide a window into the molecular ecology and genetics of continental radiations under simplified conditions, in analogy to the use of oceanic islands in studies of species radiations. Patterns of variability and gene flow in inselberg species have never been thoroughly evaluated in comparison to related taxa with more continuous distribution ranges, or to other species in the same kingdom in general. We use nuclear microsatellites to study population differentiation and gene flow in two diploid, perennial plants adapted to high-altitude neotropical inselbergs, Alcantarea imperialis and Alcantarea geniculata (Bromeliaceae). Population differentiation is pronounced in both taxa, especially in A. imperialis. Gene flow in this species is considerably lower than expected from the literature on plants in general and Bromeliaceae in particular, and too low to prevent differentiation due to drift (N(e)m < 1), unless selection coefficients/effect sizes of favourable alleles are great enough to maintain species cohesion. Low gene flow in A. imperialis indicates that the ability of pollinating bats to promote gene exchange between inselbergs is smaller than previously assumed. Population subdivision in one inselberg population of A. imperialis appears to be associated with the presence of two colour morphs that differ in the coloration of rosettes and bracts. Our results indicate a high potential for inselbergs as venues for studies of the molecular ecology and genetics of continental radiations, such as the one that gave rise to the extraordinary diversity of adaptive strategies and phenotypes seen in Bromeliaceae.

AB The worldwide colony-forming haptophyte phytoplankton Phaeocystis spp. are key organisms in trophic and biogeochemical processes in the ocean. Many organisms from protists to fish ingest cells and/or colonies of Phaeocystis. Reports on specific mortality of Phaeocystis in natural plankton or mixed prey due to grazing by zooplankton, especially protozooplankton, are still limited. Reported feeding rates vary widely for both crustaceans and protists feeding on even the same Phaeocystis types and sizes. Quantitative analysis of available data showed that: (1) laboratory-derived crustacean grazing rates on monocultures of Phaeocystis may have been overestimated compared to feeding in natural plankton communities, and should be treated with caution; (2) formation of colonies by P. globosa appeared to reduce predation by small copepods (e.g., Acartia, Pseudocalanus, Temora and Centropages), whereas large copepods (e.g., Calanus spp.) were able to feed on colonies of Phaeocystis pouchetii; (3) physiological differences between different growth states, species, strains, cell types, and laboratory culture versus natural assemblages may explain most of the variations in reported feeding rates; (4) chemical signaling between predator and prey may be a major factor controlling grazing on Phaeocystis; (5) it is unclear to what extent different zooplankton, especially protozooplankton, feed on the different life forms of Phaeocystis in situ. To better understand the mechanisms controlling zooplankton grazing in situ, future studies should aim at quantifying specific feeding rates on different Phaeocystis species, strains, cell types, prey sizes and growth states, and account for chemical signaling between the predator and prey. Recently developed molecular tools are promising approaches to achieve this goal in the future.

AB The Western Lyresnake (Trimorphodon biscutatus) is a widespread, polytypic taxon inhabiting arid regions from the warm deserts of the southwestern United States southward along the Pacific versant of Mexico to the tropical deciduous forests of Mesoamerica. This broadly distributed species provides a unique opportunity to evaluate a priori biogeographical hypotheses spanning two major distinct biogeographical realms (the Nearctic and Neotropical) that are usually treated separately in phylogeographical analyses. I investigated the phylogeography of T. biscutatus using maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from across this species' range. Phylogenetic analyses recovered five well-supported clades whose boundaries are concordant with existing geographical barriers, a pattern consistent with a model of vicariant allopatric divergence. Assuming a vicariance model, divergence times between mitochondrial lineages were estimated using Bayesian relaxed molecular clock methods calibrated using geological information from putative vicariant events. Divergence time point estimates were bounded by broad confidence intervals, and thus these highly conservative estimates should be considered tentative hypotheses at best. Comparison of mtDNA lineages and taxa traditionally recognized as subspecies based on morphology suggest this taxon is comprised of multiple independent lineages at various stages of divergence, ranging from putative secondary contact and hybridization to sympatry of 'subspecies'.

AB Species lists for regions of Europe defined by Illies (1978, Limnofauna Europaea, 2nd edn. Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart), and augmented by information from Maitland (2000, Guide to Freshwater Fish of Britain and Europe. Hamlyn, London), are used to describe patterns in freshwater fish species richness and to examine the contribution of habitat preference, migration, body size and glacial history to these patterns.
   The number of non-endemic species declines to the north and west, with increasing distance from the Ponto-Caspian region, the main source area, whereas endemic species richness declines only with latitude.
   Habitat generalists tend to be migratory while riverine specialists are usually resident. Similar numbers of riverine species and generalists occur in Europe as a whole but generalists dominate in regional faunas and, to an increasing extent, in more isolated, formerly glaciated areas. Very few lacustrine specialists were found, reflecting the geologically ephemeral nature of lakes. Only 8% of riverine species have colonized glaciated areas, compared with more than half the generalist species, and the number declines rapidly with increasing distance from the source area.
   Diadromous species show no geographical variation in species richness but potamodromous and resident species are affected by glaciation and by mountain and marine barriers.
   The mean body size of regional faunas increases with latitude because there are relatively fewer small species in more distant, glaciated areas.
   About half the species occurring in Europe are restricted to one region and the majority of these endemics occur in barrier regions with Mediterranean climates. Species in glaciated regions have much larger range sizes. Habitat preference and migration type, not body size, are the main determinants of range size.
   Freshwater habitat availability varies across Europe with glaciated areas having more lakes of a given size than unglaciated areas. Catchment size is greatest at mid-latitudes. For a given catchment size rivers in glaciated areas are shorter.
   The results support the notion that habitat variability, on both short and long time scales, favours colonization ability, which requires large body size.
   As a result of their limited vagility northern fish faunas are depauperate, show high levels of plasticity and polymorphism and may show elevated speciation rates. The isolated southern faunas of the Iberian and Italian peninsulas and the Balkans are rich in endemic species but may be subject to extinctions because of the spread of the highly seasonal Mediterranean climate.

AB Nest survival is one of the most important parameters in the population dynamics of grassland-nesting ducks (Anas and Aythya spp.) that breed in the Prairie Pothole Region of North America. Grassland habitats used by these species are increasingly threatened by habitat loss and the coincident fragmentation, which may indirectly alter net survival through effects on predators. Although predators are the dominant cause of net loss, they are difficult to monitor directly. Thus, indirect analyses of habitat variables are required. Many studies have attempted to address the relationship between fragmentation and nest survival; however, few studies have examined the influence of fragmentation at multiple spatial scales. Understanding how landscape characteristics at multiple spatial scales explain variation in nest Survival is important, because no single correct scales likely to exist for a diversity of landscape metrics. We examined the relationships between habitat variables and duck nest survival (n approximate to 4200 nests) on 18 10.4-km(2) sites selected across a gradient of landscape characteristics. in the Missouri Coteau Region of North Dakota. We evaluated both a priori and exploratory competing models of nest survival that considered habitat features measured at nest sites, within nesting patches, and at multiple landscape scales. We used generalized nonlinear mixed-modeling techniques to model net survival rates. Information-theoretic techniques were used to select among competing models. Models that included covariates measured at multiple landscape scales were better than simpler models that included only covariates measured at a single spatial scale. Landscape covariates measured at 10.4 and 41.4 km(2) resulted in the best explanation of nest survival. Nest survival was positively related to the amount of grassland habitat, negatively related to the wetland density, and related to the amount of grassland edge in a quadratic manner, with the lowest nest survival at intermediate values of grassland edge. Future research should attempt to determine the causes of these relationships, something we were unable to do with our correlative approach. Conservation efforts focused on maintaining duck populations should seek to maintain landscapes with abundant grassland and to account for the influence of configuration using GIS analyses.

AB With current concerns over issues such as global warming, the use of palaeoecological data to reconstruct past environments has gained a special significance, but much of the work on ostracod ecology and paleoecology has been qualitative in nature, or on a site-specific rather than integrated, regional basis. Furthermore, ostracod ecological relationships are complex, with each species occupying a multidimensional niche, and a range of statistical techniques can be employed to establish the significance of different environmental variables on species distribution.
   We employ logistic regression (LR) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to define ostracod species niches and assemblage response to environmental gradients, using a modem dataset of 465 ostracod samples from the eastern Iberian Peninsula. In addition to these ecological analyses, we develop ostracod-based transfer functions for the quantitative reconstruction of past environmental change from a modem regional data-set of non-marine ostracod and limnological data, by means of weighted averaging (WA) regression and calibration. Examples cited are primarily from modem and fossil ostracod samples from Iberian water bodies.
   Our results suggest that water chemistry (solute composition and concentration) and temperature are the factors to which non-marine ostracod species respond in a more clear and consistent way. Species-environment relationships modelled using the transfer-function approach of WA are strong for the above-mentioned variables, and therefore these models may be of great help in palaeoenvironmental reconstructions.

AB Female-limited polychromatism is frequent in many species of Odonata. Ischnura elegans has three colour morphs: one male-like coloured (androchrome) and two additional gynochrome brown morphs (infuscans and rufescens-obsoleta morphs). A total of 19 progenies obtained from once-mated females were reared in the laboratory in three generations. Results indicate that the colour morphs are controlled by the same genetic system as previously described for I. graellsii, i.e. an autosomal locus with female-limited expression and with three alleles with a hierarchy of dominance (p(a) > p(i) > p(o)). Five interspecific crossings between female L graellsii and male I. elegans, five crossings between hybrid females and male L elegans and one crossing between female L graellsii and a hybrid male further confirmed that the genetic system is the same in both species. A survey of morph frequencies in north-west Spain revealed that L elegans shows high variability in androchrome frequency (4-91%) between nearby populations, whereas in I. graellsii androchromes never are the majority morph (5-40%). The highest androchrome frequency in I. graellsii was found in populations closest to a locality where both species have hybridized, and that now has the highest androchrome frequency of I. elegans. We hypothesize that I. elegans genes have been incorporated into the genome of I. graellsii resulting in increased androchrome frequency in the latter species. Low androchrome frequency in I. elegans seems also related to the influence of I. graellsii genes. Therefore, we suggest that hybridization between both taxa is contributing to the temporal maintenance of contrasting androchrome frequencies in nearby populations.

AB Biological diversity would apparently seem the most intuitive and easily studied of all the ecological concepts. However, in practice biodiversity has suffered from great number of definitions that vary with the specific needs of the different researchers, thus making it extremely confusing as an ecological concept. In this paper, I shortly review the concept of biodiversity showing that there exists a substantial ambiguity among ecologists as far as biodiversity conceptualization and evaluation is concerned. I conclude that, due to this major disagreement on its very nature, biodiversity may be defined simply as a set of multivariate summary statistics for quantifying different characteristics of community structure.

AB Current epidemiologic models concerning the fetal origins of later health risk are evaluated from the perspectives of evolutionary and developmental biology. Claims of adaptive value for and biological status of fetal programming are critically examined. Life history theory is applied to identify key trade-offs in adaptive strategies that constrain developmental design to use information from the environment to guide ontogeny and establish cost-benefit trade-offs that weigh early survival advantage against remote or unlikely future costs. Expectable environments of evolutionary adaptedness, particularly of gestation, are characterized and their impact on human adaptive design discussed. The roles of neuroendocrine mechanisms in scaffolding life course development, negotiating ongoing cost-benefit trade-offs, and mediating their long-term impacts on function and health are reviewed in detail. Overviews of gestational biology and the postnatal physiologic, cognitive-affective, and behavioral effects of gestational stress identify a shared central role for the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Rather than merely mediating stress responses, the axis emerges an agent of resource allocation that draws a common thread among conditions of gestation, postnatal environments, and functional and health-related outcomes. The preponderance of evolutionary and developmental analysis identifies environments as agents on both sides of the health risk equation, by influencing vulnerabilities and capacities established in early and later life course development, and determining exposures and demands encountered over the life course.

AB Prior studies have shown that macrogeographic gradients in temperature associated with latitude and altitude can lead to countergradient patterns of variation in a number of taxa: individuals from colder environments are known to grow or develop faster than their conspecifics from warmer environments when placed in a common setting. In this study, I hypothesized that countergradient variation also is important at microgeographic scales. The wood frog, Rana sylvatica, breeds in open-canopied, temporary wetlands as well as those heavily shaded by vegetation. Shading leads to cooler thermal environments that are associated with embryonic development rates as much as 50% slower than those in unshaded wetlands. Wetlands with contrasting canopy environments are often found within tens or hundreds of meters of each other. In a common garden experiment, embryos from nearby natural wetlands displayed countergradient variation: individuals collected from shaded wetlands developed up to 12% faster than those collected from relatively unshaded wetlands. The results of this study suggest that the concept of countergradient variation may be extended to small scales of space. In addition, the rate and scale of vegetation dynamics (the agent of wetland shading) imply that divergence in development among residents of nearby wetlands may be relatively rapid, on the order of decades.

AB Many previous studies have assumed that a linear relationship between local and regional species richness indicates that communities are limited by regional processes, while a saturating relationship suggests that species interactions restrict local richness. We show theoretically that the relationship between local and regional richness changes in a consistent fashion with assembly time in interacting communities. Communities show saturation in their early assembly stages because only a subset of the regional pool may colonize a locality. At intermediate assembly times, communities will appear unsaturated until significant competitive exclusion occurs. Finally, when communities reach equilibrium, we found saturation as a result of resource competition resulting in the dominance of a limited number of species. We show that habitat size and species fecundity are important in determining the time needed for the community to reach equilibrium and thus affect the relationship between local and regional species richness. Our results suggest the number of coexisting species is a function of local and regional processes whose relative influences might vary over time and that research using the relationship between local and regional species richness to infer mechanisms limiting species richness must have knowledge of the assembly time of the community.

AB The short-term (4-year period) effects of different management regimes on the response of calcareous grassland vegetation to increased nitrogen were investigated. Four levels of nitrogen and two levels. of management were applied in a factorial design. Besides, the effects of management practices alone on species diversity were also studied. Species diversity was investigated at different levels of sub-sampling using a nested plot design. In this way, both species saturation and accumulation curves could be established. The effect of community structure, as reflected by the light regimes at various heights in the vegetation, on species diversity was also investigated. Species diversity at all levels of sub-sampling decreased significantly with management regimes and nitrogen supply rates. Percent light penetration differed significantly among management regimes and nitrogen supply rates. Grazing proved to be most efficient in countering the negative effects of nitrogen supply, but could not prevent competitors from becoming dominant. In the absence of any form of disturbance, species diversity decreased relatively rapidly. Decreased light availability, the loss of gap formation, a decrease in small-scale environmental heterogeneity and proliferation of strong competitors, all may have contributed to the observed decrease in species richness. The results of this study highlight the importance of management in maintaining high species diversity in the studied calcareous grassland. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To understand the role of leaf-level plasticity and variability in species invasiveness, foliar characteristics were studied in relation to seasonal average integrated quantum flux density (Q(int)) in the understorey evergreen species Rhododendron ponticum and Ilex aquifolium at two sites. A native relict population of R. ponticum was sampled in southern Spain (Mediterranean climate), while an invasive alien population was investigated in Belgium (temperate maritime climate). Ilex aquifolium was native at both sites. Both species exhibited a significant plastic response to Q(int) in leaf dry mass per unit area, thickness, photosynthetic potentials, and chlorophyll contents at the two sites. However, R. ponticum exhibited a higher photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency and larger investment of nitrogen in chlorophyll than I. aquifolium . Since leaf nitrogen (N) contents per unit dry mass were lower in R. ponticum , this species formed a larger foliar area with equal photosynthetic potential and light-harvesting efficiency compared with I. aquifolium . The foliage of R. ponticum was mechanically more resistant with larger density in the Belgian site than in the Spanish site. Mean leaf-level phenotypic plasticity was larger in the Belgian population of R. ponticum than in the Spanish population of this species and the two populations of I. aquifolium. We suggest that large fractional investments of foliar N in photosynthetic function coupled with a relatively large mean, leaf-level phenotypic plasticity may provide the primary explanation for the invasive nature and superior performance of R. ponticum at the Belgian site. With alleviation of water limitations from Mediterranean to temperate maritime climates, the invasiveness of R. ponticum may also be enhanced by the increased foliage mechanical resistance observed in the alien populations.

AB Many insect species engage in high-altitude, wind-borne migration, often several hundred meters above the ground. At these heights they can use the wind to travel tens or hundreds of kilometers in a single flight, and hence a knowledge of their movements is essential to understanding their ecology and population dynamics. Direct observation of high-flying insect nu. grants is very difficult, especially at night, but the remote sensing capabilities of entomological radar provide a solution to this seemingly intractable problem. We describe a novel, nutating-beam, vertical-looking radar with autonomous data analysis software. This system routinely extracts data on size, shape, alignment, and displacement vectors from individual targets, allowing long-term monitoring of migrant insect populations. We discuss the capabilities and limitations of this system and describe some of its applications in the study of insect migration behaviour.

Among 404 species recorded in total, hemicryptophytes prevailed strongly (251 species, 62.1%), followed by therophytes with 90 species (22.3%). Chamaephytes comprised 22 species (5.4%) and geophytes 17 species (4.2%). Phanerophytes (14 species, 3.5%) and hydrophytes (7 species, 1.7%) were rare. The life-form spectrum reflects prevailing desert-steppe and steppe vegetation in the study area. A Monte Carlo test was used to obtain expected ranges in life-form diversity and abundance of individual life-forms along the altitudinal gradient. The number of actually present life-forms recorded from 50 m altitudinal steps was usually within the range expected from that null model, rarely lower than expected. The number of species belonging to chamaephytes, geophytes, hydrophytes and phanerophytes along the altitudinal gradient fall within the range predicted by the null model. Therophytes were under-represented in most altitudinal segments above 4900 m a.s.l. Nevertheless, many therophytes reach remarkably high altitudes in Ladakh as compared to other regions of Central Asia and the W Himalayas. Complementary to this pattern, hemicryptophytes were over-represented in most altitudinal steps from 4900 to 5600 m a.s.l. Relative abundance of geophytes and chamaephytes between 4150 and 5800 m a.s.l. was remarkably constant. Clonal plants comprised 26.7% of the total species number. About 30% of plant species were clonal from the lowest altitudes up to 5000 m a.s.l., from where the proportion of clonal plants gradually declined down to zero at the highest altitudes. Different factors are likely to be responsible for the relatively low proportion of clonal plants and their decline at higher altitudes. At the highest altitudes clonal plants with persisting inter-connections between widely spaced ramets are damaged by virtue of repeated freezing and thawing of the soil, breaking their integrated systems. In large screes at intermediate altitudes most types of clonal plants are injured by their mobility and at the lower altitudes tough soil texture prevents horizontal growth in the below-ground. Therefore, diversity of clonal plant types is small in prevailing habitats of the study area and most clonal plants are restricted to small patches of wetlands at intermediate and lower altitudes.

AB I examined the lingering effects of past timber management practices on the vegetation structure and bird community of Kibale National Park, Uganda. I compared four forest treatments: unlogged native forest (UL), two that were selectively logged Lit low (LL) and high (HL) intensities in the 1960s, and a conifer plantation (PL). Forest-dependent birds were best represented at UL. LL was similar to UL in both vegetation structure and bird community cornposition, although some forest-dependent bird species were missing from the former. HL had significantly less canopy closure and lower tree density than other plots as a result of the combination of extensive secondary damage and natural disturbance patterns that prevented the reclosure of the forest canopy. Thirty-one percent of the forest-dependent bird species observed during the study were not detected Lit HL. At PL, bird species richness and bird abundance were about a third of those observed in other plots. There were significant correlations between heterogeneity of tree distribution (horizontal heterogeneity) and abundance and species richness of birds across plots. Abundance and species richness of all, forest-dependent, and forest generalist birds were highest in plots with intermediate measures of horizontal heterogeneity, which were mostly unlogged or lightly logged. If reduced-impact logging practices are not implemented during selective logging operations in tropical forests, consequent long-term changes in vegetation structure may result ill significant declines in the populations of some forest-dependent species, as was observed in Kibale National Park.

AB Cohort effects originate from environmental conditions, and can have long-term consequences for the cohort's performance. It has been proposed that cohort effects tend to increase population fluctuations. However, differences among individuals, which cohort effects introduce into a population, usually have stabilizing effects. There are thus two different predictions regarding the impact of cohort effects on population fluctuations. We argue that it is important to distinguish between environmental variability and its long-term effects on individual quality, and approach the question with a population model that can include or exclude such effects. We show that the influence of cohort effects depends on the inherent dynamics: cohort effects can have stabilizing effects if dynamics are inherently unstable. However, the most common outcome is destabilization whenever cohort effects act on top of inherently stable dynamics. Intriguingly, both alternatives are due to individual differences affecting the structure of density dependence in a similar way.

AB Studies of biodiversity and ecosystem function require to consider the identification level that accurately describes the functional diversity of communities, in terms of their biological traits, at different spatial scales. Therefore, we combined three published data sets of stream macroinvertebrate abundances collected at three spatial scales with a database of functional species traits (e.g. life history, morphology, physiology, and behaviour). We investigated the abundance of taxa and their traits at five levels of taxonomic (from species to class) and three levels of spatial resolution (from local habitat to catchment). We used multivariate analyses and correlations to evaluate the accuracy of community descriptions through the stability of such descriptions, the degree of similarity of site ordinations, and the overall community structure expressed at each taxonomic level. The accuracy of community descriptions based on the abundance of taxa depended on the spatial scale considered. The accurate description of the abundance of taxa required identifications to genera and/or families on the local habitat scale, while species identifications were needed on the catchment scale. In contrast, the accurate description of the abundance of biological traits was achieved by identifications to species, genera, or families on all three spatial scales. Thus, species identifications may not be necessary for future studies on the functional diversity of the stream benthos at different spatial scales.

AB Benthic-algal distributions in the Yakima River, Washington, basin were examined in relation to geology, land use, water chemistry, and stream habitat using indicator-species classification (TWINSPAN) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Algal assemblages identified by TWINSPAN were each associated with a narrow range of water-quality conditions. In the Cascade geologic province, where timber harvest and grazing are the dominant land uses, differences in community structure (CCA site scores) and concentrations of major ions (Ca and Mg) and nutrients (solute P, SiO2 and inorganic N) varied with dominant rock type of the basin. In agricultural areas of the Columbia Plateau province, differences in phytobenthos structure were based primarily on the degree of enrichment of dissolved solids, inorganic N, and solute P from irrigation-return flows and subsurface drainage. Habitat characteristics strongly correlated with community structure included reach altitude, turbidity, substratum embeddedness (Columbia Plateau), large woody-debris density (Cascade Range), and composition and density of the riparian vegetation. Algal biomass (AFDM) correlated with composition and density of the riparian vegetation but not with measured chemical-constituent concentrations. Nitrogen limitation in streams of the Cascade Range favored nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae and diatoms with endosymbiotic blue-greens, whereas nitrogen heterotrophs were abundant in agricultural areas of the Columbia Plateau.

AB Current conservation research focuses on diminishing species diversity, minimal viable populations, and on the successive demise of habitats and populations that leads species to extinction. In this paper we utilize the monarch butterfly's remarkable migration and overwintering biology as a paradigm of a new conservation theme: endangered phenomenon. An endangered phenomenon is a spectacular aspect of the life history of an animal or plant species involving a large number of individuals that is threatened with impoverishment or demise; the species per se need not be in peril, rather, the phenomenon it exhibits is at stake. We envision the near future with increasing numbers of species reduced in range and so constrained in numbers that they can no longer exhibit these characteristic spectacles.

AB Understanding the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has major implications. Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships are generally investigated at the interspecific level, although intraspecific diversity (i.e. within-species diversity) is increasingly perceived as an important ecological facet of biodiversity. Here, we provide a quantitative and integrative synthesis testing, across diverse plant and animal species, whether intraspecific diversity is a major driver of community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. We specifically tested (i) whether the number of genotypes/phenotypes (i.e. intraspecific richness) or the specific identity of genotypes/phenotypes (i.e. intraspecific variation) in populations modulate the structure of communities and the functioning of ecosystems, (ii) whether the ecological effects of intraspecific richness and variation are strong in magnitude, and (iii) whether these effects vary among taxonomic groups and ecological responses. We found a non-linear relationship between intraspecific richness and community and ecosystem dynamics that follows a saturating curve shape, as observed for biodiversity-function relationships measured at the interspecific level. Importantly, intraspecific richness modulated ecological dynamics with a magnitude that was equal to that previously reported for interspecific richness. Our results further confirm, based on a database containing more than 50 species, that intraspecific variation also has substantial effects on ecological dynamics. We demonstrated that the effects of intraspecific variation are twice as high as expected by chance, and that they might have been underestimated previously. Finally, we found that the ecological effects of intraspecific variation are not homogeneous and are actually stronger when intraspecific variation is manipulated in primary producers than in consumer species, and when they are measured at the ecosystem rather than at the community level. Overall, we demonstrated that the two facets of intraspecific diversity (richness and variation) can both strongly affect community and ecosystem dynamics, which reveals the pivotal role of within-species biodiversity for understanding ecological dynamics.

AB Aims Vegetation-plot records provide information on the presence and cover or abundance of plants co-occurring in the same community. Vegetation-plot data are spread across research groups, environmental agencies and biodiversity research centers and, thus, are rarely accessible at continental or global scales. Here we present the sPlot database, which collates vegetation plots worldwide to allow for the exploration of global patterns in taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity at the plant community level. Results sPlot version 2.1 contains records from 1,121,244 vegetation plots, which comprise 23,586,216 records of plant species and their relative cover or abundance in plots collected worldwide between 1885 and 2015. We complemented the information for each plot by retrieving climate and soil conditions and the biogeographic context (e.g., biomes) from external sources, and by calculating community-weighted means and variances of traits using gap-filled data from the global plant trait database TRY. Moreover, we created a phylogenetic tree for 50,167 out of the 54,519 species identified in the plots. We present the first maps of global patterns of community richness and community-weighted means of key traits. Conclusions The availability of vegetation plot data in sPlot offers new avenues for vegetation analysis at the global scale.

AB BackgroundPhosphorus (P) is a limiting nutrient in many agroecosystems and costly fertilizer inputs can cause negative environmental impacts. Cover crops constitute a promising management option for sustainable intensification of agriculture. However, their interactions with the soil microbial community, which is a key driver of P cycling, and their effects on the following crop, have not yet been systematically assessed.ScopeWe conducted a meta-analysis of published field studies on cover crops and P cycling, focusing on plant-microbe interactions.ConclusionsWe describe several distinct, simultaneous mechanisms of P benefits for the main crop. Decomposition dynamics, governed by P concentration, are critical for the transfer of P from cover crop residues to the main crop. Cover crops may enhance the soil microbial community by providing a legacy of increased mycorrhizal abundance, microbial biomass P, and phosphatase activity. Cover crops are generally most effective in systems low in available P, and may access unavailable' P pools. However, their effects on P availability are difficult to detect by standard soil P tests, except for increases after the use of Lupinus sp. Agricultural management (i.e. cover crop species selection, tillage, fertilization) can improve cover crop effects. In summary, cover cropping has the potential to tighten nutrient cycling in agricultural systems under different conditions, increasing crop P nutrition and yield.

AB Plant adaptation to drought has been extensively studied at many scales from ecology to molecular biology across a large range of model species. However, the conceptual frameworks underpinning the definition of plant strategies, and the terminology used across the different disciplines and scales are not analogous. Drought resistance' for instance refers to plant responses as different as the maintenance of growth and productivity in crops, to the survival and recovery in perennial woody or grassland species. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a unified conceptual framework of plant adaptive strategies to drought based on a revised terminology in order to enhance comparative studies. Ecological strategies encapsulate plant adaptation to multidimensional variation in resource variability but cannot account for the dynamic and short-term responses to fluctuations in water availability. Conversely, several plant physiological strategies have been identified along the mono-dimensional gradient of water availability in a given environment. According to a revised terminology, dehydration escape, dehydration avoidance, dehydration tolerance, dormancy, and desiccation tolerance are clearly distinguishable. Their sequential expression is expressed as water deficit increases while cavitation tolerance is proposed here to be a major hydraulic strategy underpinning adaptive responses to drought of vascular plants. This continuum of physiological strategies can be interpreted in the context of the ecological trade-off between water-acquisition vs. water-conservation, since growth maintenance is associated with fast water use under moderate drought while plant survival after growth cessation is associated with slow water use under severe drought. Consequently, the distinction between drought resistance' and drought survival', is emphasized as crucial to ensure a correct interpretation of plant strategies since knowing when not to grow' does not confer drought resistance' but may well enhance drought survival'. This framework proposal should improve cross-fertilization between disciplines to help tackle the increasing worldwide challenges that drought poses to plant adaptation.

AB The study of tradeoffs among major life history components (age at maturity, lifespan and reproduction) allowed the development of a quantitative framework to understand how environmental variation shapes patterns of biodiversity among and within species.
   Because every environment is inherently spatially structured, and in most cases temporally variable, individuals need to move within and among habitats to maximize fitness. Dispersal is often assumed to be tightly integrated into life histories through genetic correlations with other vital traits. This assumption is particularly strong within the context of a fast-slow continuum of life-history variation. Such a framework is to date used to explain many aspects of population and community dynamics. Evidence for a consistent and context-independent integration of dispersal in life histories is, however, weak. We therefore advocate the explicit integration of dispersal into life history theory as a principal axis of variation influencing fitness, that is free to evolve, independently of other life history traits.
   We synthesize theoretical and empirical evidence on the central role of dispersal and its evolutionary dynamics on the spatial distribution of ecological strategies and its impact on population spread, invasions and coexistence. By applying an optimality framework we show that the inclusion of dispersal as an independent dimension of life histories might substantially change our view on evolutionary trajectories in spatially structured environments.
   Because changes in the spatial configuration of habitats affect the costs of movement and dispersal, adaptations to reduce these costs will increase phenotypic divergence among and within populations. We outline how this phenotypic heterogeneity is anticipated to further impact population and community dynamics.

AB Intestinal bacterial communities play a pivotal role in promoting host health; therefore, the disruption of intestinal bacterial homeostasis could result in disease. However, the effect of the occurrences of disease on intestinal bacterial community assembly remains unclear. To address this gap, we compared the multifaceted ecological differences in maintaining intestinal bacterial community assembly between healthy and diseased shrimps. The neutral model analysis shows that the relative importance of neutral processes decreases when disease occurs. This pattern is further corroborated by the ecosphere null model, revealing that the bacterial community assembly of diseased samples is dominated by stochastic processes. In addition, the occurrence of shrimp disease reduces the complexity and cooperative activities of species-to-species interactions. The keystone taxa affiliated with Alphapro teobacteria and Actinobacteria in healthy shrimp gut shift to Gammaproteobacteria species in diseased shrimp. Changes in intestinal bacterial communities significantly alter biological functions in shrimp. Within a given metabolic pathway, the pattern of enrichment or decrease between healthy and deceased shrimp is correlated with its functional effects. We propose that stressed shrimp are more prone to invasion by alien strains (evidenced by more stochastic assembly and higher migration rate in diseased shrimp), which, in turn, disrupts the cooperative activity among resident species. These findings greatly aid our understanding of the underlyingmechanisms that govern shrimp intestinal community assembly between health statuses.

AB Though bacteria and fungi are common inhabitants of decaying wood, little is known about the relationship between bacterial and fungal community dynamics during natural wood decay. Based on previous studies involving inoculated wood blocks, strong fungal selection on bacteria abundance and community composition was expected to occur during natural wood decay. Here, we focused on bacterial and fungal community compositions in pine wood samples collected from dead trees in different stages of decomposition. We showed that bacterial communities undergo less drastic changes than fungal communities during wood decay. Furthermore, we found that bacterial community assembly was a stochastic process at initial stage of wood decay and became more deterministic in later stages, likely due to environmental factors. Moreover, composition of bacterial communities did not respond to the changes in the major fungal species present in the wood but rather to the stage of decay reflected by the wood density. We concluded that the shifts in the bacterial communities were a result of the changes in wood properties during decomposition and largely independent of the composition of the wood -decaying fungal communities.

AB Ecological investigations are increasingly using functional diversity in order to understand different patterns, such as species occurrence, species competitive abilities, and the influence of biological communities on ecosystem functioning. Here we provide an overview of the history and applicability of functional diversity in ecological studies. We found that the idea of functional diversity emerged many times and in distinct fields over the years. Functional diversity was conceived as an alternative classification to measure the ecological importance of species in a community, as well as a way to understand how biodiversity affects specific ecosystem functions. Gradually, new questions regarding functional traits emerged. Some examples include understanding species competitive abilities, patterns of species co-occurrence, community assembly, and the role of different traits on ecosystem functioning. The increasing use of functional-based approaches fueled the search for new metrics aiming at accurately estimating functional diversity and, consequently, categorical-based classifications of functional traits have been gradually replaced by continuous multi-trait approaches. More recently, the role of functional diversity was recognized as a key factor to maintain important functions and services of ecosystems. We present empirical evidence supporting this statement.

AB Laboratory microcosm experiments using protists as model organisms have a long tradition and are widely used to investigate general concepts in population biology, community ecology and evolutionary biology. Many variables of interest are measured in order to study processes and patterns at different spatiotemporal scales and across all levels of biological organization. This includes measurements of body size, mobility or abundance, in order to understand population dynamics, dispersal behaviour and ecosystem processes. Also, a variety of manipulations are employed, such as temperature changes or varying connectivity in spatial microcosm networks. Past studies, however, have used varying methods for maintenance, measurement, and manipulation, which hinders across-study comparisons and meta-analyses, and the added value they bring. Furthermore, application of techniques such as flow cytometry, image and video analyses, and in situ environmental probes provide novel and improved opportunities to quantify variables of interest at unprecedented precision and temporal resolution. Here, we take the first step towards a standardization of well-established and novel methods and techniques within the field of protist microcosm experiments. We provide a comprehensive overview of maintenance, measurement and manipulation methods. An extensive supplement contains detailed protocols of all methods, and these protocols also exist in a community updateable online repository. We envision that such a synthesis and standardization of methods will overcome shortcomings and challenges faced by past studies and also promote activities such as meta-analyses and distributed experiments conducted simultaneously across many different laboratories at a global scale.

AB The spaces where countryside meets town are often amongst society's most valued and pressured places which together form the rural-urban fringe (RUF). A 'messy' yet opportunistic space in policy and decision making processes, the RUF remains confused and 'disintegrated' lacking sufficient understanding and explicit attention for sustainable management as places in their own right. This paper exposes the scope, nature and reasons leading towards policy disintegration within the RUF with critical attention on the separate lenses of the Ecosystem Approach and Spatial Planning frameworks reflecting a marked natural and built environment divide. Using research funded by the Rural Economy and Land Use programme, three 'bridging' concepts were identified within which improved integration is explored: Time, Connections and Values. Using team member thoughtpieces and workshops, together with visioning exercises in two rural-urban fringes, a series of narratives are presented within which the RUF opportunity is re-discovered set within a hybridised theory of spatial and environmental planning. In so doing the paper challenges established economic and planning models of urban development and expansion with more holistic ideas and approaches. One size-fits-all solutions such as greenbelts, regionalism or localism are rejected within an approach that champions multi-scalar and sectoral perspectives set within a governance framework that achieves social and economic well-being through maintaining and enhancing ecosystem functions and services. We conclude by arguing that policy strands within environment and planning must be better connected allowing the RUF to be developed as an opportunity space for testing and experimentation.

AB Plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPR) may help reducing the toxicity of heavy metals to plants in polluted environments. In this work the effects of inoculating metal resistant and plant growth promoting bacterial strains on the growth of Helianthus annuus grown in Zn and Cd spiked soils were assessed. The PGPR strains Ralstonia eutropha (B1) and Chrysiobacterium humi (B2) reduced losses of weight in metal exposed plants and induced changes in metal bioaccumulation and bioconcentration - with strain B2 decreasing up to 67% Zn accumulation and by 20% Zn bioconcentration factor (BCF) in the shoots, up to 64% Zn uptake and 38% Zn BCF in the roots, and up to 27% Cd uptake and 27% Cd BCF in plant roots. The impact of inoculation on the bacterial communities in the rhizosphere of the plant was also assessed. Bacterial community diversity decreased with increasing levels of metal contamination in the soil, but in rhizosphere soil of plants inoculated with the PGPR strains, a higher bacterial diversity was kept throughout the experimental period. Inoculation of sunflower, particularly with C humi (B2), appears to be an effective way of enhancing the short term stabilization potential of the plant in metal contaminated land, lowering losses in plant biomass and decreasing aboveground tissue contamination.

AB Range expansions are extremely common, but have only recently begun to attract attention in terms of their genetic consequences. As populations expand, demes at the wave front experience strong genetic drift, which is expected to reduce genetic diversity and potentially cause allele surfing', where alleles may become fixed over a wide geographical area even if their effects are deleterious. Previous simulation models show that range expansions can generate very strong selective gradients on dispersal, reproduction, competition and immunity. To investigate the effects of range expansion on genetic diversity and adaptation, we studied the population genomics of the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) in Ireland. The bank vole was likely introduced in the late 1920s and is expanding its range at a rate of similar to 2.5km/year. Using genotyping-by-sequencing, we genotyped 281 bank voles at 5979 SNP loci. Fourteen sample sites were arranged in three transects running from the introduction site to the wave front of the expansion. We found significant declines in genetic diversity along all three transects. However, there was no evidence that sites at the wave front had accumulated more deleterious mutations. We looked for outlier loci with strong correlations between allele frequency and distance from the introduction site, where the direction of correlation was the same in all three transects. Amongst these outliers, we found significant enrichment for genic SNPs, suggesting the action of selection. Candidates for selection included several genes with immunological functions and several genes that could influence behaviour.

   Evaluation Criteria - Dutch Hoverflies as a Case Study
SO PLOS ONE

AB Understanding species distributions and the factors limiting them is an important topic in ecology and conservation, including in nature reserve selection and predicting climate change impacts. While Species Distribution Models (SDM) are the main tool used for these purposes, choosing the best SDM algorithm is not straightforward as these are plentiful and can be applied in many different ways. SDM are used mainly to gain insight in 1) overall species distributions, 2) their pastpresent-future probability of occurrence and/or 3) to understand their ecological niche limits (also referred to as ecological niche modelling). The fact that these three aims may require different models and outputs is, however, rarely considered and has not been evaluated consistently. Here we use data from a systematically sampled set of species occurrences to specifically test the performance of Species Distribution Models across several commonly used algorithms. Species range in distribution patterns from rare to common and from local to widespread. We compare overall model fit (representing species distribution), the accuracy of the predictions at multiple spatial scales, and the consistency in selection of environmental correlations all across multiple modelling runs. As expected, the choice of modelling algorithm determines model outcome. However, model quality depends not only on the algorithm, but also on the measure of model fit used and the scale at which it is used. Although model fit was higher for the consensus approach and Maxent, Maxent and GAM models were more consistent in estimating local occurrence, while RF and GBM showed higher consistency in environmental variables selection. Model outcomes diverged more for narrowly distributed species than for widespread species. We suggest that matching study aims with modelling approach is essential in Species Distribution Models, and provide suggestions how to do this for different modelling aims and species' data characteristics (i.e. sample size, spatial distribution).

AB Background: Schistosomes are dioecious parasitic flatworms, which live in the vasculature of their mammalian definitive hosts. They are the causative agent of schistosomiasis, a disease of considerable medical and veterinary importance in tropical and subtropical regions. Schistosomes undergo a sexual reproductive stage within their mammalian host enabling interactions between different species, which may result in hybridization if the species involved are phylogenetically close. In Senegal, three closely related species in the Schistosoma haematobium group are endemic: S. haematobium, which causes urogenital schistosomiasis in humans, and S. bovis and S. curassoni, which cause intestinal schistosomiasis in cows, sheep and goats.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Large-scale multi-loci molecular analysis of parasite samples collected from children and domestic livestock across Senegal revealed that interactions and hybridization were taking place between all three species. Evidence of hybridization between S. haematobium/S. curassoni and S. haematobium/S. bovis was commonly found in children from across Senegal, with 88% of the children surveyed in areas of suspected species overlap excreting hybrid miracidia. No S. haematobium worms or hybrids thereof were found in ruminants, although S. bovis and S. curassoni hybrid worms were found in cows. Complementary experimental mixed species infections in laboratory rodents confirmed that males and females of each species readily pair and produce viable hybrid offspring.
   Conclusions/Significance: These data provide indisputable evidence for: the high occurrence of bidirectional hybridization between these Schistosoma species; the first conclusive evidence for the natural hybridisation between S. haematobium and S. curassoni; and demonstrate that the transmission of the different species and their hybrids appears focal. Hybridization between schistosomes has been known to influence the disease epidemiology and enhance phenotypic characteristics affecting transmission, morbidity and drug sensitivity. Therefore, understanding and monitoring such inter-species interactions will be essential for optimizing and evaluating control strategies across such potential hybrid zones.

AB Within the rapidly developing field of movement ecology, much attention has been given to studying the movement of individuals within a subset of their population's occupied range. Our understanding of the effects of landscape heterogeneity on animal movement is still fairly limited as it requires studying the movement of multiple individuals across a variety of environmental conditions. Gaining deeper understanding of the environmental drivers of movement is a crucial component of predictive models of population spread and habitat selection and may help inform management and conservation. In Ontario, woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) occur along a wide geographical gradient ranging from the boreal forest to the Hudson Bay floodplains. We used high-resolution GPS data, collected from 114 individuals across a 450 000 km2 area in northern Ontario, to link movement behaviour to underlying local environmental variables associated with habitat permeability, predation risk and forage availability. We show that a great deal of observed variability in movement patterns across space and time can be attributed to local environmental conditions, with residual individual differences that may reflect spatial population structure. We discuss our results in the context of current knowledge of movement and caribou ecology and highlight potential applications of our approach to the study of wide-ranging animals.

AB To determine microbial community composition, community spatial structure and possible key microbial processes in the shallow-sea hydrothermal vent systems off NE Taiwan's coast, we examined the bacterial and archaeal communities of four samples collected from the water column extending over a redoxocline gradient of a yellow and four from a white hydrothermal vent. Ribosomal tag pyrosequencing based on DNA and RNA showed statistically significant differences between the bacterial and archaeal communities of the different hydrothermal plumes. The bacterial and archaeal communities from the white hydrothermal plume were dominated by sulfur-reducing Nautilia and Thermococcus, whereas the yellow hydrothermal plume and the surface water were dominated by sulfide-oxidizing Thiomicrospira and Euryarchaeota Marine Group II, respectively. Canonical correspondence analyses indicate that methane (CH4) concentration was the only statistically significant variable that explains all community cluster patterns. However, the results of pyrosequencing showed an essential absence of methanogens and methanotrophs at the two vent fields, suggesting that CH4 was less tied to microbial processes in this shallow-sea hydrothermal system. We speculated that mixing between hydrothermal fluids and the sea or meteoric water leads to distinctly different CH4 concentrations and redox niches between the yellow and white vents, consequently influencing the distribution patterns of the free-living Bacteria and Archaea. We concluded that sulfur-reducing and sulfide-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophs accounted for most of the primary biomass synthesis and that microbial sulfur metabolism fueled microbial energy flow and element cycling in the shallow hydrothermal systems off the coast of NE Taiwan.

AB Polyploidy is a major evolutionary process in eukaryotes-particularly in plants and, to a less extent, in animals, wherein several past and recentwhole-genome duplication events have been described. Surprisingly, the incidence of polyploidy in other eukaryote kingdoms, particularly within fungi, remained largely disregarded by the scientific community working on the evolutionary consequences of polyploidy. Recent studies have significantly increased our knowledge of the occurrence and evolutionary significance of fungal polyploidy. The ecological, structural and functional consequences of polyploidy in fungi are reviewed here and compared with the knowledge acquired with conventional plant and animal models. In particular, the genus Saccharomyces emerges as a relevant model for polyploid studies, in addition to plant and animal models.

AB The evolution of flight is a key innovation that may enable the extreme diversification of insects. Nonetheless, many species-rich, winged insect groups contain flightless lineages. The loss of flight may promote allopatric differentiation due to limited dispersal power and may result in a high speciation rate in the flightless lineage. Here we show that loss of flight accelerates allopatric speciation using carrion beetles (Coleoptera: Silphidae). We demonstrate that flightless species retain higher genetic differentiation among populations and comprise a higher number of genetically distinct lineages than flight-capable species, and that the speciation rate with the flightless state is twice that with the flight-capable state. Moreover, a meta-analysis of 51 beetle species from 15 families reveals higher genetic differentiation among populations in flightless compared with flight-capable species. In beetles, which represent almost one-fourth of all described species, repeated evolution of flightlessness may have contributed to their steady diversification since the Mesozoic era.

AB Arms races between avian brood parasites and their hosts often result in parasitic mimicry of host eggs, to evade rejection. Once egg mimicry has evolved, host defences could escalate in two ways: (i) hosts could improve their level of egg discrimination; and (ii) negative frequency-dependent selection could generate increased variation in egg appearance (polymorphism) among individuals. Proficiency in one defence might reduce selection on the other, while a combination of the two should enable successful rejection of parasitic eggs. We compared three highly variable host species of the Afrotropical cuckoo finch Anomalospiza imberbis, using egg rejection experiments and modelling of avian colour and pattern vision. We show that each differed in their level of polymorphism, in the visual cues they used to reject foreign eggs, and in their degree of discrimination. The most polymorphic host had the crudest discrimination, whereas the least polymorphic was most discriminating. The third species, not currently parasitized, was intermediate for both defences. A model simulating parasitic laying and host rejection behaviour based on the field experiments showed that the two host strategies result in approximately the same fitness advantage to hosts. Thus, neither strategy is superior, but rather they reflect alternative potential evolutionary trajectories.

AB Climate change has been identified as a causal factor for diverse ecological changes worldwide. Warming trends over the last couple of decades have coincided with the collapse of long-term population cycles in a broad range of taxa, although causal mechanisms are not well-understood. Larch budmoth (LBM) population dynamics across the European Alps, a classic example of regular outbreaks, inexplicably changed sometime during the 1980s after 1,200 y of nearly uninterrupted periodic outbreak cycles. Herein, analysis of perhaps the most extensive spatiotemporal dataset of population dynamics and reconstructed Alpine-wide LBM defoliation records reveals elevational shifts in LBM outbreak epicenters that coincide with temperature fluctuations over two centuries. A population model supports the hypothesis that temperature-mediated shifting of the optimal elevation for LBM population growth is the mechanism for elevational epicenter changes. Increases in the optimal elevation for population growth over the warming period of the last century to near the distributional limit of host larch likely dampened population cycles, thereby causing the collapse of a millennium-long outbreak cycle. The threshold-like change in LBM outbreak pattern highlights how interacting species with differential response rates to climate change can result in dramatic ecological changes.

AB Species are impacted by climate change at both ecological and evolutionary time scales. Studies in northern continents have provided abundant evidence of dramatic shifts in distributions of species subsequent to the last glacial maximum (LGM), particularly at high latitudes. However, little is known about the history of southern continents, especially at high latitudes. South America is the only continent, other than Antarctica, that extends beyond 40 degrees S. Genetic studies of a few Patagonian species have provided seemingly conflicting results, indicating either postglacial colonization from restricted glacial refugia or persistence through glacial cycles and in situ differentiation. Using mitochondrial DNA sequences of 14 species of sigmodontine rodents, a major faunal ensemble of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, we show that at least nine of these species bear genetic footprints of demographic expansion from single restricted sources. However, timing of demographic expansion precedes the LGM in most of these species. Four species are fragmented phylogeographically within the region. Our results indicate that (i) demographic instability in response to historical climate change has been widespread in the Patagonian-Fueguian region, and is generally more pronounced at high latitudes in both southern and northern continents; (ii) colonization from lower latitudes is an important component of current Patagonian-Fueguian diversity; but (iii) in situ differentiation has also contributed to species diversity.

AB The upper 8.45 m of a sediment core from Lake Naleng were analysed for its pollen and charcoal content to detect vegetation, climate, and human activity changes on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) since the Pleistocene-Holocene transition (11.7 cal kyr BP). The application of pollen indicator taxa, pollen sums, biomisation, and multivariate analysis helped to reconstruct environmental conditions during the Holocene. Furthermore, 64 surface samples from the southeastern TP and its foreland were analysed to investigate the relationship between modern pollen assemblages and vegetation. The modern vegetation was recorded in the surface pollen assemblages by pollen indicator types, although sediments also contain pollen spectra extra-regional pollen transported from lower vegetation belts, which is seen as a consequence of steep elevation gradients at the southeastern margin of the TP. The relation between different vegetation belts and temperature from the modern sample sites was used to infer quantitative temperature trends for the Holocene record.
   Spreading of forests at the beginning of the Holocene marks the transition to warmer conditions. From 10.7 to similar to 4.4 cal kyr BP open Abies-Betula forests were found at Lake Naleng probably reflecting a stronger-than-present summer monsoon. Temperature range reconstructions suggest a temperature that was about 2-3 degrees C warmer and a treeline position that was 400-600 m higher than today. A severe climate deterioration with temperatures about 1-2 degrees C colder than before is documented by a retreating forest between 8.1 and 7.2 cal kyr BP. Forests retreated while subalpine Rhododendron shrubs spread around Lake Naleng indicating colder conditions with temperatures 1-2 degrees C below early and mid Holocene level after 4.4 cal kyr BP. The forest decline at 4.4 cal kyr BP is considered to reflect climatic conditions as low concentrations of charcoal particles found in this period exclude human-induced fires as reason for the forest retreat. However, grazing indicators imply human influence on the environment since 3.4 cal kyr BP around Lake Naleng. We therefore consider the rapid treeline shift seen at 3.4 cal kyr BP as partly generated by human activity and partly by climatic conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We review key issues, available approaches and analyses to encourage and assist practitioners to develop sound plans to evaluate the effectiveness of weed biological control agents at various phases throughout a program. Assessing the effectiveness of prospective agents before release assists the selection process, while post-release evaluation aims to determine the extent that agents are alleviating the ecological, social and economic impacts of the weeds. Information gathered on weed impacts prior to the initiation of a biological control program is necessary to provide baseline data and devise performance targets against which the program can subsequently be evaluated. Detailed data on weed populations, associated plant communities and, in some instances ecosystem processes collected at representative sites in the introduced range several years before the release of agents can be compared with similar data collected later to assess agent effectiveness. Laboratory, glasshouse and field studies are typically used to assess agent effectiveness. While some approaches used for field studies may be influenced by confounding factors, manipulative experiments where agents are excluded (or included) using chemicals or cages are more robust but time-consuming and expensive to implement. Demographic modeling and benefit-cost analyses are increasingly being used to complement other studies. There is an obvious need for more investment in long-term post-release evaluation of agent effectiveness to rigorously document outcomes of biological control programs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Foliage structure, chemistry, photosynthetic potentials (V-cmax and J(max)), and mesophyll diffusion conductance (g(m)) were quantified for 35 broad-leaved species from four sites with contrasting rainfall and soil fertility in eastern Australia. The aim of the study was to estimate the extent to which g(m) and related leaf properties limited photosynthesis (A), focusing on highly sclerophyllous species typical of the 'slow-return' end of the leaf economics spectrum. Leaf dry mass per unit area (M-A) varied similar to 5-fold, leaf life span (L-L) and N (N-M) and P (P-M) contents per dry mass similar to 8-fold, and various characteristics of foliage photosynthetic machinery 6- to 12-fold across the data set. As is characteristic of the 'leaf economics spectrum', more robust leaves with greater M-A and longevity were associated with lower nutrient contents and lower foliage photosynthetic potentials. g(m) was positively correlated with V-cmax and J(max), and these correlations were stronger on a mass basis. Only g(m)/mass was negatively associated with M-A. CO2 drawdown from substomatal cavities to chloroplasts (C-i-C-C) characterizing mesophyll CO2 diffusion limitations was larger in leaves with greater M-A, lower g(m)/mass, and lower photosynthetic potentials. Relative limitation of A due to finite mesophyll diffusion conductance, i.e. 1-A(infinite g(m))/A(actual g(m)), was always > 0.2 and up to 0.5 in leaves with most robust leaf structure, demonstrating the profound effect of finite g(m) on realized photosynthesis rates. Data from different sites were overlapping in bivariate relationships, and the variability of average values between the sites was less than among the species within the sites. Nevertheless, photosynthesis was more strongly limited by g(m) in low rain/high nutrient and high rain/low nutrient sites that supported vegetation with more sclerophyllous foliage. These data collectively highlight a strong relationship between leaf structure and g(m), and demonstrate that realized photosynthesis rates are strongly limited by g(m) in this highly sclerophyllous flora.

AB Science and reporting information needs for monitoring dynamics in land cover over time have prompted research, and made operational, a wide variety of change detection methods utilizing multiple dates of remotely sensed data. Change detection procedures based upon spectral values are common; however, landscape pattern analysis approaches which utilize spatial information inherent within imagery present opportunities for the generation of unique and ecologically important information. While the use of two images may provide the means to identify change, the use of more than two images for long-term monitoring affords the ability to identify a greater range of processes of landscape change, including rates and dynamics, The main objective of this review is to investigate and summarize the methods and applications of land cover spatial pattern analysis using three or more image dates. The potential and the limitations of landscape pattern indices are identified and discussed to inform application recommendations. The second objective of this review is to make recommendations, including appropriate landscape pattern indices, for the application of landscape pattern analysis of a long time series of remotely sensed data to a case study involving the mountain pine beetle in British Columbia, Canada. The review concludes with recommendations for future research.

AB Chestnut blight fungus (Endothia parasitica [Murr.] P.J. And. & H.W. And.)) is a classic example of an invasive species, which severely damaged populations of its host, Castanea dentata, and had widespread and long-term impacts on eastern North American forests. Concurrently, forests were further disturbed by lumbering, which was common across the region from the mid 1800s to the early 1900s. In 1926, local infestations of chestnut blight were reported in the Coweeta Basin, Southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. We used permanent plot inventories of the Basin (first sampled in 1934 and twice afterward in 1969-72 and 1988-93) to describe the distribution of species along a complex environmental gradient. Specifically, we asked: How does vegetation change over approximately 60 years following logging and the demise of C. dentata? Does the association between vegetation and environment determine the pattern of species distributions through time? Which species replaced C. dentata across this complex environmental gradient? We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination and multiresponse permutation procedure for the analyses of the inventory periods. In 1934, C. dentata was the most important species in the Coweeta Basin. It was present in 98% of the plots and contributed 22% of the total density and 36% of the total basal area. Diversity increased significantly over time and was attributed to an increase in evenness of species distribution. The canopy dominant, C. dentata, was replaced by more than one species across the environmental gradient. Importance values of Quercus prinus, Acer rubrum, Cornus florida, Tsuga canadensis, and Oxydendrum arboreum increased by 2-5% across the basin following the decline of C. dentata. Tsuga canadensis increased in abundance and distribution, especially near streams across elevations. Liriodendron tulipifera replaced C. dentata in moist coves, which have low terrain shape and high organic matter content. In contrast, Q. prinus and A. rubrum were ubiquitous, much like C. dentata before the chestnut blight becoming dominant or co-dominant species across all environmental conditions.

AB I examined variability in the abundances of functional groups, functional diversity measures, and functional structure of littoral macroinvertebrate communities in relation to the environmental features of boreal lakes. The most important environmental variables shaping variation in the abundances of functional groups and functional structure were lake surface area, macrophyte cover, total phosphorous, and water hardness. The same environmental variables (i.e., lake surface area, macrophyte cover) accounted for variability in functional richness and functional diversity, while functional evenness was related to different environmental variables (i.e., hardness, color). Lake surface area and macrophyte cover comprised the most important axes of habitat templets shaping the functional trait structure and biodiversity in boreal lakes: lake area mirrors habitat differences between smaller and larger lakes, and macrophyte cover portrays the effects of habitat structural complexity on functional biodiversity. Functional biodiversity measures were also strongly correlated to species-level measures, and the correlation between similarity in functional and taxonomic structure was strong. Functional and taxonomic measures of macroinvertebrate communities thus provide rather similar information about littoral communities and ecosystem functioning.

AB 1. Increasing functional diversity often leads to an increase in ecosystem productivity in the form of overyielding. While the mechanisms (i.e. complementarity or facilitation) that underlie overyielding provide strong insights into species coexistence and community assembly, they are rarely tested. In subalpine grasslands, traditional management through manuring and hay-making results in intermediate productivity that is associated with high functional diversity. This functional diversity results from the coexistence between conservative plant species (with slow growth rates, low specific leaf area) and exploitative species (with fast growth rates, high specific leaf area).
   2. We hypothesized that overyielding occurs among these two functional groups and tested whether complementarity or facilitation can explain overyielding. Using three perennial grass species per functional group, we compared single and mixed functional group mesocosms at low and intermediate levels of fertilization to test the occurrence of overyielding. Additionally, we measured the outcomes of biotic interactions among these two functional groups by manipulating plant density.
   3. After two growing seasons, we found evidence of overyielding under intermediate levels of fertility. Overyielding was associated with a reduction of competition intensity when both functional groups were grown together. These results suggest that complementarity, as evidenced by a decrease in competition intensity, rather than facilitation, explains the observed overyielding. Indeed, we found evidence for complementarity for light and modification of nutrient use as possible mechanisms for the overyielding.
   4. Synthesis. Complementarity between functional groups might be an important mechanism enhancing functional diversity, particularly in harsh environments at intermediate rather than low fertility.

AB We conducted a long-term experiment in grassland with the aim of elucidating grassland dynamics in relation to variations in rainfall amount and spatial and temporal variation in disturbance. In particular we aimed to increase our understanding of ecosystem dynamics and function, species redundancy, invasion biology, and other related topics. We studied the dynamics of serpentine annual grassland in northern California over the period 1983-2002 in a replicated series of experimental plots comprising controls, gopher exclosures, and aboveground herbivore exclosures. Annual rainfall amount varied greatly during the study period, which included two major El Nino events and a period of prolonged below-average rainfall. Gopher disturbance was highly variable both spatially and temporally but was positively correlated with soil depth. Disturbance was reduced but not eliminated from the gopher exclosures and was significantly increased in the aboveground herbivore exclosures. Grassland dynamics were driven by rainfall amounts and distributions that had the most pronounced effects on the dominant plant species, while gopher disturbance had additional effects on the rarer species. Effects of excluding aboveground herbivores were swamped by a large increase in gopher disturbance within aboveground exclosures. Overall species numbers were reduced during a period of below-average rainfall but recovered in subsequent years. There was a large array of different responses of individual plant species to both rainfall and disturbance. Our results provide support for the "insurance'' hypothesis, which suggests that biodiversity buffers ecosystem processes against environmental changes because different species (or phenotypes) respond differently to these changes, leading to functional compensations among species. Here, a species that was at very low abundance levels at the start of the study (Microseris douglasii) temporarily increased in abundance to become one of the dominant species in the grassland following a period of prolonged below-average rainfall. We also observed the repeated invasion of the serpentine grassland by the nonnative grass Bromus hordeaceus, which increased greatly in abundance following both of the major El Nino events. The results emphasize the importance of long-term observations in providing a context for shorter-term studies and allowing analysis of plant community responses to climate variation and disturbance, particularly in the face of ongoing global change.

AB Phylogenetic information is useful in understanding the evolutionary history of adaptive traits. Here, we present a well-resolved phylogenetic hypothesis for Heliconius butterflies and related genera. We use this tree to investigate the evolution of three traits, pollen feeding, pupal-mating behaviour and larval gregariousness. Phylogenetic relationships among 60 Heliconiina species (86% of the subtribe) were inferred from partial DNA sequences of the mitochondrial genes cytochrome oxidase I, cytochrome oxidase II and 16S rRNA, and fragments of the nuclear genes elongation factor-1 alpha, apterous, decapentaplegic and wingless (3834 bp in total). The results corroborate previous hypotheses based on sequence data in showing that Heliconius is paraphyletic, with Laparus doris and Neruda falling within the genus, demonstrating a single origin for pollen feeding but with a loss of the trait in Neruda. However, different genes are not congruent in their placement of Neruda; therefore, monophyly of the pollen feeding species cannot be ruled out. There is also a highly supported monophyletic 'pupal-mating clade' suggesting that pupal mating behaviour evolved only once in the Heliconiina. Additionally, we observed at least three independent origins for larval gregariousness from a solitary ancestor, showing that gregarious larval behaviour arose after warning coloration.

AB Question: Land-use change has a major impact on terrestrial plant communities by affecting fertility and disturbance. We test how particular combinations of plant functional traits can predict species responses to these factors and their abundance in the field by examining whether trade-offs at the trait level (fundamental trade-offs) are linked to trade-offs at the response level (secondary trade-offs).
   Location: Central French Alps.
   Methods: We conducted a pot experiment in which we characterized plant trait syndromes by measuring whole plant and leaf traits for six dominant species, originating from contrasting subalpine grassland types. We characterized their response to nutrient availability, shading and clipping. We quantified factors linked with different land usage in the field to test the relevance of our experimental treatments.
   Results: We showed that land management affected nutrient concentration in soil, light availability and disturbance intensity. We identified particular suites of traits linked to plant stature and leaf structure which were associated with species responses to these environmental factors. Leaf dry matter content separates fast and slow growing species. Height and lateral spread separated tolerant and intolerant species to shade and clipping. Discussion and
   Conclusion: Two fundamental trade-offs based on stature traits and leaf traits were linked to two secondary trade-off, based on response to fertilization shade and mowing. Based on these trade-offs, we discuss four different species strategies which could explain and predict species distributions and traits syndrome at community scale under different land-uses in subalpine grasslands.

AB The MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) primary productivity products are evaluated against observed Above-ground Net Primary Production (AGNPP) in the semi-arid Senegal 2001. MODIS net primary productivity (NPP) modelling is a light use efficiency (LUE) based approach incorporating constraints on vegetation productivity arising from simulated radiation, water demand and temperature data from NASA's Data Assimilation Office (DAO). Annually integrated MODIS PSN (MOD17A2 net photosynthesis, Collection 4) explains more of the observed biomass variation (r(2) = 0.77) than MODIS fAPAR (fraction Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, Collection 4) (r(2) = 0.72), indicating the effect of including the canopy stress scalar (epsilon(s)) based on DAO data combined with modelled maintenance respiration costs (of leaf and fine roots). Annual MODIS NPP (MOD17A3, Collection 4 (C4) and Collection 4.5 (C4.5)) including growth respiration and live wood maintenance respiration costs and 2 modified DAO input (C4.5) however increases the residual unexplained observed AGNPP variance (C4 NPP; r(2) = 0.49) (C4.5 NPP; r(2) = 0.37). The overall quality of the annual NPP MODIS C4 and C4.5 products are moderate for the semi-arid Senegal because of the annual respiration cost modelling and a change in C4.5 biome-specific parameters stored in a Biome Properties Look-Up Table (BPLUT) is the main contributor to the observed discrepancy between C4 and C4.5 NPP. The dynamic range of the values of all MOD 17 products was too low when compared to observed AGNPP. An estimate of canopy water stress (SIWSI; Shortwave Infrared Water Stress Index) derived from MODIS channels 2 and 6 and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) irradiance derived from geostationary METEOSAT data were tested for primary production modelling using a stepwise linear regression analysis. PAR irradiance was combined with MODIS fAPAR into APAR (Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation) explaining 79% of the observed AGNPP variation. Introducing SIWSI significantly increased the explained variance of observed AGNPP (r(2)=0.89). MODIS-derived percentage tree cover was tested as a predictor based on the hypothesis that tree cover provides information on differences in respiratory costs between trees and grasses thereby accounting for variations in the LUE conversion efficiency epsilon. No significant reduction in residual unexplained AGNPP variance was found. Earth observation based derivation of PAR and canopy water stress from SIWSI suggest potential improvements to primary production models in semi-arid biomes that can be implemented in general NPP modelling LUE methodology.

AB Levels of gene flow among populations vary both inter- and intraspecifically, and understanding the ecological bases of variation in levels of gene flow represents an important link between the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations. The effects of habitat spatial structure on gene flow have received considerable attention; however, most studies have been conducted at a single spatial scale and without background data on how individual movement is affected by landscape features. We examined the influence of habitat connectivity on inferred levels of gene flow in a high-altitude, meadow-dwelling butterfly, Parnassius smintheus. For this species, we had background data on the effects of landscape structure on both individual movement and on small-scale population genetic differentiation. We compared genetic differentiation and patterns of isolation by distance, based on variation at seven microsatellite loci, among three regions representing two levels of connectivity of high-altitude, nonforested habitats. We found that reduced connectivity of habitats, resulting from more forest cover at high altitudes, was associated with greater genetic differentiation among populations (higher estimated F-ST), a breakdown of isolation by distance, and overall lower levels of inferred gene flow. These observed differences were consistent with expectations based on our knowledge of the movement behaviour of this species and on previous population genetic analyses conducted at the smaller spatial scale. Our results indicate that the role of gene flow may vary among groups of populations depending on the interplay between individual movement and the structure of the surrounding landscape.

AB Mbuna, the dominant fishes on the rocky shores of Lake Malawi, have become a major 'model system' for the study of rapid speciation and adaptive radiation. At least 295 putative species are known, of which more than 200 remain undescribed. There is no good evidence for monophyly in the mbuna, rather mitochondrial DNA phylogenies indicate that they are polyphlyetic with respect to benthic feeding cichlids of the genera Aulonocara, Alticorpus and some species of Lethrinops. Male mbuna hold territories for 18 months or more and breed year-round. All species are maternal mouthbrooders, but females do not guard free-swimming young. Mbuna are polygamous (both sexes). There is sexual dimorphism in size, colour and fin length, and many species show within-population colour polymorphism. Mbuna genera are largely differentiated on the basis of head, jaw and tooth morphology, but congeneric species are generally distinguished by male colour. Many morphologically specialized forms have broad diets and often feed on common easily obtainable resources. While it is likely that dietary and habitat niche partitioning contributes to species coexistence, this has never clearly been demonstrated under experimental conditions, Populations on spatially separated habitat patches are often genetically differentiated, probably because most species are specialized for life on rocky shores, and lack a dispersal phase in their life histories. Males seem to disperse more than females, but are able to home several kilometres back to their territories. Some closely related ecologically equivalent allopatric populations are differentiated in male colour. Those tested have been shown to mate at least partially assortatively. Sexual selection acting on male colour seems the most plausible mechanism for initial species divergence. The same colour forms seem to have arisen several times, suggesting frequent parallel evolution. The main conservation threat to mbuna at present seems to be translocation of species within the lake as a result of the aquarium trade. However, deleterious effects on indigenous populations are not documented. In the long run, sedimentation, pollution, introduction of alien species and the development of targeted food fisheries could be more serious threats.

AB Maps of interpolated climate normals have recently become essential tools for many types of forestry research, such as studying genetic adaptation of trees to local environments, modeling species ranges shifts, or forest productivity under climate change scenarios. In this paper, we evaluate two widely used climate models for British Columbia with respect to their general precision and regional bias. We discuss limitations due to the resolution of the current "state of the art" PRISM climate model and provide new methodology for "intelligent" up-sampling of the PRISM model for studies that require spatially explicit climate data. In order to stress the importance of choosing an adequate climate model and understanding its limitations, we provide two examples where baseline climate models caused misleading predictions of how the climate envelope of ecosystems shifts as a consequence of increased temperature, and how tree growth may respond to climate change.

AB Currently, slightly less than half the world's population lives in dense urban areas, principally cities. In Australia, nearly 85% of people live in towns with 1000 or more residents. Although individual species of urban flora and fauna have often been well studied, little is known of the long-term temporal patterns associated with changes in both the abiotic and biotic environments as urban systems expand. Using historical and current information, the changes in species richness (defined as the native and introduced vertebrates and vascular plants) in Adelaide, South Australia, are described from its founding in 1836 until 2002. Adelaide is an isolated city of over a million inhabitants, bordered by a range of hills and the South Australian coastline. With a Mediterranean climate, a culture that places high importance on private residential gardens, and the presence of extensive public parklands, the metropolitan area has a. significant diversity of both native and introduced flora and fauna. Using only the presence or absence of a species, the changes to plant and vertebrate species richness were quantified by analyzing the observed patterns of change at a functional group level. Powerful correlative evidence is provided to explain the development and establishment of patterns in urban ecology.
   There has been a dramatic change in species composition, with an increase in total species numbers of similar to30%. At least 132 native species of plants and animals have become locally extinct, and a minimum of 648 introduced species have arrived (mostly plants). The plants increased in species richness by 46%. Fifty percent of the native mammal species were lost, and overall, the birds declined by one species, representing 21 extinctions and 20 successful introductions. Amphibians and reptiles showed no net change. The herbaceous perennial and annual plant species richness showed a substantial increase. This temporal approach to urban ecology demonstrates new ways to identify individual species or groups at risk of extinction and provides some long-term management goals for large urban areas.

AB Responses of carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) to urbanisation were studied along an urban-suburban-rural gradient representing decreasing intensities of human disturbance. Carabids were collected by pitfall trapping during their activity period in lowland oak forest patches in the city of Debrecen, Eastern Hungary. The average number of carabid species was significantly higher in the rural and urban areas compared to the suburban one. The high overall species richness in the urban area was due to the presence of species preferring open habitats. The species richness of forest specialist carabids significantly increased along the urban-rural gradient. The overall carabid abundance was significantly higher in the rural than the other two areas. The results did not support the hypothesis that overall diversity should decrease in response to habitat disturbance. They also contradicted the intermediate disturbance hypothesis: species richness was not the highest in the moderately disturbed suburban area. In the urban area, opportunistic species dominated. The average carabid body size was significantly larger in the rural and suburban areas than in the more disturbed urban area. Multivariate methods detected changes in species composition and abundance structure along the urban-rural gradient. Significant proportion of the variation in abundance and species richness was explained by the heterogeneity of environmental variables (ground temperature, surface temperature, humidity, cover of decaying wood material, herbs, canopy layer, and by the amount of prey).

AB Aim Conservation activities have increasingly focused on issues at the level of the landscape but are constrained by limited data and knowledge relating to biodiversity at this scale. Satellite remote sensing has considerable, but under-exploited, potential as a source of information on biodiversity at the landscape level. Remote sensing has generally been used to assess biodiversity indirectly, using approaches that often fail to fully exploit the information content of the imagery and typically only with regard to the species richness component of biodiversity. The aim of this paper was to assess the potential of remote sensing as a source of information on the richness, evenness and composition of tree species in a tropical rain forest.
   Location The test site was a c. 225 km(2) region centred on the Danum Valley Field Centre, Borneo. This test site contained regions of undisturbed and differentially logged rain forest.
   Methods Data on tree biodiversity had been acquired for fifty-two sample plots by standard field survey methods and were used to derive summary indices of biodiversity for seedlings, saplings and mature trees. Differences between logged and unlogged sites were evaluated by comparison of the indices and species accumulation curves. A Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image of the site acquired close to the date of the field survey was obtained and rigorously pre-processed. Feedforward neural networks were used to derive predictions of biodiversity indices from the imagery. A Kohonen self organizing map neural network was used to ordinate the field data to derive classes of forest defined by relative similarity in species composition. The separability of the defined classes in the Landsat TM image was evaluated with a discriminant analysis.
   Results Analyses of the field data revealed considerable variation in the biodiversity of seedlings, saplings and trees at the site, associated, in part, with differences in logging activities. This variation in biodiversity was manifest in the remotely sensed data. The analyses indicated an ability to (1) predict biodiversity indices, with the highest correlation between predicted and actual index observed for evenness described by Shannon entropy (r = 0.546), but especially to (2) classify nine forest classes defined on the basis of similarity in tree species composition (accuracy 95.8%).
   Main conclusions Logging activities impacted on biodiversity and the resulting variation in biodiversity was reflected in the remotely sensed imagery. Using methods that exploit more fully the information content of the imagery than those used in other previous studies, a richer representation of biodiversity may be derived. This representation includes estimates of key summary indices of biodiversity, notably richness and evenness, as well as information on species composition. The results indicate that remotely sensed data may be used as a source of information on biodiversity at the landscape scale that may be used to inform conservation science and management.

AB The Atlantic Ocean-Mediterranean Sea junction has been proposed as an important phylogeographical area on the basis of concordance in genetic patterns observed at allozyme, mtDNA and microsatellite DNA markers in several marine species. This study presents microsatellite DNA data for a mobile invertebrate species in this area, the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, allowing comparison of this relatively new class of DNA marker with previous allozyme results, and examination of the relative effects on gene flow of the Strait of Gibraltar and the Almeria-Oran oceanographic front. Genetic variation at seven microsatellite loci screened in six samples from NE Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of the Iberian Peninsula was high (mean Na = 9.6, mean H-e = 0.725). Microsatellites detected highly significant subpopulation structuring (F-ST = 0.061; R-ST = 0.104), consistent with an isolation-by-distance model of low levels of gene flow. Distinct and significant clinal changes in allele frequencies between Atlantic and Mediterranean samples found at five out of seven loci, however indicate these results might be also consistent with an alternative model of secondary contact and introgression between previously isolated and divergent populations, as previously proposed for other marine species from the Atlantic-Mediterranean area. A pronounced 'step' change between SW Mediterranean samples associated with the Almeria-Oran front suggests this oceanographic feature may represent a contemporary barrier to gene flow.

AB Four laboratory experiments on fresh, modem diatoms collected from lakes in the Northern Great Plains of North America were carried out to assess the effects of dissolution on diatom abundance and composition. Marked differences in mean dissolution susceptibility exist between species, despite sometimes significant intra-specific variation between heterovalves. Twenty-four taxa were ranked according to susceptibility to dissolution using an exponential decay model of valve abundance. This dissolution ranking was used to derive two weighted indices of sample preservation.
   A third index (F) was based on a simple binary classification of valve morphology into dissolved and pristine categories, as distinguished by light microscopy (LM). When compared against rank indices and a measure of species diversity, this diatom dissolution index was found to be the best predictor of the progress of dissolution as estimated by total valve abundance or biogenic silica (BiSi) loss, Strong empirical relationships between F index values and diatom abundance (r(2) = 0.84, n = 32) and BiSi (r(2) = 0.89, n = 32) were developed and applied to a diatom sequence from a short core from Devils Lake, North Dakota, and compared to diatom-inferred and observed salinity at this site.
   The F index is a simple, effective diagnostic tool to assess important aspects of diatom preservation. The index can provide insight into Si cycling and record changes in conditions pertinent to diatom dissolution, and has a role in validation of transfer functions or other inferences derived from compositional data.

AB 1 Nothofagus pumilio forms an abrupt alpine timberline (AT) at 690 m a.s.l on Balseiro mountain, 54 degrees S, Tierra del Fuego, Chile. Fruit and seed rain (quantity and quality), emergence, density and survival of seedlings were studied across an altitudinal gradient (450-740 m) from within the forest to above the AT.
   2 Fruit rain generally declined with altitude but increased between 630 and 690 m before falling sharply beyond the AT. The proportion of seed-bearing fruits, seed viability and seed mass also declined with increasing altitude, but showed no recovery in the vicinity of the AT.
   3 Fruit rain decreased exponentially with distance into the alpine zone, so that effective dispersal rarely exceeded 20 m beyond the AT and few of these fruits contained seeds.
   4 Seedling emergence and density decreased with altitude both within the forest and into the alpine zone so that seedlings were found no more than 10-20 m above the AT. Even in 1996, when fruit production was high, successful seedling recruitment was limited to lower altitudes.
   5 There was little correlation between altitude and the percentage survival of naturally occurring seedlings within the forest. However, transplanted seedlings survived better at the AT itself than immediately inside the forest, and showed high mortality in the alpine zone.
   6 The most severe bottlenecks for tree recruitment within the forest appeared to be seedling emergence and seed production. Above the AT, seed viability and emergence were the principal bottlenecks.
   7 Although not all demographic variables declined altitudinally, the overall probability of adult establishment decreased with increasing altitude and became very low once the protection by the tree canopy became unavailable. A demographic model explaining the origin and abrupt character of the AT studied is presented.

AB Using the theory and methods of non-linear dynamics, I explore the consequences of cooperation on the size and dynamics of social groups. I present a model that incorporates into a discrete growth equation a positive density-dependent factor to represent the synergistic effects of cooperation. Analysis of this model shows that, by increasing the net reproductive output of group-living organisms, cooperation could either stabilize or destabilize the dynamics of a social group. At one end of the spectrum, group-living and cooperation could make persistence possible under harsh demographic or ecological conditions. At the other end of the spectrum, in populations already organized in social groups, cooperation could lead to more highly integrated social groups that are subject to a boom-and-bust pattern of growth. When groups last for multiple generations, such a pattern could take the form of periodic or chaotic dynamics. It is suggested that dynamical instability could result in rates of group turnover large enough for selection among the highly integrated social groups to take over as the primary evolutionary force. Consideration of the dynamical effects of cooperation, therefore, may shed light both on the ecological and demographic conditions leading to the origin and maintenance of group-living as well as on the forces responsible for shaping the diversity of animal societies.

ID ORDINATION
AB Traditionally, ecological survey relies upon the intuitive interpretation of habitat patterns in the held. The statistical stratification developed for regional survey by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE) is designed to minimise personal judgement in sample site location. The environmental strata within the classification are recognisable and give confidence to users from a variety of backgrounds. The methodology originated in the 1960s when multivariate statistics were developed and applied to ecological data. Initially, Great Britain (GB) was classified from environmental data recorded from 1200 out of the 240 000 km(2) of the National Grid. Logistic discrimination and discriminant functions were used to assign the remaining squares to original classes and to reassign the original squares. The final classes differed slightly from the initial divisions because the allocations use different data sets and different techniques. Field surveys of ecological parameters have been used to provide independent data for testing the classification, to characterise the classes and to provide national estimates of land coverage. The statistical rationale behind the methodology is described and the relevance of the experience gained during the development is discussed in relation to future work. Finally, applications of the classification are described demonstrating its use as a framework in a variety of ecological studies. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

AB Dropping counts were used to assess elephant abundance in the remote forests of northeastern Gabon where there are few people and no logging. Elephants prefer the secondary forest which grows on abandoned villages and plantations, but avoid roads and villages. Thus elephant distribution is governed by the distribution of both past and present human settlement, even in the remotest and least disturbed forests of equatorial Africa.

AB Biological invasions present a global problem underlain by an ecological paradox that thwarts explanation: how do some exotic species, evolutionarily naive to their new environments, outperform locally adapted natives? We propose that community assembly theory provides a framework for addressing this question. Local community assembly rules can be defined by evaluating how native species' traits interact with community filters to affect species abundance. Evaluation of exotic species against this benchmark indicates that exotics that follow assembly rules behave like natives, while those exhibiting novel interactions with community filters can greatly underperform or outperform natives. Additionally, advantages gained by exotics over natives following disturbance can be explained by accounting for extrinsic assembly processes that bias exotic traits toward ruderal strategies.

AB Understanding social-ecological systems (SES) is crucial to supporting the sustainable management of resources. Agent-based modelling is a valuable tool to achieve this because it can represent the behaviour and interactions of organisms, human actors and institutions. Agent-based models (ABMs) have therefore already been widely used to study SES. However, ABMs of SES are by their very nature complex. They are therefore difficult to parameterize and analyse, which can limit their usefulness. It is time to critically reflect upon the current state-of-the-art to evaluate to what degree the potential of agent-based modelling for gaining general insights and supporting specific decision-making has already been utilized. We reviewed achievements and challenges by building upon developments in good modelling practice in the field of ecological modelling with its longer history. As a reference, we used the TRACE framework, which encompasses elements of model development, testing and analysis. We firstly reviewed achievements and challenges with regard to the elements of the TRACE framework addressed in reviews and method papers of social-ecological ABMs. Secondly, in a mini-review, we evaluated whether and to what degree the elements of the TRACE framework were addressed in publications on specific ABMs. We identified substantial gaps with regard to ( 1) communicating whether the models represented real systems well enough for their intended purpose and ( 2) analysing the models in a systematic and transparent way so that model output is not only observed but also understood. To fill these gaps, a joint effort of the modelling community is needed to foster the advancement and use of strategies such as participatory approaches, standard protocols for communication, sharing of source code, and tools and strategies for model design and analysis. Throughout our analyses, we provide specific recommendations and references for improving the state-of-the-art. We thereby hope to contribute to the establishment of a new advanced culture of agent-based modelling of SES that will allow us to better develop general theory and practical solutions.

AB Although several studies have examined the functional diversity of freshwater macroinvertebrates, the variety of methodologies combined with the absence of a synthetic review make our understanding of this field incomplete. Therefore, we reviewed the current methodology for assessing functional diversity in freshwater macroinvertebrate research. Our review showed that most papers quantified functional diversity using biological traits, among which feeding habits were the most common traits probably due to the assumed links between feeding and ecosystem functions. A large number of diversity measures have been applied for quantifying functional diversity of freshwater macroinvertebrate assemblages, among which Rao's quadratic entropy looks like the most frequent. In most papers, functional diversity was positively related to taxon richness, and functional redundancy was a key concept in explaining this correlation. Most studies detected strong influence of the environmental factors as well as human impact on functional diversity. Finally, our review revealed that functional diversity research is biased towards European running waters and is hindered by yet insufficient information on the autecology of macroinvertebrates.

TI Was there a Ferguson Effect on crime rates in large US cities?
SO JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE

ID VIOLENT CRIME; POLICE; LEGITIMACY
AB Purpose: There has been widespread speculation that the events surrounding the shooting death of an unarmed young black man by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri-and a string of similar incidents across the country-have led to increases in crime in the United States. This study tested for the "Ferguson Effect" on crime rates in large U.S. cities.
   Methods: Aggregate and disaggregate monthly Part I criminal offense data were gathered 12 months before and after August 2014 from police department data requests and websites in 81 large U.S. cities. The exogenous shock of Ferguson was examined using a discontinuous growth model to determine if there was a redirection in seasonality-adjusted crime trends in the months following the Ferguson shooting.
   Results: No evidence was found to support a systematic post-Ferguson change in overall, violent, and property crime trends; however, the disaggregated analyses revealed that robbery rates, declining before Ferguson, increased in the months after Ferguson. Also, there was much greater variation in crime trends in the post Ferguson era, and select cities did experience increases in homicide. Overall, any Ferguson Effect is constrained largely to cities with historically high levels of violence, a large composition of black residents, and socioeconomic disadvantages.
   Conclusions: The national discourse surrounding the "Ferguson Effect" is long on anecdotes and short on data, leaving criminologists largely on the sidelines of a conversation concerning one of the most prominent contemporary issues in criminal justice. Our findings are largely consistent with longstanding criminological knowledge that changes in crime trends are slow and rarely a product of random shocks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cities are growing rapidly, thereby expected to cause a large-scale global biotic homogenization. Evidence for the homogenization hypothesis is mostly derived from plants and birds, whereas arthropods have so far been neglected. Here, I tested the homogenization hypothesis with three insect indicator groups, namely true bugs, leafhoppers, and beetles. In particular, I was interested whether insect species community composition differs between urban and rural areas, whether they are more similar between cities than between rural areas, and whether the found pattern is explained by true species turnover, species diversity gradients and geographic distance, by non-native or specialist species, respectively. I analyzed insect species communities sampled on birch trees in a total of six Swiss cities and six rural areas nearby. In all indicator groups, urban and rural community composition was significantly dissimilar due to native species turnover. Further, for bug and leafhopper communities, I found evidence for large-scale homogenization due to urbanization, which was driven by reduced species turnover of specialist species in cities. Species turnover of beetle communities was similar between cities and rural areas. Interestingly, when specialist species of beetles were excluded from the analyses, cities were more dissimilar than rural areas, suggesting biotic differentiation of beetle communities in cities. Non-native species did not affect species turnover of the insect groups. However, given non-native arthropod species are increasing rapidly, their homogenizing effect might be detected more often in future. Overall, the results show that urbanization has a negative large-scale impact on the diversity specialist species of the investigated insect groups. Specific measures in cities targeted at increasing the persistence of specialist species typical for the respective biogeographic region could help to stop the loss of biodiversity.

AB Understanding the relationships between trait diversity, species diversity and ecosystem functioning is essential for sustainable management. For functions comprising two trophic levels, trait matching between interacting partners should also drive functioning. However, the predictive ability of trait diversity and matching is unclear for most functions, particularly for crop pollination, where interacting partners did not necessarily co-evolve. World-wide, we collected data on traits of flower visitors and crops, visitation rates to crop flowers per insect species and fruit set in 469 fields of 33 crop systems. Through hierarchical mixed-effects models, we tested whether flower visitor trait diversity and/or trait matching between flower visitors and crops improve the prediction of crop fruit set (functioning) beyond flower visitor species diversity and abundance. Flower visitor trait diversity was positively related to fruit set, but surprisingly did not explain more variation than flower visitor species diversity. The best prediction of fruit set was obtained by matching traits of flower visitors (body size and mouthpart length) and crops (nectar accessibility of flowers) in addition to flower visitor abundance, species richness and species evenness. Fruit set increased with species richness, and more so in assemblages with high evenness, indicating that additional species of flower visitors contribute more to crop pollination when species abundances are similar.Synthesis and applications. Despite contrasting floral traits for crops world-wide, only the abundance of a few pollinator species is commonly managed for greater yield. Our results suggest that the identification and enhancement of pollinator species with traits matching those of the focal crop, as well as the enhancement of pollinator richness and evenness, will increase crop yield beyond current practices. Furthermore, we show that field practitioners can predict and manage agroecosystems for pollination services based on knowledge of just a few traits that are known for a wide range of flower visitor species.

AB Biodiversity is globally recognised as a cornerstone of healthy ecosystems, and biodiversity conservation is increasingly becoming one of the important aims of environmental management. Evaluating the trade-offs of alternative management strategies requires quantitative estimates of the costs and benefits of their outcomes, including the value of biodiversity lost or preserved. This paper takes a decision-analytic standpoint, and reviews and discusses the alternative aspects of biodiversity valuation by dividing them into three categories: socio-cultural, economic, and ecological indicator approaches. We discuss the interplay between these three perspectives and suggest integrating them into an ecosystem-based management (EBM) framework, which permits us to acknowledge ecological systems as a rich mixture of interactive elements along with their social and economic aspects. In this holistic framework, socio-cultural preferences can serve as a tool to identify the ecosystem services most relevant to society, whereas monetary valuation offers more globally comparative and understandable values. Biodiversity indicators provide clear quantitative measures and information about the role of biodiversity in the functioning and health of ecosystems. In the multi-objective EBM approach proposed in the paper, biodiversity indicators serve to define threshold values (i.e., the minimum level required to maintain a healthy environment). An appropriate set of decision-making criteria and the best method for conducting the decision analysis depend on the context and the management problem in question. Therefore, we propose a sequence of steps to follow when quantitatively evaluating environmental management against biodiversity. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Mountains are often more species-rich than lowlands. This could be the result of migration from lowlands to mountains, of a greater survival rate in mountains, or of a higher diversification rate in mountains. We investigated this question in the globally distributed family Ericaceae, which includes c. 4426 species ranging from sea level to >5000m. We predict that the interaction of low specific leaf area (SLA) and montane habitats is correlated with increased diversification rates. A molecular phylogeny of Ericaceae based on rbcL and matK sequence data was built and dated with 18 fossil calibrations and divergence time estimates. We identified radiations using bamm and correlates of diversification rate changes using binary-state speciation and extinction (BiSSE) and multiple-state speciation and extinction (MuSSE) analyses. Analyses revealed six largely montane radiations. Lineages in mountains diversified faster than nonmountain lineages (higher speciation rate, but no difference in extinction rate), and lineages with low SLA diversified faster than high-SLA lineages. Further, habitat and trait had a positive interactive effect on diversification. Our results suggest that the species richness in mountains is the result of increased speciation rather than reduced extinction or increased immigration. Increased speciation in Ericaceae was facilitated by low SLA.

AB An increase in species richness with decreasing latitude is a prominent pattern in nature. However, it remains unclear whether there are corresponding latitudinal gradients in the properties of ecological interaction networks. We investigated the structure of 216 quantitative antagonistic networks comprising insect hosts and their parasitoids, drawn from 28 studies from the High Arctic to the tropics. Key metrics of network structure were strongly affected by the size of the interaction matrix (i.e. the total number of interactions documented between individuals) and by the taxonomic diversity of the host taxa involved. After controlling for these sampling effects, quantitative networks showed no consistent structural patterns across latitude and host guilds, suggesting that there may be basic rules for how sets of antagonists interact with resource species. Furthermore, the strong association between network size and structure implies that many apparent spatial and temporal variations in network structure may prove to be artefacts.

AB An accurate understanding of species diversity is essential to studies across a wide range of biological subdisciplines. However, delimiting species remains challenging in evolutionary radiations where morphological diversification is rapid and accompanied by little genetic differentiation or when genetic lineage divergence is not accompanied by morphological change. We investigate the utility of a variety of recently developed approaches to examine genetic and morphological diversity, and delimit species in a morphologically conserved group of Southeast Asian lizards. We find that species diversity is vastly underestimated in this unique evolutionary radiation, and find an extreme case where extensive genetic divergence among lineages has been accompanied by little to no differentiation in external morphology. Although we note that different conclusions can be drawn when species are delimited using molecular phylogenetics, coalescent-based methods, or morphological data, it is clear that the use of a pluralistic approach leads to a more comprehensive appraisal of biodiversity, and greater appreciation for processes of diversification in this biologically important geographic region. Similarly, our approach demonstrates how recently developed methodologies can be used to obtain robust estimates of species limits in nonadaptive or cryptic evolutionary radiations.

AB 1. Because many large mammal species have wide geographical ranges, spatially distant populations may be confronted with different sets of environmental conditions. Investigating how home range (HR) size varies across environmental gradients should yield a better understanding of the factors affecting large mammal ecology. We evaluated how HR size of a large herbivore, the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), varies in relation to seasonality, latitude (climate), weather, plant productivity and landscape features across its geographical range in Western Europe. As roe deer are income breeders, expected to adjust HR size continuously to temporal variation in food resources and energetic requirements, our baseline prediction was for HR size to decrease with proxies of resource availability. We used GPS locations of roe deer collected from seven study sites (EURODEER collaborative project) to estimate fixed-kernel HR size at weekly and monthly temporal scales. We performed an unusually comprehensive analysis of variation in HR size among and within populations over time across the geographical range of a single species using generalized additive mixed models and linear mixed models, respectively. Among populations, HR size decreased with increasing values for proxies of forage abundance, but increased with increases in seasonality, stochastic variation of temperature, latitude and snow cover. Within populations, roe deer HR size varied over time in relation to seasonality and proxies of forage abundance in a consistent way across the seven populations. Thus, our findings were broadly consistent across the distributional range of this species, demonstrating a strong and ubiquitous link between the amplitude and timing of environmental seasonality and HR size at the continental scale. Overall, the variability in average HR size of roe deer across Europe reflects the interaction among local weather, climate and seasonality, providing valuable insight into the limiting factors affecting this large herbivore under contrasting conditions. The complexity of the relationships suggests that predicting ranging behaviour of large herbivores in relation to current and future climate change will require detailed knowledge not only about predicted increases in temperature, but also how this interacts with factors such as day length and climate predictability.

AB Habitat filtering (HF, trait convergence) and niche differentiation (ND, trait divergence) are known to impact upon plant community structure. Both processes integrate individual responses to the abiotic environment and biotic interactions. Thus, it is difficult to clearly identify the underlying abiotic and biotic factors that ultimately impact community structure by looking at community-level patterns of trait divergence or convergence alone. We used a functional trait-based and multiscale approach to assess how biotic interactions and aridity determine the functional structure of semi-arid shrublands sampled along a large aridity gradient in Spain. At the regional scale, we investigated functional differences among species (axes of specialization) to identify important traits for community assembly. At the community scale, we evaluated the relative impact of HF and ND on community structure using a null model approach. Finally, at the plant neighbourhood scale, we evaluated the impact of biotic interactions on community structure by investigating the spatial patterns of trait aggregation. The shrub species surveyed can be separated along four axes of specialization based on their above-ground architecture and leaf morphology. Our community scale analysis suggested that the functional structure of semi-arid communities was clearly non-random, HF and ND acting independently on different traits to determine community structure along the aridity gradient. At the plant neighbourhood scale, the spatial distribution of species was also clearly not random, suggesting that competition and facilitation impacted on the observed changes in the functional diversity of shrubland communities along the aridity gradient. Synthesis: Our results demonstrated that HF and ND acted simultaneously on independent traits to jointly determine community structure. Most importantly, our multiscale approach suggested that competition and facilitation interplayed with aridity to determine this structure. Competition appeared to be constant along the aridity gradient and explained the high functional diversity observed in semi-arid shrublands. Facilitation affected subordinate and rare species and, thus, may act to enhance the biodiversity of these ecosystems. Finally, the framework employed in our study allows moving forward from the examination of patterns to the development of mechanistic trait-based approaches to study plant community assembly.

AB MOD17A2 provides operational gross primary production (GPP) data globally at 1 km spatial resolution and 8-day temporal resolution. MOD17A2 estimates GPP according to the light use efficiency (LUE) concept assuming a fixed maximum rate of carbon assimilation per unit photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the vegetation (epsilon(max)). Minimum temperature and vapor pressure deficit derived from meteorological data down-regulate epsilon(max) and constrain carbon assimilation. This data is useful for regional to global studies of the terrestrial carbon budget, climate change and natural resources. In this study we evaluated the MOD17A2 product and its driver data by using in situ measurements of meteorology and eddy covariance GPP for 12 African sites. MOD17A2 agreed well with eddy covariance GPP for wet sites. Overall, seasonality was well captured but MOD17A2 GPP was underestimated for the dry sites located in the Sahel region. Replacing the meteorological driver data derived from coarse resolution reanalysis data with tower measurements reduced MOD17A2 GPP uncertainties, however, the underestimations at the dry sites persisted. Inferred epsilon(max) calculated from tower data was higher than the epsilon(max) prescribed in MOD17A2. This, in addition to uncertainties in fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) explains some of the underestimations. The results suggest that improved quality of driver data, but primarily a readjustment of the parameters in the biome parameter look-up table (BPLUT) may be needed to better estimate GPP for African ecosystems in MOD17A2.

AB Climate change is affecting biodiversity worldwide, but conservation responses are constrained by considerable uncertainty regarding the magnitude, rate and ecological consequences of expected climate change. Here we propose a framework to account for several sources of uncertainty in conservation prioritization. Within this framework we account for uncertainties arising from (i) species distributions that shift following climate change, (ii) basic connectivity requirements of species, (iii) alternative climate change scenarios and their impacts, (iv) in the modelling of species distributions, and (v) different levels of confidence about present and future. When future impacts of climate change are uncertain, robustness of decision-making can be improved by quantifying the risks and trade-offs associated with climate scenarios. Sensible prioritization that accounts simultaneously for the present and potential future distributions of species is achievable without overly jeopardising present-day conservation values. Doing so requires systematic treatment of uncertainties and testing of the sensitivity of results to assumptions about climate. We illustrate the proposed framework by identifying priority areas for amphibians and reptiles in Europe.

AB Flexibility in biological systems is seen as an important driver of macro-ecosystem function and stability. Spatially constrained endosymbiotic settings, however, are less studied, although environmental thresholds of symbiotic corals are linked to the function of their endosymbiotic dinoflagellate communities. Symbiotic flexibility is a hypothesized mechanism that corals may exploit to adapt to climate change. This study explores the flexibility of the coral-Symbiodinium symbiosis through quantification of Symbiodinium ITS2 sequence assemblages in a range of coral species and genera. Sequence assemblages are expressed as an index of flexibility incorporating phylogenetic divergence and relative abundance of Symbiodinium sequences recovered from the host. This comparative analysis reveals profound differences in the flexibility of corals for Symbiodinium, thereby classifying corals as generalists or specifists. Generalists such as Acropora and Pocillopora exhibit high intra- and inter-species flexibility in their Symbiodinium assemblages and are some of the most environmentally sensitive corals. Conversely, specifists such as massive Porites colonies exhibit low flexibility, harbour taxonomically narrow Symbiodinium assemblages, and are environmentally resistant corals. Collectively, these findings challenge the paradigm that symbiotic flexibility enhances holobiont resilience. This underscores the need for a deeper examination of the extent and duration of the functional benefits associated with endosymbiotic diversity and flexibility under environmental stress.

AB Ecological corridors are landscape elements that prevent the negative effects of fragmentation. However, their effectiveness has never been clearly validated in urban landscapes.
   We analysed the role of green corridors in an urban context by comparing metacommunities of arthropods in (i) woodlots considered as sources of species, (ii) woody corridors and domestic gardens that are (iii) connected (CG) or (iv) disconnected to corridors (DG) and taking into account the connectivity of the matrix. We trapped 3 taxa of arthropods - spiders, carabids and staphylinids - because they are sensitive to fragmentation but with different dispersal capabilities. We analysed their species richness, abundance and taxonomic and functional composition.
   For the 3 taxa, the taxonomic and functional compositions of communities in CG were closer to those of the corridor and the source than those of DG. Woodland species were associated with source, corridor and CG. A lower abundance in DG was revealed for staphylinids and spiders. Lower species richness in DG was observed for staphylinids.
   The differences between taxa could be explained by the dispersal capabilities of the species and by their various responses to landscape structures. For carabids, processes at a wider scale could be responsible for their rarity in sources and, consequently, in gardens. For spiders, the colonisation from other sources could explain the high species richness found in disconnected gardens. Our results suggest that the role of corridors is crucial for enhancing biodiversity in green spaces such as domestic gardens.
   Our results clarify the effectiveness of corridors in urban landscapes and have direct implications for the ecological management of cities. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We analysed concentrations of starch, sucrose, glucose and fructose in upper branch wood, foliage and trunk sapwood of Douglas-fir trees in height classes ranging from similar to 2 to similar to 57 m. Mean concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) for all tissues were highest in the tallest height class and lowest in the lowest height class, and height-related trends in NSC were most pronounced in branches. Throughout a 17-month sampling period, mean values of branch NSC from the 57 m trees ranged between 30 and 377% greater than the 2 m trees. Branch NSC was inversely correlated with midday shoot water potential (psi(I)), shoot osmotic potential at full turgor (Psi(pi)) and shoot extension. Temporal fluctuation in branch NSC was inversely correlated with height, and positively correlated with midday Psi(I), Psi(pi) and shoot extension. The positive correlation between height and storage of NSC, and the negative correlation between NSC storage and shoot extension provide evidence that size-related growth decline in trees is not strongly associated with constraints on photosynthesis. The negative correlation between height and fluctuation in NSC suggests that mobilization of photosynthate in taller trees is constrained by some factor such as reductions in turgor-driven cell expansion or constraints on phloem transport.

AB 1. Demographic tactics within animal populations are shaped by selective pressures. Exploitation exerts additional pressures so that differing demographic tactics might be expected among populations with differences in levels of exploitation. Yet little has been done so far to assess the possible consequences of exploitation on the demographic tactics of mammals, even though such information could influence the choice of effective management strategies.
   2. Compared with similar-sized ungulate species, wild boar Sus scrofa has high reproductive capabilities, which complicates population management. Using a perturbation analysis, we investigated how population growth rates (lambda) and critical life-history stages differed between two wild boar populations monitored for several years, one of which was heavily harvested and the other lightly harvested.
   3. Asymptotic lambda was 1 242 in the lightly hunted population and 1 115 in the heavily hunted population, while the ratio between the elasticity of adult survival and juvenile survival was 2 63 and 1 27, respectively. A comparative analysis including 21 other ungulate species showed that the elasticity ratio in the heavily hunted population was the lowest ever observed.
   4. Compared with expected generation times of similar-sized ungulates (more than 6 years), wild boar has a fast life-history speed, especially when facing high hunting pressure. This is well illustrated by our results, where generation times were 3 6 years in the lightly hunted population and only 2 3 years in the heavily hunted population. High human-induced mortality combined with non-limiting food resources accounted for the accelerated life history of the hunted population because of earlier reproduction.
   5. Synthesis and applications. For wild boar, we show that when a population is facing a high hunting pressure, increasing the mortality in only one age-class (e. g. adults or juveniles) may not allow managers to limit population growth. We suggest that simulations of management strategies based on context-specific demographic models are useful for selecting interventions for population control. This type of approach allows the assessment of population response to exploitation by considering a range of plausible scenarios, improving the chance of selecting appropriate management actions.

AB The seasonal and annual variability of sensible heat flux (H), latent heat flux (LE), evapotranspiration (ET), crop coefficient (K-c) and crop water productivity (WPET) were investigated under two different rice environments, flooded and aerobic soil conditions, using the eddy covariance (EC) technique during 2008-2009 cropping periods. Since we had only one EC system for monitoring two rice environments, we had to move the system from one location to the other every week. In total, we had to gap-fill an average of 50-60% of the missing weekly data as well as those values rejected by the quality control tests in each rice field in all four cropping seasons. Although the EC method provides a direct measurement of LE, which is the energy used for ET, we needed to correct the values of H and LE to close the energy balance using the Bowen ratio closure method before we used LE to estimate ET. On average, the energy balance closure before correction was 0.72 +/- 0.06 and it increased to 0.99 +/- 0.01 after correction. The Gin both flooded and aerobic fields was very low. Likewise, the energy involved in miscellaneous processes such as photosynthesis, respiration and heat storage in the rice canopy was not taken into consideration.
   Average for four cropping seasons, flooded rice fields had 19% more LE than aerobic fields whereas aerobic rice fields had 45% more H than flooded fields. This resulted in a lower Bowen ratio in flooded fields (0.14 +/- 0.03) than in aerobic fields (0.24 +/- 0.01). For our study sites, evapotranspiration was primarily controlled by net radiation. The aerobic rice fields had lower growing season ET rates (3.81 +/- 0.21 mm d(-1)) than the flooded rice fields (4.29 +/- 0.23 mm d(-1)), most probably due to the absence of ponded water and lower leaf area index of aerobic rice. Likewise, the crop coefficient, K-c, of aerobic rice was significantly lower than that of flooded rice. For aerobic rice, K-c values were 0.95 +/- 0.01 for the vegetative stage, 1.00 +/- 0.01 for the reproductive stage, 0.97 +/- 0.04 for the ripening stage and 0.88 +/- 0.03 for the fallow period, whereas, for flooded rice, K-c values were 1.04 +/- 0.04 for the vegetative stage, 1.11 +/- 0.05 for the reproductive stage, 1.04 +/- 0.05 for the ripening stage and 0.93 +/- 0.06 for the fallow period. The average annual ET was 1301 mm for aerobic rice and 1440 mm for flooded rice. This corresponds to about 11% lower total evapotranspiration in aerobic fields than in flooded fields. However, the crop water productivity (WPET) of aerobic rice (0.42 +/- 0.03 g grain kg(-1) water) was significantly lower than that of flooded rice (1.26 +/- 0.26 g grain kg(-1) water) because the grain yields of aerobic rice were very low since they were subjected to water stress.
   The results of this investigation showed significant differences in energy balance and evapotranspiration between flooded and aerobic rice ecosystems. Aerobic rice is one of the promising water-saving technologies being developed to lower the water requirements of the rice crop to address the issues of water scarcity. This information should be taken into consideration in evaluating alternative water-saving technologies for environmentally sustainable rice production systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB There is growing evidence that the reproductive schedules of female mammals can be affected by conditions experienced during early development, with low parental investment leading to accelerated life-history strategies in the offspring. In humans, the relationships between early-life conditions and timing of puberty are well studied, but much less attention has been paid to reproductive behaviour. Here, we investigate associations between early-life conditions and age at first pregnancy (AFP) in a large, longitudinally studied cohort of British women (n = 4553). Low birthweight for gestational age, short duration of breastfeeding, separation from mother in childhood, frequent family residential moves and lack of paternal involvement are all independently associated with earlier first pregnancy. Apart from that of birthweight, the effects are robust to adjustment for family socioeconomic position (SEP) and the cohort member's mother's age at her birth. The association between childhood SEP and AFP is partially mediated by early-life conditions, and the association between early-life conditions and AFP is partially mediated by emotional and behavioural problems in childhood. The overall relationship between early-life adversities and AFP appears to be approximately additive.

AB Aim
   The scale dependence of many ecological patterns and processes implies that general inference is reliant on obtaining scale-response curves over a large range of grains. Although environmental correlates of richness have been widely studied, comparisons among groups have usually been applied at single grains. Moreover, the relevance of environment-richness associations to fine-grain assemblages has remained surprisingly unclear. We present a first global cross-scale assessment of environment-richness associations for birds, mammals and amphibians from 2000 km down to c. 20 km.
   Location
   World-wide.
   Methods
   We performed an extensive survey of the literature for well-sampled terrestrial vertebrate inventories over clearly defined small extents. Coarser grain richness was estimated from the intersection of extent-of-occurrence range maps with concentric equal-distance circles around fine-grain assemblage location centroids. General linear and simultaneous autoregressive models were used to relate richness at the different grains to environmental correlates.
   Results
   The ability of environmental variables to explain species richness decreases markedly toward finer grains and is lowest for fine-grained assemblages. A prominent transition in importance occurs between productivity and temperature at increased grains, which is consistent with the role of energy affecting regional, but not local, richness. Variation in fine-grained predictability across groups is associated with their purported grain of space use, i.e. highest for amphibians and narrow-ranged and small-bodied species.
   Main conclusions
   We extend the global documentation of environment-richness associations to fine-grained assemblages. The relationship between fine-grained predictability of a group and its ecological characteristics lends empirical support to the idea that variation in species fine-grained space use may scale up to explain coarse-grained diversity patterns. Our study exposes a dramatic and taxonomically variable scale dependence of environment-richness associations and suggests that environmental correlates of richness may hold limited information at the level of communities.

AB P>1. Interactions among plants and their consumers, pollinators and dispersers are central to evolutionary theory, but interactions among plants themselves have received much less attention. Thus focusing more attention on the evolutionary role of plant-plant interactions may provide greater insight into the processes that organize communities.
   2. Here, we integrate divergent themes in the literature in an effort to provide a synthesis of empirical evidence and ideas about how plant interactions may affect evolution and how evolution may affect plant interactions.
   3. First, we discuss the idea of niche partitioning evolving through competitive interactions among plants, the idea of niche construction evolving through facilitative interactions, and the connections between these ideas and more recent research on diversity and ecosystem function and trait-based community organization.
   4. We then review how a history of coexistence within a region might affect competitive outcomes and explore the mechanisms by which plants exert selective forces on each other. Next, we consider recent research on invasions suggesting that plant interactions can reflect regional evolutionary trajectories. Finally, we place these lines of research into the context of extended phenotypes and the geographic mosaic of co-evolution.
   5. Synthesis. Our synthesis of separate lines of inquiry is a step towards understanding the evolutionary importance of interactions among plants, and suggests that the evolutionary consequences of interactions contribute to communities that are more than assemblages of independent populations.

AB Background: One of the most significant consequences of contemporary global change is the rapid decline of biodiversity in many ecosystems. Knowledge of the consequences of biodiversity loss in terrestrial ecosystems is largely restricted to single ecosystem functions. Impacts of key plant functional groups on soil biota are considered to be more important than those of plant diversity; however, current knowledge mainly relies on short-term experiments.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied changes in the impacts of plant diversity and presence of key functional groups on soil biota by investigating the performance of soil microorganisms and soil fauna two, four and six years after the establishment of model grasslands. The results indicate that temporal changes of plant community effects depend on the trophic affiliation of soil animals: plant diversity effects on decomposers only occurred after six years, changed little in herbivores, but occurred in predators after two years. The results suggest that plant diversity, in terms of species and functional group richness, is the most important plant community property affecting soil biota, exceeding the relevance of plant above-and belowground productivity and the presence of key plant functional groups, i.e. grasses and legumes, with the relevance of the latter decreasing in time.
   Conclusions/Significance: Plant diversity effects on biota are not only due to the presence of key plant functional groups or plant productivity highlighting the importance of diverse and high-quality plant derived resources, and supporting the validity of the singular hypothesis for soil biota. Our results demonstrate that in the long term plant diversity essentially drives the performance of soil biota questioning the paradigm that belowground communities are not affected by plant diversity and reinforcing the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem functioning.

AB Freshwater fish diversity is shaped by phylogenetic constraints acting on related taxa and biogeographic constraints operating on regional species pools. In the present study, we use a trait-based approach to examine taxonomic and biogeographic patterns of life history diversity of freshwater fishes in North America (exclusive of Mexico). Multivariate analysis revealed strong support for a tri-lateral continuum model with three end-point strategies defining the equilibrium (low fecundity, high juvenile survivorship), opportunistic (early maturation, low juvenile survivorship), and periodic (late maturation, high fecundity, low juvenile survivorship) life histories. Trait composition and diversity varied greatly between and within major families. Finally, we used occurrence data for large watersheds (n = 350) throughout the United States and Canada to examine geographic patterns of life history variation. Distinct patterns of life history strategies were discernible and deemed congruent with biogeographic processes and selection pressures acting on life history strategies of freshwater fishes throughout North America.

AB P>Grazing occurs over a third of the earth's land surface and may potentially influence the storage of 109 Mg year-1 of greenhouse gases as soil C. Displacement of native herbivores by high densities of livestock has often led to overgrazing and soil C loss. However, it remains unknown whether matching livestock densities to those of native herbivores can yield equivalent soil C sequestration. In the Trans-Himalayas we found that, despite comparable grazing intensities, watersheds converted to pastoralism had 49% lower soil C than watersheds which retain native herbivores. Experimental grazer-exclusion within each watershed type, show that this difference appears to be driven by indirect effects of livestock diet selection, leading to vegetation shifts that lower plant production and reduce likely soil C inputs from vegetation by c. 25 gC m-2 year-1. Our results suggest that while accounting for direct impacts (stocking density) is a major step, managing indirect impacts on vegetation composition are equally important in influencing soil C sequestration in grazing ecosystems.

AB Sound plays an important role in the life of many animals, including many bird species. Typically, male birds sing to defend a territory and to attract mates. Ambient noise may negatively affect the signal efficiency of their songs, which may be critical to reproductive success. Consequently, anthropogenic noise may be detrimental to individual birds and to populations in cities and along highways. Several bird species that are still common in urban areas have been shown to sing at higher frequency at locations where there is more low-frequency traffic noise. Here we show that chiffchaffs along noisy highways also sing with a higher minimum frequency than chiffchaffs nearby at a quiet riverside. Furthermore, through experimental exposure to highway noise we show that these birds are capable of making such adjustments over a very short time scale. The first 10 songs sung during the noise exposure revealed an immediate shift to higher frequencies, with a return to pre-exposure levels in recordings without noise the following day. In a transmission re-recording experiment we tested the impact of a potential measurement artifact by recording playback of the same songs repeatedly under different controlled noise conditions. We found an upward shift in the minimum frequency measurement associated with more noisy recordings of the same song, but this artifact was not of a scale that it could explain the noise-dependent spectral shifts in chiffchaffs.

AB The positive relationship between a species' geographic distribution and its abundance is one of ecology's most well-documented patterns, yet the causes behind this relationship remain unclear. Although many hypotheses have been proposed to account for distribution-abundance relationships, none have attained unequivocal support. Accordingly, the positive association in distribution-abundance relationships is generally considered to be due to a combination of these proposed mechanisms acting in concert. In this review, we suggest that much of the disparity between these hypotheses stems from differences in terminology and ecological point of view. Realizing and accounting for these differences facilitates integration, so that the relative contributions of each mechanism may be evaluated. Here, we review all the mechanisms that have been proposed to account for distribution-abundance relationships, in a framework that facilitates a comparison between them. We identify and discuss the central factors governing the individual mechanisms, and elucidate their effect on empirical patterns.

AB Early developmental experiences, such as incubation conditions, can have important consequences for post-hatching fitness in birds. Although the effects of incubation temperature on phenotype of avian hatchlings are poorly understood, recent research suggests that subtle changes in incubation conditions can influence hatchling characteristics, including body size and condition. We designed an experiment to explore the effects of incubation temperature on hatching success, survival to 9 days post hatch, growth and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in wood ducks (Aix sponsa). Wood duck eggs were collected from nest boxes and experimentally incubated at three temperatures (35.0, 35.9 and 37.0 degrees C), each falling within the range of temperatures of naturally incubated wood duck nests. Survival and growth were monitored in ducklings fed ad libitum for 9 days post hatch. In addition, baseline and stress-induced plasma corticosterone concentrations were measured in 2 and 9 day old ducklings. Hatching success and survival to 9 days was greatest in ducks incubated at the intermediate temperature. Ducklings incubated at 35.9 degrees C and 37.0 degrees C had 43% higher growth rates than ducklings incubated at 35.0 C. In addition, ducklings incubated at 35.0 degrees C had higher baseline (17-50%) and stress-induced (32-84%) corticosterone concentrations than ducklings incubated at 35.9 degrees C and 37.0 degrees C at 2 and 9 days post hatch. We also found a significant negative correlation between body size and plasma corticosterone concentrations (baseline and stress-induced) in 9 day old ducklings. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that thermal conditions experienced during embryonic development can influence the HPA axis of young birds. Our results illustrate that subtle changes (<1.0 degrees C) in the incubation environment can have important consequences for physiological traits important to fitness.

   FECUNDITY; MALES; HERITABILITY; HARASSMENT
AB Adaptive mate choice by females is an important component of sexual selection in many species. The evolutionary consequences of male mate preferences, however, have received relatively little study, especially in the context of sexual conflict, where males often harm their mates. Here, we describe a new and counterintuitive cost of sexual selection in species with both male mate preference and sexual conflict via antagonistic male persistence: male mate choice for high-fecundity females leads to a diminished rate of adaptive evolution by reducing the advantage to females of expressing beneficial genetic variation. We then use a Drosophila melanogaster model system to experimentally test the key prediction of this theoretical cost: that antagonistic male persistence is directed toward, and harms, intrinsically higher-fitness females more than it does intrinsically lower-fitness females. This asymmetry in male persistence causes the tails of the population's fitness distribution to regress towards the mean, thereby reducing the efficacy of natural selection. We conclude that adaptive male mate choice can lead to an important, yet unappreciated, cost of sex and sexual selection.

AB Phytoplankton size structure plays a significant role in controlling the carbon flux of marine pelagic ecosystems. The mesoscale distribution and seasonal variation of total and size-fractionated phytoplankton biomass in surface waters. as measured by chlorophyll a (Chl a), was studied in the Southern Yellow Sea using data from four cruises during 2006-2007. The distribution of Chl a showed a high degree of spatial and temporal variation in the study area. Chl a concentrations were relatively high in the summer and autumn, with a mean of 142 and 1.27 mg m(-3), respectively. Conversely, in the winter and spring. the average Chl a levels were only 098 and 0.99 mg m(-3) Total Chl a showed a clear decreasing gradient from coastal areas to the open sea in the summer, autumn and winter cruises. Patches of high Chl a were observed in the central part of the Southern Yellow Sea in the spring due to the onset of the phytoplankton bloom. The eutrophic coastal waters contributed at least 68% of the total phytoplankton biomass in the surface layer. Picophytoplankton showed a consistent and absolute dominance in the central region of the Southern Yellow Sea (>40%) in all of the cruises, while the proportion of microphytoplankton was the highest in coastal waters The relative proportions of pico- and nanophytoplankton decreased with total biomass, whereas the proportion of the micro-fraction increased with total biomass. Relationships between phytoplankton biomass and environmental factors were also analysed. The results showed that the onset of the spring bloom was highly dependent on water column stability. Phytoplankton growth was limited by nutrient availability in the summer due to the strong thermocline. The combined effects of P-limitation and vertical mixing in the autumn restrained the further increase of phytoplankton biomass in the Surface layer. The low phytoplankton biomass in winter was caused by vertical dispersion due to intense mixing. Compared with the availability of nutrients. temperature did not seem to cause direct effects on phytoplankton biomass and its size structure. Although interactions of many different environmental factors affected phytoplankton distributions. hydrodynamic conditions seemed to be the dominant factor. Phytoplankton size structure was determined mainly by the size-differential capacity in acquiring resource. Short time scale events, such as the spring bloom and the extension of Yangtze River plume, can have substantial influences, both on the total Chl a concentration and on the size structure of the phytoplankton.

AB P>1. The value of measuring ecosystem functions in regular monitoring programs is increasingly being recognised as a potent tool for assessing river health. We measured the response of ecosystem metabolism, organic matter decomposition and strength loss, and invertebrate community composition across a gradient of catchment impairment defined by upstream landuse stress in two New Zealand streams. This was performed to determine if there were consistent responses among contrasting functional and structural indicators.
   2. Rates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) ranged from 0.1 to 7.0 gO(2) m<SU-2</SU day<SU-1</SU and from 0.34 to 16.5 gO(2) m<SU-2</SU day<SU-1</SU respectively. Rates of GPP were variable across the landuse stress gradient, whereas ER increased linearly with the highest rates at the most impacted sites. Production/respiration (P/R) and net ecosystem metabolism (NEM) indicated that sites at the low and high ends of the stress gradient were heterotrophic with respiration rates presumably relying on organic matter from upstream sources, adjacent land or point sources. Sites with moderate impairment were predominantly autotrophic.
   3. Declines in the tensile strength of the cotton strips showed no response across part of the gradient, but a strong response among the most impaired sites. The rate of mass loss of wooden sticks (Betula platyphylla Sukaczev) changed from a linear response to a U-shaped response across the impairment gradient after water temperature compensation, whereas leaf breakdown at a subset of sites suggested a linear loss in mass per degree-day. Three macroinvertebrate metrics describing the composition of the invertebrate community and its sensitivity to pollution showed similar linear inverse responses to the landuse stress gradient.
   4. The first axis of a redundancy analysis indicated an association between landuse stress and various measures of water quality, and wooden stick mass loss, the invertebrate metric % EPT [percentage of macroinvertebrate taxa belonging to the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (excluding Hydroptilidae] taxa, P/R and NEM, supporting the utility of these structural and functional metrics for assessing degree of landuse stress. The second axis was more strongly associated with catchment size, ER and GPP which suggests that these indicators were responding to differences in stream size.
   5. Our results suggest that nonlinear responses to catchment impairment need to be considered when interpreting measurements of ecosystem function. Functional indicators could be useful for detecting relatively subtle changes where the slope of the response curve is maximised and measurements at the low and high ends of the impairment gradient are roughly equivalent. Such responses may be particularly valuable for detecting early signs of degradation at high quality sites, allowing management responses to be initiated before the degradation becomes too advanced, or for detecting initial moves away from degraded states during the early stages of restoration. Close links between structural and functional indices of river health across an impairment gradient are not necessarily expected or desirable if the aim is to minimise redundancy among ecological indicators.

AB During the last decade many electronic databases of vegetation plots, mainly phytosociological releves, were established in different European countries. These databases contain information which is extremely valuable for both testing various macroecological hypotheses and for nature conservation surveying or monitoring. The aim of this paper is to provide estimates of the number of vegetation plots there are in Europe, how many are stored in an electronic format and to assess their distribution across European countries and regions. We sent a questionnaire to the managers of national or regional databases of vegetation plots and other prominent vegetation ecologists. Meta-data obtained in this way indicate that there are > 4,300,000 vegetation-plot records in Europe, of which > 1,800,000 are already stored electronically. Of the electronic plots, 60% are stored in TURBOVEG databases. Most plot records probably exist in Germany, the Netherlands, France, Poland, Spain, Czech Republic, Italy, UK, Switzerland and Austria. The largest numbers of plots per unit area are in the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and countries of central Europe. The most computerized plots per country exist in the Netherlands (600,000), followed by France, the Czech Republic and the UK. Due to its strong phytosociological tradition, Europe has many more vegetation plots than any other part of the world, This wealth of unique ecological information is a challenge for future biodiversity studies. With the alarming loss in biodiversity and environmental problems like global warming and ongoing changes in land use, there is an urgent need for wide-scale scientific and applied vegetation research. Developments of information systems such as SynBioSys Europe and facilitation of data flow between the national and regional databases should make it easier to use these vegetation-plot data.

AB Norway spruce of northern Europe expanded at the end of the last glacial out of one refugium in Russia. To provide a detailed insight into how the genetic structure in the northern European lineage of this species has been shaped by postglacial migration, recurrent pollen flow and marginality, we here compare variation at seven highly variable nuclear microsatellite loci in 37 populations (1715 trees) with mitochondrial DNA variation. Microsatellite diversity was high (H-E = 0.640) and genetic differentiation was low (FST = 0.029). The microsatellite structure supported a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-based hypothesis of two migration routes out of a single Russian refugium; one northwestern over Finland to northern Scandinavia, and one southwestern across the Baltic Sea into southern Scandinavia. Microsatellite diversity was maintained along the southwestern migration routes, whereas a significant decrease was observed towards the north. In contrast, the mtDNA diversity suggested higher amounts of historical gene flow towards the north than along the southwestern migration route. This suggests that the loss of nuclear diversity after postglacial colonization has been efficiently replenished by pollen-mediated gene flow in the south. Towards the north, smaller effective population size because of more limited seed and pollen production may have caused decreased nuclear diversity and increased inbreeding, reflecting the ecological marginality of the species in the north.

AB Assessing natural variability of leaf water use efficiency in plants adapted to extreme conditions of the Mediterranean climate represents an important step in the evaluation of the usefulness of some plant ecophysiological traits under water stress. Eleven Mediterranean species naturally inhabiting the Balearic Islands and corresponding to different growth forms (herbs, semi-deciduous shrubs, woody evergreen shrubs and woody evergreen semi-shrubs) were subject to progressive soil water depletion. Leaf intrinsic water use efficiency was measured by gas exchange at four different degrees of water stress. Under well watered conditions, differences in leaf intrinsic water use efficiency (A (N)/g (s)) among growth forms were limited to woody evergreen semi-shrubs, which presented the highest values. Under water stress conditions, differences became more evident, with a trend for an increase in A (N)/g (s) from woody evergreen shrubs, through semi-deciduous shrubs and herbaceous to woody evergreen semi-shrubs. The observed variation in A (N)/g (s) correlated with several physiological (leaf water potential, soil to leaf hydraulic conductance and stomatal conductance) and morphological (stomatal density) parameters, displaying a general relationship for all growth forms. This suggests that the capacity for withstanding water limitation is adaptive for all Mediterranean species. However, when A (N)/g (s) was related to leaf mass area, this relationship was not generally applicable, and depended on growth forms, suggesting that different growth forms display specific morphological adjustments in response to water shortage.

AB Tropospheric ozone exercises pressure on vegetation in combination with other oxidative factors such as strong sunlight, UV-B radiation, high temperatures and water shortage. The relationship established between these factors and the plants can be either antagonistic (cross-resistance) or synergistic. Response mechanisms are activated involving physiological, chemical and morphological features. Overall sensitivity (or resistance) is determined by the amount of total oxidative pressure in relation to the plant's physiological plasticity [i.e. its ability (within its own resilience potential) to alter its structure and functions in order to react to the oxidative pressure]. Within different populations of the same species, functional leaf traits (leaf area and thickness, leaf mass per area or specific leaf area, tissue thickness) may vary in relation to the extent that the plant succeeds in acclimating to ambient oxidative pressure. The behaviour of a tree in an oxidative environment can be interpreted by means of leaf structure analysis. Leaves presenting high tissue density (and thus low intercellular space content) display a high degree of acclimation to stressors, react little to environmental changes and are characterized by remarkable longevity. Leaves of this type also have a high photosynthesis capacity per surface unit (due to the N content per surface unit) and a high P-N/G(W) (or water use efficiency, WUE). Thus, they are able to support detoxification processes. These morphological traits are to be found in adult plants in late successional stands and, above all, in ambients that have already been subjected to oxidative pressure. However, in early successional species and during the dynamic stages of growth (e.g. in the renewal occurring along forest edges), it is the opposite leaf traits that prevail: low leaf density, high photosynthesis capacity per dry weight unit, low WUE, low leaf longevity. These traits make plants far more reactive to environmental changes (e.g. they exploit the light from sun flecks much more effectively), but enable them to achieve only a low degree of acclimation and a poor ability to support detoxification processes. Whereas adult forests display a high level of ecological resilience and have a relatively good tolerance of ozone, the renewal stages are (at least potentially) more vulnerable. In these environments, ozone can alter the competition among genotypes and favour more resistant ones. Among the sectors most at risk, we must include communities growing at the edge of their ecological range, for whom even a slight increase in oxidative pressure can trigger substantial degenerative processes.

AB Why does the neutral theory, which is based on unrealistic assumptions, predict diversity patterns so accurately? Answering questions like this requires a radical change in the way we tackle them. The large number of degrees of freedom of ecosystems pose a fundamental obstacle to mechanistic modelling. However, there are tools of statistical physics, such as the maximum entropy formalism (MaxEnt), that allow transcending particular models to simultaneously work with immense families of models with different rules and parameters, sharing only well-established features. We applied MaxEnt allowing species to be ecologically idiosyncratic, instead of constraining them to be equivalent as the neutral theory does. The answer we found is that neutral models are just a subset of the majority of plausible models that lead to the same patterns. Small variations in these patterns naturally lead to the main classical species abundance distributions, which are thus unified in a single framework.

AB Hybridization between differentiated lineages can have many different consequences depending on fitness variation among hybrid offspring. When introduced organisms hybridize with natives, the ensuing evolutionary dynamics may substantially complicate conservation decisions. Understanding the fitness consequences of hybridization is an important first step in predicting its evolutionary outcome and conservation impact. Here, we measured natural selection caused by differential viability of hybrid larvae in wild populations where native California Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma californiense) and introduced Barred Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum mavortium) have been hybridizing for 50-60 years. We found strong evidence of hybrid vigor; mixed-ancestry genotypes had higher survival rates than genotypes containing mostly native or mostly introduced alleles. Hybrid vigor may be caused by heterozygote advantage (overdominance) or recombinant hybrid vigor (due to epistasis or complementation). These genetic mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and we find statistical support for both overdominant and recombinant contributions to hybrid vigor in larval tiger salamanders. Because recombinant homozygous genotypes can breed true, a single highly fit genotype with a mosaic of native and introduced alleles may eventually replace the historically pure California Tiger Salamander (listed as Threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act). The management implications of this outcome are complex: Genetically pure populations may not persist into the future, but average fitness and population viability of admixed California Tiger Salamanders may be enhanced. The ecological consequences for other native species are unknown.

AB Estimation of effective population sizes (N-e) and temporal gene flow (N(e)m, m) has many implications for understanding population structure in evolutionary and conservation biology. However, comparative studies that gauge the relative performance of N-e, N(e)m or m methods are few. Using temporal genetic data from two salmonid fish population systems with disparate population structure, we (i) evaluated the congruence in estimates and precision of long- and short-term N-e, N(e)m and m from six methods; (ii) explored the effects of metapopulation structure on N-e estimation in one system with spatiotemporally linked subpopulations, using three approaches; and (iii) determined to what degree interpopulation gene flow was asymmetric over time. We found that long-term N-e estimates exceeded short-term N-e within populations by 2-10 times; the two were correlated in the system with temporally stable structure (Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar) but not in the highly dynamic system (brown trout, Salmo trutta). Four temporal methods yielded short-term N-e estimates within populations that were strongly correlated, and these were higher but more variable within salmon populations than within trout populations. In trout populations, however, these short-term N-e estimates were always lower when assuming gene flow than when assuming no gene flow. Linkage disequilibrium data generally yielded short-term N-e estimates of the same magnitude as temporal methods in both systems, but the two were uncorrelated. Correlations between long- and short-term geneflow estimates were inconsistent between methods, and their relative size varied up to eightfold within systems. While asymmetries in gene flow were common in both systems (58-63% of population-pair comparisons), they were only temporally stable in direction within certain salmon population pairs, suggesting that gene flow between particular populations is often intermittent and/or variable. Exploratory metapopulation N-e analyses in trout demonstrated both the importance of spatial scale in estimating N-e and the role of gene flow in maintaining genetic variability within subpopulations. Collectively, our results illustrate the utility of comparatively applying N-e, N(e)m and m to (i) tease apart processes implicated in population structure, (ii) assess the degree of continuity in patterns of connectivity between population pairs and (iii) gauge the relative performance of different approaches, such as the influence of population subdivision and gene flow on N-e estimation. They further reiterate the importance of temporal sampling replication in population genetics, the value of interpreting N-e or m in light of species biology, and the need to address long-standing assumptions of current N-e, N(e)m or m models more explicitly in future research.

AB Remote sensing in the solar domain provides indirect measurements of green leaf area index and chlorophyll content on a within-field scale. This information can be used to build an indicator related to the nitrogen status of the crop itself used to make nitrogen recommendations, varying on the within-field scale. We propose as an indicator for winter wheat crops the nitrogen absorption deficit determined by reference to optimal nitrogen status. Three methods for calculating the nitrogen absorption deficit of the crop from the green leaf area index (GLAI) and the chlorophyll content (Cab) are proposed and compared. The first method consists in evaluating the nitrogen nutrition index from the chlorophyll content. The second evaluates the nitrogen content of the canopy and the third directly estimates the quantity of nitrogen absorbed by the canopy from the quantity of chlorophyll that the canopy contains. The methods were calibrated and validated on three datasets obtained on 2 years and two sites, on experiments were nitrogen dressing varied from 0 to 300 kg ha(-1). Measurements consisted in time evolution from end of winter to earing stage of dry matter (range 5.9-17.5 t ha(-1)), GLAI (range 0.1-6), chlorophyll content (range 0.3-0.9 g m(-2) leaf or 0.1-4.5 g m(-2) soil) and nitrogen absorption (range 38-234 kg ha(-1)). We. found that the relationship between absorbed nitrogen and chlorophyll was more stable when considering integrated quantities of chlorophyll in the canopy (g m(-2) soil) than when considering chlorophyll content (g cm(-2) leaf). As a consequence, the third method gave the best results, both for description and prediction, with an error of about 20 kg N ha(-1). (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) is native to east Asia, is established throughout Europe, and is introduced but geographically restricted in North America. We developed and compared two separate environmental niche models using genetic algorithm for rule set prediction (GARP) and mitten crab occurrences in Asia and Europe to predict the species' potential distribution in North America. Since mitten crabs must reproduce in water with >= 15 parts per thousand salinity, we limited the potential North American range to freshwater habitats within the highest documented dispersal distance (1260 km) and a more restricted dispersal limit (354 km) from the sea. Applying the higher dispersal distance, both models predicted the lower Great Lakes, most of the eastern seaboard, the Gulf of Mexico and southern extent of the Mississippi River watershed, and the Pacific northwest as suitable environment for mitten crabs, but environmental match for southern states (below 35 degrees N) was much lower for the European model. Use of the lower range with both models reduced the expected range, especially in the Great Lakes, Mississippi drainage, and inland areas of the Pacific Northwest. To estimate the risk of introduction of mitten crabs, the amount of reported ballast water discharge into major United States ports from regions in Asia and Europe with established mitten crab populations was used as an index of introduction effort. Relative risk of invasion was estimated based on a combination of environmental match and volume of unexchanged ballast water received (July 1999 - December 2003) for major ports. The ports of Norfolk and Baltimore were most vulnerable to invasion and establishment, making Chesapeake Bay the most likely location to be invaded by mitten crabs in the United States. The next highest risk was predicted for Portland, Oregon. Interestingly, the port of Los Angeles/Long Beach, which has a large shipping volume, had a low risk of invasion. Ports such as Jacksonville, Florida, had a medium risk owing to small shipping volume but high environmental match. This study illustrates that the combination of environmental niche- and vector-based models can provide managers with more precise estimates of invasion risk than can either of these approaches alone.

AB Understanding ecosystem processes as they relate to wildfire and vegetation dynamics is of growing importance as fire frequency and extent increase throughout the western United States. However, the effects of severe, stand-replacing wildfires are poorly understood. We studied inorganic nitrogen pools and mineralization rates after stand-replacing wildfires in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, Wyoming. After fires that burned in summer 2000, soil ammonium concentration peaked in 2001 (33 mg NH4-N-kg(soil)(-1)); soil nitrate increased subsequently (2.7 mg NO3-N-kg(soil)(-1) in 2003) but was still low. However, annual net ammonification rates were largely negative from 2001 to 2004, indicating ammonium depletion. Thus, although net nitrification rates were positive, annual net nitrogen mineralization (net ammonification plus net nitrification) remained low. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) increased from 0.25 to 1.6 Mg-ha(-1)-yr(-1) from 2001 to 2004, but variation in ANPP among stands was not related to net nitrogen mineralization rates. Across a broader temporal gradient (stand age zero to > 250 yr), negative rates of net annual ammonification were especially pronounced in the first postfire year. Laboratory incubations using N-15 isotope pool dilution revealed that gross production of ammonium was reduced and ammonium consumption greatly exceeded gross production during the initial postfire years. Our results suggest a microbial nitrogen sink for several years after severe, stand-replacing fire, confirming earlier hypotheses about postdisturbance succession and nutrient cycling in cold, fire-dominated coniferous forests. Postfire forests in Yellowstone seem to be highly conservative for nitrogen, and microbial immobilization of ammonium plays a key role during early succession.

AB We tested the hypotheses that invasive species had higher irradiance plasticity, capture ability and efficiency than noninvasive species using two invasive aliens-Ageratina adenophora and Chromolaena odorata, and one noninvasive alien-Gynura sp. The three aliens were grown at 4.5%,12.5%,36%, 50% and 100% irradiances for 64 days before harvesting. The plastic response of specific leaf area (SLA) contributed to improved light interception at low irradiance, carbon gain and water balance at high irradiance. It was a good predictor for intraspecific irradiance responses of leaf area ratio (LAR), leaf area:root mass ratio, maximum photosynthetic rate (P-max) and net assimilation rate (NAR). Biomass allocation-related traits were species specific and their plasticity to irradiance was low. The high root mass fraction, leaf mass fraction and LAR distinguished the two invaders from Gynura. However, other resource capture-related traits, such as SLA, NAR and P-max, were not always higher for the invaders than for Gynura. Furthermore, plasticity to irradiance was not different between the invasive and noninvasive aliens. With increasing irradiance, Gynura decreased biomass investment to roots and leaves but increased the investment to support structures adversely affecting both low and high irradiance acclimation. Ageratina might invade new habitat successfully through tolerating shading at low irradiance and outshading competitors by forming dense stands when irradiance is increased. The results suggested that both resource capture-related traits and irradiance acclimation conferred competitive advantage to the two invaders and some traits were common for invasive and noninvasive aliens but others were specific for invaders.

AB Understanding the global geographical distribution of extinction risk is a key challenge in conservation biology. It remains controversial, however, to what extent areas become threat hotspots simply because of high human impacts or due to predisposing ecological conditions. Limits to the taxonomic and geographical extent, resolution and quality of previously available data have precluded a full global assessment of the relative roles of these factors. Here, we use a new global database on the geographical distributions of birds on continents and continental islands to show that, after controlling for species richness, the best predictors of the global pattern of extinction risk are measures of human impact. Ecological gradients are of secondary importance at a global scale. The converse is true for individual biogeographic realms, within which variation in human impact is reduced and its influence on extinction risk globally is therefore underestimated. These results underline the importance of a global perspective on driving spatial patterns of extinction risk, and the key role of anthropogenic factors in driving the current extinction crisis.

AB The outcome of natural hybridization is highly variable and depends on the nonexclusive effects of both pre- and post-mating reproductive barriers. The objective of this study was to address three specific questions regarding the dynamics of hybridization between the American and European eels (Anguilla rostrata and Anguilla anguilla). Using 373 AFLP loci, 1127 eels were genotyped, representing different life stages from both continents, as well as multiple Icelandic locations. We first evaluated the extent of hybridization and tested for the occurrence of hybrids beyond the first generation. Second, we tested whether hybrids were randomly distributed across continents and among Icelandic sampling sites. Third, we tested for a difference in the proportion of hybrids between glass eel and yellow eel stages in Iceland. Our results provided evidence for (i) an overall hybrid proportion of 15.5% in Iceland, with values ranging from 6.7% to 100% depending on life stages and locations; (ii) the existence of hybrids beyond the first generation; (iii) a nonrandom geographic distribution of hybrids in the North Atlantic; and (iv) a higher proportion of first and later generation hybrids in yellow eels compared to glass eels, as well as a significant latitudinal gradient in the proportion of hybrids in Icelandic freshwater. We propose that the combined effect of both differential survival of hybrids and variation in hybridization rate through time best explain these patterns. We discuss the possibility that climate change, which is impacting many environmental features in the North Atlantic, may have a determinant effect on the outcome of natural hybridization in Atlantic eels.

AB Surface sediments from 30 mountain lakes in south-eastern Switzerland (Engadine, Grisons) were analysed for subfossil diatom, chironomid, and cladoceran assemblages. Ordination techniques were used to identify relevant physical and chemical environmental parameters that best explain the distribution of these biota in the studied lakes. Diatom assemblage composition showed a strong relationship with physical (e.g., lake depth, temperature, organic content of surface sediments) and chemical variables (e.g., lake-water pH, alkalinity, silica concentration). The greatest variance in chironomid and cladoceran assemblages is explained by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content of lake water, temperature, and the organic content of surface sediments, all parameters which are highly correlated with lake elevation. Increasing lake depth is reflected in diatom and cladoceran assemblages by higher percentages of planktonic species, whereas chironomid assemblages in the deep Engadine lakes are characterised by a high proportion of lotic taxa. In contrast to similar studies in the Northern and Southern Alps, subfossil assemblages in the Engadine mountain lakes showed a strong relationship with DOC, which in these weakly buffered lakes is negatively correlated with altitude. According to our findings, chironomid and cladocera remains have a considerable potential as quantitative palaeotemperature indicators in the Engadine area. This potential is somewhat weaker for diatoms which seem to be more strongly influenced by water chemistry and lake bathymetry.

AB The detection of footprints of natural selection in genetic polymorphism data is fundamental to understanding the genetic basis of adaptation, and has important implications for human health. The standard approach has been to reject neutrality in favor of selection if the pattern of variation at a candidate locus was significantly different from the predictions of the standard neutral model. The problem is that the standard neutral model assumes more than just neutrality, and it is almost always possible to explain the data using an alternative neutral model with more complex demography. Today's wealth of genomic polymorphism data, however, makes it possible to dispense with models altogether by simply comparing the pattern observed at a candidate locus to the genomic pattern, and rejecting neutrality if the pattern is extreme. Here, we utilize this approach on a truly genomic scale, comparing a candidate locus to thousands of alleles throughout the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. We demonstrate that selection has acted to increase the frequency of early-flowering alleles at the vernalization requirement locus FRIGIDA. Selection seems to have occurred during the last several thousand years, possibly in response to the spread of agriculture. We introduce a novel test statistic based on haplotype sharing that embraces the problem of population structure, and so should be widely applicable.

AB Coexisting animal species frequently differ in resource use in at least one niche dimension and thus avoid competition. While a range of morphological differences that lead to differentiation in animals' mechanical access to food have been identified, the role of sensory differences in within-guild niche differentiation has received less attention. We tested the hypothesis that differences in sensory access to prey contribute to resource partitioning between potentially competing species using two sympatric, similar-sized, congeneric bat species as a model system. Nursery colonies of Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) and Bechstein's bat (Myotis bechsteinii) roost in bat boxes in the same orchard and forage in forests and orchards nearby. In observations and behavioural experiments with freshly captured M. bechsteinii, we showed that individuals are able to hunt using prey-generated sound alone. In contrast, M. nattereri rarely uses prey-generated sound, but instead is able to find prey by echolocation very close to vegetation. In accordance with these behavioural data, we showed that M. bechsteinii has significantly larger ears than M. nattereri, providing it with superior detection and localization abilities for relatively low-frequency prey rustling sounds. We hypothesized that these differences in sensory ecology of the two syntopic, congeneric species would contribute to resource partitioning, so that M. bechsteinii would find more noisy prey taxa, possibly hidden in vegetation, by listening for prey sounds, while M. nattereri would have better access to still prey using echolocation or associative learning. Analysis of faecal samples collected on the same nights from bat boxes occupied by each species corroborated this prediction. The diets of the two species differed significantly, reflecting their different prey perception techniques and thereby supporting the hypothesis that differences in sensory ecology contribute to niche differentiation.

AB We compared mitochondrial DNA and gill-raker number variation in populations of the European whitefish Coregonus lavaretus (L.) species complex to illuminate their evolutionary history, and discuss mechanisms behind diversification. Using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and sequencing 528 bp of combined parts of the cytochrome oxidase b (cyt b) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (ND3) mithochondrial DNA (mtDNA) regions, we documented phylogeographic relationships among populations and phylogeny of mtDNA haplotypes. Demographic events behind geographical distribution of haplotypes were inferred using nested clade analysis (NCA) and mismatch distribution. Concordance between operational taxonomical groups, based on gill-raker numbers, and mtDNA patterns was tested. Three major mtDNA clades were resolved in Europe: a North European clade from northwest Russia to Denmark, a Siberian clade from the Arctic Sea to southwest Norway, and a South European clade from Denmark to the European Alps, reflecting occupation in different glacial refugia. Demographic events inferred from NCA were isolation by distance, range expansion, and fragmentation. Mismatch analysis suggested that clades which colonized Fennoscandia and the Alps expanded in population size 24 500-5800 years before present, with minute female effective population sizes, implying small founder populations during colonization. Gill-raker counts did not commensurate with hierarchical mtDNA clades, and poorly with haplotypes, suggesting recent origin of gill-raker variation. Whitefish designations based on gill-raker numbers were not associated with ancient clades. Lack of congruence in morphology and evolutionary lineages implies that the taxonomy of this species complex should be reconsidered.

AB 1. Studies on biodiversity and ecosystem function require considering metrics for accurately describing the functional diversity of communities. The number of taxa (richness) is commonly used to characterise biological diversity. The disadvantage of richness as a measure of biological diversity is that all taxa are taken into account on an equal basis regardless of their abundance, their biological characteristics or their function in the ecosystem.
   2. To circumvent this problem, we applied a recently described measure of biological diversity that incorporates dissimilarities among taxa. Dissimilarities were defined from biological traits (e.g. life history, morphology, physiology and behaviour) of stream invertebrate taxa and the resulting biological diversity index was considered as a surrogate for functional diversity.
   3. As sampling effort is known to affect the number of taxa collected within a reach, we investigated how change in functional diversity is affected by sampling effort. We used stream invertebrate community data from three large European rivers to model accumulation curves and to assess the number of samples required to estimate (i.e. closeness to the maximal value) functional diversity and genera richness. We further evaluated the precision of estimates (i.e. similarity of temporal or spatial replicates) of the total functional diversity.
   4. As expected, richness estimates were strongly dependent on sampling effort, and 10 replicate samples were found to underestimate actual richness. Moreover, richness estimates showed much variation with season and location. In contrast, functional diversity had greater accuracy with less sampling effort and the precision of the estimates was higher than richness both across sampling occasions and sampling reaches. These results are further arguments towards conducting research on the design of a biomonitoring tool based on biological traits.

AB We analyzed fossil chironomids (nonbiting midges) and pollen in two lake-sediment records to reconstruct and quantify Holocene summer-temperature fluctuations in the European Alps. Chironomid and pollen records indicate five centennial-scale cooling episodes during the early- and mid-Holocene. The strongest temperature declines of approximate to1degreesC are inferred at approximate to10,700-10,500 and 8,2007,600 calibrated C-14 years B.P., whereas other temperature fluctuations are of smaller amplitude. Two forcing mechanisms have been presented recently to explain centennial-scale climate variability in Europe during the early- and mid-Holocene, both involving changes in Atlantic thermohaline circulation. In the first mechanism, changes in meltwater flux from the North American continent to the North Atlantic are responsible for changes in the Atlantic thermohaline circulation, thereby affecting circum-Atlantic climate. In the second mechanism, solar variability is the cause of Holocene climatic fluctuations, possibly triggering changes in Atlantic thermolhaline overturning. Within their dating uncertainty, the two major cooling periods in the European Alps are coeval with substantial changes in the routing of North American freshwater runoff to the North Atlantic, whereas quantitatively, our climatic reconstructions show a poor agreement with available records of past solar activity. Thus, our results suggest that, during the early- and mid-Holocene, freshwater-induced Atlantic circulation changes had stronger influence on Alpine summer temperatures than solar variability and that Holocene thermolhaline circulation reductions have led to summer-temperature declines of up to 1degreesC in central Europe.

AB Biofouling on international vessels is an important mechanism for the inadvertent transfer of non-indigenous marine species around the globe. This paper describes the nature and extent of biofouling on 30 merchant vessels (ranging from 1400 to 32 000 gross registered tonnes) based on analysis of hull inspection video footage collected by two New Zealand commercial diving companies. A new method for measuring biofouling communities is applied, which aims to incorporate the potential for various hull locations to house non-indigenous marine species. Our analysis revealed that out-of-service vessels and vessels plying trans-Tasman routes possessed greater levels of biofouling than more active vessels. Dry-docking support strips and sea-chest gratings generally had the highest levels of biofouling and may pose relatively high biosecurity risks. Any future biosecurity surveillance should target these hull locations for non-indigenous species.

AB A list of 618 species of alien flowering plants recorded for Mexico is presented; they are distributed in 355 genera and 87 families. The families with the largest number of species are Poaceae (171), Fabaceae sensu lato (57), Asteraceae (56), and Brassicaceae (45). The representation of most families with alien species in Mexico agrees with the average distribution frequencies estimated by Pysek (1998) for 26 floras throughout the World. Exceptions are an under-representation of Asteraceae and an over-representation of Poaceae. Most alien species (78.9%) in Mexico have their origin in the Old World; South America ranks second with 9.6%. As defined by Richardson et al. (2000), 19.8% of the alien species could be considered casual aliens and 80.2% of them naturalized. The proportion of alien species relative to the 22,968 native flowering plant species recorded for Mexico is 2.7%.

AB A 6-year study was conducted in tallgrass prairie to assess the effects of grazing management (cattle stocking densities and grazing systems) on plant community composition and diversity. Treatments included sites grazed season-long (May to October) at 3 stocking densities (3.8, 2.8, and 1.8 hectares per animal unit), ungrazed control sites, and sites under a late-season rest rotation grazing system at this same range of stocking densities. Plant communities were sampled twice each season using a nearest-point procedure. Native plant species diversity, species richness, and growth form diversity were significantly higher in grazed compared to ungrazed prairie, and diversity was greatest at the highest stocking density. This enhancement of plant species diversity under grazing was not a result of increased frequency of weedy/exotic species. There were no significant effects of grazing system on plant diversity, nor any significant stocking density x grazing system interactions, indicating that animal density is a key management variable influencing plant species diversity and composition in tallgrass prairie and that effects of animal density override effects of grazing systems. Increasing cattle stocking densities decreased the abundance of the dominant perennial tall grasses, and increased abundance of the C-4 perennial mid-grasses. The frequency of perennial forbs was relatively stable across grazing treatments. Abundance of annual forbs varied among years and grazing treatments. In half of the years sampled, annual forbs showed the highest frequency under intermediate stocking density. Patterns of responses among plant groups suggest that some species may respond principally to direct effects of grazers and others may respond to indirect effects of grazers on competitive relationships or on the spatial patterns of fuel loads and fires. Thus, this study suggests that large grazer densities, fire, and annual climatic variability interact to influence patterns of plant community composition and diversity in tallgrass prairie. Effects of varying management such as stocking densities and grazing systems on plant species diversity and the relative abundances of different plant growth forms or functional groups may have important consequences for grassland community stability and ecosystem function.

AB We examined population substructure of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp). in Shark Bay, Western Australia, using 10 highly polymorphic microsatellite loci, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). For microsatellite analysis, 302 different animals were sampled from seven localities throughout the bay. Analysis of genetic differentiation between sampling localities showed a significant correlation between the number of migrants (Nm) calculated from F-ST, R-ST, and private alleles, and distance between localities-a pattern of isolation-by-distance. For mtDNA, 220 individuals from all seven localities were sequenced for a 351 base pair fragment of the control region, resulting in eight haplotypes, with two distinct clusters of haplotypes. Values of F-ST and phi(ST) for mtDNA yielded statistically significant differences, mostly between localities that were not adjacent to each other, suggesting female gene flow over a scale larger than the sampled localities. We also observed a significant correlation between the number of female migrants calculated from F-ST and phi(ST) and the distance of sampling localities. Our results indicate that dispersal in female dolphins in Shark Bay is more restricted than that of males.

   LEAVES
AB Leaf trait data were compiled for 258 Australian plant species from several habitat types dominated by woody perennials. Specific leaf area (SLA), photosynthetic capacity, dark respiration rate and leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus ( P) concentrations were positively correlated with one another and negatively correlated with average leaf lifespan. These trait relationships were consistent with previous results from global datasets. Together, these traits form a spectrum of variation running from species with cheap but frequently replaced leaves to those with strategies more attuned to a nutrient-conserving lifestyle. Australian species tended to have SLAs at the lower end of the spectrum, as expected in a dataset dominated by sclerophyllous species from low fertility or low rainfall sites. The existence of broad-scale, 'global' relationships does not imply that the same trait relationships will always be observed in small datasets. In particular, the probability of observing concordant patterns depends on the range of trait variation in a dataset, which, itself, may vary with sample size or species-sampling properties such as the range of growth forms, plant functional 'types', or taxa included in a particular study. The considerable scatter seen in these broad-scale trait relationships may be associated with climate, physiology and phylogeny.

AB Mathematical models have suggested that population cycles of northern voles are generated by a combined effect of delayed and direct density-dependent mechanisms. Predation is considered to be the most likely mechanism affecting vole populations in a delayed density-dependent manner. We conducted a replicated two-factor experiment with the field vole (Microtus agrestis) during 1999-2001 in western Finland, manipulating both predation rate and winter food supply to evaluate whether a shortage of winter food has the potential to limit the growth of vole populations in a direct density-dependent manner. Vole populations in fenced predator exclosures rapidly attained higher densities than in unfenced areas, with the difference persisting until the end of the experiment. In the first winter, food supplementation increased vole population growth in fenced areas, but not in unfenced areas. The growth of vole populations in both supplemented and nonsupplemented fenced areas became limited in a direct density-dependent manner during the first winter. During the second winter, food supplementation prevented the crash of vole populations within fences, whereas again no obvious effect was found in the areas exposed to predation. Furthermore, supplemental winter food increased the overwinter survival of voles in fenced areas in both winters. Our results indicate that Microtus vole populations that have succeeded in escaping regulation by predators are limited in growth by a lack of winter food. This factor is thus a strong candidate for the direct density dependence inherently necessary for the occurrence of population cycles.

AB 1. The relationship between biomass and species richness in temperate vegetation has been described as a hump-back response model. The hump-back model predicts that herbaceous species richness is highest at an intermediate level of biomass. However, this has not been investigated in arid-zone grazing lands.
   2. We tested the hump-back prediction in an and tropical grazing region in northern Kenya where a seasonal grazing exclosure system is practised. We compared vegetation structure, species richness and composition on an open range and exclosures at five sites to elucidate the potential mechanisms behind variation in species richness.
   3. More biomass was accumulated within seasonal exclosures than in continuously grazed areas. Species richness in exclosure plots varied from 5.3 to 8.3 species In 2, while that in open plots varied from 5.1 to 7.5 species m(-2). A pair-wise test showed no difference in two of the five sites with respect to both total and herbaceous species richness.
   4. The primary floristic gradient illuminated through ordination was related to biomass, while the secondary gradient was related to species richness. The exclosure plots had more abundant species, especially compared with open plots, which had more rare and occasional species. A total of 37 herbaceous species was recorded; 22% were indifferent to grazing, 30% grazing intolerant and 48% promoted by grazing.
   5. The relationship between biomass and herbaceous species richness showed (i) no trend within the exclosures (maximum biomass 800 g m(-2)); (ii) a positive trend in the open grazing land (maximum of 500 g m(-2)); and a hump-back pattern when (i) and (ii)were analysed together. Optimum richness corresponded to a biomass level of 400-500 g m(-2). Species richness declined with increase in age of exclosures.
   6. We confirmed that species richness will decline when biomass exceeds 500 g m(-2), as predicted by the hump-back model, even in and grazing lands. Seasonal grazing exclosures may increase species richness to a certain level, but the decline in species richness with age of exclosures indicates that long-term exclusion of grazing may not necessarily increase species richness in arid-zone grazing lands.

AB Most bird studies of female signalling have been confined to species in which females display a male-ornament in a vestigial form. However, a great deal of benefit may be gained from considering phenotypic traits that are specific to females. This is because (1) sex-specific traits may signal sex-specific qualities and (2) females may develop a male-ornament not because they are selected to do so, but because fathers transmit to daughters the underlying genes for its expression (genetic correlation between the sexes). We investigated these two propositions in the barn owl Tyto alba, a species in which male plumage is lighter in colour and less marked with black spots than that of females. Firstly, we present published evidence that female plumage spottiness reflects parasite resistance ability. We also show that male plumage coloration is correlated with reproductive success, male feeding rate and heart mass. Secondly, cross-fostering experiments demonstrate that plumage coloration and spottiness are genetically correlated between the sexes. This implies that if a given trait value is selected in one sex, the other sex will indirectly evolve towards a similar value. This prediction is supported by the observation that female plumage coloration and spottiness resembled that of males, in comparisons at the level of Tyto alba alba populations, Tyto alba subspecies and Tyto species. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that sex-specific traits signal sex-specific qualities and that a gene for a sex-specific trait can be expressed in the other sex as the consequence of a genetic correlation between the sexes.

AB Data on fruit abundance and ecological overlap among Ateles belzebuth, Lagothrix lagothricha Cebus apella, and Alouatta seniculus were gathered during 13 months at Tinigua National Park (Colombia), in an effort to test the following hypotheses concerning competition for fruits. Coexistence is possible because: (1) during periods when fruit availability is limited, the species utilize different resources; and (2) the species have different fruit preferences independent of fruit production in the forest. Differences were found in resource use (diet and habitat) for all four species. Despite these differences, all four devoted large proportions of time feeding on fruit. Fruit abundance influenced their activity patterns. Ninety percent of all interspecific aggressive interactions (N = 69) were seen in fruiting trees. The first hypothesis was best supported, given that all species significantly increased their intake of the vegetative parts of plants during periods of fruit scarcity. Fruit partitioning during periods of scarcity was observed dearly only for one pair of species (C. apella and L. lagothricha). In general, the second hypothesis was nor supported as a mechanism for reducing competition because most fruit species were consumed by more than one primate species. Fruit preferences, however, may be particularly important in explaining differences in niche overlap between the most ecologically similar species: A. belzebuth relied heavily on the fruits of one palm species (Oenocarpus bataua) during periods of fruit scarcity and abundance, while L. lagothricha completely ignored this fruit.

AB For invasion ecology to become a quantitative approach to conservation, robust predictors of success must be identified Taxonomy although often casually mentioned, has never been thoroughly assessed as all agent of prediction. I used binomial probabilities to identify taxonomic patterns in establishment success among global avifauna. At most, 2.54% of all avian species are considered successfully established exotics somewhere in the world. The distribution of these species among higher taxa is far from random. Seven families contained more successfully established exotic species than expected by chance: Anatidae (ducks and geese), Phasianidae (pheasants), Passeridae (sparrows and estrildid finches), Psittacidae (parrots and allies), Columbidae (pigeons and doves), Rheidae (rheas), and Odontophoridae (New World quails). Human influence on probability of transport appears to drive this taxonomic pattern. Anatidae, Odontophoridae, and Phasianidae hold far more species than expected that arrived in their invasive range for exploitation (i.e., hunting or game). Passeridae and Sturnidae (starlings and mynahs) have more pet species than expected by chance. This, traits that enhance probability of purposeful transport exhibit a taxonomic pattern, This human influence on probability of transport increases the quantity of species introduced but does not increase the proportion of species that successfully become established. When invasion risk is assigned, it is vital to understand the interaction between species-specific attributes that influence established and transportation.

AB The objective of the paper is to study a physically based method of retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) parameters from global data sets of new generation wide field of view optical satellite sensors, such as POLDER/ADEOS, VGT/SPOT4, MODIS/EOS, MISR/EOS, MERIS/ENVISAT, and so forth. The method uses the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model of Kuusk (1995), which simultaneously predicts the spectral and directional behavior of reflectances, as a function of LAI, chlorophyll concentration, ratio of leaf size to canopy height, and other optical or structural parameters of the soil and vegetation. The same model is used irrespective of surface type, and no ancillary data is needed. This approach is evaluated with field and airborne data acquired over three different types of surfaces: Sahelian vegetation in the HAPEX-Sahel (1992) experiment, boreal forest in the BOREAS (1994) experiment, and cultivated nr-eas in the Alpilles (1996) experiment. The results shore that the LAI is restituted with a fair accuracy [root-mean-square (rms) difference between model results and observations of 0.70], better than that obtained with a semiempirical relation LAI-vegetation index. The daily fAPAR is restituted accurately, with a rms difference between measured and modeled fAPAR of 0.097. In the example of HAPEX, the model reproduces to some extent the temporal evolution of measured LAI and fAPAR. Reflectances reconstructed with the model are in acceptable agreement with observed reflectances, with a rms difference between observed and measured values of 0.017 on average. It is concluded that the retrieval of biophysical parameters from inversion of a BRDF model is promising from the perspective of a quantitative characterization of the terrestrial biosphere from space.

AB The foredune vegetation in the Gulf of Cadiz (SW Spain, S Portugal) was studied by means of morphological characters and functional traits of plants. The 55 vascular species recorded in the area were classified into three functional types: Type I consists mainly of winter annuals of moderate size with soft leaves, showing no presumed adaptations to the dune environment. Plants of Type Il are mostly perennials with a below-ground spreading root network and leaves with presumed adaptations to coastal environmental stress. Type III includes plants mostly capable of being dispersed by sea-water and of withstanding sand burial.
   In relatively unstable soil, Type II and Type III plants were found to be more abundant, their relative proportion depending on the dominance of accretion/erosion processes. Increasing cover of Type I plants was associated with relatively more stable soils. The ratios in occurrences of the three types can be used as an indicator of foredune dynamics.

AB In contrast to what is generally believed, the reproductive strategies of ants are remarkably diverse and include such different phenomena, as wingless female and male sexuals, reproduction by mated workers, thelytokous parthenogenesis, and complete workerlessness. We review the various reproductive life histories and investigate them in the light of recent models on the evolution of dispersal strategies and multiple-queening. It appears that most deviations from ''normal'' colony propagation can be explained by a decreased success of dispersal and solitary founding by solitary queens in certain types of habitats. Consequently, alternative reproductive strategies are found especially in those species, in which environmental conditions or a highly specialized way of life are thought to make solitary founding costly. Among the key factors, which determine the success of reproductive strategies, appear to be spatial and temporal distribution of habitats and the availability of nest sites.

AB A sound basis for defining life-history tactics was obtained by reviewing life-history traits. This involved an explanation of the ecological implications of thelytoky (automictic or apomictic), arrhenotoky, amphitoky, sexual reproduction, semelparity, iteroparity, seasonal iteroparity, and the relationship between semelparity and juvenile development. Several forms of synchronization of life cycles with environmental conditions were classified, ranging from the ability to overcome harsh seasonal conditions to obligate diapause dormancy. Ecologically, this involves adaptations to environmental conditions ranging from irregularly occurring and unpredictable events to regularly occurring and predictable conditions. Dispersal traits were grouped as directional migration (phoresy) and undirectional migration (anemochory). Distinctions were made between facultative and obligate phoresy and between carrier-specific and carrier-unspecific phoresy. A multi-dimensional system of tactics was outlined, based on well-defined underived traits. This system was compared with one- and two-dimensional schemes described by MacArthur and Wilson (1967), Grime (1977), and Southwood (1977) and with the multi-dimensional system described by Stearns (1976). For each tactic, relationships with the main biotopes in which it occurs were defined. Examples of species showing certain tactics were selected from the taxonomic orders of microarthropods. The generality of the traits for various groups of organisms and of the classification of life-history tactics developed was explored.

AB "Conservation genomics" encompasses the idea that genome-scale data will improve the capacity of resource managers to protect species. Although genetic approaches have long been used in conservation research, it has only recently become tractable to generate genome-wide data at a scale that is useful for conservation. In this Review, we discuss how genome-scale data can inform species delineation in the face of admixture, facilitate evolution through the identification of adaptive alleles, and enhance evolutionary rescue based on genomic patterns of inbreeding. As genomic approaches become more widely adopted in conservation, we expect that they will have a positive impact on management and policy decisions.

AB High-throughput sequencing is helping biologists to overcome the difficulties of inferring the phylogenies of recently diverged taxa. The present study analyzes the phylogenetic signal of genomic regions with different inheritance patterns using genome skimming and ddRAD-seq in a species-rich Andean genus (Diplostephium) and its allies.
   We analyzed the complete nuclear ribosomal cistron, the complete chloroplast genome, a partial mitochondrial genome, and a nuclear-ddRAD matrix separately with phylogenetic methods. We applied several approaches to understand the causes of incongruence among datasets, including simulations and the detection of introgression using the D-statistic (ABBA-BABA test).
   We found significant incongruence among the nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial phylogenies. The strong signal of hybridization found by simulations and the D-statistic among genera and inside the main clades of Diplostephium indicate reticulate evolution as a main cause of phylogenetic incongruence.
   Our results add evidence for a major role of reticulate evolution in events of rapid diversification. Hybridization and introgression confound chloroplast and mitochondrial phylogenies in relation to the species tree as a result of the uniparental inheritance of these genomic regions. Practical implications regarding the prevalence of hybridization are discussed in relation to the phylogenetic method.

AB Aim (1) To characterize the relationship(s) between species richness and area for alien plant and bird species on islands, and to identify commonalities and differences in those relationships for these different taxa, and between alien and native species; (2) to test whether area per se, native species richness or human factors related to area is the primary determinant of alien species richness; and (3) to explore the effects on alien island biogeography of isolation, productivity and the time since first European landfall.
   Location Islands around the world.
   Methods We used structural equation models (SEMs; supported by generalized linear models) to interrogate data on the alien and native species richness of birds and plants on islands.
   Results Alien plant and bird species richness were both strongly correlated with island area, with similar slopes on logarithmic axes. SEMs for both plants and birds revealed positive direct effects of native species richness and human population size, and positive indirect effects of area, on alien species richness. The models also identified indirect effects of temperature (positive) and isolation (negative) on alien species richness. Native plant and bird species richness were both predicted by direct effects of area (positive), temperature (positive) and isolation (negative). However, native plant richness was the only direct predictor of native bird species richness, and the strongest direct predictor of alien bird species richness, for islands with both plant and bird richness data.
   Main conclusions Our analyses recover the species-area, species-isolation and productivity relationships in native richness. Alien species richness was most strongly related to native species richness, with additional effects of human population size. Human population size most likely determines the number of alien species that arrive on an island, while the effect of native species richness may be driven by the influence of habitat heterogeneity on the likelihood that those populations persist (establishment success).

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles, or 'drones', appear to offer a flexible, accurate and affordable solution to some of the technical challenges of nature conservation monitoring and law enforcement. However, little attention has been given to their possible social impacts. In this paper, I review the possible social impacts of using drones for conservation, including on safety, privacy, psychological wellbeing, data security and the wider understanding of conservation problems. I argue that negative social impacts are probable under some circumstances and should be of concern for conservation for two reasons: (1) because conservation should follow good ethical practice; and (2) because negative social impacts could undermine conservation effectiveness in the long term. The paper concludes with a call for empirical research to establish whether the identified social risks of drones occur in reality and how they could be mitigated, and for self-regulation of drone use by the conservation sector to ensure good ethical practice and minimise the risk of unintended consequences.

AB Over the course of the last twenty years, participatory modeling has increasingly been advocated as an integral component of integrated, adaptive, and collaborative water resources management. However, issues of high cost, time, and expertise are significant hurdles to the widespread adoption of participatory modeling in many developing countries. In this study, a step-wise method to initialize the involvement of key stakeholders in the development of qualitative system dynamics models (i.e. causal loop diagrams) is presented. The proposed approach is designed to overcome the challenges of low expertise, time and financial resources that have hampered previous participatory modeling efforts in developing countries. The methodological framework was applied in a case study of soil salinity management in the Rechna Doab region of Pakistan, with a focus on the application of qualitative modeling through stakeholder-built causal loop diagrams to address soil salinity problems in the basin. Individual causal loop diagrams were developed by key stakeholder groups, following which an overall group causal loop diagram of the entire system was built based on the individual causal loop diagrams to form a holistic qualitative model of the whole system. The case study demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed approach, based on using causal loop diagrams in initiating stakeholder involvement in the participatory model building process. In addition, the results point to social-economic aspects of soil salinity that have not been considered by other modeling studies to date. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Climate warming is expected to induce treelines to advance to higher elevations. Empirical studies in diverse mountain ranges, however, give evidence of both advancing alpine treelines and rather insignificant responses. The inconsistency of findings suggests distinct differences in the sensitivity of global treelines to recent climate change. It is still unclear where Himalayan treeline ecotones are located along the response gradient from rapid dynamics to apparently complete inertia. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge regarding sensitivity and response of Himalayan treelines to climate warming, based on extensive field observations, published results in the widely scattered literature, and novel data from ongoing research of the present authors.
   Several sensitivity indicators such as treeline type, treeline form, seed-based regeneration, and growth patterns are evaluated. Since most Himalayan treelines are anthropogenically depressed, observed advances are largely the result of land use change. Near-natural treelines are usually krummholz treelines, which are relatively unresponsive to climate change. Nevertheless, intense recruitment of treeline trees suggests a great potential for future treeline advance. Competitive abilities of seedlings within krummholz thickets and dwarf scrub heaths will be a major source of variation in treeline dynamics. Tree growth-climate relationships show mature treeline trees to be responsive to temperature change, in particular in winter and pre-monsoon seasons. High pre-monsoon temperature trends will most likely drive tree growth performance in the western and central Himalaya. Ecological niche modelling suggests that bioclimatic conditions for a range expansion of treeline trees will be created during coming decades.

AB Climate change is profoundly affecting the evolutionary trajectory of individual species and ecological communities, in part through the creation of novel species assemblages. How climate change will influence competitive interactions has been an active area of research. Far less attention, however, has been given to altered reproductive interactions. Yet, reproductive interactions between formerly isolated species are inevitable as populations shift geographically and temporally as a result of climate change, potentially resulting in introgression, speciation, or even extinction. The susceptibility of hybridization rates to anthropogenic disturbance was first recognized in the 1930s. To date, work on anthropogenically mediated hybridization has focused primarily on either physical habitat disturbance or species invasion. Here, I review recent literature on hybridization to identify how ecological responses to climate change will increase the likelihood of hybridization via the dissolution of species barriers maintained by habitat, time, or behavior. Using this literature, I identify several cases where novel hybrid zones have recently formed, likely as a result of changing climate. Future research should focus on identifying areas and taxonomic groups where reproductive species interactions are most likely to be influenced by climate change. Furthermore, a better understanding of the evolutionary consequences of climate-mediated secondary contact is urgently needed. Paradoxically, hybridization is both a major conservation concern and an important source of novel genetic and phenotypic variation. Hybridization may therefore both contribute to increasing rates of extinction and stimulate the creation of novel phenotypes that will speed adaptation to novel climates. Predicting which result will occur following secondary contact will be an important contribution to conservation for many species.

AB Four fossil floras ranging in age from the mid Miocene to the early Pleistocene from the eastern Siwaliks near Darjeeling and in Arunachal Pradesh (AP) were compared taxonomically and subjected to a CLAMP (Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program) analysis using a new calibration dataset that includes sites from India, southern China and Thailand and high resolution gridded climate data. Two lower Siwalik mid Miocene floras yielded almost the same values suggesting mean annual temperatures (MATs) of 25.4 and 25.3 degrees C +/- 2.8 degrees C (all uncertainties +/- 2 sigma) with warm month mean temperatures (WMMTs) of 28.4 and 27.8 +/- 3.39 degrees C and cold month mean temperatures (CMMTs) of 17.9 and 21.3 +/- 4 degrees C. Precipitation estimates have high uncertainties but suggest a weak monsoon with growing season precipitations of 242 +/- 92 cm for Darjeeling and 174 +/- 92 cm for AP. Leaves from the middle Siwalik (Pliocene) sediments of AP indicate a lowering of the MAT to 23.7 degrees C, a function of cooler winter months (CMMT 16.9 degrees C). The AP early Pleistocene temperatures and rainfall were similar to those of the mid Miocene. Changes in the monsoon index suggest that in the AP area there has been little change in the intensity of the monsoon since mid Miocene time, while further west at Darjeeling there has been an intensification since the mid Miocene. Mid Miocene CLAMP-derived enthalpy estimates provide sea level (<200 a.m.s.l.) data for a re-evaluation of the palaeoelevation of a 15 Ma flora from the Namling-Oiyug Basin, southern Tibet. Enthalpy values from Darjeeling and AP were 354.1 and 355.8 +/- 10.3 kJ/kg respectively, while that derived from the Namling-Oiyug flora was 296.3 kJ/kg. This yields a palaeoelevation of 5888 m for the Namling site using the Darjeeling enthalpy estimate as a sea level datum and 6065 m using the AP assemblage. The combined uncertainty is +/- 728 m. Model corrected enthalpy trends at sea level across palaeolatitude and longitude reduce the mean elevation to 5.54 km. These elevations are higher than earlier estimates from the same site (but within uncertainty) and the corrected mean is similar to 1 km higher than the present day basin floor elevation in the region, suggesting some deflation since 15 Ma associated with east-west extension, particularly if a shift in the locus of deformation and uplift south to the Himalayas in post middle Miocene times relieved N-S compressional stress on southern Tibet.

AB This paper draws on the Foucauldian notion of biopower to renarrate the development of conservation science in the US as a form of liberal biopolitical rule. With its emphasis on making nature live, conservation marks a shift away from a sovereign form of rule that emphasized subduing and controlling nature; today, nature is ruled not by the sword but by science. Through a discussion of key concepts in conservation biology-populations in crisis; evolution and its future orientation; extinction as death that is necessary for life; and diversity as purity-we illustrate the truth discourses, underlying logics, and calculative technologies by which distinctions within nonhuman life are made and made meaningful. We argue that conservation is biopolitical not just in that it moves from controlling individuals to statistically managing populations and species, but also in that it extends the racialized logic of abnormality in its core notions of biological diversity and purity. In the logics of conservation and race, life produces diversity, conceived as variety of biological kinds; within that diversity exist kinds that foster ongoing life, which should be maximized, and kinds that are threats, which should be let die in the name of life in general.

We collected and analyzed 7707 samples of 17 widespread arctic-alpine plant species for amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). Genetic structure, diversity and distinctiveness were analyzed for each species, and extrapolated to cover the geographic range of each species. The resulting maps were overlaid to produce metamaps. The Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, the Greenlandic ice cap, the Urals, and lowland areas between southern mountain ranges and the Arctic were the strongest barriers against gene flow. Diversity was highest in Beringia and gradually decreased into formerly glaciated areas. The highest degrees of distinctiveness were observed in Siberia. We conclude that large-scale general patterns exist in the Arctic, shaped by the Pleistocene glaciations combined with long-standing physical barriers against gene flow. Beringia served as both refugium and source for interglacial (re)colonization, whereas areas further west in Siberia served as refugia, but less as sources for (re)colonization.

AB Bacterioplankton communities are deeply diverse and highly variable across space and time, but several recent studies demonstrate repeatable and predictable patterns in this diversity. We expanded on previous studies by determining patterns of variability in both individual taxa and bacterial communities across coastal environmental gradients. We surveyed bacterioplankton diversity across the Columbia River coastal margin, USA, using amplicon pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from 596 water samples collected from 2007 to 2010. Our results showed seasonal shifts and annual reassembly of bacterioplankton communities in the freshwater-influenced Columbia River, estuary, and plume, and identified indicator taxa, including species from freshwater SAR11, Oceanospirillales, and Flavobacteria groups, that characterize the changing seasonal conditions in these environments. In the river and estuary, Actinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria indicator taxa correlated strongly with seasonal fluctuations in particulate organic carbon (rho = -0.664) and residence time (rho=0.512), respectively. In contrast, seasonal change in communities was not detected in the coastal ocean and varied more with the spatial variability of environmental factors including temperature and dissolved oxygen. Indicator taxa of coastal ocean environments included SAR406 and SUP05 taxa from the deep ocean, and Prochlorococcus and SAR11 taxa from the upper water column. We found that in the Columbia River coastal margin, freshwater-influenced environments were consistent and predictable, whereas coastal ocean community variability was difficult to interpret due to complex physical conditions. This study moves beyond beta-diversity patterns to focus on the occurrence of specific taxa and lends insight into the potential ecological roles these taxa have in coastal ocean environments.

AB Little is known about the potential effect of climate warming on phyllosphere fungi, despite their important impact on the dynamics and diversity of plant communities. The structure of phyllosphere fungal assemblages along elevation gradients may provide information about this potential effect, because elevation gradients correspond to temperature gradients over short geographic distances. We thus investigated variations in the composition of fungal assemblages inhabiting the phyllosphere of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) at four sites over a gradient of 1000 m of elevation in the French Pyrenees Mountains, by using tag-encoded 454 pyrosequencing. Our results show that the composition of fungal assemblages varied significantly between elevation sites, in terms of both the relative abundance and the presenceabsence of species, and that the variations in assemblage composition were well correlated with variations in the average temperatures. Our results therefore suggest that climate warming might alter both the incidence and the abundance of phyllosphere fungal species, including potential pathogens. For example, Mycosphaerella punctiformis, a causal agent of leaf spots, showed decreasing abundance with elevation and might therefore shift to higher elevations in response to warming.

AB In masting trees, synchronized, heavy reproductive events are thought to deplete stored resources and to impose a replenishment period before subsequent masting. However, direct evidence of resource depletion in wild, masting trees is very rare. Here, we examined the timing and magnitude (local vs individual-level) of stored nutrient depletion after a heavy mast event in Pinus albicaulis.
   In 2005, the mast year, we compared seasonal changes in leaf and sapwood nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and leaf photosynthetic rates in cone-bearing branches, branches that never produced cones, and branches with experimentally removed cones. We also compared nutrient concentrations in cone branches and branches that had never had cones between 2005 and 2006, and measured tree ring width and new shoot growth during 2005.
   During the mast year, N or P depletion occurred only in tissue fractions of reproductive branches, where photosynthetic rates were reduced. However, by the end of the following year, nutrients were depleted in all branches, indicating individual-level resource depletion. New shoot and radial growth were not affected by masting.
   We provide direct evidence that mast events in wild trees deplete stored nutrients. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating reproductive costs over time and at the individual level.

AB Historic processes are expected to influence present diversity patterns in combination with contemporary environmental factors. We hypothesise that the joint use of beta diversity partitioning methods and a threshold-based approach may help reveal the effect of large-scale historic processes on present biodiversity. We partitioned intra-regional beta diversity into its turnover (differences in composition caused by species replacements) and nestedness-resultant (differences in species composition caused by species losses) components. We used piecewise regressions to show that, for amphibian beta diversity, two different world regions can be distinguished. Below parallel 37, beta diversity is dominated by turnover, while above parallel 37, beta diversity is dominated by nestedness. Notably, these regions are revealed when the piecewise regression method is applied to the relationship between latitude and the difference between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the present temperature but not when present energy-water factors are analysed. When this threshold effect of historic climatic change is partialled out, current energy-water variables become more relevant to the nestedness-resultant dissimilarity patterns, while mountainous areas are associated with higher spatial turnover. This result suggests that nested patterns are caused by species losses that are determined by physiological constraints, whereas turnover is associated with speciation and/or Pleistocene refugia. Thus, the new threshold-based view may help reveal the role of historic factors in shaping present amphibian beta diversity patterns.

AB The expansion of industrial oil palm cultivation threatens tropical biodiversity globally, especially in developing countries. Driven by plans to generate economic revenue, large-scale plantations are emerging in Southeast Asia, Africa and Brazilian Amazon. However, the ecological impacts of the sector are poorly studied with respect to oil palm management system, and recommended conservation measures are based on limited data. We studied avifauna in oil palm landscapes in Peninsular Malaysia under different management systems (large plantation estates versus smallholdings) and age classes (uniform age versus mixed-age stands). We sampled 41 large plantation estates and 14 smallholdings, as well as 20 sites in an extensively logged peat swamp forest, the type of natural forest prior to conversion to oil palms. Compared with logged peat swamp forest, our results showed that forest conversion to oil palm cultivation may have eliminated 48-60% of bird species. We also found: (i) plantation estates and smallholdings supported similar bird assemblages but the latter supported significantly more species (P = 0.007); and (ii) despite reduced species richness in oil palm landscapes, we found high abundance of some individual bird species in specific types of stands including some forest, migratory, and wetland species. Conversion of natural forest to oil palm landscapes should not occur in the future through clearing of primary or secondary native forests. To complement conventional conservation approaches (e.g. the establishment of protected areas) in palm oil-producing countries, existing plantation estates and smallholdings should be managed in ways to promote improved conservation outcomes, although oil palm landscapes maintained a fraction of the original forest biodiversity. Managing habitat heterogeneity at both a local and a landscape-level is highly recommended in oil palm landscapes to maintain and/or enhance avian biodiversity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Climate change impacts on vegetation are mediated by soil processes that regulate rhizosphere water balance, nutrient dynamics, and ground-level temperatures. For ecosystems characterized by high fine-scale substrate heterogeneity such as grasslands on poorly developed soils, effects of climate change on plant communities may depend on substrate properties that vary at the scale of individuals (< m2), leading to fine-scale shifts in community structure that may go undetected at larger scales. Here, we show in a long-running climate experiment in species-rich limestone grassland in Buxton, England (UK), that the resistance of the community to 15-year manipulations of temperature and rainfall at the plot scale (9 m2) belies considerable community reorganization at the microsite (100 cm2) scale. In individual models of the abundance of the 25 most common species with respect to climate treatment and microsite soil depth, 13 species exhibited significant soil depth affinities, and nine of these have shifted their position along the depth gradient in response to one or more climate treatments. Estimates of species turnover across the depth gradient reviewed in relation to measurements of water potential, nitrogen supply, pH, and community biomass suggest that communities of shallow microsites are responding directly to microenvironmental changes induced by climate manipulation, while those of the deepest microsites are shifting in response to changes in competitive interference from more nutrient-demanding species. Moreover, for several species in summer drought and winter heated treatments, climate response in deep microsites was opposite that of shallow microsites, suggesting microsite variation is contributing to community stability at the whole-plot level. Our study thus demonstrates a strong link between community dynamics and substrate properties, and suggests ecosystems typified by fine-scale substrate heterogeneity may possess a natural buffering capacity in the face of climate change.

AB Current methods underpinning environmental flow (eFlow) decisions often lack transparency, do not adequately consider uncertainties and rarely include adaptive management principles. We report the development and application of an eFlow Bayesian Network (BN) model that links four flow components with an ecological model to predict the spawning and recruitment of two important native fish species, the Australian Grayling and River Blackfish, in the highly regulated and flow-stressed lower Latrobe River in Victoria, Australia. Autumn high flows, in conjunction with low stream temperature, are critical for Grayling spawning. The BN model was used to predict the probability of spawning and recruitment of these two native fish species for four flow scenarios. Quantitative data, flow simulation models and expert judgement were used to parameterize the BN model. The model results showed clearly that currently, and into the future, there is a very low likelihood of spawning and recruitment of Australian Grayling in the lower Latrobe. River Blackfish are minimally affected by the predicted reductions in flow and increased stream temperatures. Management scenarios aimed at modifying flows and stream temperatures to increase the likelihood of successful spawning and recruitment of Australian Grayling were assessed. Self-sustaining populations of Australian Grayling could conceivably be achieved in the upper reaches of this river if fish passage was provided through an on-stream reservoir. A major benefit in building and applying an eFlow BN model is that it can facilitate meaningful analysis and discussion of the ecological effects of particular eFlow regimes.

AB Variation in organic matter inputs caused by differences in plant community composition has been shown to affect microbial activity, although the mechanisms controlling these effects are not entirely understood. In this study we determine the effects of variation in substrate composition, quantity, and diversity on soil extracellular enzyme activity and respiration in laboratory microcosms. Microbial respiration responded predictably to substrate composition and quantity and was maximized by the addition of labile substrates and greater substrate quantity. However, there was no effect of substrate diversity on respiration. Substrate composition significantly affected enzyme activity. Phosphatase activity was maximized with addition of C and N together, supporting the common notion that addition of limiting resources increases investment in enzymes to acquire other limiting nutrients. Chitinase activity was maximized with the addition of chitin, suggesting that some enzymes may be stimulated by the addition of the substrate they degrade. In contrast, activities of glucosidase and peptidase were maximized by the addition of the products of these enzymes, glucose and alanine, respectively, for reasons that are unclear. Substrate diversity and quantity also stimulated enzyme activity for three and four of the six enzymes assayed, respectively. We found evidence of complementary (i.e., non-additive) effects of additions of different substrates on activity for three of the six enzymes assayed; for the remaining enzymes, effects of adding a greater diversity of substrates appeared to arise from the substrate-specific effects of those substrates included in the high-diversity treatment. Finally, in a comparison of measures of microbial respiration and enzyme activity, we found that labile C and nutrient-acquiring enzymes, not those involved in the degradation of recalcitrant compounds, were the best predictors of respiration rates. These results suggest that while composition, quantity, and diversity of inputs to microbial communities all affect microbial enzyme activity, the mechanisms controlling these relationships are unique for each particular enzyme.

AB Some tropical cyanobacteria have spread to temperate freshwaters during the last decades. To evaluate their further development in temperate lakes, we studied the temperature- and light-dependent growth of three invasive (Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, Anabaena bergii and Aphanizomenon aphanizomenoides) and three native (Aphanizomenon gracile, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Anabaena macrospora) cyanobacterial species (Nostocales) from German lakes. We also included one potentially invasive (Aphanizomenon ovalisporum) Nostocales species. We conducted semi-continuous culture experiments and a microcosm experiment along a natural light gradient. Temperature data were used to design a model to simulate the development of selected species according to three temperature scenarios (past, present and future). Native species had significantly higher growth rates than invasive species and the potential invader A. ovalisporum at low temperatures (< 10 degrees C), while the opposite was true at high temperatures (>= 35 degrees C). Maximum growth rates of A. ovalisporum, A. aphanizomenoides and C. raciborskii were clearly higher than those of A. bergii and the native species. Regarding light-dependent growth, significant differences were found between single species but not between all native and invasive species. The model simulation demonstrates a shift in dominance from the native A. gracile in the historic scenario to C. raciborskii populations in the future scenario, in which also the potential invader A. ovalisporum is able to establish populations in temperate lakes. Our findings suggest that any further temperature increase would promote the growth and development of Nostocales species in general, and that of the invasive species in particular, and would enable a more northward expansion of A. ovalisporum.

AB 1. The structure of biological communities reflects the influence of both local environmental conditions and processes such as dispersal that create patterns in species' distribution across a region.
   2. We extend explicit tests of the relative importance of local environmental conditions and regional spatial processes to aquatic plants, a group traditionally thought to be little limited by dispersal. We used partial canonical correspondence analysis and partial Mantel tests to analyse data from 98 lakes and ponds across Connecticut (northeastern United States).
   3. We found that aquatic plant community structure reflects the influence of local conditions (pH, conductivity, water clarity, lake area, maximum depth) as well as regional processes.
   4. Only 27% of variation in a presence/absence matrix was explained by environmental conditions and spatial processes such as dispersal. Of the total explained, 45% was related to environmental conditions and 40% to spatial processes.
   5. Jaccard similarity declined with Euclidean distance between lakes, even after accounting for the increasing difference in environmental conditions, suggesting that dispersal limitation may influence community composition in the region.
   6. The distribution of distances among lakes where species occurred was associated with dispersal-related functional traits, providing additional evidence that dispersal ability varies among species in ways that affect community composition.
   7. Although environmental and spatial variables explained a significant amount of variation in community structure, a substantial amount of stochasticity also affects these communities, probably associated with unpredictable colonisation and persistence of the plants.

AB Ecological speciation is the process by which barriers to gene flow between populations evolve due to adaptive divergence via natural selection A relatively unexplored area in ecological speciation is the role of gene expression Gene expression may be associated with ecologically important phenotypes not evident from morphology and play a role during colonization of new environments Here we review two potential roles of gene expression in ecological speciation (1) its indirect role in facilitating population persistence and (2) its direct role in contributing to genetically based reproductive isolation We find indirect evidence that gene expression facilitates population persistence, but direct tests are lacking We also find clear examples of gene expression having effects on phenotypic traits and adaptive genetic divergence, but links to the evolution of reproductive isolation itself remain indirect Gene expression during adaptive divergence seems to often involve complex genetic architectures controlled by gene networks, regulatory regions, and "eQTL hotspots "Nonetheless, we review how approaches for isolating the functional mutations contributing to adaptive divergence are proving to be successful The study of gene expression has promise for increasing our understanding ecological speciation, particularly when integrative approaches are applied

AB The field of soil ecology has relatively few fundamental unifying principles that can be used to explain and predict patterns and processes in belowground ecosystems. Here we propose that a first step towards developing a more comprehensive set of unifying principles in soil ecology is to identify and understand the characteristics shared by a wide range of soils, the common mechanisms driving soil biogeochemical processes, and the biogeochemical constraints imposed on soil biota regardless of soil type. Very often, soil ecologists focus on the differences between soils when, in fact, many soils share a common set of ecological mechanisms that govern biogeochemical processes. Here we explore evidence for the existence of unifying principles in soil ecology, highlighting some of the similarities in carbon dynamics and soil communities across widely different soil types and examining the various mechanisms that may drive these similarities. Given that soils are extremely complex environments that exhibit substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity, defining overarching principles is, arguably, more challenging in soil ecology than in other disciplines. However, recent methodological advances hold great promise for testing and formulating unifying principles, particularly when such methods are used consistently, in concert with other interdisciplinary approaches, and across a range of sites. Soils are not identical, but they do exhibit consistent patterns and processes that, if explored more intensively, will affirm the existence of unifying principles in soil ecology.

AB We employed DNA sequence variation at two mitochondrial (control region, COI) regions from 212 individuals of Galaxias platei (Pisces, Galaxiidae) collected throughout Patagonia (25 lakes/rivers) to examine how Andean orogeny and the climatic cycles throughout the Quaternary affected the genetic diversity and phylogeography of this species. Phylogenetic analyses revealed four deep genealogical lineages which likely represent the initial division of G. platei into eastern and western lineages by Andean uplift, followed by further subdivision of each lineage into separate glacial refugia by repeated Pleistocene glacial cycles. West of the Andes, refugia were likely restricted to the northern region of Patagonia with small relicts in the south, whereas eastern refugia appear to have been much larger and widespread, consisting of separate northern and southern regions that collectively spanned most of Argentinean Patagonia. The retreat of glacial ice following the last glacial maximum allowed re-colonization of central Chile from nonlocal refugia from the north and east, representing a region of secondary contact between all four glacial lineages. Northwestern glacial relicts likely followed pro-glacial lakes into central Chilean Patagonia, whereas catastrophic changes in drainage direction (Atlantic -> Pacific) for several eastern palaeolakes were the likely avenues for invasions from the east. These mechanisms, combined with evidence for recent, rapid and widespread population growth could explain the extensive contemporary distribution of G. platei throughout Patagonia.

AB The fish assemblage structure was analyzed along an estuarine gradient of a small macrotidal estuary (the Canche, France). Fishes were collected every two months between May 2006 and July 2007 from 12 sampling stations using a 1.5-m beam trawl with a 5 mm mesh size in the cod end. To complement this information, sampling was also performed using 15-m fyke nets (8 mm mesh size in the cod end). For each sample, abiotic (temperature, salinity, pH, oxygen, turbidity, river flow, wind speed and depth) and biotic (macro crustacean species abundances) were recorded. Throughout the study, 28 fish species belonging to 20 families were collected. Fish catches were dominated by juveniles, especially Young-Of-the-Year (YOY) for the majority of the species. According to the Index of Relative Importance (IRI), common goby Pomatoschistus microps, flounder Platichtys flesus, sprat Sprattus sprattus, sea-bass Dicentrarchus labrax and plaice Pleuronectes platessa were the most abundant species, together accounting for 99.2% of the total IRI. Estuarine residents (ER = 66.2%) and marine juvenile migrants species (MJ = 31.4%) were the most important ecological guilds. The structure of the fish assemblage and its relationship to environmental variables was examined using multivariate techniques. Cluster and non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) analysis defined six distinct groups in the Canche estuary, which are discriminated by specific species (SIMPER). Spatio-temporal variations in fish assemblage structure reflect the density peaks of the most abundant species. Spearman rank correlations and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that among the ten environmental variables examined, temperature, salinity and Crangon crangon (a potential predator for YOY fish or prey for older ones) are the three most important factors influencing fish species richness and abundances. Our observations reinforce the idea that certain fish species may have different life history styles in different geographic areas. The present study highlights the necessity of a better knowledge of the connectivity between estuaries and adjacent marine areas. The Canche constitutes an important ecosystem for fishes and as it is subject to little anthropogenic disturbance; its ichthyofauna can be viewed as a reference or normal assemblage for small temperate macrotidal estuaries.

AB It is widely believed that the neutral theory of biodiversity cannot be used for parameter inference if the assumption of neutrality is not met. The goal of this work is to extend this neutral framework to quantify the intensity of recruitment limitation (limited dispersal plus environmental filtering) in natural species assemblages. We model several local communities as part of a larger metacommunity, and we assume that neutrality holds in each local community, but not in the metacommunity. The immigration rate m does not only reflect dispersal limitation into a given local community, but also the intensity of environmental filtering. We develop a novel statistical method to infer the immigration parameter m in each local community. Using simulated datasets, we show that m indeed depends on both dispersal limitation and on the intensity of environmental filtering. We then apply this method to a network of tropical tree plots in central Panama. Inferred recruitment rates m were positively correlated with the fraction of trees dispersed by mammals, and with annual rainfall, possibly due to a weaker environmental filtering as rainfall increases. Finally, m, as estimated from trees greater than 1 cm trunk diameter, were significantly larger than an estimation based on trees greater than 10 cm trunk diameter. This suggests a cumulative effect of environmental filtering upon trees throughout their ontogeny.

AB Plant species assemblages, communities or regional floras might be termed 'saturated' when additional immigrant species are unsuccessful at establishing due to competitive exclusion or other inter-specific interactions, or when the immigration of species is off-set by extirpation of species. This is clearly not the case for state, regional or national floras in the USA where colonization (i.e. invasion by exotic species) exceeds extirpation by roughly a 24 to 1 margin. We report an alarming temporal trend in plant invasions in the Pacific Northwest over the past 100 years whereby counties highest in native species richness appear increasingly invaded over time. Despite the possibility of some increased awareness and reporting of native and exotic plant species in recent decades, historical records show a significant, consistent long-term increase in exotic species (number and frequency) at county, state and regional scales in the Pacific Northwest. Here, as in other regions of the country, colonization rates by exotic species are high and extirpation rates are negligible. The rates of species accumulation in space in multi-scale vegetation plots may provide some clues to the mechanisms of the invasion process from local to national scales.

AB 1. Much ecological theory is based on the characterization of ecological habits of species as 'generalist' or 'specialist', but standard measures for placing species along a generalist-specialist gradient do not exist.
   2. We introduce a method for quantifying habitat specialization (i.e. relative niche widths) using species co-occurrence data. Generalists should co-occur with many species, whereas specialists should co-occur with relatively few species, given equal plot occurrences. We quantify this concept using a generalist-specialist metric (theta) derived from a beta diversity statistic.
   3. We evaluate the ability of our generalist-specialist metric to correctly rank species according to simulated (known) niche widths. Our technique is generally robust to a wide variety of niche distribution structures and sampling designs, but surveys strongly biased toward certain habitats can undermine the ability of theta to accurately describe niche widths for underrepresented species.
   4. We apply our technique to three spatially nested surveys of the large woody flora (> 1 cm d.b.h.) of the south-eastern USA. For each dataset we rank the generalist-specialist tendencies of all species of non-trivial occurrences, including 113 species across the Southeast, 71 species of southern Appalachian forests, and 44 species of the 6800-ha Joyce Kilmer-Slickrock Wilderness Area (NC and TN, USA).
   5. Rankings of species' theta-values were generally consistent among datasets of different spatial extent. Generalist species (e.g. Ilex opaca, Ulmus rubra, Morus rubra, Prunus serotina, Acer rubrum) were often those with large geographical ranges, particularly for theta-values from the largest dataset, and overall were more likely to be bird-dispersed, deciduous, and shade tolerant. South-eastern specialist species (e.g. Taxodium spp., Abies fraseri, Quercus laevis, Pinus pungens, Pinus palustris) were those associated with stressful or unusual conditions, such as a long duration of flooding, high fire frequency, or extreme cold or dry climates.
   6. Our study demonstrates that increasingly available, large-survey datasets can contribute niche-related species information in the absence of detailed environmental or habitat measurements. Applications include new assessments of relationships between species traits, ecological and environmental tolerances, and species packing in different assemblages.

AB It has been known for 50 years that the time period over which data are collected affects the shape of empirical species abundance distributions. However, despite a recent resurgence of interest in characterizing and explaining these patterns the temporal component of species abundance distributions has been largely ignored. I argue that it is essential to take account of time, and not only because sampling duration can have a profound influence on the perceived shape of the distribution. Partitions of species abundance distributions based on temporal occurrence in the record will facilitate tests of both biological and neutral models and may lead to a better understanding of rarity. These temporal partitions also have interesting, but as yet barely explored, parallels with spatial ones such as the core-satellite division. Moreover, changes in abundance distributions across all three of Preston's temporal scales (sampling time, ecological time and evolutionary time) present rich opportunities for ecological research.

AB The beneficial acclimation hypothesis ( BAH) is controversial. While physiological work all but assumes that the BAH is true, recent studies have shown that support for the BAH is typically wanting. The latter have been criticized for assessing the benefits of developmental plasticity rather than acclimation. Here we examine the BAH within a strong inference framework for five congeneric species of ameronothroid oribatid mites that occupy marine to terrestrial habitats. We do so by assessing responses of maximum speed, optimum temperature, and performance breadth, measured from - 10 degrees C to 35 degrees C, to four treatment temperatures ( 0 degrees, 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees C). We show that the BAH and its alternatives often make similar empirical predictions. Weak beneficial acclimation is characteristic of one of the more marine species. In the other two upper-shore and marine species, evidence exists for deleterious acclimation and the colder-is-better hypothesis. In the two fully terrestrial species, there is no plasticity. Lack of plasticity is beneficial when cue reliability is low or costs of plasticity are high, and the former seems plausible in terrestrial habitats. However, weak plasticity in the uppershore/marine species and the absence of plasticity in the terrestrial species might also be a consequence of phylogenetic constraint.

AB The use of indicator taxa for conservation planning is common, despite inconsistent evidence regarding their effectiveness. These inconsistencies may be the result of differences among species and taxonomic groups studied, geographic location, or scale of analysis. The scale of analysis can be defined by grain and extent, which are often confounded. Grain is the size of each observational unit and extent is the size of the entire study area. Using species occurrence records compiled by NatureServe from survey data, range maps, and expert opinion, we examined correlations in species richness between each of seven taxa (amphibians, birds, butterflies, freshwater fish, mammals, freshwater mussels, and reptiles) and total richness of the remaining six taxa at varying grains and extents in two regions of the US (Mid-Atlantic and Pacific Northwest). We examined four different spatial units of interest: hexagon (similar to 649 km(2)), subecoregion (3800-34,000 km(2)), ecoregion (8300 - 79,000 km(2)), and geographic region (315,000-426,000 km(2)). We analyzed the correlations with varying extent of analysis (grain held constant at the hexagon) and varying grain (extent held constant at the region). The strength of correlation among taxa was context dependent, varying widely with grain, extent, region, and taxon. This suggests that (1) taxon, grain, extent, and study location explain, in part, inconsistent results of previous studies; (2) planning based on indicator relationships developed at other grains or extents should be undertaken cautiously; and (3) planning based on indicator relationships developed in other geographic locations is risky, even if planning occurs at an equivalent grain and extent.

AB Adaptive radiations are extremely useful to understand factors driving speciation. A challenge in speciation research is to distinguish forces creating novelties and those relevant to divergence and adaptation. Recently, hybridization has regained major interest as a potential force leading to functional novelty and to the genesis of new species. Here, we show that introgressive hybridization is a prominent phenomenon in the radiation of sailfin silversides (Teleostei: Atheriniformes: Telmatherinidae) inhabiting the ancient Malili Lakes of Sulawesi, correlating conspicuously with patterns of increased diversity. We found the most diverse lacustrine species-group of the radiation to be heavily introgressed by genotypes originating from streams of the lake system, an effect that has masked the primary phylogenetic pattern of the flock. We conclude that hybridization could have acted as a key factor in the generation of the flock's spectacular diversity. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical evidence for massive reticulate evolution within a animal radiation.

AB 1. Transitional waters, described as critical transition zones because of their position at terrestrial, freshwater and marine interfaces, provide essential goods and services to the biosphere including human populations. These ecotones face increasing human influence mainly due to population density increase in coastal areas.
   2. Transitional water bodies have, to date, received little attention in the development of ecological status indicators, this is a critical deficiency when trying to meet the Water Framework Directive objective of all significant water bodies achieving good ecological status by the year 2015.
   3. In order to assess changes in transitional water communities many taxonomic-based indicators have already been proposed but there are a number of concerns for their use such as taxonomic classification difficulties, their unsuitability for multi-site comparisons and their inconsistent relationships with disturbance or stress.
   4. Alternative methods based on body size, abundance distribution among functional groups, functional diversity and productivity descriptors are proposed. These methods offer the opportunity to compare sites with different taxonomic compositions and allow derivation of indicators related to ecological status of communities under scrutiny.
   5. Finally, the suitability of these taxonomic-free descriptors to provide relevant information for each of the four main biotic compartments in coastal lagoons is discussed. The use of biomass distribution among functional groups for fish, benthos and macrophyte and to use body-size distribution for benthos and plankton is proposed.

AB Understanding what governs patterns of soil delta N-15 and delta C-13 is limited by the absence of these data assembled throughout the development of individual ecosystems. These patterns are important because stable isotopes of soil organic N and C are integrative indicators of biogeochemical processing of soil organic matter. We examined 615 N of soil organic matter (delta N-15(SOM)) and delta C-13(SOM) of archived soil samples across four decades from four depths of an aggrading forest in southeastern USA. The site supports an old-field pine forest in which the N cycle is affected by former agricultural fertilization, massive accumulation of soil N by aggrading trees over four decades, and small to insignificant fluxes of N via NH3 volatilization, nitrification, and denitrification. We examine isotopic data and the N and C dynamics of this ecosystem to evaluate mechanisms driving isotopic shifts over time. With forest development, delta C-13(SOM) became depth-dependent. This trend resulted from a decline of similar to 2 parts per thousand. in the surficial 15 cm of mineral soil to -26.07 parts per thousand, due to organic matter inputs from forest vegetation. Deeper layers exhibited relatively little trend in delta C-13(SOM) with time. In contrast, delta N-15(SOM) was most dynamic in deeper layers. During the four decades of forest development, the deepest layer (35-60 cm) reached a maximum delta N-15 value of 9.1 parts per thousand, increasing by 7.6 parts per thousand, The transfer of > 800 kg ha(-1) of soil organic N into aggrading vegetation and the forest floor and the apparent large proportion of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi in these soils suggest that fractionation via microbial transformations must be the major process changing delta N-15 in these soils. Accretion of isotopically enriched compounds derived from microbial cells (i.e., ECM fungi) likely promote isotopic enrichment of soils over time. The work indicates the rapid rate at which ecosystem development can impart delta N-15(SOM) and delta C-13(SOM) signatures associated with undisturbed soil profiles.

AB Hubbell's unified neutral theory is a zero-sum ecological drift model in which population sizes change at random in a process resembling genetic drift, eventually leading to extinction. Diversity is maintained within the community by speciation. Hubbell's model makes predictions about the distribution of species abundances within communities and the turnover of species from place to place (beta diversity). However, ecological drift cannot be tested adequately against these predictions without independent estimates of speciation rates, population sizes, and dispersal distances. A more practical prediction from ecological drift is that time to extinction of a population of size N is approximately 2N generations. I test this prediction here using data for passerine birds (Passeriformes). Waiting times to speciation and extinction were estimated from genetic divergence between sister populations and a lineage-through-time plot for endemic South American suboscine passerines. Population sizes were estimated from local counts of birds in two large forest plots extrapolated to the area of wet tropical forest in South America and from atlas data on European passerines. Waiting times to extinction (ca. 2 Ma) are much less than twice the product of average population size (4.0 and 14.4 x 10(6) individuals in South America and Europe) and generation length (five and three years) for songbirds, that is, 40 and 86 Ma, respectively. Thus, drift is too slow to account for turnover in regional avifaunas. Presumably, other processes, involving external drivers, such as climate and physiographic change, and internal drivers, such as evolutionary change in antagonistic interactions, predominate. Hubbell's model is historical and geographic, and his perspective importantly links local and regional process and pattern. Ecological reality can be added to the mix while retaining Hubbell's concept of continuity of communities in space and time.

AB Over several decades, the distribution patterns and evolution of alpine disjunct species has become an increasingly discussed subject. Large scale genetic analysis has allowed the resolution of the past range changes and intraspecific evolution of many species, in Europe especially of Mediterranean origin. However, the phylogeographic structures of species with arctic-alpine disjunct distribution patterns are relatively poorly studied. The existing phylogeographic analysis (mostly of alpine plant species) supports disjunct distributions during glacial as well as post-glacial periods for a number of species. However, several questions still remain unresolved and we therefore analysed the Mountain Ringlet Erebia epiphron as a model for such alpine disjunct species. We found strong differentiation into five different lineages supporting five differentiation centres: (i) the eastern Pyrenees, (ii) the mountain ranges between the central Pyrenees and south-western Alps, (iii, iv) two areas along the southern Alps margin and (v) the northern Alps margin. We propose that these patterns evolved due to the humidity requirements of this species, which did not allow survival in the dry glacial steppes, but along the margins of the wetter glaciated high mountain ranges.

AB Historically, carbon limitation, through a shortage of photoassimilates has been argued to limit the growth of trees at the upper altitudinal treeline. In a three-year free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment, two species of 30-year-old alpine conifers (Larix decidua and Pinus uncinata) were studied to test this hypothesis in situ in the Swiss Central Alps (2180 m above sea level). CO2 enrichment was combined with foliage removal to test the effect of altered source-sink relationships on tree growth and leaf level responses. Elevated CO2 enhanced photosynthesis and increased nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations in the needles of both species. While the deciduous larch trees showed longer needles and a stimulation of shoot growth over all three seasons when grown in situ under elevated CO2, pine trees showed no such responses. Irrespective of CO2 concentration, defoliation in both species stimulated photosynthesis and increased stomatal conductance in remaining current-year needles in the treatment year and reduced leaf nitrogen concentration in the year following defoliation. Defoliated larch trees had fewer and shorter needles with reduced NSC concentrations in the year following defoliation and showed no stimulation in shoot elongation when exposed to elevated CO2. In contrast, defoliation of evergreen pine trees had no effect on needle NSC concentrations, but stimulated shoot elongation when defoliated trees were exposed to elevated CO2. After three years, our results suggest that deciduous larch is carbon limited at treeline, while evergreen pine is not. However, as indicated by the defoliation treatment, the carbon economy of these trees can clearly be modified by extreme events. The expected changes in growth of these treeline trees with improving carbon availability as atmospheric CO2 continues to increase will thus depend on both the interplay between biotic and abiotic processes, and the species or tree functional types involved.

AB Determining the diets of marine invertebrates by gut content analysis is problematic. Many consumed organisms become unrecognizable once partly digested, while those with hard remains (e.g. diatom skeletons) may bias the analysis. Here, we adapt DNA-based methods similar to those used for microbial diversity surveys as a novel approach to study the diets of macrophagous (the deep-sea amphipods Scopelocheirus schellenbergi and Eurythenes gryllus) and microphagous (the bivalve Lucinoma aequizonata) feeders in the deep sea. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in conjunction with 'universal' primers amplified portions of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene for animals ingested by S. schellenbergi and E. gryllus and the 18S rRNA gene for lesser eukaryotes ingested by L. aequizonata. Amplified sequences were combined with sequences from GenBank to construct phylogenetic trees of ingested organisms. Our analyses indicate that S. schellenbergi, E. gryllus and L. aequizonata diets are considerably more diverse than previously thought, casting new light on the foraging strategies of these species. Finally, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this technique and its potential applicability to diet analyses of other invertebrates.

AB Surveys of natural habitats often indicate that native and exotic species richness are positively correlated Lit large scales and negatively correlated at small scales. The small-scale relationship is often presented as evidence that native richness can repel invasion or conversely that exotic invasions can reduce native diversity. The larger scale pattern has been interpreted as evidence of the importance of facilitation, variable habitat quality, propagule supply, and other ecological phenomena. However, these explanations fail to consider expected native-exotic richness relationships under a null model assuming no species interactions. We show via simulation that the null expectation for a randomly assembled community is a negative relationship between native and exotic species richness at the smallest scales and. when plots vary in total richness, a positive relationship at larger Scales. We outline a procedure to compare observational data to this null expectation using, a permutation test of labels of species origin (native or exotic). Our use of this technique on plant community data indicates that patterns of native and exotic richness are remarkably similar to those generated by a null model. We argue that a null model approach is needed to evaluate whether observed native-exotic richness data deviate significantly from expected patterns generated by sampling and statistical artifacts.

AB In the context of neutral theories of community ecology, a novel genealogy-based framework has recently furnished an analytic extension of Ewens' sampling multivariate abundance distribution, which also applies to a random sample from a local community. Here, instead of taking a multivariate approach, we further develop the sampling theory of Hubbell's neutral spatially implicit theory and derive simple abundance distributions for a random sample both from a local community and a metacommunity. Our result is given in terms of the average number of species with a given abundance in any randomly extracted sample. Contrary to what has been widely assumed, a random sample from a metacommunity is not fully described by the Fisher log-series, but by a new distribution. This new sample distribution matches the log-series expectation at high biodiversity values (theta > 1) but clearly departs from it for species-poor metacommunities (theta < 1). Our theoretical framework should be helpful in the better assessment of diversity and testing of the neutral theory by using abundance data.

AB Since the beginning of industrialisation the global mean surface temperature has increased and, as a consequence, the amount and distribution of precipitation have changed. The impact of this global climate change is largest in the continental regions of the Northern Hemisphere. As a consequence climate change in southern Germany is more pronounced compared to the global trend (Abb. 2 to 4). According to results from regional climate models this development will continue during the next decades and will lead to hot and dry summers whereas the spring will become wetter causing severe flooding events. European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), one of the most important forest tree species in southern Germany, is particularly affected by the increase of periods of drought in summer and periods of heavy rain in fall and spring with oxygen depletion in the soil (Abb. 6 to 8). The drought- and flooding-sensitive beech already now shows reduced growth and reduced competitive capacity especially of the seedlings at extreme sites. These negative effects are supposed to be continued and further extended by the changing climate during the next decades. The competitive capacity of beech will further be reduced by the limited capability of this species compared to other forest trees to take advantage from the increasing atmospheric CO, content (Abb. 5). In contrast to these results from investigations by different disciplines of natural sciences, forest political decisions in southern Germany one-sided supported and still support the use of beech. The sylvicultural practices resulting from these political decisions will negatively affect the sustainability of forest development in southern Germany. The current action requirements and research needs are discussed.

AB Attacks by large carnivores on humans can occasionally help to generate significant resistance to carnivore conservation efforts. We have reviewed research addressing concerns for human safety in large carnivore conservation, and have evaluated statements about the frequencies and causes of attacks based on our findings concerning i) existing data on the number of attacks by large carnivores in various parts of the world; ii) information systems documenting details of attacks; and iii) research that provides credible advice on what to do when encountering a large carnivore, to minimize the likelihood of being attacked. We conclude that little information exists for any of these criteria and what is available is often inadequate to determine the frequency of attacks, their causes and how to avoid them. We suggest that information systems, including database(s) on attacks and encounters, should be established for large carnivore conservation efforts, to supply information and to answer future requests for this information.

AB We present a mechanistic underpinning For various discrete-time population models that can produce limit cycles and chaotic dynamics. Specific examples include the discrete-time logistic model and the Hassell model, which for a long time eluded convincing mechanistic interpretations, and also the Ricker- and Beverton-Holt models. We first formulate a continuous-time resource consumption model for the dynamics within a year, and from that we derive a discrete-time model for the between-year dynamics. Without influx of resources from the outside into the system, the resulting between-year dynamics is always overcompensating and hence may produce complex dynamics as well as extinction in finite time. We recover a connection between various standard types of continuous-time models for the resource dynamics within a year on the one hand and various standard types of discrete-time models for the population dynamics between years on the other. The model readily generalizes to several resource and consumer species as well as to more than two trophic levels for the within-year dynamics. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Studies of plant and animal assemblages from both the terrestrial and the marine fossil records reveal persistence for extensive periods of geological time, sometimes millions of years. Persistence does not require lack of change or the absence of variation from one occurrence of the assemblage to the next in geological time. It does, however, imply that assemblage composition is bounded and that variation occurs within those bounds. The principal cause for these patterns appears to be species-, and perhaps clade-level, environmental fidelity that results in long-term tracking of physical conditions. Other factors that influence persistent recurrence of assemblages are historical, biogeographic effects, the "law of large numbers," niche differentiation, and biotic interactions. Much research needs to be done in this area, and greater uniformity is needed in the approaches to studying the problem. However, great potential also exists for enhanced interaction between paleoecology and neoecology in understanding spatiotemporal complexity of ecological dynamics.

AB Knowledge about the impact of human activity on the behavior of wolves (Cams lupus) is important to predict habitats suitable for wolf recolonization and for planning management zones. We tested the hypothesis that wolves live spatiotemporally segregated from humans. From 1994 to 1999, we radiotracked 11 wolves in 4 packs and monitored human activity in the Bialowieza Forest, Poland. Wolves avoided permanent human-made structures (settlements, forest. edge to arable land, roads, tourist trails) more in the day than at night. Wolf avoidance increased with increasing human use. Particularly large settlements and intensively used public roads reduced the area used by wolves. Wolves avoided human presence in the forest (traffic, forestry operations) by temporarily selecting areas where people were absent. One of the wolf packs selected a national park zone with restriced access (50 km(2)) as the core area of its home range in both day and night. Conversely, wolf packs living in a commercial forest with small nature reserves (less than or equal to4 km(2)) did not select. reserves in the day or night. We concluded that spatiotemporal segregation is an adaptation of wolves to coexist with humans while keeping their activity pattern optimized toward food acquisition. The distribution of areas with restricted human access, forest, settlements, and intensively used public roads are important factors determining the suitability of an area for wolves.

AB Conservation of aquatic resources requires management of both fishing effort and the mosaic of habitats Used by nekton that sustain fisheries production. Within this context, "environment" is viewed as the sum of the abiotic and biotic surroundings, including habitat and other organisms, whereas, "habitat" is viewed as the localized structured component that acts as a template of organization and attractor for nekton. Although there is much debate, it is generally believed that nekton survival depends upon approaching their physiological optima first and then behaviorally searching out the appropriate life-stage-dependent habitat. Deviation from the optimal environment increases mortality and/or decreases production. This conceptual view possesses both dynamic (physical-chemical) and stationary (structural) components. Young estuarine-dependent nekton respond hierarchically to environmental conditions which will "deliver" them into the optimal nursery zones within the landscape leading to higher survival, growth, and production. Variability in climatic conditions coupled with large-scale El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)/LaNina events influence recruitment and can shift the position of the dynamic component such that it either does not overlap the stationary component or does so infrequently and only to a small degree. Under these conditions, habitat is considered a limiting factor when these two components are spatially/temporally uncoupled or when access to the structural component is lost due to development or other anthropogenic impacts. For example, habitat alteration clue to blkkheading/filling eliminates or redLices access to intertidal salt marshes, which are vital to estuarine ecosystem processes. Additionally, these anthropogenic activities also lead to habitat. fragmentation, a change in the spatial arrangement of important habitats along the estuarine axis, and potentially to shifts in the source/sink balance of the estuary. These changes can alter ecosystem health, dynamics, and ultimately productivity. Understanding linkages between these components of the environment is important to aquatic management. The focus of this article is to present a conceptual model that links the environment-habitat mosaic with production, and to illustrate the impact of habitat loss on estuarine productivity. This approach is valuable for 1) predicting the outcome of perturbations, 2) development of a better understanding of the linkages between components of the environment, and 3) providing a basis for future research using a more holistic approach.

Morphological methods for identifying prey components after consumption often fail to make accurate identifications of invertebrates because prey morphology becomes damaged during capture, ingestion and digestion. Another disadvantage of morphological methods for prey identification is that they often involve sampling procedures that are disruptive for the predator, such as stomach flushing or lethal collection. We have developed a DNA-based method for identifying species of krill (Crustacea: Malacostraca), an enormously abundant group of invertebrates that are directly consumed by many groups of marine vertebrates. The DNA-based approach allows identification of krill species present in samples of vertebrate stomach contents, vomit, and, more importantly, faeces. Utilizing samples of faeces from vertebrate predators minimizes the impact of dietary studies on the subject animals. We demonstrate our method first on samples of Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) stomach contents, where DNA-based species identification can be confirmed by prey morphology. We then apply the method to faeces of Adelie penguins and to faeces of the endangered pygmy blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda). In each of these cases, krill species consumed by the predators could be identified from their DNA present in faeces or stomach contents.

AB I examined a data set of 77 protected areas in the USA (including national and state parks) to determine which of the following variables most strongly influence alien plant species richness: park area, climate (temperature and precipitation), native species richness, visitation rate, local human population size, total road length, park shape and duration of European settlement. Many of these predictor variables are intercorrelated, so I used multiple regression to help separate their effects. In support of previous studies, native species richness was the best single predictor of alien species richness, probably because it was a good estimator of both park area and habitat diversity available for establishment of alien species. Other significant predictors of alien species richness were years of occupation of the area by European settlers and the human population size of adjacent counties. Climate, visitation rate, road length and park shape did not influence alien species richness. The proportion of alien species (alien richness/native richness) is inversely related to park area, in agreement with a previous study. By identifying which variables are most important in determining alien species richness, such findings suggest ways to reduce alien species establishment.

AB We compared responses to drought and re-watering of greenhouse:-grown cuttings of Populus x euramericana (Dude) Guinier clones, Luisa Avanzo and Dorskamp. Total leaf area, leaf number, leaf area increment and stomata] conductance were evaluated periodically during a 29-day drought period and for 16 days after re-watering. Soil water content and predawn leaf water potential (Psi(wp)) were measured on Days 29 and 45. On the same days, relative water content (RWC), specific leaf area (SLA), nitrogen, chlorophyll, soluble sugars, total phenols, flavanols and antioxidant activity were determined for leaves taken from the bottom to the top of each cutting. Leaves of Luisa Avanzo cuttings grew more rapidly than leaves of Dorskamp and exhibited higher SLA, but lower concentrations of nitrogen, chlorophyll and soluble sugars and lower antioxidant activity per unit area. On Day 29, after withholding water, both clones had closed their stomata, reduced rates of leaf growth, and lower Psi(wp) and RWC; however, the clones differed in their responses to soil water depletion. Compared to Dorskamp, Luisa Avanzo closed its stomata earlier and maintained higher Psi(wpz), but lower RWC and leaf sugar concentrations. Antioxidant activity of leaf methanolic extracts decreased in response to water stress only in Luisa Avanzo. Leaf physiology and its modulation by water stress were age dependent in Luisa Avanzo.

AB In this paper we demonstrate how broad scale comparative physiology has an important role to play in informing a variety of assumptions made in macroecology. We do so by examining large-scale geographic variation in insect development, thermal tolerance and metabolic rate. From these studies, and those from the literature on insect water loss and thermoregulation, we show that there is often a bias to the geographic extent of available empirical data. Studies of cold hardiness are most usually undertaken at high latitudes, while investigations Of upper thermal tolerances and water loss are most common in warm arid regions. Likewise, we demonstrate that much variation in insect physiological tolerances is partitioned at higher taxonomic levels, which has important implications for comparative physiology. Intriguingly, data on the full range of variables we review are available for only three species. We also show that, despite its importance, body size is regularly reported in only some kinds of investigations (metabolic rate, water loss rate), whereas in others (upper lethal temperature, cold hardiness, development) this variable is often ignored. In short, although large-scale comparative physiology can contribute considerable understanding to both physiology and ecology, there is much that remains to be done. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB When resources are limited, parents should decide the optimal number, size, and sex of progeny, and offspring should decide the optimal allocation of resources to different costly functions, such as growth and immunity. We manipulated clutch sizes of Eurasian kestrels by one egg to estimate possible cumulative effects of incubation and chick rearing costs on parental body condition, feeding effort, and offspring viability, No obvious effects of clutch size manipulations on feeding effort were found while feeding effort was adjusted to the original clutch size. Enlarged and control nests suffered from higher nestling mortality than reduced nests, and chicks of the enlarged group were in poorer body condition than chicks of the reduced group. Controlling For body mass, male chicks exhibited lower cell-mediated immunity assessed by a cutaneous hypersensitivity response than females, but only in treatments suffering from food restrictions, as indicated by chick starvation. These novel results reveal inter-sexual differences in physiological strategies in early, life, suggesting sex-related differences in susceptibility to disease and consequently in survival prospects of offspring.

AB The utility of individual based models (IBMs) is that properties of ecological systems can be derived by considering the properties of individuals constituting them. Individual differences may be physiological, behavioral or may arise from interactions among individuals. The differences result in unique life histories, which when considered as a whole give rise to growth and size distributions that provide a measure of the state of the population. Early IBMs generally did not consider the effect of a spatially variable physical environment. Recent advances in ocean circulation models that include realistic temporal and spatial variation of currents, turbulence, light, prey, etc., have enabled IBMs to be embedded in model flow fields and for unique, sometimes behaviorally modified, Lagrangian trajectories to be computed. The explicit consideration of realistic spatial heterogeneity provides an additional factor that contributes to the differentiation among individuals, to variances in population structure, and ultimately to our understanding of the recruitment process. This is particularly important in marine environments where fronts, boundary layers, pycnoelines, gyres and other smaller spatial features have been hypothesized to play a significant role in determining vital rates and population structure. In this paper we will review the status of research on spatially-explicit IBMs, their successes, limitations and future developments. Examples will be drawn from approaches used in the past decade in GLOBEC, FOCI, SABRE and other programs.

AB Acanthochromis polyacanthus is an unusual tropical marine damselfish that uniquely lacks pelagic larvae and has lost the capacity for broad-scale dispersal among coral reefs. On the modern Great Barrier Reef (GBR), three color morphs meet and hydridize at two zones of secondary contact. Allozyme electrophoreses revealed strong differences between morphs from the southern zone but few differences between morphs from the northern counterpart, thus suggesting different contact histories. We explore the phylogeography of Acanthochromis polyacanthus with mitochondrial cytochrome b region sequences (alignment of 565 positions) obtained from 126 individuals representing seven to 12 fish from 13 sites distributed over 12 reefs of the GBR and the Coral Sea. The samples revealed three major clades: (1) black fish collected from the southern GBR; (2) bicolored fish collected from the GBR and one reef (Osprey) from the northern Coral Sea; (3) black and white monomorphs collected from six reefs in the Coral Sea. All three clades were well supported (72-100%) by bootstrap analyses. Sequence divergences were very high between the major clades (mean = 7.6%) as well as within them (2.0-3.6%). Within clades, most reefs segregated as monophyletic assemblages. This was revealed both by phylogenetic analyses and AMOVAs that showed that 72-90% of the variance originated from differences among groups, whereas only 5-13% originated within populations. These patterns are discussed in relation to the known geological history of coral reefs of the GBR and the Coral Sea. Finally, we ask whether the monospecific status of Acanthochromis should be revisited because the sequence divergences found among our samples is substantially greater than those recorded among well-recognized species in other reef fishes.

AB The body composition of protein and fat in Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and brown trout Salmo trutta before and after winter was investigated in a temperate. small river, normally ice covered from the middle of November until the end of March. Fat. protein and specific energy declined greatly in winter brit were replenished rapidly in spring. Rates of decline were slower for the smallest fish, which also had the lowest specific content of fat, protein, and energy, while the differences in absolute amounts were greatest for the largest fish. The mean specific fat content was reduced by 45-70% during winter, relative to the pre-winter period (September). Mean daily reductions in specific enegy of the larger size groups of brown trout (3.7 x 10(-3)kJ g(-1) day(-1)) were almost half of the corresponding values for the largest Atlantic salmon (6.3 x 10(-3) kJ g(-1) day (-1)) during winter. A minor reduction in protein content was found during winter, with mean reductions of 6-10% in comparison to those in September. During spring the fat content was replenished rapidly, particularly for the smallest salmon fry (a threefold increase from April to June. Fat content in the larger salmon and trout increased by about 1.8 times. Based on estimated metabolic rates. digested energy during wintertime may contribute about two-thirds of the brown trout fry's energy demand. For Atlantic salmon, the corresponding value is about 50%. The winter period put considerable stress on the young salmonids lining in lotic environments, in particular for the smallest fry with the lowest energy content before winter and the largest losses during winter. This should make the fry more vulnerable to adverse abiotic and biotic factors. (C) 1998 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

AB The occurrence of naturally regenerated Picea abies (L.) Karst. emergent seedlings (i.e., ii year old) and established seedlings (>1 year old and up to 1.3 m in height) was monitored in relation to the occurrence of microrelief conditions in 10 old-growth swamp forests in northern Sweden. Further, nine different microhabitat types were defined in relation to the microrelief and bryophyte species present, and for five of the forest sites, a 4-year sowing experiment was performed by placing P. abies seeds in each microhabitat type. Although logs, roots, and stumps only occupied 14% of the forest floor, 43% of P. abies regeneration occurred in these microrelief conditions. Hummocks occupied 35% of the forest floor and harboured 48% of the regeneration, while hollows and flat ground occupied 49% of the forest floor but included only 9% of the regeneration. Seedling emergence from sown seeds was highest in the Sphagnum spp. microhabitats and lowest in the Hylocomium splendens (Hedw.) and Pleurozium schreberi (Brid.) microhabitats. Seedling establishment was highest in the presence of Sphagnum spp. and Pleurozium growing on logs. Seedling mortality was mainly caused by smothering by bryophytes. Elevated microhabitats are thus crucial for P. abies regeneration and should consequently be considered in the management of boreal swamp forests.

AB Macroecologists interpret correlates of body size and geographical range size in an ecological context, but these patterns may also reflect historical or phylogenetic forces.  We examined the relationship between range size and body size for a monophyletic group of 27 North American minnow species.  Body size and range size were positively correlated, but both variables were also correlated with latitude.  After controlling for effects of latitude, body size and range size were no longer correlated.  The basal dichotomy of the cladogram defined an eastern and western clade; they differed in their geological and climatic histories and macroecological patterns.  Within the western clade, only Bergmann's rule was confirmed.  Within the eastern clade, both longitude and latitude of geographical range were positively correlated with body size.  A simple measure of phylogeny was correlated with range size:  species branching near the cladogram root had larger geographical ranges than species branching distally.  After statistically removing the effects of latitude, longitude, and phylogeny, there was a significant positive correlation between body size and range size.  Macroecological patterns are sensitive to phylogeny and speciation history, and they may be most informative for clades that occupy areas with a common climatic history.

AB The woody vegetation of 131 clear-cut, postlogged boreal forest stands in central Canada, previously dominated by Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP., is compared with 250 natural postfire stands from the same region. Each dataset represents a stand chronosequence on a range of substrate types. Correspondence analysis (CA) based ordination methods is used for structural and compositional comparison in order to address the question of the extent to which woody vegetation recovery and succession are similar between the two disturbance types. In addition, canonical CA is used as a general linear model strategy to examine unique and covariant influences on forest composition. The postlogged stand dataset had a much lower representation of conifer-dominated stands than the postfire dataset and a far greater proportion of stands dominated by poplars. Detrended and canonical CA on all 381 stands indicated a primary influence on stand composition due to site factors, but disturbance type and intensity, i.e. wildfire versus horse or mechanical hauling in postlogged stands, showed the strongest correlation of any single variable. Analyses of each dataset, separately, indicated similar predictability of vegetation composition from associated stand environmental and age data but regressions were weak (R-2 similar to 22%). Whereas skidding type and stand age were the most important correlates with the postlogged data, soil variables were the most prominent correlates with the postfire woody vegetation. In addition to Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. dominated woodland deriving from postfire succession, such forests also arose on a widespread basis in horse skidded, postlogged stands through the persistence of advanced growth seedlings. Mechanically skidded, postlogged stands show a wholesale conversion from conifer dominance, mostly Picea mariana, to dominance by Populus. It is concluded that both the qualitative nature and the intensity of boreal forest disturbance lead to different woody vegetation recovery patterns.

AB Lynx Lynx lynx (Linnaeus, 1758) - ungulate relationships were studied in the exploited (530 km(2)) and pristine (47.5 km(2)) parts of Bialowieza Primeval Forest during 1985 through 1992. In pristine forest, Sus scrofa (54%) and Cervus elaphus (35%) predominated in the ungulate community. In exploited forest, C. elaphus (36%) and Capreolus capreolus (33%) were most abundant. Seat analysis indicated that cervids comprised 87% of biomass consumed by lynxes in the cold season; Lepus europaeus were 11%, and S. scrofa 2%. Hare was 2.5 times higher in the lynx diet in the exploited forest than in the pristine forest. Among 138 carcasses of ungulates killed by lynx in exploited forests in cold seasons, 76% were roe deer. In the pristine forests, red deer (61%) and roe deer (28%) were equally positively selected. Lynx did not select roe deer for any sex/age class but did select red deer fawns. Snowtracking showed that lynx attempted 1 attack on deer, 2 on medium-sized prey, and 6 on rodents in their daily route. Lynx fed an average of 3 - 4 days on a killed deer. Eight species of scavengers (mainly wild boar and red fox) fed on lynx's kills. Analysis of 1090 ungulate carcasses found in Bialowieza Forest showed that predation was responsible for 75% of known natural mortality in red deer (66% by wolf Canis lupus Linnaeus, 1758; 9% by lynx), 62% in roe deer (37% by lynx, 25% by wolf), 27% in moose (all by wolf), and 12% in wild boar (11% by wolf, 1% by lynx). Review of studies from the Palaearctic region revealed that the share of hare in lynx diet positively correlated with latitude, whereas the share of ungulates was inversely related to latitude. From Palaearctic ungulates that ranged from 15 kg body mass (Moschus moschiferus) to 920 bg (male Bison bonasus), the lynx selected the smallest species available. Mean electivity index (D) for 9 ungulate species was negatively correlated with their log body mass. In the Palaearctic region, predation contributed, on average, 1% to the natural mortality of European bison, 25% to that of wild boar, 59% of moose, 80% of red deer, and 85% of roe deer. Of total predation-caused mortality, the average share caused by lynx was 46% in roe deer, 14% in red deer and little or none in wild boar, moose, and bison.

AB Species-habitat relationships are an important aspect of fish life history, particularly in early ontogeny. To address the lack of information on the microhabitat use/requirements of European coarse fishes, particularly 0-group fishes in riverine systems, an empirical model was generated from data collected in the River Great Ouse catchment (UK). During 7 weeks in autumn 1990, data on young-of-the-year (0+) juvenile fishes and 15 environmental variables were collected at 2800 stratified, random point samples within 130 study sites (streams, rivers, side-channels, backwaters). Of 24 species of 0+ fish, only 10 were captured in greater-than-or-equal-to 3% of non-null samples. Association analysis and canonical correspondence analysis of the samples-by-species (967 x 10) and samples-by-variables (967 x 15) data matrices revealed that the shallow, narrow, lotic, stony-pebbly channel microhabitat of riffles and runs was preferred by the progeny of substrate-spawning, substrate/plant-spawning and nest-guarding fishes. Moderately deeper and wider, sinuous channels, with slow-to-moderate water velocities and medium-sized substrata were also favourable to progeny of substrate spawners. Assemblages of 0+ fish in deeper, wider, silted , trapezoidal-shaped channels with slow-to-lentic flowing water, i.e. channelised and regulated, were dominated by ubiquitous (plant/substrate) spawners.

AB Ten species of marine phytoplankton were grown under a range of photosynthetic photon flux densities (PFDs) and examined for variation in cell volume and carbon quota.  Results suggest that in response to low PFDs phytoplankton generally reduce their cell volume and frequently reduce their carbon quota.  A significant linear relationship between the log of PFD (I) and cell volume (in nine of ten species) and log I and carbon quota (four of ten species) was demonstrated.
   When exposed to a transient in light intensity, Thalassiosira pseudonana (Hustedt, clone 3H) Halse and Heimdal underwent a rapid adaptation in cell volume and carbon quota.  Cells going from low light to high light reached maximum mean cell volume within 5 h, and cells going from high light to low light reached a minimum mean cell volume within 12 h.  The resulting kinetic constant (k; a measure of the rate of adaptation) was considerably larger than previously reported k values.  Ditylum brightwellii (West) Grunow increased in length but did not increase in width during a transient to increased irradiance.
   Nutrient limitation was shown to override PFD in determining cell volume and carbon quota for Heterosigma akashiwo Hada.  Cells grown at equivalent irradiances but N-limited were smaller than light-limited and nutrient-saturated cells.  Therefore, cell volume and carbon quota do not have the same relationship with PFD when factors other than PFD control growth rate.
   The ecological implications of reduced cell volumes and carbon quotas with decreasing PFD include possible impacts on CO2 budgets, an influence on sinking rates, potential changes in predation rates, and surface area/cell volume benefits.

AB Although habitat loss is the predominant factor leading to biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene(1,2), exactly how this loss manifests-and at which scales-remains a central debate(3-6). The 'passive sampling' hypothesis suggests that species are lost in proportion to their abundance and distribution in the natural habitat(7,8), whereas the 'ecosystem decay' hypothesis suggests that ecological processes change in smaller and more-isolated habitats such that more species are lost than would have been expected simply through loss of habitat alone(9,10). Generalizable tests of these hypotheses have been limited by heterogeneous sampling designs and a narrow focus on estimates of species richness that are strongly dependent on scale. Here we analyse 123 studies of assemblage-level abundances of focal taxa taken from multiple habitat fragments of varying size to evaluate the influence of passive sampling and ecosystem decay on biodiversity loss. We found overall support for the ecosystem decay hypothesis. Across all studies, ecosystems and taxa, biodiversity estimates from smaller habitat fragments-when controlled for sampling effort-contain fewer individuals, fewer species and less-even communities than expected from a sample of larger fragments. However, the diversity loss due to ecosystem decay in some studies (for example, those in which habitat loss took place more than 100 years ago) was less than expected from the overall pattern, as a result of compositional turnover by species that were not originally present in the intact habitats. We conclude that the incorporation of non-passive effects of habitat loss on biodiversity change will improve biodiversity scenarios under future land use, and planning for habitat protection and restoration.
   Analysis of 123 studies of assemblage-level abundances of focal taxa from fragmented habitats finds that increasing fragmentation has a disproportionately large effect on biodiversity loss, supporting the ecosystem decay hypothesis.

AB Drylands make up roughly 40% of the Earth's land surface, and billions of people depend on services provided by these critically important ecosystems. Despite their relatively sparse vegetation, dryland ecosystems are structurally and functionally diverse, and emerging evidence suggests that these ecosystems play a dominant role in the trend and variability of the terrestrial carbon sink. More, drylands are highly sensitive to climate and are likely to have large, non-linear responses to hydroclimatic change. Monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of dryland ecosystem structure (e.g., leaf area index) and function (e.g., primary production and evapotranspiration) is therefore a high research priority. Yet, dryland remote sensing is defined by unique challenges not typically encountered in mesic or humid regions. Major challenges include low vegetation signal-to-noise ratios, high soil background reflectance, presence of photosynthetic soils (i.e., biological soil crusts), high spatial heterogeneity from plot to regional scales, and irregular growing seasons due to unpredictable seasonal rainfall and frequent periods of drought. Additionally, there is a relative paucity of continuous, long-term measurements in drylands, which impedes robust calibration and evaluation of remotely-sensed dryland data products. Due to these issues, remote sensing techniques developed in other ecosystems or for global application often result in inaccurate, poorly constrained estimates of dryland ecosystem structural and functional dynamics. Here, we review past achievements and current progress in remote sensing of dryland ecosystems, including a detailed discussion of the major challenges associated with remote sensing of key dryland structural and functional dynamics. We then identify strategies aimed at leveraging new and emerging opportunities in remote sensing to overcome previous challenges and more accurately contextualize drylands within the broader Earth system. Specifically, we recommend: 1) Exploring novel combinations of sensors and techniques (e.g., solar-induced fluorescence, thermal, microwave, hyperspectral, and LiDAR) across a range of spatiotemporal scales to gain new insights into dryland structural and functional dynamics; 2) utilizing near-continuous observations from new-and-improved geostationary satellites to capture the rapid responses of dryland ecosystems to diurnal variation in water stress; 3) expanding ground observational networks to better represent the heterogeneity of dryland systems and enable robust calibration and evaluation; 4) developing algorithms that are specifically tuned to dryland ecosystems by utilizing expanded ground observational network data; and 5) coupling remote sensing observations with process-based models using data assimilation to improve mechanistic understanding of dryland ecosystem dynamics and to better constrain ecological forecasts and long-term projections.

AB A growing body of evidence suggests that microbial alpha-diversity (local species richness) may have positive effects on ecosystem function. However, less attention has been paid to beta-diversity (the variation among local microbial assemblages). Here we studied the impact of microbial alpha-diversity on stochastic/deterministic microbial community assembly processes, which are related to beta-diversity, and the consequences for community function. Bacterial communities differing in alpha-diversity were generated and their structures and potential community functional traits were inferred from DNA sequencing. Phylogenetic null modeling analysis suggests that stochastic assembly processes are dominant in high-diversity communities. However, in low-diversity communities, deterministic assembly processes are dominant, associating with the reduction of specialized functions that are correlated with specific bacterial taxa. Overall, we suggest that the low-diversity-induced deterministic community assembly processes may constrain community functions, highlighting the potential roles of specialized functions in community assembly and in generating and sustaining the function of soil ecosystems.

AB Organic waste can be considered a food subsidy which represents an important source of energy for different species that exploit it. However, it could produce contrasting impacts, both positive and negative. We reviewed which species of terrestrial vertebrates (birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians) exploit rubbish dumps, and the impacts that waste produces on them. We analysed 159 articles including 98 species that are present in rubbish dumps. Studies come from all over the world (including Antarctica), but mainly from Europe, North America and Africa. Impacts reported on vertebrates were manly considered positive (72.6%) but around a quarter showed negative impacts. Rubbish dumps provide food resources that may improve body condition, enhance reproductive performance and abundance, improve survival rate, alter movements, and they can be an important sustenance for some endangered species. However, these places increase the risk of pathogen infections and poisoning, can be responsible for the spread of introduced-invasive species and favour conflicts between humans and animals that use them. Moreover, species that take advantage of these sites can produce negative impacts on others that do not use them. Worldwide increase in waste production makes this novel ecosystem important on shaping ecological communities. Therefore, the spatial and temporal effects of rubbish dumps on wildlife should be evaluated more deeply at a worldwide scale considering current differences in waste production from developing to developed countries.

AB Plants are known to influence belowground microbial community structure along their roots, but the impacts of plant species richness and plant functional group (FG) identity on microbial communities in the bulk soil are still not well understood. Here, we used 454-pyrosequencing to analyse the soil microbial community composition in a long-term biodiversity experiment at Jena, Germany. We examined responses of bacteria, fungi, archaea, and protists to plant species richness (communities varying from 1 to 60 sown species) and plant FG identity (grasses, legumes, small herbs, tall herbs) in bulk soil. We hypothesized that plant species richness and FG identity would alter microbial community composition and have a positive impact on microbial species richness. Plant species richness had a marginal positive effect on the richness of fungi, but we observed no such effect on bacteria, archaea and protists. Plant species richness also did not have a large impact on microbial community composition. Rather, abiotic soil properties partially explained the community composition of bacteria, fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), archaea and protists. Plant FG richness did not impact microbial community composition; however, plant FG identity was more effective. Bacterial richness was highest in legume plots and lowest in small herb plots, and AMF and archaeal community composition in legume plant communities was distinct from that in communities composed of other plant FGs. We conclude that soil microbial community composition in bulk soil is influenced more by changes in plant FG composition and abiotic soil properties, than by changes in plant species richness per se.

AB Evaluating the quality of ecosystems in terms of biological patrimony and functioning is of critical importance in the actual context of intensified human activities. Microbial diversity is commonly used as a bioindicator of ecosystems functioning. However, there is a lack of sensitivity of microbial diversity indicators in the case of moderate and chronic environmental degradation, such as atmospheric deposition of pollutants, agricultural practices, diffuse pollution by wastewater and climate change. As a consequence, there is a need for alternative bioindicators of soils and water quality. Here, we discuss the interest of adopting a more integrative approach based on biotic interaction networks beyond the simple diversity indicators. We review how the various biotic interactions can be integrated in the various microbial networks such as trophic, mutualistic and co-occurrence networks. Then we discuss the efficiency of microbial networks and associated metrics to detect changes in microbial communities. We conclude that the connectance, the number of links and the average degree of co-occurrence networks could vary from 10 to 50% in response to minor perturbations when microbial diversity parameters remain stable. Finally, we analyze studies that aimed at linking microbial networks and activity to evaluate the potential of such networks for providing simple and operational indicators of ecosystem quality and functioning.

AB Biotic and abiotic factors are increasingly acknowledged to synergistically shape broad-scale species distributions. However, the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors in predicting species distributions is unclear. In particular, biotic factors, such as predation and vegetation, including those resulting from anthropogenic land-use change, are underrepresented in species distribution modeling, but could improve model predictions. Using generalized linear models and model selection techniques, we used 129 estimates of population density of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) from 5 continents to evaluate the relative importance, magnitude, and direction of biotic and abiotic factors in predicting population density of an invasive large mammal with a global distribution. Incorporating diverse biotic factors, including agriculture, vegetation cover, and large carnivore richness, into species distribution modeling substantially improved model fit and predictions. Abiotic factors, including precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, were also important predictors. The predictive map of population density revealed wide-ranging potential for an invasive large mammal to expand its distribution globally. This information can be used to proactively create conservation/management plans to control future invasions. Our study demonstrates that the ongoing paradigm shift, which recognizes that both biotic and abiotic factors shape species distributions across broad scales, can be advanced by incorporating diverse biotic factors.

AB A fundamental goal of ecological research is to understand and model how processes generate patterns so that if conditions change, changes in the patterns can be predicted. Different approaches have been proposed for modelling species assemblage, but their use to predict spatial patterns of species richness and other community attributes over a range of spatial and temporal scales remains challenging. Different methods emphasize different processes of structuring communities and different goals. In this review, we focus on models that were developed for generating spatially explicit predictions of communities, with a particular focus on species richness, composition, relative abundance and related attributes. We first briefly describe the concepts and theories that span the different drivers of species assembly. A combination of abiotic processes and biotic mechanisms are thought to influence the community assembly process. In this review, we describe four categories of drivers: (i) historical and evolutionary, (ii) environmental, (iii) biotic, and (iv) stochastic. We discuss the different modelling approaches proposed or applied at the community level and examine them from different standpoints, i.e. the theoretical bases, the drivers included, the source data, and the expected outputs, with special emphasis on conservation needs under climate change. We also highlight the most promising novelties, possible shortcomings, and potential extensions of existing methods. Finally, we present new approaches to model and predict species assemblages by reviewing promising 'integrative frameworks' and views that seek to incorporate all drivers of community assembly into a unique modelling workflow. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these new solutions and how they may hasten progress in community-level modelling.

   RESPONSES
AB During droughts, leaves are predicted to act as 'hydraulic fuses' by shedding when plants reach critically low water potential (Toant), thereby slowing water loss, stabilizing T plan I and protecting against cavitation-induced loss of stem hydraulic conductivity (K-s).
   We tested these predictions among trees in seasonally dry tropical forests, where leaf shedding is common, yet variable, among species. We tracked leaf phenology, Toara and K-s in saplings of six tree species distributed across two forests.
   Species differed in their timing and extent of leaf shedding, yet converged in shedding leaves as they approached the Toa,,t value associated with a 50% loss of K-s and at which their model-estimated maximum sustainable transpiration rate approached zero. However, after shedding all leaves, the Toat value of one species, Genipa americana, continued to decline, indicating that water loss continued after leaf shedding. K-s was highly variable among saplings within species and seasons, suggesting a minimal influence of seasonal drought on K-s.
   Hydraulic limits appear to drive diverse patterns of leaf shedding among tropical trees, supporting the hydraulic fuse hypothesis. However, leaf shedding is not universally effective at stabilizing Toant, suggesting that the main function of drought deciduousness may vary among species.

AB Despite the vital role of microorganisms for ecosystem functioning and human welfare, our understanding of their global diversity and biogeographical patterns lags significantly behind that of plants and animals. We conducted a meta-analysis including similar to 600 soil samples from all continents to evaluate the biogeographical patterns and drivers of bacterial diversity in terrestrial ecosystems at the global scale. Similar to what has been found with plants and animals, the diversity of soil bacteria in the Southern Hemisphere decreased from the equator to Antarctica. However, soil bacteria showed similar levels of diversity across the Northern Hemisphere. The composition of bacterial communities followed dissimilar patterns between hemispheres, as the Southern and Northern Hemispheres were dominated by Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria, respectively. However, Proteobacteria was co-dominant in both hemispheres. Moreover, we found a decrease in soil bacterial diversity with altitude. Climatic features (e.g., high diurnal temperature range and low temperature) were correlated with the lower diversity found at high elevations, but geographical gradients in soil total carbon and species turnover were important drivers of the observed latitudinal patterns. We thus found both parallels and differences in the biogeographical patterns of aboveground vs. soil bacterial diversity. Our findings support previous studies that highlighted soil pH, spatial influence, and organic matter as important drivers of bacterial diversity and composition. Furthermore, our results provide a novel integrative view of how climate and soil factors influence soil bacterial diversity at the global scale, which is critical to improve ecosystem and earth system simulation models and for formulating sustainable ecosystem management and conservation policies.

AB This study compares actual evapotranspiration (ETa) measurements by a set of six weighable lysimeters, ETa estimates obtained with the eddy covariance (EC) method, and evapotranspiration calculated with the full-form Penman-Monteith equation (ETPM) for the Rollesbroich site in the Eifel (western Germany). The comparison of ETa measured by EC (including correction of the energy balance deficit) and by lysimeters is rarely reported in the literature and allows more insight into the performance of both methods. An evaluation of ETa for the two methods for the year 2012 shows a good agreement with a total difference of 3.8% (19 mm) between the ETa estimates. The highest agreement and smallest relative differences (< 8 %) on a monthly basis between both methods are found in summer. ETa was close to ETPM, indicating that ET was energy limited and not limited by water availability. ETa differences between lysimeter and EC were mainly related to differences in grass height caused by harvest and the EC footprint. The lysimeter data were also used to estimate precipitation amounts in combination with a filter algorithm for the high-precision lysimeters recently introduced by Peters et al. (2014). The estimated precipitation amounts from the lysimeter data differ significantly from precipitation amounts recorded with a standard rain gauge at the Rollesbroich test site. For the complete year 2012 the lysimeter records show a 16% higher precipitation amount than the tipping bucket. After a correction of the tipping bucket measurements by the method of Richter (1995) this amount was reduced to 3 %. With the help of an onsite camera the precipitation measurements of the lysimeters were analyzed in more detail. It was found that the lysimeters record more precipitation than the tipping bucket, in part related to the detection of rime and dew, which contribute 17% to the yearly difference between both methods. In addition, fog and drizzle explain an additional 5.5% of the total difference. Larger differences are also recorded for snow and sleet situations. During snowfall, the tipping bucket device underestimated precipitation severely, and these situations contributed also 7.9% to the total difference. However, 36% of the total yearly difference was associated with snow cover without apparent snowfall, and under these conditions snow bridges and snow drift seem to explain the strong overestimation of precipitation by the lysimeter. The remaining precipitation difference (about 33 %) could not be explained and did not show a clear relation to wind speed. The variation of the individual lysimeters devices compared to the lysimeter mean are small, showing variations up to 3% for precipitation and 8% for evapotranspiration.

AB Local adaptation and adaptive clines are pervasive in natural plant populations, yet the effects of these types of adaptation on genomic diversity are not well understood. With a data set of 202 accessions of Medicago truncatula genotyped at almost 2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, we used mixed linear models to identify candidate loci responsible for adaptation to three climatic gradients-annual mean temperature (AMT), precipitation in the wettest month (PWM), and isothermality (ITH)-representing the major axes of climate variation across the species' range. Loci with the strongest association to these climate gradients tagged genome regions with high sequence similarity to genes with functional roles in thermal tolerance, drought tolerance, or resistance to herbivores of pathogens. Genotypes at these candidate loci also predicted the performance of an independent sample of plant accessions grown in climate-controlled conditions. Compared to a genome-wide sample of randomly drawn reference SNPs, candidates for two climate gradients, AMT and PWM, were significantly enriched for genic regions, and genome segments flanking genic AMT and PWM candidates harbored less nucleotide diversity, elevated differentiation between haplotypes carrying alternate alleles, and an overrepresentation of the most common haplotypes. These patterns of diversity are consistent with a history of soft selective sweeps acting on loci underlying adaptation to climate, but not with a history of long-term balancing selection.

AB AimThe factors that set species range limits underlie many patterns in ecology, evolution, biogeography and conservation. These factors have been the subject of several reviews, but there has been no systematic review of the causes of warm-edge limits (low elevations and latitudes). Understanding these causes is urgent, given that the factors that set these limits might also drive extinction at warm edges as global climate changes. Many authors have suggested that warm-edge limits are set by biotic factors (particularly competition) whereas others have stressed abiotic factors (particularly temperature). We synthesize the known causes of species' warm-edge range limits, with emphasis on the underlying mechanisms (proximate causes).
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsWe systematically searched the literature for studies testing the causes of warm-edge range limits.
   ResultsWe found 125 studies that address the causes of warm-edge limits, from a search including >4000 studies. Among the species in these studies, abiotic factors are supported more often than biotic factors in setting species range limits at warm edges, in contrast to the widely held view that biotic factors are more important. Studies that test both types of factors support abiotic factors significantly more frequently. In addition, only 23 studies (61 species) identified proximate causes of these limits, and these overwhelmingly support physiological tolerances to abiotic factors (primarily temperature). Only eight species with identified proximate causes were tested for both biotic and abiotic factors, but the majority support abiotic factors.
   Main conclusionsAlthough it is often assumed that warm-edge limits are set by biotic factors, our review shows that abiotic factors are supported more often among the species in these 125 studies. However, few studies both identify proximate causes and test alternative mechanisms, or examine the interaction between biotic and abiotic factors. Filling these gaps should be a high priority as warm-edge populations are increasingly driven to extinction by climate change.

AB In many regions of the world, such as Southern Europe and most Mediterranean areas, the frequency and magnitude of droughts and heat waves are expected to increase under global warming and will challenge the sustainability of both native and sown grasslands. To analyze the adaptive strategies of species, genotypes and cultivars, we aim both (i) to understand the composition and functioning of natural grasslands and (ii) to propose ideotypes of cultivars and optimal composition for mixtures of species/genotypes under water deficit and high temperatures. This review presents a conceptual framework to analyze adaptive responses of perennial herbaceous species, starting from resistance to moderate drought with growth maintenance (dehydration avoidance and tolerance of lamina) to growth cessation and survival of plants under severe stress (dehydration avoidance and tolerance of meristems). The most discriminating functional traits vary according to these contrasting strategies because of a trade-off between resistance to moderate moisture deficit and survival of intense drought. Consequently it is crucial to measure the traits of interest in the right organs and as a function of soil water use, in order to avoid misleading interpretations of plant responses. Furthermore, collaboration between ecologists, eco-physiologists, and agronomists is required to study the combination of plant strategies in natural grasslands as only this will provide the necessary rules for species and cultivars or ecotypes assemblage. This 'agro-ecological' approach aims to identify and enhance functional complementarity and limit competition within the multi-specific or multi-genotypic material associated in mixtures since using plant biodiversity should contribute to improving grassland resistance and resilience.

AB Stress during early life can profoundly influence an individual's phenotype. Effects can manifest in the short-term as well as later in life and even in subsequent generations. Transgenerational effects of stress are potentially mediated via modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) as well as epigenetic mechanisms causing heritable changes in gene expression. To investigate these pathways we subjected domestic chicken (Gallus gallus) to intermittent social isolation for the first three weeks of life. The early life stress resulted in a dampened corticosterone response to restraint stress in affected birds and in their male offspring. Stress-specific genes, such as early growth response 1 (EGR1) and corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1), were upregulated immediately after restraint stress, but not under baseline conditions. Treatment differences in gene expression were also correlated across generations which indicate transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In an associative learning test early stressed birds made more correct choices suggesting a higher coping ability in stressful situations. This study is the first to show transgenerational effects of early life stress in a precocial species by combining behavioral, endocrinological, and transcriptomic measurements.

AB Background: Cavitation resistance to water stress-induced embolism determines plant survival during drought. This adaptive trait has been described as highly variable in a wide range of tree species, but little is known about the extent of genetic and phenotypic variability within species. This information is essential to our understanding of the evolutionary forces that have shaped this trait, and for evaluation of its inclusion in breeding programs.
   Methodology: We assessed cavitation resistance (P-50), growth and carbon isotope composition in six Pinus pinaster populations in a provenance and progeny trial. We estimated the heritability of cavitation resistance and compared the distribution of neutral markers (F-ST) and quantitative genetic differentiation (Q(ST)), for retrospective identification of the evolutionary forces acting on these traits.
   Results/Discussion: In contrast to growth and carbon isotope composition, no population differentiation was found for cavitation resistance. Heritability was higher than for the other traits, with a low additive genetic variance (h(ns)(2) = 0.43+/-0.18, CVA = 4.4%). Q(ST) was significantly lower than F-ST, indicating uniform selection for P-50, rather than genetic drift. Putative mechanisms underlying Q(ST)<F-ST are discussed.

AB Interspecific interactions and soil nitrogen supply levels affect intercropping productivity. We hypothesized that interspecific competition can be alleviated by increasing N application rate and yield advantage can be obtained in competitive systems. A field experiment was conducted in Wuwei, Gansu province in 2007 and 2008 to study intercropping of faba bean/maize, wheat/maize, barley/maize and the corresponding monocultures of faba bean (Vicia faba L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) with N application rates of 0, 75, 150, 225 and 300 kg N ha(-1). Total land equivalent ratios (TLER) were 1.22 for faba bean/maize, 1.16 for wheat/maize, and 1.13 for barley/maize intercropping over the 2-year study period. Maize was overyielding when intercropped with faba bean, but underyielding when intercropped with wheat or barley according to partial land equivalent ratios (PLER) based on grain yields of individual crops in intercropping and sole cropping. There was an interspecific facilitation between intercropped faba bean and maize, and interspecific competition between maize and either wheat or barley. The underyielding of maize was higher when intercropped with barley than with wheat. Fertilizer N alleviated competitive interactions in intercrops with adequate fertilizer N at 225 kg ha(-1). Yield advantage of intercropping can be acquired with adequate nitrogen supply, even in an intensive competitive system such as barley/maize intercropping. This is important when using intercropping to develop intensive farming systems with high inputs and high outputs.

AB Polyandry, where females mate with multiple males, means that a male's reproductive success will depend both on his ability to acquire mates and the ability of his sperm to compete effectively for fertilizations. But, how do males partition their reproductive investment between these two episodes of selection? Theory predicts that increases in ejaculate investment will come at a cost to investment in other reproductive traits. Although evidence revealing such trade-offs is accumulating, we know little about their genetic basis. Here, I report patterns of genetic (co) variation for a range of traits subject to pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection in the guppy Poecilia reticulata, a promiscuous livebearing fish in which males alternate between courtship and sneak matings to obtain copulations. The analyses of genetic variation and covariation for these behaviours revealed a strong genetic predisposition for one tactic over the other. Both mating tactics were also strongly genetically integrated with the level of sexual ornamentation and ejaculate quality. Males that predominantly performed sneak matings were less ornamented but had faster swimming sperm than those that predominantly used courtship. These patterns of genetic variation and covariation reveal potential evolutionary constraints on the direction of selection of pre- and post-copulatory traits, and support sperm competition theory by revealing a trade-off between sexual attractiveness and investment in ejaculates.

AB The effect that rising atmospheric CO2 levels will have on forest productivity and water use efficiency remains uncertain, yet it has critical implications for future rates of carbon sequestration and forest distributions. Efforts to understand the effect that rising CO2 will have on forests are largely based on growth chamber studies of seedlings, and the relatively small number of FACE sites. Inferences from these studies are limited by their generally short durations, artificial growing conditions, unnatural step-increases in CO2 concentrations, and poor replication. Here we analyze the global record of annual radial tree growth, derived from the International Tree ring Data Bank (ITRDB), for evidence of increasing growth rates that cannot be explained by climatic change alone, and for evidence of decreasing sensitivity to drought. We find that approximately 20 percent of sites globally exhibit increasing trends in growth that cannot be attributed to climatic causes, nitrogen deposition, elevation, or latitude, which we attribute to a direct CO2 fertilization effect. No differences were found between species in their likelihood to exhibit growth increases attributable to CO2 fertilization, although Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), the two most commonly sampled species in the ITRDB, exhibit a CO2 fertilization signal at frequencies very near their upper and lower confidence limits respectively. Overall these results suggest that CO2 fertilization of forests will not counteract emissions or slow warming in any substantial fashion, but do suggest that future forest dynamics may differ from those seen today depending on site conditions and individual species' responses to elevated CO2.

AB In the first part, this paper synthesises the main results from a series of previous studies on the closure of the local energy balance at low-vegetation sites during the LITFASS-2003 experiment. A residual of up to 25% of the available energy has been found which cannot be fully explained either by the measurement uncertainty of the single components of the surface energy balance or by the length of the flux-averaging period. In the second part, secondary circulations due to heterogeneities in the surface characteristics (roughness, thermal and moisture properties) are discussed as a possible cause for the observed energy balance non-closure. This hypothesis seems to be supported from the fluxes derived from area-averaging measurement techniques (scintillometers, aircraft).

AB Most diploid species arise from single-species ancestors. Hybrid origins of new species are uncommon (except among polyploids) and are documented infrequently in animals. Examples of natural hybridization leading to speciation in mammals are exceedingly rare. Here, we show a Caribbean species of bat (Artibeus schwartzi) has a nuclear genome derived from two nonsister but congeneric species (A. jamaicensis and A. planirostris) and a mitochondrial genome that is from a third extinct or uncharacterized congener. Artibeus schwartzi is self-sustaining, morphologically distinct, and exists in near geographic isolation of its known parent species. Island effects (i.e., area, reduced habitat variability, and geographic isolation) likely have restricted gene flow from parental species into the Caribbean populations of this hybrid lineage, thus contributing to local adaptation and isolation of this newly produced taxon. We hypothesize differential rates of the development of reproductive isolation within the genus and estimate that 2.5 million years was an insufficient amount of time for the development of postzygotic isolation among the three species that hybridized to produce A. schwartzi. Reticulated evolution thus has resulted in a genomic combination from three evolutionary lineages and a transgressive phenotype that is distinct from all other known species of Artibeus. The data herein further demonstrate the phenomenon of speciation by hybridization in mammals is possible in nature.

AB Evolutionary processes play an important role in shaping the dynamics of range expansions, and selection on dispersal propensity has been demonstrated to accelerate rates of advance. Previous theory has considered only the evolution of unconditional dispersal rates, but dispersal is often more complex. For example, many species emigrate in response to crowding. Here, we use an individual-based model to investigate the evolution of density dependent dispersal into empty habitat, such as during an invasion. The landscape is represented as a lattice and dispersal between Populations follows a stepping-stone pattern. Individuals carry three 'genes' that determine their dispersal strategy when experiencing different population densities. For a stationary range we obtain results consistent with previous theoretical studies: few individuals emigrate from patches that are below equilibrium density. However, during the range expansion of a previously stationary population, we observe evolution towards dispersal strategies where considerable emigration occurs well below equilibrium density. This is true even for moderate costs to dispersal, and always results in accelerating rates of range expansion. Importantly, the evolution we observe at an expanding front depends upon fitness integrated over several generations and cannot be predicted by a consideration of lifetime reproductive success alone. We argue that a better understanding of the role of density dependent dispersal, and its evolution, in driving population dynamics is required especially within the context of range expansions.

AB Partitioning of soil nitrogen (N) by niche separation among species may be an important mechanism explaining species coexistence and positive biodiversity-productivity relationships in terrestrial plant communities. However, there is little experimental evidence for such partitioning, in particular, as assessed across a gradient of species richness. In experimental communities of one, three, and six temperate grassland species in the field, we tested whether increasing species richness (1) decreases niche breadths of individual species, (2) decreases niche overlap among species, and (3) increases niche breadth of whole communities. Six N sources consisting of three different chemical forms of N-15-labeled N ((NO3-)-N-15, (NH4+)-N-15, C-13(2)-N-15-glycine) injected at two soil depths (3 and 12 cm) were applied to each community. The chemical form and the soil depth of N characterize the niches for which niche breadth (Levins' B) and overlap (proportional similarity) were measured. After 48 hours, aboveground plant material was harvested to measure N-15 enrichment. As expected, niche breadth of single species and niche overlap among species decreased with increased species richness, but community niche breadth did not increase. The decrease in niche breadth and niche overlap mostly occurred among subordinate species or pairs of subordinate and dominant species, rather than among dominant species. Species in the six-species mixtures mostly preferred NO3- from shallow soil. This may be partly explained by the presence of legumes in all six-species mixtures which allowed "N sparing" (i.e., increased availability of soil N since legumes rely more on atmospheric N-2 than on soil N). Niche separation with respect to N uptake from different chemical forms and soil depths did not contribute much to facilitating the coexistence of dominant species, nor do our results suggest it as a major driver of positive diversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. However, partitioning of N may be important for the persistence of subordinate species.

AB Questions: 1. Is there a primary role of disturbance at local scale and of environmental stress at regional scale? 2. Does disturbance increase or decrease environmental stress at local scale?
   Location: The Atlantic coastal dune system of the Aquitaine Region ( France).
   Methods: Species biomass and 16 environmental variables were sampled in 128 quadrats along a local beach-inland gradient and a regional North- South gradient. Environmental data were analysed with ANOVAs and vegetation- environment relationships with Canonical Correspondence Analysis.
   Results: At the local scale community composition was primarily driven by disturbance due to sand burial, whereas water and nutrient stress better explained regional differences. However, random biogeographical events are very likely to also affect community composition at the largest scale. The main interaction between environmental stress and disturbance was the mitigation of nutrient stress induced by disturbance at a local scale. This was due to a positive direct effect of sand burial and a positive indirect effect of wind ( decrease in VPD by ocean spray). Although wind had also a significant effect on soil conductivity and pH, there was no evidence that these factors had any role in community composition.
   Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that disturbance had a primary role at local scale and environmental stress at regional scale but further research is needed to separate the effect of stress from that of dispersal at regional scale. We also demonstrated that environmental stress in primary succession may not always decline with decreasing disturbance.

AB Information to guide decision making is especially urgent in human dominated landscapes in the tropics, where urban and agricultural frontiers are still expanding in an unplanned manner. Nevertheless, most studies that have investigated the influence of landscape structure on species distribution have not considered the heterogeneity of altered habitats of the matrix, which is usually high in human dominated landscapes. Using the distribution of small mammals in forest remnants and in the four main altered habitats in an Atlantic forest landscape, we investigated 1) how explanatory power of models describing species distribution in forest remnants varies between landscape structure variables that do or do not incorporate matrix quality and 2) the importance of spatial scale for analyzing the influence of landscape structure. We used standardized sampling in remnants and altered habitats to generate two indices of habitat quality, corresponding to the abundance and to the occurrence of small mammals. For each remnant, we calculated habitat quantity and connectivity in different spatial scales, considering or not the quality of surrounding habitats. The incorporation of matrix quality increased model explanatory power across all spatial scales for half the species that occurred in the matrix, but only when taking into account the distance between habitat patches (connectivity). These connectivity models were also less affected by spatial scale than habitat quantity models. The few consistent responses to the variation in spatial scales indicate that despite their small size, small mammals perceive landscape features at large spatial scales. Matrix quality index corresponding to species occurrence presented a better or similar performance compared to that of species abundance. Results indicate the importance of the matrix for the dynamics of fragmented landscapes and suggest that relatively simple indices can improve our understanding of species distribution, and could be applied in modeling, monitoring and managing complex tropical landscapes.

AB Based on a combination of data from the Czech National Phytosociological Database and expert knowledge, a database of vascular plant species pools for 88,habitats, representative of the diversity of Czech vegetation, was compiled. This database contains 1820 native species, 249 archaeophytes and 278 neophytes, each assigned to one or more habitats. Besides the data on species occurrence in different habitats, the database contains information on a species' ecological optimum in the habitat or its dominance. The largest pools of native species were found in rather rare habitats of dry and warm herbaceous or woody habitats at low altitudes, some of which contain > 530 species (maximum of 695 species for thermophilous forest fringes). These were followed by common habitats on mesic soils. The smallest pools of native species were in saline, aquatic and bog habitats (< 90 species). Species pool sizes of archaeophytes and neophytes for different habitats were positively, yet weakly, correlated with the species pool sizes of native species. Habitats with native species pools < 350 species contained any number of archaeophytes. Habitats with < 100 native species contained < 5, and often no neophytes, but habitats with 100-350 native species contained different numbers of neophytes. Habitats with > 350 native species always contained > 5 archaeophytes and > 5 neophytes, and often many more. Two hundred and thirty two native species, 18 archaeophytes and 30 neophytes were identified as potential dominants in at least one habitat. However, potentially dominant species made up less than 3% of the species pool for 78 out of 88 habitats. Larger percentages (up to 14.6%) of potential dominants were included in habitats with small species pools and species-poor stands (e.g., aquatic, saline and mire habitats). The number of habitats in which a species occurred was used as a measure of its ecological range. Most ecological generalists were found among the native species, less among the archaeophytes and least among the neophytes. Out of the 36 species that occur as dominants in three or more habitats, 34 were native (many are grasses), one was an archaeophyte (Cirsium arvense) and one was a neophyte (Impatiens parviflora).

AB Recent research on speciation has identified a central role for ecological divergence, which can initiate speciation when (i) subsets of a species or population evolve to specialize on different ecological resources and (ii) the resulting phenotypic modes become reproductively isolated. Empirical evidence for these two processes working in conjunction, particularly during the early stages of divergence, has been limited. We recently described a population of the medium ground finch, Geospiza fortis, that features large and small beak morphs with relatively few intermediates. As in other Darwin's finches of the Gala pagos Islands, these morphs presumably diverged in response to variation in local food availability and inter- or intraspecific competition. We here demonstrate that the two morphs show strong positive assortative pairing, a pattern that holds over three breeding seasons and during both dry and wet conditions. We also document restrictions on gene flow between the morphs, as revealed by genetic variation at 10 microsatellite loci. Our results provide strong support for the central role of ecology during the early stages of adaptive radiation.

AB The importance of interspecific competition as a cause of resource partitioning among species has been widely assumed but rarely tested. Using neighbor removals in combination with N-15 tracer additions in the field, we examined variation among three alpine species in the uptake of N-15-NH4+, N-15-NO3-, and N-15-C-13-[2]-glycine in intact neighborhoods, when paired with a specific neighbor, and when all neighbors were removed. Species varied in the capacity to take up N-15-labeled NH4+, NO3-, and glycine in intact neighborhoods and in interspecific pairs. When interspecific neighbor pairs were compared with no neighbor controls, neighbors reduced N-15 uptake in target species by as much as 50%, indicating competition for N. Furthermore, neighbor identity influenced the capacity of species to take up different forms of N. Thus, competition within interspecific neighbor pairs often caused reduced uptake of a particular form of N, as well as shifts to uptake of an alternative form of N. Such shifts in resource use as a result of competition are an implicit assumption in studies of resource partitioning but have rarely been documented. Our study suggests that plasticity in the uptake of different forms of N may be a mechanism by which cooccurring plants reduce competition for N.

AB Water stress is one of the most important limiting factors controlling terrestrial primary production, and the performance of a primary production model is largely determined by its capacity to capture environmental water stress. The algorithm that generates the global near-real-time MODIS GPP/NPP products (MOD17) uses VPD ( vapor pressure deficit) alone to estimate the environmental water stress. This paper compares the water stress calculation in the MOD17 algorithm with results simulated using a process-based biogeochemical model (Biome-BGC) to evaluate the performance of the water stress determined using the MOD17 algorithm. The investigation study areas include China and the conterminous United States because of the availability of daily meteorological observation data. Our study shows that VPD alone can capture interannual variability of the full water stress nearly over all the study areas. In wet regions, where annual precipitation is greater than 400 mm/yr, the VPD-based water stress estimate in MOD17 is adequate to explain the magnitude and variability of water stress determined from atmospheric VPD and soil water in Biome-BGC. In some dry regions, where soil water is severely limiting, MOD17 underestimates water stress, overestimates GPP, and fails to capture the intraannual variability of water stress. The MOD17 algorithm should add soil water stress to its calculations in these dry regions, thereby improving GPP estimates. Interannual variability in water stress is simpler to capture than the seasonality, but it is more difficult to capture this interannual variability in GPP. The MOD17 algorithm captures interannual and intraannual variability of both the Biome-BGC-calculated water stress and GPP better in the conterminous United States than in the strongly monsoon-controlled China.

AB Pollination by insects in forests is an extremely important process that should be conserved. Not only do pollinating insects help to maintain a diversity of plants within forests, but they also aid in pollinating crops found near forested land. Currently, the effects of various forest management practices on floral visiting insect abundance or diversity is unknown, so we investigated how prescribed burning, mechanical shrub control, and combination of the two affected abundance of floral visiting insects. We caught 7921 floral visitors from four orders and 21 families. Hymenoptera was the most abundant and diverse order, with Halictidae being the most abundant family A total of 45 species of Hymenoptera representing six families were captured. We caught seven families and 35 species of Lepidoptera, six families and 33 species of Coleoptera, and two families and 13 species of Diptera. Most floral visitors were captured in the mechanical shrub control plus prescribed burn treatments, while lower numbers were caught on the mechanical shrub control only, prescribed burn only and control treatments. Overall species richness was also higher on mechanical plus burn treatments. Total pollinator abundance and the abundance of most orders and families was correlated with decreased tree basal area and increased percent herbaceous plant cover. Our study shows that floral visitors increased in abundance and species richness most from forest disturbance that reduced the density of overstory trees and increased the amount of herbaceous plant growth.

AB Empirical studies have suggested that species richness of grassland insects usually decreases under grazing management. By contrast, grazing has been shown to increase the species density and richness of vascular plants, especially on productive soils. In order to test the suggested differences in response to management between plants and insects, we simultaneously studied species richness of vascular plants and their insect herbivores, butterflies and moths, in 68 semi-natural grasslands with varying grazing intensity and frequency in SW Finland. Species richness of plants and insects was for the first time related to a quantitative measure of disturbance intensity and successional age, mean vegetation height, by using generalized additive models (GAM). The effects of soil nutrients on vegetation height were accounted for by using phosphorus concentration as a productivity surrogate.
   The results showed that species richness of butterflies and moths peaked in taller vegetation compared with vascular plants, corresponding to a lower disturbance intensity and increasing time since abandonment. These patterns are discussed in the light of two hypotheses, the "structural diversity hypothesis" and "dynamic equilibrium model" of Huston, both suggesting a weaker disturbance tolerance of insects compared with plants. Butterflies and moths which are specialists in their larval host-plant use (monophagous and oligophagous species) preferred lower vegetation (higher disturbances) compared with generalists (polyphagous species), as predicted by Huston's model. This difference indicates a stronger relationship with plant species richness for specialist than for generalist butterflies and moths. Our results support the application of regionally and temporally varying grazing intensities in grassland conservation management.

AB Introduced species, those dispersed outside their natural ranges by humans, now cause almost all biological invasions, i.e., entry of organisms into habitats with negative effects on organisms already there. Knowing whether introduction tends to give organisms specific ecological advantages or disadvantages in their new habitats could help understand and control invasions. Even if no specific species traits are associated with introduction, introduced species might out-compete native ones just because the pool of introduced species is very large ("global competition hypothesis"). Especially in the case of intentional introduction, high initial propagule pressure might further increase the chance of establishment, and repeated introductions from different source populations might increase the fitness of introduced species through hybridization. Intentional introduction screens species for usefulness to humans and so might select for rapid growth and reproduction or carry species to suitable habitats, all which could promote invasiveness. However, trade offs between growth and tolerance might make introduced species vulnerable to extreme climatic events and cause some invasions to be transient ("reckless invader hypothesis"). Unintentional introduction may screen for species associated with human-disturbed habitats, and human disturbance of their new habitats may make these species more invasive. Introduction and natural long-distance dispersal both imply that species have neither undergone adaptation in their new habitats nor been adapted to by other species there. These two characteristics are the basis for many well-known hypotheses about invasion, including the "biotic resistance", "enemy release", "evolution of increased competitive ability" and "novel weapon" hypotheses, each of which has been shown to help explain some invasions. To the extent that biotic resistance depends upon local adaption by native species, altering selection pressures could reduce resistance and promote invasion ("local adaptation hypothesis"), and restoring natural regimes could reverse this effect.

AB In Malaysia, rapid changes in land use invariably portrayed have a relationship with environmental degradation. However, this has always been stated without any quantitative measurement for understanding the relationship in order to describe implications for land use planning and management. To understand the relationship this study addresses landscape pattern and landscape type responses to changes in land use in the state of Selangor, Malaysia as a case study. Three land use maps representing the years of 1966, 1981 and 1995 were used in this study. These maps were divided into 100 grid squares with each grid square has 10 km x 10 km dimension. These grid squares were used as a sampling unit for land use and landscape pattern change analyses. Based on proportion of land use categories, the landscape type of each grid square was determined. Results show that between 1966 and 1981 only one land use category significantly changed (p < 0.05) in its proportion compared to five land use categories between 1981 and 1995. This indicates that human land use intensity increased between 1981 and 1995. As response to the intensity of land use change, fragmentation (measured by number of patches and mean patch size metrics) and diversity (measured by relative patch richness metric) of the state's landscape increased from 1981 to 1995. Changes in land use also influenced the landscape types and its dynamic of change. Two categories of landscape types; human landscape (cropland, semi-natural and mixed landscapes) and natural landscape (forest and wetland landscapes) characterized the state landscape. Based on the number of grid squares human landscape increased over the period, whereas natural landscape decreased. Between 1966 and 1981, change from one landscape type to another was predominantly occurred in human landscape. Between 1981 and 1995, change was mainly occurred in the natural landscape. Developmental activities might have been less intense in the human landscape, but they had a much greater impact on the natural ecosystem. This study also revealed the potential of landscape type as a reference for land evaluation and complement to landscape metric as measurement for monitoring changes in a landscape. Finally, we conclude that it is important to understand the changes of land use intensification and its effects on landscape pattern as well as landscape types and their dynamic of change in order to describe the implications for land use planning and management.

AB Most satellites provide, at best, a single daily snapshot of vegetation and, at worst, these snapshots may be separated by periods of many days when the ground was obscured by cloud cover. Since vegetation carbon exchange can be very dynamic on diurnal and day-to-day timescales, the limited temporal resolution of satellite data is a potential limitation in the use of these data to estimate integrated CO2 exchange between vegetation and the atmosphere. Our objective in this study was to determine whether consistent relationships exist between midday carbon flux on clear days and daily or 8-day mean values. CO2 flux data were obtained from eight sites, covering a wide range of vegetation types, which are part of the AmeriFlux system. Midday gross CO2 exchange was highly correlated with both daily and 8-day mean gross CO2 exchange and these relationships were consistent across all the vegetation types. In addition, it did not make any difference whether the midday data were derived from the AM or PM satellite overpass times, indicating that midday depression of photosynthesis was not a significant factor in these relationships. Inclusion of cloudy days in the 8-day means also did not affect the relationships relative to single clear days. Although there was a relationship between photosynthetic rates and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) for half hour data, this relationship tended to saturate at PAR values less than half of full sun and for many of the sites the relationship between daily total photosynthesis and PAR was very weak. Consequently, cloudy conditions had less effect on daily gross CO2 exchange than would have been expected. Conversely, the saturation of photosynthesis at moderate PAR values resulted in considerable variation in light use efficiency (LUE). LUE was higher for daily and 8-day means than it was at midday on clear days and the correlation between midday and 8-day mean LUE was relatively weak. Although these results suggest that it may not be possible to estimate 8-day mean LUE reliably from satellite data, LUE models may still be useful for estimation of midday values of gross CO2 exchange which could then be related to longer term means of CO2 exchange.

AB The cichlid fishes of Lake Malawi are famously diverse. However, phylogenetic and population genetic studies of their history have been difficult because of the great amount of genetic variation that is shared between species. We apply a recently developed method for fitting the "isolation with migration" divergence model to a data set of specially designed compound loci to develop portraits of cichlid species divergence. Outgroup sequences from a cichlid from Lake Tanganyika permit model parameter estimates in units of years and effective population sizes. Estimated speciation times range from 1,000 to 17,000 years for species in the genus Tro-pheops. These exceptionally recent dates suggest that Malawi cichlids as a group experience a very active and dynamic diversif ication process. Current effective population size estimates range form 2,000 to near 40,000, and to > 120,000 for estimates of ancestral population sizes. It appears that very recent speciation and gene flow are among the reasons why it has been difficult to discern the phylogenetic history of Malawi cichlids.

   DYNAMICS; SONGBIRD; BRITAIN; TRENDS
AB The timing of arrival of 81 migratory species in response to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was studied at two Finnish bird observatories (1970-99). Timing was determined for the first migrants and for the peak of migration, as well as for the early, median and late phases of migration, defined as the dates when the seasonal cumulative sum of birds reached 5%, 50% and 95%, respectively. For most species, the timing of arrival correlated negatively with the NAO in all phases of migration: the correlation was significant for 79% of species studied. Thus, most species arrived in Finland early when the NAO was positive and indicative of mild and rainy winters in northern Europe. Although all phases of migration correlated negatively with the NAO, the correlations were more negative for the early than for the late phases of migration. Since the NAO did not show a significant trend during the study period, the correlations indicate that the timing of birds followed stochastic fluctuations in the NAO. This finding suggests that most Finnish migratory birds are able to adjust the timing of spring arrival in response to climatic change without time delay.

AB Long-distance bird migration is expensive, and individuals in prime condition are therefore expected to arrive at the breeding grounds earlier than the average individual. in the population. We tested whether arrival date during spring migration was associated with low parasite burden and strong T-cell-dependent immune response in populations of the transequatorially migrating Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica from Denmark, Italy, and Spain. Male Barn Swallows with heavy infestations of the chewing louse Hirundoecus malleus L. arrived later than other males, whereas that was not the case for females. This negative relationship remained after controlling the relationship between parasite load and arrival for tail length. Infection with blood parasites of the species Haemoproteus prognei was associated with delayed arrival in the Spanish population, which was the only one with a high prevalence of blood parasites. High intensities of infestation with a commensal feather mite were associated with early arrival by females, but also by males when the independent, relationship between tail length and intensity of mite infestation was controlled statistically. Experimental manipulation of nest infestation with the hematophagous mite Ornithonyssus bursa Berlese affected the arrival date of adult,males, but not of females in the following year, with arrival date being inversely related to the experimental mite population size. Males with strong T-cell responses arrived earlier than males with weak responses, independent of their tail length in two of three populations, but there was no significant relationship in females. These findings are in accordance with predictions based on the hypothesis that bird migration is dependent on condition, with individuals in prime condition arriving early.

AB Isolating barriers between interbreeding sympatric or parapatric interfertile species are maintained by processes that occur within their hybrid zones. Although the effects of intrinsic selection on hybrid fitness are well known, less is understood about extrinsic fitness variation. At Tiryal Dag, northeast Turkey, Rhododendron x sochadzeae (R. ponticum x caucasicum) forms large populations in which neither segregation nor backcrossing occur, in habitats intermediate between those of its parents. Using single-copy species-specific random amplified polymorphic DNA and inter simple sequence repeat markers, it was determined that most or all R. x sochadzeae plants are F(1)s, and that there are many separate genets present. Hand pollination and germination experiments showed that R. x sochadzeae plants can produce viable seed of F(2)s or backcrosses in either direction. Furthermore, adult backcrosses have been observed in habitats atypical for R. x sochadzeae. From this, all non-F-1 hybrid derivatives appear to be eliminated in the hybrid zone at Tiryal Dag as a result of postgermination selection. This absence of post-F-1 hybrid derivatives apparently prevents introgression. This type of hybrid population is here termed an F-1-dominated hybrid zone (F(1)DZ), and also occurs in Encelia. The observed dominance of F(1)s within a narrow habitat range is best explained by habitat-mediated superiority of F(1)s over all other genotype classes. Therefore, habitat-mediated selection against the second hybrid generation might be preventing interspecific gene flow in R. x sochadzeae. F(1)DZ formation is postulated to require the formation of F(1)s in quantity, habitat-mediated superiority in F(1)s, and highly specific habitat conditions.

AB Common Ravens (Corvus corax) in the Mojave Desert of California, USA are subsidized by anthropogenic resources. Large numbers of nonbreeding ravens are attracted to human developments and thus are spatially restricted, whereas breeding ravens are distributed more evenly throughout the area. We investigated whether the spatial distribution of risk of predation by ravens to juveniles of the threatened desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) was determined by the spatial distribution of (1) nonbreeding ravens at human developments (leading to "spillover" predation) or (2) breeding individuals throughout developed and undeveloped areas (leading to "hyperpredation"). Predation risk, measured using styrofoam models of juvenile desert tortoises, was high near places Attracting large numbers of nonbreeding ravens, near successful nests, and far from successful nests when large numbers of nonbreeding ravens were present. Patterns consistent with both "spillover" predation and "hyperpredation" were thug observed, attributed to the nonbreeding and breeding segments of the population, respectively. Furthermore, because locations of successful nests changed almost annually, consistent low-predation refugia for juvenile desert tortoises were nearly nonexistent. Consequently, anthropogenic resources for ravens could indirectly lead to the suppression, decline, or even extinction, of desert tortoise populations.

AB Seagrasses form temporally dynamic, fragmented subtidal landscapes in which both large- and small-scale habitat structure may influence faunal survival and abundance. We compared the relative influences of seagrass (Zostera marina L.) habitat fragmentation (patch size and isolation) and structural complexity (shoot density) on juvenile blue crab (Callinectes sapidus Rathbun) survival and density in a Chesapeake Bay seagrass meadow. We tethered crabs to measure relative survival, suction sampled for crabs to measure density, and took seagrass cores to measure shoot density in patches spanning six orders of magnitude (ca. 0.25-30,000 m(2)) both before (June) and after (September) seasonally predictable decreases in seagrass structural complexity and increases in seagrass fragmentation. We also determined if juvenile blue crab density and seagrass shoot density varied between the edge and the interior of patches. In June, juvenile blue crab survival was not linearly related to seagrass patch size or to shoot density, but was significantly lower in patches separated by large expanses of unvegetated sediment (isolated patches) than in patches separated by < 1 m of unvegetated sediment (connected patches). In September, crab survival was inversely correlated with seagrass shoot density. This inverse correlation was likely due to density-dependent predation by juvenile conspecifics (i.e. cannibalism); juvenile blue crab density increased with seagrass shoot density, was inversely correlated with crab survival, and was greater in September than in June. Shoot density effects on predator behavior and on conspecific density also likely caused crab survival to be lower in isolated patches than in connected patches in June. Isolated patches were either large (patch area > 3000 m(2)) or very small (< 1 m(2)). Large isolated patches had the lowest shoot densities, which may have allowed predators to easily find tethered crabs. Very small isolated patches had the highest shoot densities and consequently a high abundance of predators (=juvenile conspecifics). Though shoot density did not differ between the edge and the interior of patches, crabs were more abundant in the interior of patches than at the edge. These results indicate that seagrass fragmentation does not have an overriding influence on juvenile blue crab survival and density, and that crab cannibalism and seasonal changes in landscape structure may influence relationships between crab survival and seagrass habitat structure. Habitat fragmentation, structural complexity, faunal density, and time all must be incorporated into future studies on faunal survival in seagrass landscapes.

AB Artificial nests are commonly used to evaluate predation, but the assumption that this method mimics predation on natural nests has seldom been tested. Natural and artificial nests of eastern yellow robins (Eopsaltriet anstralis) were monitored in four, 55-ha plots over two breeding seasons. Overall, daily survival rates were higher (P < 0.001) for natural (95%/day) than for artificial nests (88%/day). Among plots, daily survival rates for the two types of nests were not correlated with one another (P = 0.72) indicating that the spatial pattern of predation on artificial nests did not mimic that for natural nests. Seasonal variation was evident for natural nests in one year, when they were more successful at the beginning and end of the breeding season. No seasonal patterns were observed for artificial nests in either year. Neither natural nor artificial nests showed annual variation in predation. Previous researchers concluded that large birds were important predators on robin nests, In this study, predation by large birds on artificial nests was positively correlated with the numbers of large birds counted on the plots (P = 0.04). However, large birds depredated only 16% of artificial nests. Daily survival rates for artificial nests were recalculated using predation by large birds only. These rates were compared with natural nests, but there was still no correspondence in the spatial and temporal patterns of predation for the two types of nests. These results suggest that inferences about predation on natural nests based on artificial nest studies should be avoided. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Using the phylogeographic framework, we assessed the DNA sequence variation at the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene across the distribution range of the barbel Barbus barbus, a widely distributed European cyprinid. Reciprocal monophyly of non-Mediterranean European and Balkan/Anatolian populations is taken as evidence for a long-term barrier to gene flow, and interpreted as a consequence of survival of the species in two separate refugia during several later glacial cycles. Lack of profound genealogical divergence across Europe from western France to the northwestern Black Sea basin is consistent with recent colonization of this area from a single glacial refuge, which was probably located in the Danube River basin. This may have occurred in two steps: into the Western European river basins during the last interglacial, and throughout the Central European river basins after the last glacial. The populations from the Balkans and Anatolia apparently did not contribute mitochondrial DNA to the post-Pleistocene colonization of non-Mediterranean Europe. Lack of detectable variation within the Balkans/Anatolia is attributed mainly to recent expansion throughout these regions, facilitated by the freshwater conditions and seashore regression in the Black Sea during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene.

AB Whilst the use of molecular genetic techniques is widespread in the fields of population and evolutionary biology, their application within the mammalian order Chiroptera neither reflects the species richness nor the ecological and behavioural diversity of the order. This is despite the fact that the Chiroptera are problematic to study using more direct observational techniques. Here, we standardize and synthesise the current data, assess the contribution of molecular research to the study of bat species and highlight the importance of its continued and expanded use. At an inter-population level, molecular studies have demonstrated a great diversity of population genetic structure within the order. Among populations of migratory species, genetic structure appears universally low, and hence seasonal movement is likely to be the prevailing influence. However, for sedentary species an array of factors including dispersal ability, extrinsic barriers to gene flow and historical events may determine the extent of genetic partitioning among populations. Intrinsic factors such as wing morphology or roost requirements may also influence population genetic structure in sedentary bat species, a proposal which requires further research. Molecular studies have also made important contributions towards an understanding of social organisation in bats. Evidence indicates that in many polygynous species male mating success does not translate directly into reproductive success, perhaps as a result of multiple mating by females. Estimates of relatedness within and genetic structure among colonies are, in general, very low; a finding which has important implications regarding theories concerning the formation and persistence of bat social groups. Molecular studies have provided new and important insights into the ecology of bats, and have opened up exciting and previously unexplored avenues of research. The data from these studies suggest not only a predictive framework for future studies, but also the use of genetic data in the management and conservation of bat species.

AB Human activities have greatly reduced the amount of the earth's area available to wild species. As the area they have left declines, so will their rates of speciation. This loss of speciation will occur for two reasons: species with larger geographical ranges speciate faster: and loss of area drives up extinction rates, thus reducing the number of species available for speciation. Theory predicts steady states in species diversity, and fossils suggest that these have typified life for most of the past 500 million years. Modern and fossil evidence indicates that, at the scale of the whole earth and its major biogeographical provinces, those steady states respond linearly, or nearly so, to available area. Hence, a loss of x% of area will produce a loss of about x% of species. Local samples of habitats merely echo the diversity available in the whole province of which they are a part. So, conservation tactics that rely on remnant patches to preserve diversity cannot succeed for long. Instead, diversity will decay to a depauperate steady state in two phases. The first will involve deterministic extinctions, reflecting the loss of all areas in which a species can ordinarily sustain its demographics. The second will be stochastic, reflecting accidents brought on by global warming, new diseases, and commingling the species of the separate bio-provinces. A new kind of conservation effort, reconciliation ecology, can avoid this decay. Reconciliation ecology discovers how to modify and diversify anthropogenic habitats so that they harbor a wide variety of species. It develops management techniques that allow humans to share their geographical range with wild species.

AB 1. The chief objectives were to analyse and model experimental data for maximum growth and food consumption of Atlantic salmon parr (Salmo salar) collected from a cold glacier fed river in western Norway. The growth and feeding models were also applied to groups of Atlantic salmon growing and feeding at rates below the maximum. The growth models were validated by comparing their predictions with observed growth in the river supplying the experimental fish.
   2. Two different models were fitted, one originally developed for British salmon and the other based on a model for bacterial growth. Both gave estimates for optimum temperature for growth at 18-19 degreesC, somewhat higher than for Atlantic salmon from Britain. Higher optimal temperature for growth in salmon from a cold Norwegian river than from British rivers does not concur with predictions from the thermal adaptation hypothesis.
   3. Model parameter estimates differed among growth groups in that the lower critical temperature for growth increased from fast to slow growing individuals. In contrast to findings for brown trout (Salmo trutta), the optimum temperature for growth did not decrease with decreasing levels of food consumption.
   4. A new and simple model showed that food consumption (expressed in energy terms) peaked at 19.5-19.8 degreesC, which is similar to the optimal temperature for growth. Feeding began at a temperature 1.5 degreesC below the lower temperature for growth and ended about 1 degreesC above the maximum temperature for growth. Model parameter estimates for consumption differed among growth groups in a manner similar to the growth models. Maximum consumption was lower for Atlantic salmon than for brown trout, except at temperatures above 18 degreesC.
   5. By combining the growth and food consumption models, growth efficiency was estimated and reached a maximum at about 14 degreesC for fast growing individuals, increasing to nearly 17 degreesC for slow growing ones, although it was lower overall for the latter group. Efficiency also declined with increasing fish size. Growth efficiency was generally higher for Atlantic salmon than for brown trout, particularly at high temperature.

AB Macroinvertebrate communities from 29 streams and rivers of the mountain and the Andean Patagonian Plateau were analyzed. Samples were collected from six river basins, which were part of four different biozones of the Patagonian Ecoregion. Samples from mountain streams were dominated by Plecoptera, Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera and Diptera, while plateau rivers where mainly Diptera, Oligochaeta and Mollusca. Total invertebrate abundance ranged from 7 to 12 249 ind.m(-2). Elmidae, Paratrichocladius, Chironomus, Smicridea annulicornis, Parasericostoma ovale and Meridialaris laminata were the most abundant insect taxa, while Nais communis and Hyalella curvispina were the most abundant non-insect taxa. Species-environmental relationships were examined using Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Current speed, conductivity, substrate size and abundance of aquatic plants, were identified as the major variables structuring faunal assemblages. Regression analyses revealed that species richness was negatively correlated with latitude, and positively correlated with water temperature and altitude. Macroivertebrate abundance increased with conductivity, altitude and water temperature. These results suggest that habitat heterogeneity was the strongest predictor of macroinvertebrate assemblages, but species richness could be predicted at a landscape scale using topographical and climatic features.

AB Little attention has been paid to fragmentation effects on organisms living in open habitats in which species may have high mobility and generalized habitat use. We investigated landscape effects on 23 farmland bird species breeding in 72 semi-natural dry pastures distributed equally among three landscape types (agricultural-dominated, mosaic, and forest-dominated) in southcentral Sweden. There were generally higher local abundances of farmland birds in pastures located in agricultural-dominated and mosaic landscapes than in forest-dominated landscapes. Species feeding on a mixed diet as well as resident species and temperate migrants were most numerous in pastures located in agricultural-dominated landscapes and least numerous in forest-dominated landscapes. While controlling for the effects of local pasture area and vegetation structure, we found that the local abundance of 18 (78%) farmland bird species was significantly associated with the composition and structure of the surrounding landscape. The landscape distance that explained the largest part of local variation in abundance varied among species according to the size of their breeding territories or foraging home ranges. Our results suggest that habitat use of farmland birds breeding in pastures is affected both by suitable foraging habitats in the surrounding landscape and by nest sites within local pastures. Despite the generally higher abundances of farmland birds in pastures located in agricultural-dominated landscapes, most species of European and Swedish conservation concern had higher abundance in pastures located in more forested landscapes. Thus, the rapid loss of semi-natural dry pastures in forest-dominated landscapes is a serious threat to the future of these species in Sweden.

AB Current scientific concerns regarding the impacts of global change include the responses of forest composition and biomass to rapid changes in climate, and forest gap models have often been used to address this issue. These models reflect the concept that forest composition and biomass in the absence of large-scale disturbance are explained by competition among species for light and other resources in canopy gaps formed when dominant trees die. Since their initiation 25 yr ago, a wide variety of gap models have been developed that are applicable to different forest ecosystems all over the world. Few gap models, however, have proved to be equally valid over a wide range of environmental conditions, a problem on which our work is focused.
   We previously developed a gap model that is capable of simulating forest composition and biomass in temperate forests of Europe and eastern North America based on a single model structure, In the present study, we extend the model to simulate individual tree species response to strong moisture seasonality and low temperature seasonality, and we modify the widespread parabolic temperature response function to mimic nonlinear increases in growth with increased temperature up to species-specific optimal values.
   The resulting gap model, FORCLIM V2.9, generates realistic projections of tree species composition and biomass across a complex gradient of temperature and moisture in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The model is evaluated against measured basal area and stand structure data at three elevations of the H. J. Andrews LTER site, yielding satisfactory results. The very same model also provides improved estimates of species composition and stand biomass in eastern North America and central Europe, where it originated. This suggests that the model modifications we introduced are indeed generic.
   Temperate forests other than those we studied here are characterized by climates that are quits similar to the ones in the three study regions. Therefore we are confident that it is possible to explain forest composition and biomass of all major temperate forests by means of a single hypothesis as embodied in a forest gap model.

AB Historical and contemporary fish collections were used to examine the influence of agricultural land use on fish communities in the central Chattahoochee River, USA. In-stream habitat data were also collected to examine the relationship between agricultural land use and stream habitat structure. We found a significant positive relationship between agricultural land use and in-stream sediment (r(2)=0.43, P=0.01). Stream depth heterogeneity decreased significantly with increased sediment (r(2)=0.39, P=0.02). Mainstream reaches draining agricultural lands had significantly lower levels of fish diversity than forested reaches (r(2)=0.47, P<0.01), Agriculture also explained significant variation in mainstream species abundances but was not a significant predictor of species diversity or species abundances in headwater reaches. Most pool species that use coarse substrates decreased in relative abundance with increasing agriculture in the watershed. Our results suggest that mainstream environments and their associated communities are more susceptible than headwater reaches to the effects of agriculture. This finding has important consequences for conservation, since mainstream reaches are reported to function as species refugia during pulse disturbance events (e.g., floods, droughts).

AB Soil and vegetation development on surface-mined coal sites in a mixed grass prairie region were studied as (a) naturally revegetated chronosequences of 1, 7, 17, 30 and 45-year old sites, and (b) on sites that were regraded, received topsoil, and were fertilized and seeded. In both cases, vegetation and soils of adjacent, relatively undisturbed areas were also studied for comparison. Species richness was lowest (26 species) at the 1-year old site and highest (114 species) at unmined sites; species richness increased youngest to the oldest sites. Stand ordinations revealed that the site age was the most important factor influencing species richness and abundance. On the younger sites, the environment was characterized by unleached parent materials high in electrical conductivity, SO4, Mg, Ca, and Na and plants growing there were non-native, annual pioneers. At about 30 years, the edaphic conditions had moderated somewhat, and the species complex had a greater number of native species. However, even after 45 years, there were clear differences among mined and unmined sites both in species composition and edaphic conditions. Rates of nutrient accumulations over the 45-year time gradient were as follows: organic C 131 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), N 25 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), P 0.1 kg ha(-1) yr(-)1, and K 4.9 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). C/N ratios showed the widest range for 1-year old sites (5-40), but 70% of the 45-year old sites showed values below 15, comparable to unmined sites. Distributional diagrams of plant species revealed their topographic and habitat preferences which may be helpful in formulating species prescriptions for revegetation. Stand-environmental complex ordinations with 53 variables in the matrix showed topographic variables to be the most important, followed by site age. This study attempted to evaluate simultaneously two major environmental factors-time and topography, as these influence the development of soils and vegetation concomitantly. The use of canonical correspondence analysis facilitated the resolution of these two major environmental factors in illustrating the relationships between the species and the environments in which they grow. Simulations with the CENTURY model of C and N dynamics on north- and south-facing slopes provided useful insights into the recovery time of mined systems. All carbon pools (except passive) were larger on the north-facing slopes than on the south, as was the accumulation of organic N. Rehabilitation of mined areas is now required by law and regulations applicable in the region under discussion mandate the following steps: regrading of ridges to blend in with the surrounding topography, spreading topsoil, fertilizing and seeding. The course of vegetation and soil development of such sites was studied intensively for four years and revealed that the first year vegetation, irrespective of desirable species seeded, was dominated by the pioneer forb, Kochia scoparia. Its replacement by seeded grasses was quick. The rapid replacement of Kochia by grasses appears to be related to the production of allelochemics by Kochia and its acting as a nurse crop in the first year. Although allelochemics may be produced by Kochia as a defense mechanism for herbivory, the compounds seem to produce ionic imbalances (P, Mn, Zn) which hasten its own demise through autotoxicity. Like the abandoned mined sites, dispersal of seeds in space (immigration) seemed to be more important than from seeds in the topsoil (seed banks- dispersal in time).
   But in contrast to abandoned mined sites, the managed sites showed (a) a very rapid replacement of pioneers, (b) three to five times faster rates of leaching of ions capable of diminishing plant growth, (c) 5-8 times faster rates of mineralization of ions that promote growth, and (d) successional trends followed the facilitation and auto-inhibition pathways. A comparison of abandoned and managed systems clearly shows that by following the legal mandates, the rehabilitation process can be achieved many decades sooner with human assistance.

AB We sampled the wood beetle fauna in 1) living hollow, 2) standing dead and 3) downed dead beech Fagus sylvatica logs in fragmented old-growth forests in southern Sweden. In nearly primaeval stands, species richness was similar in the three types of microhabitat, but in previously (50-100 yr ago) managed stands species richness was lower in living hollow trees. The number of red-listed beetle species per sample was higher in living hollow beeches in nearly primaeval stands than in formerly managed stands, but there was no difference in downed dead beeches. This agrees with our expectation, based on the relative stability of the microhabitats, that species living in hollow trees would have a lower dispersal propensity than those that depend on dead, downed logs. Among 55 red-listed species found, 69% had a higher frequency in nearly primaeval stands than in previously managed stands. For 22 endangered plus vulnerable species the figure was 77%. Most red-listed species had occurrence frequencies of 5%, or less.

AB The impact of soil cover organization on the forest community has been studied in a 19-ha tract at Piste de St Elie station in French Guiana. 195 species each represented by at least 10 individuals were chosen from records of the position, diameter at breast height (dbh) and precise identification by botanical sampling of 12 104 ligneous plants (dbh greater than or equal to 10 cm).
   Spatial variations in the soil were mapped using the method proposed by Boulet et al. (1982). The soil mapping units correspond to the successive stages of evolution of a currently unbalanced ferralitic cover. These stages describe firstly the thinning by erosion of the microaggregated upper horizon and secondly the mineralogical changes under more or less extended hydromorphic conditions. The degree of evolution of ferralitic cover is also related to the hydrodynamic functioning and chemical properties of the soil. Geological substrate, topography and slope have also been taken into account.
   Analysis of the influence of environmental variables on plant cover has been performed using the Ecological Profiles method and Correspondence Analysis (CA) of the table of ecological profiles.
   The forest community seems to be dependent on the soil and the topographical features that govern it. There are significant, exclusive soil-species links for each soil functioning mapping unit. However, the highest proportion of significant positive links is connected with a thick microaggregated horizon (25%). Several species are of real value as indicators and more particularly enable differentiation between the forest stands of typical ferralitic soil and the ones of thinned out, transformed and hydromorphic soils. The CA of the species by environmental variables matrices reveals two significant factorial axes. The first can be associated with the drainage mainly related to the thinning of the soil and the second with the hydromorphic conditions related to the topography. The vegetation ordination of the stands (congruent to 0.25 ha) delimited in the various soil domains clearly shows that changes in ferralitic cover and in particular the transition from soil with deep vertical drainage to soil with superficial lateral drainage is accompanied by substantial changes in the forest community.

AB Interest in host-associated microbiomes has skyrocketed recently, yet our ability to explain microbiome variation has remained stubbornly low. Considering scales of interaction beyond the level of the individual host could lead to new insights. Metacommunity theory has many of the tools necessary for modeling multiscale processes and has been successfully applied to host microbiomes. However, the biotic nature of the host requires an expansion of theory to incorporate feedback between the habitat patch (host) and their local (microbial) community. This feedback can have unexpected effects, is predicted to be common, and can arise through a variety of mechanisms, including developmental, ecological, and evolutionary processes. We propose a new way forward for both metacommunity theory and host microbiome research that incorporates this feedback.

AB By modification of the operational conditions of batch reactors, a municipal wastewater treatment plant was upgraded from activated sludge to aerobic granular sludge (AGS) technology. After upgrading, the volume of the biological reactors was reduced by 30%, but the quality of the effluent substantially improved. The concentration of biomass in the reactors increased twofold; the average biomass yield was 0.6 g MLVSS/g COD, and excess granular sludge was efficiently stabilized in aerobic conditions. Canonical correspondence analysis based on the results of next-generation sequencing showed that the time of adaptation significantly influenced the microbial composition of the granules. In mature granules, the abundance of ammonium-oxidizing bacteria was very low, while the abundance of the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria Nitrospira sp. was 0.5 +/- 0.1%. The core genera were Tetrasphaera, Sphingopyxis, Dechloromonas, Flavobacterium, and Ohtaekwangia. Bacteria belonging to these genera produce extracellular polymeric substances, which stabilize granule structure and accumulate phosphorus. The results of this study will be useful for designers of AGS wastewater treatment plants, and molecular data given here provide insight into the ecology of mature aerobic granules from a full-scale facility.

AB Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of experimental drought manipulation studies using rainout shelters in five sites of natural grassland ecosystems of Europe. The single studies assess the effects of extreme drought on the intraspecific variation of the specific leaf area (SLA), a proxy of plant growth. We evaluate and compare the effect size of the SLA response for the functional groups of forbs and grasses in temperate and sub-Mediterranean systems. We hypothesized that the functional groups of grasses and forbs from temperate grassland systems have different strategies in short-term drought response, measured as adjustment of SLA, with SLA-reduction in grasses and SLA-maintenance in forbs. Second, we hypothesized that grasses and forbs from sub-Mediterranean systems do not differ in their drought response as both groups maintain their SLA. We found a significant decrease of SLA in grasses of the temperate systems in response to drought while SLA of forbs showed no significant response. Lower SLA is associated with enhanced water-use efficiency under water stress and thus can be seen as a strategy of phenotypic adjustment. By contrast, in the sub-Mediterranean systems, grasses significantly increased their SLA in the drought treatment. This result points towards a better growth performance of these grasses, which is most likely related to their strategy to allocate resources to belowground parts. The observed SLA reduction of forbs is most likely a direct drought response given that competitive effect of grasses is unlikely due to the scanty vegetation cover. We point out that phenotypic adjustment is an important driver of short-term functional plant response to climatic extremes such as drought. Differential reactions of functional groups have to be interpreted against the background of the group's evolutionary configuration that can differ between climatic zones.

AB A significant fraction of carbon stored in the Earth's soil moves through arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and ectomycorrhiza (EM). The impacts of AM and EM on the soil carbon budget are poorly understood. We propose a method to quantify the mycorrhizal contribution to carbon cycling, explicitly accounting for the abundance of plant-associated and extraradical mycorrhizal mycelium. We discuss the need to acquire additional data to use our method, and present our new global database holding information on plant species-by-site intensity of root colonization by mycorrhizas. We demonstrate that the degree of mycorrhizal fungal colonization has globally consistent patterns across plant species. This suggests that the level of plant species-specific root colonization can be used as a plant trait. To exemplify our method, we assessed the differential impacts of AM:EM ratio and EM shrub encroachment on carbon stocks in sub-arctic tundra. AM and EM affect tundra carbon stocks at different magnitudes, and via partly distinct dominant pathways: via extraradical mycelium (both EM and AM) and via mycorrhizal impacts on above- and belowground biomass carbon (mostly AM). Our method provides a powerful tool for the quantitative assessment of mycorrhizal impact on local and global carbon cycling processes, paving the way towards an improved understanding of the role of mycorrhizas in the Earth's carbon cycle.

AB Biological records are one of the most important sources of data for a large number of research areas. For example, their application has made valuable contributions to climate change ecology, where they are used to monitor species range shifts; to conservation ecology, where they are used to assess species' Red List status; and to biogeography, where they are used to highlight hotspots of biodiversity. A major benefit of biological records is the large spatial extent of the coverage combined with the fine spatial precision of the data: this combination is essential for any ecologist hoping to address large-scale questions about biodiversity and environmental change. Because most biological records are collected by a vast pool of volunteer recorders, studies utilizing biological records have the advantage of large-scale long-term data that it would otherwise be unfeasibly expensive to collect. We review the application of biological records by focussing on four key areas of biodiversity research: biogeography, trend assessments, climate change ecology, and conservation biology. We showcase the diversity of insights that biological records have delivered, which in turn illustrates the contribution of the voluntary recording community to our understanding of biodiversity science.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London.

AB Freezing stress is one of the most important limiting factors determining the ecological distribution and production of tree species. Assessment of frost risk is, therefore, critical for forestry, fruit production, and horticulture. Frost risk is substantial when hazard (i.e., exposure to damaging freezing temperatures) intersects with vulnerability (i.e., frost sensitivity). Based on a large number of studies on frost resistance and frost occurrence, we highlight the complex interactive roles of environmental conditions, carbohydrates, and water status in frost risk development. To supersede the classical empirical relations used to model frost hardiness, we propose an integrated ecophysiologically-based framework of frost risk assessment. This framework details the individual or interactive roles of these factors, and how they are distributed in time and space at the individual-tree level (within-crown and across organs). Based on this general framework, we are able to highlight factors by which different environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, light, flood, and drought), and management practices (pruning, thinning, girdling, sheltering, water aspersion, irrigation, and fertilization) influence frost sensitivity and frost exposure of trees.

AB The processes that cause and influence movement are one of the main points of enquiry in movement ecology. However, ecology is not the only discipline interested in movement: a number of information sciences are specialising in analysis and visualisation of movement data. The recent explosion in availability and complexity of movement data has resulted in a call in ecology for new appropriate methods that would be able to take full advantage of the increasingly complex and growing data volume. One way in which this could be done is to form interdisciplinary collaborations between ecologists and experts from information sciences that analyse movement. In this paper we present an overview of new movement analysis and visualisation methodologies resulting from such an interdisciplinary research network: the European COST Action "MOVE - Knowledge Discovery from Moving Objects" (http://www.move-cost.info). This international network evolved over four years and brought together some 140 researchers from different disciplines: those that collect movement data (out of which the movement ecology was the largest represented group) and those that specialise in developing methods for analysis and visualisation of such data (represented in MOVE by computational geometry, geographic information science, visualisation and visual analytics). We present MOVE achievements and at the same time put them in ecological context by exploring relevant ecological themes to which MOVE studies do or potentially could contribute.

AB BACKGROUNDConcentrations of the neonicotinoid insecticides clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid were determined in arable soils from a variety of locations in England.
   RESULTSIn soil samples taken from the central area of fields, concentrations of clothianidin ranged from 0.02 to 13.6 mu g kg(-1). Thiamethoxam concentrations were between <0.02 and 1.50 mu g kg(-1), and imidacloprid concentrations between <0.09 and 10.7 mu g kg(-1). Concentrations of clothianidin and thiamethoxam were lower in soil samples taken from the edges of fields than from the centres of fields, but this difference was less pronounced for imidacloprid.
   CONCLUSIONThis work gives a clear indication of the levels of neonicotinoids in arable soils after typical use of these compounds as seed dressings in the United Kingdom. There was evidence that imidacloprid was more persistent in the soils studied than clothianidin and thiamethoxam. As clothianidin and thiamethoxam have largely superseded imidacloprid in the United Kingdom, neonicotinoid levels were lower than suggested by predictions based on imidacloprid alone.

AB AimMaps of species ranges are among the most frequently used distribution data in biodiversity studies. As with any biological data, range maps have some level of measurement error, but this error is rarely quantified. We assessed the error associated with amphibian range maps by comparing them with point locality data.
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsThe maps published by the Global Amphibian Assessment were assessed against two data sets of species point localities: the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and a refined data set including recently published, high-quality presence data from both GBIF and other sources. Range fit was measured as the proportion of presence records falling within the range polygon(s) for each species.
   ResultsUsing the high-quality point data provided better fit measures than using the raw GBIF data. Range fit was highly variable among continents, being highest for North American and European species (a fit of 84-94%), and lowest for Asian and South American species (a fit of 57-64%). At the global scale, 95% of amphibian point records were inside the ranges published in maps, or within 31km of the range edge. However, differences among continents were striking, and more points were found far from range edges for South American and Asian species.
   Main conclusionsThe Global Amphibian Assessment range maps represent the known distribution of most amphibians well; this study provides measures of accuracy that can be useful for future research using amphibian maps as baseline data. Nevertheless, there is a need for greater investment in the continuous updating and improvement of maps, particularly in the megadiverse areas of tropical Asia and South America.

AB 1Altitudinal gradients provide a useful space-for-time substitution to examine the capacity for plant competition and facilitation to mediate responses to climate change. Decomposing net interactions into their facilitative and competitive components, and quantifying the performance of plants with and without neighbours along altitudinal gradients, may prove particularly informative in understanding the mechanisms behind plant responses to environmental change. To decouple the inherent responses of species to climate from the responses of plant-plant interactions to climate, we conducted a meta-analysis. Using data from 16 alpine experiments, we tested if changes in net interactions along altitudinal gradients were due to a change in the performance of target species without neighbours (i.e. environmental severity effects only) or with neighbours (neighbour trait mediated effects). There was a global shift from competition to facilitation with increasing altitude driven by both environmental severity and neighbour trait effects. However, this global pattern was strongly influenced by the high number of studies in mesic climates and driven by competition at low altitude in temperate climates (neighbour trait effect), and facilitation at high altitude in arctic and temperate climates (environmental severity effect). In Mediterranean systems, there was no significant effect of competition, and facilitation increased with decreasing altitude. Changes in facilitation with altitude could not unambiguously be attributed to either neighbour trait effects or environmental severity effects, probably because of the opposing stress gradients of cold and aridity in dry environments. Partitioning net interactions along altitudinal gradients led to the prediction that climate change should decrease the importance of facilitation in mesic alpine communities, which might in turn exacerbate the negative effects of climate change in these regions. In xeric climates, the importance of facilitation by drought-tolerant species should increase at low altitudes which should mitigate the negative effect of climate change. However, the importance of facilitation by cold-tolerant species at high altitudes may decrease and exacerbate the effects of climate change.

AB Peat humification or decomposition is a frequently used proxy to extract past time changes in hydrology and climate from peat bogs. During the past century several methods to determine changes in peat decomposition have been introduced. Most of these methods are operationally defined only and the chemical changes underlying the decomposition process are often poorly understood and lack validation. Owing to the chemically undefined nature of many humification analyses the comparison of results obtained by different methods is difficult. In this study we compared changes in peat decomposition proxies in cores of two peat bogs (Konigsmoor, KK; Kleines Rotes Bruch, KRB) from the Harz Mountains (Germany) using C/N ratios, Fourier transform infrared spectra absorption (FTIR) intensities, Rock Eval (R) oxygen and hydrogen indices, delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopic signatures and UV-absorption (UV-ABS) of NaOH peat extracts. In order to explain parallels and discrepancies between these methods, one of the cores was additionally analysed by pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (pyrolysis-GC-MS). Pyrolysis-GC-MS data provide detailed information on a molecular level, which allows differentiation of both changes attributed to decomposition processes and changes in vegetation. Principal component analysis was used to identify and separate the effects of changes in vegetation pattern and decomposition processes because both may occur simultaneously upon changes in bog hydrology. Records of decomposition proxies show similar historical development at both sites, indicating external forcing such as climate as controlling the process. All decomposition proxies except UV-ABS and delta N-15 isotopes show similar patterns in their records and reflect to different extents signals of decomposition. The molecular composition of the KK core reveals that these changes are mainly attributed to decomposition processes and to a lesser extent to changes in vegetation. Changes in the molecular composition indicate that peat decomposition in the KK bog is mainly characterized by preferential decomposition of phenols and polysaccharides and relative enrichment of aliphatics during drier periods. Enrichment of lignin and other aromatics during decomposition was also observed but showed less variation than polysaccharides or aliphatics, and presumably reflects changes in vegetation associated with changes in hydrology of the bogs. Significant correlations with polysaccharide and aliphatic pyrolysis products were found for C/N ratios, FTIR-band intensities and for hydrogen index values, supporting that these decomposition indices provide reasonable information. Correlations of polysaccharide and aliphatic pyrolysis products with oxygen index values and delta C-13 was weaker, assumingly indicating carboxylation of the peat during drier periods and enrichment of isotopically lighter peat components during decomposition, respectively. FTIR, C/N ratio, pyrolysis-GC-MS analyses and Rock Eval hydrogen indices appear to reflect mass loss and related changes in the molecular peat composition during mineralization best. Pyrolysis-GC-MS allows disentangling the decomposition processes and vegetation changes. UV-ABS measurements of alkaline peat extracts show only weak correlation with other decomposition proxies and pyrolysis results as they mainly reflect the formation of humic acids through humification and to a lesser extent mass loss during mineralization.

AB Body condition indices are widely used by ecologists, but many indices are used without empirical validation. To test the validity of a variety of indices, we compared how well a broad range of body condition indices predicted body fat mass, percent body fat and residual fat mass in mice Mus musculus. We also compared the performance of these condition indices with the multiple regression of several morphometric variables on body fat mass, percent body fat and residual fat mass. In our study population, two ratio based condition indices - body mass/body length and log body mass/log body length - predicted body fat mass as well as or better than other ratio and residual indices of condition in females. In males one ratio based condition index (log body mass/log body length) and one residual index (residuals from a regression of pelvic circumference on body length) were best at predicting body fat mass. All indices were better at estimating body fat mass, and residual fat mass than at estimating percent body fat. The predictions of body fat were much better for females than for males. Multiple regressions incorporating pelvic circumference (i.e. girth at the iliac crests) were the best predictors of body fat mass, residual fat mass, and percent body fat, and these multiple regressions were better than any of the condition indices. We recommend 1) that condition be precisely defined, 2) that predictors of condition be empirically validated, 3) that pelvic circumference be considered as a potential predictor of fat content, and 4) that, in general, multiple regression be considered as an alternative to condition indices.

AB This paper considers how farmers perceive and respond to climate change policy risks, and suggests that understanding these risk responses is as important as understanding responses to biophysical climate change impacts. Based on a survey of 162 farmers in California, we test three hypotheses regarding climate policy risk: (1) that perceived climate change risks will have a direct impact on farmer's responses to climate policy risks, (2) that previous climate change experiences will influence farmer's climate change perceptions and climate policy risk responses, and (3) that past experiences with environmental policies will more strongly affect a farmer's climate change beliefs, risks, and climate policy risk responses. Using a structural equation model we find support for all three hypotheses and furthermore show that farmers' negative past policy experiences do not make them less likely to respond to climate policy risks through participation in a government incentive program. We discuss how future research and climate policies can be structured to garner greater agricultural participation. This work highlights that understanding climate policy risk responses and other social, economic and policy perspectives is a vital component of understanding climate change beliefs, risks and behaviors and should be more thoroughly considered in future work.

AB Organic fertilizers have the capacity to alter the nitrogen isotopic composition of plants. Camelid dung and seabird guano are two potentially important fertilizers in the agricultural systems of western South America, particularly Peru and Chile. This paper presents isotopic data (delta C-13 and delta N-15) from field grown plants (maize, lea mays) fertilized with the following four treatments: CO (control, no fertilizer applied), AS (ammonium sulfate, a chemical fertilizer), DU (camelid dung), and SG (seabird guano). Plants were grown in experimental plots in the Viru Valley, northern Peru. Plants fertilized with the chemical fertilizer presented very similar isotopic compositions compared to the control. Conversely, the camelid dung fertilized plants were characterized by higher delta N-15 values compared to the control plants (by 1.8 to 4.2 parts per thousand depending on the plant part). The seabird guano fertilized plants were greatly enriched in N-15 in comparison to the control plants (by 11.3 to 20.0 parts per thousand). The results of this study have important implications for the reconstruction of human diet using isotopic data derived from bone collagen and related tissues, particularly in the prehispanic Andes, but also in Europe and North America during the 19th century, when Peruvian seabird guano was used extensively. Specifically, the interpretation of the relative contributions of plant and animal protein to the diet on the basis of bulk isotopic compositions of bone collagen (or similar tissues) may be confounded by camelid dung fertilization if the carbon isotopic compositions of the two sources are similar. Likewise, the interpretation of the relative contributions of maize and marine protein may be confounded by seabird guano fertilization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Marine debris is a growing problem for wildlife, and has been documented to affect more than 267 species worldwide. We investigated the prevalence of marine debris ingestion in 115 sea turtles stranded in Queensland between 2006-2011, and assessed how the ingestion rates differ between species (Eretmochelys imbricata vs. Chelonia mydas) and by turtle size class (smaller oceanic feeders vs. larger benthic feeders). Concurrently, we conducted 25 beach surveys to estimate the composition of the debris present in the marine environment. Based on this proxy measurement of debris availability, we modeled turtles' debris preferences (color and type) using a resource selection function, a method traditionally used for habitat and food selection. We found no significant difference in the overall probability of ingesting debris between the two species studied, both of which have similar life histories. Curved carapace length, however, was inversely correlated with the probability of ingesting debris; 54.5% of pelagic sized turtles had ingested debris, whereas only 25% of benthic feeding turtles were found with debris in their gastrointestinal system. Benthic and pelagic sized turtles also exhibited different selectivity ratios for debris ingestion. Benthic phase turtles had a strong selectivity for soft, clear plastic, lending support to the hypothesis that sea turtles ingest debris because it resembles natural prey items such as jellyfish. Pelagic turtles were much less selective in their feeding, though they showed a trend towards selectivity for rubber items such as balloons. Most ingested items were plastic and were positively buoyant. This study highlights the need to address increasing amounts of plastic in the marine environment, and provides evidence for the disproportionate ingestion of balloons by marine turtles.

AB The co-occurring of evergreen and deciduous angiosperm trees in Asian tropical dry forests on karst substrates suggests the existence of different water-use strategies among species. In this study it is hypothesized that the co-occurring evergreen and deciduous trees differ in stem hydraulic traits and leaf water relationships, and there will be correlated evolution in drought tolerance between leaves and stems.
   A comparison was made of stem hydraulic conductivity, vulnerability curves, wood anatomy, leaf life span, leaf pressurevolume characteristics and photosynthetic capacity of six evergreen and six deciduous tree species co-occurring in a tropical dry karst forest in south-west China. The correlated evolution of leaf and stem traits was examined using both traditional and phylogenetic independent contrasts correlations.
   It was found that the deciduous trees had higher stem hydraulic efficiency, greater hydraulically weighted vessel diameter (D-h) and higher mass-based photosynthetic rate (A(m)); while the evergreen species had greater xylem-cavitation resistance, lower leaf turgor-loss point water potential (p(0)) and higher bulk modulus of elasticity. There were evolutionary correlations between leaf life span and stem hydraulic efficiency, A(m), and dry season p(0). Xylem-cavitation resistance was evolutionarily correlated with stem hydraulic efficiency, D-h, as well as dry season p(0). Both wood density and leaf density were closely correlated with leaf water-stress tolerance and A(m).
   The results reveal the clear distinctions in stem hydraulic traits and leaf water-stress tolerance between the co-occurring evergreen and deciduous angiosperm trees in an Asian dry karst forest. A novel pattern was demonstrated linking leaf longevity with stem hydraulic efficiency and leaf water-stress tolerance. The results show the correlated evolution in drought tolerance between stems and leaves.

AB Aim We tested the hypothesis that shredder detritivores, a key trophic guild in stream ecosystems, are more diverse at higher latitudes, which has important ecological implications in the face of potential biodiversity losses that are expected as a result of climate change. We also explored the dependence of local shredder diversity on the regional species pool across latitudes, and examined the influence of environmental factors on shredder diversity.
   Location World-wide (156 sites from 17 regions located in all inhabited continents at latitudes ranging from 67 degrees N to 41 S).
   Methods We used linear regression to examine the latitudinal variation in shredder diversity at different spatial scales: alpha (alpha), gamma (gamma) and beta (beta) diversity. We also explored the effect of gamma-diversity on alpha-diversity across latitudes with regression analysis, and the possible influence of local environmental factors on shredder diversity with simple correlations.
   Results Alpha diversity increased with latitude, while gamma- and beta-diversity showed no clear latitudinal pattern. Temperate sites showed a linear relationship between gamma- and alpha-diversity; in contrast, tropical sites showed evidence of local species saturation, whichmay explain why the latitudinal gradient in alpha-diversity is not accompanied by a gradient in gamma-diversity. Alpha diversity was related to several local habitat characteristics, but gamma- and beta-diversity were not related to any of the environmental factors measured.
   Main conclusions Our results indicate that global patterns of shredder diversity are complex and depend on spatial scale. However, we can draw several conclusions that have important ecological implications. Alpha diversity is limited at tropical sites by local factors, implying a higher risk of loss of key species or the whole shredder guild (the latter implying the loss of trophic diversity). Even if regional species pools are not particularly species poor in the tropics, colonization from adjacent sites may be limited. Moreover, many shredder species belong to cool-adapted taxa that may be close to their thermal maxima in the tropics, which makes them more vulnerable to climate warming. Our results suggest that tropical streams require specific scientific attention and conservation efforts to prevent loss of shredder biodiversity and serious alteration of ecosystem processes.

AB 1. Collaborative adaptive management (CAM) is regularly touted as the best way to handle natural resource management in the face of uncertainty, change and conflict. Successful applications of CAM have, however, been elusive in practice.
   2. This article examines the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program(AMP) in the United States, and other CAM efforts, to illustrate why and how procedural shortcomings may lead to natural resource management failures and reflect on how they may be overcome.
   3. Synthesis and applications. To increase the chance of success, CAM efforts should set clear over-arching goals and concrete and measurable objectives, employ tools and incentives to facilitate participation and foster collaboration, implement well-defined joint fact-finding protocols to promote shared learning and manage scientific uncertainty, and commit to monitoring and adapting their management regimes over time. Even in complex and contentious resource management contexts, future CAM efforts that integrate these design elements are likely to lead to more effective natural resource management.

AB Environmental warming is predicted to rise dramatically over the next century, yet few studies have investigated its effects in natural, multi-species systems. We present data collated over an 8-year period from a catchment of geothermally heated streams in Iceland, which acts as a natural experiment on the effects of warming across different organisational levels and spatiotemporal scales. Body sizes and population biomasses of individual species responded strongly to temperature, with some providing evidence to support temperature size rules. Macroinvertebrate and meiofaunal community composition also changed dramatically across the thermal gradient. Interactions within the warm streams in particular were characterised by food chains linking algae to snails to the apex predator, brown trout These chains were missing from the colder systems, where snails were replaced by much smaller herbivores and invertebrate omnivores were the top predators. Trout were also subsidised by terrestrial invertebrate prey, which could have an effect analogous to apparent competition within the aquatic prey assemblage. Top-down effects by snails on diatoms were stronger in the warmer streams, which could account for a shallowing of mass-abundance slopes across the community. This may indicate reduced energy transfer efficiency from resources to consumers in the warmer systems and/or a change in predator-prey mass ratios. All the ecosystem process rates investigated increased with temperature, but with differing thermal sensitivities, with important implications for overall ecosystem functioning (e.g. creating potential imbalances in elemental fluxes). Ecosystem respiration rose rapidly with temperature, leading to increased heterotrophy. There were also indications that food web stability may be lower in the warmer streams.

AB Species monitoring is one key approach to assess human impact on nature. Four main approaches have been applied in bird monitoring: comparing distribution atlases from different times, repeated monitoring programmes, checklist programmes, and species-specific surveys. We evaluate the potential of another type of data for monitoring: presence-only data on species sightings reported voluntarily by the public to open-access internet platforms, here the Species Gateway (SG) in Sweden. We regressed data on the 242 bird species observed 2001-2009 in the Swedish Bird Survey (SBS) against the corresponding SG data. We also investigated the relationship for groups of species utilizing different habitats and displaying a significant inter-annual variation, a coefficient of variation >0.3 according to the SBS. We found support for a positive relationship in inter-annual variation in population level between the two datasets. However, the species subsets displayed variation from positive to negative correlations. Restricting the analysis to species with high inter-annual variation increased the positive correlation between the data sets. The reason for the mismatch between the two datasets may be explained by temporal changes in the willingness to report certain common species to the SG. Another reason may be an imbalance in the coverage of common versus uncommon species among the two datasets. The use of voluntary citizen-based data requires great care and good knowledge of the limitation of the data. If these requirements are fulfilled, we suggest that they may be a complement to standardised programmes. especially for assessing uncommon species of conservation concern. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Coping strategies are important for performance in sport and individual differences may contribute to the coping strategies adopted by athletes. In this study, we explored the main and interactive effects of the big five personality dimensions on sport-related coping and compared personality profiles of discrete groups of athletes. Altogether, 253 athletes (mean age 21.1 years, s = 3.7) completed the NEO-FFI (Costa & McCrae, 1992), and the Coping Function Questionnaire for Sport (Kowalski & Crocker, 2001). Results showed that extraverted athletes, who were also emotionally stable and open to new experiences (a three-way interaction effect), reported a greater use of problem-focused coping strategies. Conscientious athletes (main effect), and athletes displaying high levels of extraversion, openness, and agreeableness (a three-way interaction effect), reported a greater use of emotion-focused coping strategies, and athletes with low levels of openness, or high levels of neuroticism (main effects), reported a greater use of avoidance coping strategies. Different personality characteristics were observed between higher-level and lower-level athletes, between men and women athletes, and between individual and team sport athletes. These findings suggest that the five-factor model of personality can help distinguish various levels of athletic involvement and can help identify the coping strategies athletes are likely to adopt during participation.

AB P>Trees reduce their carbon (C) allocation to roots and mycorrhizal fungi in response to high nitrogen (N) additions, which should reduce the N retention capacity of forests. The time needed for recovery of mycorrhizas after termination of N loading remains unknown.
   Here, we report the long-term impact of N loading and the recovery of ectomycorrhiza after high N loading on a Pinus sylvestris forest. We analysed the N% and abundance of the stable isotope 15N in tree needles and soil, soil microbial fatty acid biomarkers and fungal DNA.
   Needles in N-loaded plots became enriched in 15N, reflecting decreased N retention by mycorrhizal fungi and isotopic discrimination against 15N during loss of N. Meanwhile, needles in N-limited (control) plots became depleted in 15N, reflecting high retention of 15N by mycorrhizal fungi. N loading was terminated after 20 yr. The delta 15N and N% of the needles decreased 6 yr after N loading had been terminated, and approached values in control plots after 15 yr. This decrease, and the larger contributions compared with N-loaded plots of a fungal fatty acid biomarker and ectomycorrhizal sequences, suggest recovery of ectomycorrhiza.
   High N loading rapidly decreased the functional role of ectomycorrhiza in the forest N cycle, but significant recovery occurred within 6-15 yr after termination of N loading.

AB Global climate change poses an immense challenge for conservation biologists seeking to mitigate impacts to species and ecosystems. Species persistence will depend on geographic range shifts or adaptation in response to warming patterns as novel climates and community assemblages arise. Assisted colonization has been proposed as a method for addressing these challenges. This technique, which consists of transporting species to a new range that is predicted to be favorable for persistence under future climate scenarios, has become the subject of controversy and discussion in the conservation community due to its highly manipulative nature, questions about widespread feasibility, and uncertainty associated with the likelihood of translocated species becoming invasive. We reviewed the discussion and criticism associated with assisted colonization and sought to identify other conservation techniques that also display potential to promote the colonization and adaptation of species in response to climate change. We propose an integrated conservation strategy that includes management for habitat connectivity, conservation genetics, and when necessary, assisted colonization of species that are still unable to shift their ranges even given implementation of the above standard conservation approaches. We argue that this integrated approach will facilitate persistence for a larger proportion of species than is possible by solely using assisted colonization. Furthermore, a multi-faceted approach will likely reduce the uncertainty of conservation outcomes and will become increasingly necessary for conservation of biodiversity in a changing climate.

AB Prochlorococcus describes a diverse and abundant genus of marine photosynthetic microbes. It is primarily found in oligotrophic waters across the globe and plays a crucial role in energy and nutrient cycling in the ocean ecosystem. The abundance, global distribution, and availability of isolates make Prochlorococcus a model system for understanding marine microbial diversity and biogeochemical cycling. Analysis of 73 metagenomic samples from the Global Ocean Sampling expedition acquired in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans revealed the presence of two uncharacterized Prochlorococcus clades. A phylogenetic analysis using six different genetic markers places the clades close to known lineages adapted to high-light environments. The two uncharacterized clades consistently cooccur and dominate the surface waters of high-temperature, macronutrient-replete, and low-iron regions of the Eastern Equatorial Pacific upwelling and the tropical Indian Ocean. They are genetically distinct from each other and other high-light Prochlorococcus isolates and likely define a previously unrecognized ecotype. Our detailed genomic analysis indicates that these clades comprise organisms that are adapted to iron-depleted environments by reducing their iron quota through the loss of several iron-containing proteins that likely function as electron sinks in the photosynthetic pathway in other Prochlorococcus clades from high-light environments. The presence and inferred physiology of these clades may explain why Prochlorococcus populations from iron-depleted regions do not respond to iron fertilization experiments and further expand our understanding of how phytoplankton adapt to variations in nutrient availability in the ocean.

AB Despite increasing interest in urban ecology the factors limiting the colonisation of towns and cities by species from rural areas are poorly understood. This is largely due to the lack of a detailed conceptual framework for this urbanisation process, and of sufficient case studies. Here, we develop such a framework. This draws upon a wide range of ecological and evolutionary theory and the increasing number of studies of how the markedly divergent conditions in urban and rural areas influence the traits of urban populations and the structure of urban assemblages. We illustrate the importance of this framework by compiling a detailed case study of spatial and temporal variation in the urbanisation of the blackbird Turdus merula. Our framework identifies three separate stages in the urbanisation process: (i) arrival, (ii) adjustment, and (iii) spread. The rate of progress through each stage is influenced by environmental factors, especially human attitudes and socio-economic factors that determine the history of urban development and the quality of urban habitats, and by species' ecological and life-history traits. Some traits can positively influence progression through one stage, but delay progression through another. Rigorous assessment of the factors influencing urbanisation should thus ideally pay attention to the different stages. Urbanisation has some similarities to invasion of exotic species, but the two clearly differ. Invasion concerns geographic range expansion that is external to the species' original geographic range, whilst urbanisation typically relates to filling gaps within a species' original range. This process is exemplified by the blackbird which is now one of the commonest urban bird species throughout its Western Palearctic range. This is in stark contrast to the situation 150 years ago when the species was principally confined to forest. Blackbird urbanisation was first recorded in Germany in 1820, yet some European cities still lack urban blackbirds. This is especially so in the east, where urbanisation has spread more slowly than in the west. The timing of blackbird urbanisation exhibits a marked spatial pattern, with latitude and longitude explaining 76% of the variation. This strong spatial pattern contrasts with the weaker spatial pattern in timing of urbanisation exhibited by the woodpigeon Columba palumbus (with location explaining 39% of the variation), and with the very weak spatial pattern in timing of black-billed magpie Pica pica urbanisation (in which location explains 12% of the variation). Strong spatial patterns in timing of urbanisation are more compatible with the leap-frog urbanisation model, in which urban adapted or imprinted birds colonise other towns and cities, than with the independent urbanisation model, in which urban colonisation events occur independently of each other. Spatial patterns in isolation do not, however, confirm one particular model. Factors relating to the arrival and adjustment stages appear particularly likely to have influenced the timing of blackbird urbanisation. Spatial variation in the occurrence of urban populations and the timing of their establishment creates opportunities to assess the factors regulating urbanisation rates, and how the composition of urban assemblages develops as a result. These are major issues for urban ecology.

AB Climate change and habitat destruction are widely recognized as major threats to species' survival. As a result of these anthropogenic impacts, species are often forced into novel landscapes where their persistence is difficult to predict. Knowledge of how individuals move or disperse through the landscape, choose habitat in which to settle, and produce offspring which survive to repeat the process can greatly improve our ability to predict species' persistence. The field of behavioral landscape ecology uses a strong theoretical base to explore, often experimentally, how the behavior of a particular species is affected by heterogeneous and rapidly changing landscapes and can offer valuable insight for managing species in the face of human-induced environmental changes. When interpreted by modelers, results of landscape-level behavioral experiments can be quantified for use in predictive models. To this end, we summarize the methods and results of research using direct experimental manipulation techniques broken into the following categories: translocations, playback experiments, food resource manipulations, manipulations of reproductive success, direct manipulations of the landscape, and manipulations of predation risk. We review and place in a theoretical framework the results from this emerging body of research regarding how organisms move in and respond to different types of landscapes, both natural and human-altered. We go onto highlight the potential of each experimental method to quantify different processes, which may be useful when interpreted by modelers attempting to parameterize predictive models. Finally, we suggest future directions for experimental research that will allow for greater integration of behavioral landscape ecology and predictive modeling. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB There is a general consensus that functional traits are reliable indicators of adaptation of organisms to particular environmental characteristics. In this study we relate the combined distributions of species traits of plants and animals to disturbance regimes in chestnut forests of southern Switzerland affected by regular winter fires. We used co-inertia analysis for combining the trait response of 471 invertebrate species (117 001 individuals) and 81 plant species at 23 sites with different fire and cutting histories. Trait response was assessed by calculating the variation in weighted mean traits averaged over the communities and by using mean traits in multivariate analyses. The analysis showed a strong association between plant and animal traits under fire constraints (Monte-Carlo test, p=0.0045). Plants and animal distributions show parallel trends in responses to fire which selects traits relating to persistence (ability to survive), resilience (ability to recover) and mobility. Warmth-demanding insects, herbivores, flying carnivores and pollinators were associated with recent fires, as were annual, ruderal and light-demanding plant species with long flowering duration. Small arthropods feeding on dead wood and those with narrow habitat requirements were associated with low fire frequency and unburnt sites, as were competitive plants with large seeds favoring moist sites. The spatial association between plant and animal traits reflected adaptations that promote survival in the disturbance regime, while the disturbance acts as an environmental filter on the distribution and assemblage of the trait values within communities.
   This combined analysis of plant and invertebrate traits distributions illustrates how community and ecosystem responses can be monitored and the results generalized across localities and disturbance types. Analyses of traits that cross trophic levels provide powerful and promising tools for validating management procedures and controlling ecosystem functions.

AB In order to explore the potential of dinocyst assemblages in marine sediment as a proxy for primary productivity, we analyzed a reference "modern" database including 1171 sites from the North Atlantic Ocean (n = 483), the Arctic Ocean (n = 401) and the North Pacific Ocean (n = 287). We compiled two sets of primary productivity data derived from satellite observations: (1) The dataset from the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) program applied to observations from 1978 to 1989 and (2) the data set from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) program using observations from 2002 to 2005. We performed canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) on a data matrix that included 62 dinocyst taxa and eight sea-surface parameters (winter and summer salinity, winter and summer temperature, sea-ice cover, summer, winter and annual primary productivity). CCA results show that primary productivity is a determinant parameter of dinocyst assemblages (including both phototrophic and heterotrophic taxa) in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and at hemispheric scale. In the North Pacific, the relationship between productivity and dinocyst assemblages is particularly strong. We tested the modern analogue technique to reconstruct productivity using the North Atlantic, North Pacific, Arctic and hemispheric dinocyst data sets. With the exception of the Arctic Ocean alone, which is characterized by overall low productivity, productivity Can be estimated with an accuracy (Root Mean Square Error = RMSE) of +/- 11-25%. The best performance is obtained for reconstruction of winter productivity from the MODIS data. It is noteworthy that the RMSE for all estimated productivity parameters is narrower than the mean differences between productivity data derived from the MODIS and CZCS data sets. Therefore, we conclude that dinocysts can be used to reconstruct productivity with an accuracy equivalent to that of primary productivity estimated from satellite observations. Application of the approach in a sedimentary core from the northwest North Atlantic (core HU 91-045-094) revealed large amplitude variations of productivity over the last 25,000 years. The use of both MODIS and CZCS datasets indicate generally low productivity during the glacial stage, the Younger Dryas and Heinrich events, with annual productivity of less than 100 gC m(-2). The reconstructions also suggest higher productivity during the early Holocene, especially based on the MODIS data that suggest annual values of up to 350 gC m(-2). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Habitat remnants in urbanized areas typically conserve biodiversity and serve the recreation and urban open-space needs of human populations. Nevertheless, these goals can be in conflict if human activity negatively affects wildlife. Hence, when considering habitat remnants as conservation refuges it is crucial to understand how human activities and land uses affect wildlife use of those and adjacent areas. We used tracking data (animal tracks and den or bed sites) on 10 animal species and information on human activity and environmental factors associated with anthropogenic disturbance in 12 habitat fragments across San Diego County, California, to examine the relationships among habitat fragment characteristics, human activity, and wildlife presence. There were no significant correlations of species presence and abundance with percent plant cover for all species or with different land-use intensities for all species, except the opossum (Didelphis virginiana), which preferred areas with intensive development. Woodrats (Neotoma spp.) and cougars (Puma concolor) were associated significantly and positively and significantly and negatively, respectively, with the presence and prominence of utilities. Woodrats were also negatively associated with the presence of horses. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) and coyotes (Canis latrans) were associated significantly and negatively and significantly and positively, respectively, with plant bulk and permanence. Cougars and gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) were negatively associated with the presence of roads. Roadrunners (Geococcyx californianus) were positively associated with litter. The only species that had no significant correlations with any of the environmental variables were black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). Bobcat tracks were observed more often than gray foxes in the study area and bobcats correlated significantly only with water availability, contrasting with results from other studies. Our results appear to indicate that maintenance of habitat fragments in urban areas is of conservation benefit to some animal species, despite human activity and disturbance, as long as the fragments are large.

AB In promiscuous species, male reproductive success is determined by the interaction between the ability to access and choose females of the highest reproductive quality and, after copulation, the ability to outcompete the ejaculates of rival males. Disentangling the factors regulating the interplay between traits conferring a reproductive advantage before and after copulation is therefore crucial to understanding how sexual strategies evolve. Here we show in the fowl Gallus gallus, where social status determines copulation success, that dominant males produce more sperm than subordinates but that the quality of dominant males' sperm decreases over successive copulations, whereas that of subordinates remains constant. Experimentally manipulating male social status confirmed that ejaculate quality ( the number and quality of sperm produced) was a response to the social environment rather than the result of intrinsic differences between dominant and subordinate males. We further show that dominant males responded to variation in female sexual ornamentation, which signals reproductive quality, by adjusting the number and quality of sperm they transferred, whereas subordinate males did not: they transferred ejaculates of similar quality to females with different ornament sizes. These results indicate that trade-offs between traits influencing reproductive success before and after copulation, combined with variation in social dynamics and female quality, may favor the evolution of phenotypically plastic alternative reproductive strategies.

AB Repeatability of parental care, let alone heritability of care, has been rarely measured, although there has been much research linking sexual selection to male parental care and also examining biparental care in relation to game theory models. We investigated within- and between-year repeatabilities of incubation and nestling provisioning and how these two types of parental care were related in a sexually dimorphic species, the house sparrow, Passer domesticus. We found that between- and within-year repeatabilities of feeding rate were high in males and low to moderate in females, but that between- and within-year repeatabilities of incubation time were low to moderate in both sexes. Interestingly, the amount of time during which neither sex incubated significantly predicted the subsequent male feeding rate but not the female feeding rate. Our results suggest a need for a new theoretical framework that encompasses variation in the predictability and plasticity of parental investment by individuals.

AB Aim In this study, I determine the relationships between net primary productivity (NPP), human population density, species richness and land use. I also examine the implications of human settlement patterns for species conservation. Location Australia.
   Methods I document the associations between NPP, human population density and the species richness of birds, butterflies and mammals using correlations and spatial regressions. I also assess changes in land-use with NPP and population density, focussing particularly on protected areas. An initial exploration into the implications of the NPP-population density relationship for regional conservation strategies is provided.
   Results Human population density increases with NPP suggesting that available energy may be a key driving force of human settlement patterns. The species richness of each taxonomic group and geographically restricted species also increases with NPP leading to substantial overlap between species diversity and populated regions. The percentage of land designated as minimal use decreases considerably with increasing human population density and NPP, while intensive agriculture is confined entirely to areas of high NPP. There are strong negative relationships between the size of Australia's National Parks and human population density and NPP. Small parks are often surrounded by relatively dense settlements, but have high average NPP, while large parks are mostly isolated and characterized by low productivity. There are no areas in the highest quartile of NPP that also occur in the most sparsely populated regions, presenting challenges for conservation strategies wanting to protect productive areas under the least threat of human development.
   Main conclusions Human population density and species richness respond similarly to variation in NPP, leading to spatial congruence between human settlements and productive, species rich regions. Planning strategies are required that minimize the potential threat posed by human development to diverse ecosystems and maximize the underlying productivity of protected areas. Reducing the level of threat may require stabilizing the size of the human population, while capturing larger areas of relatively high productivity in the conservation reserve system would lead to greater protection of local diversity.

AB Data from six sites in Victoria Land (72-77 degrees S) investigating co-variation in soil communities (microbial and invertebrate) with biogeochemical properties showthe influence of soil properties on habitat suitability varied among local landscapes as well as across climate gradients. Species richness of metazoan invertebrates (Nematoda, Tardigrada and Rotifera) was similar to previous descriptions in this region, though identification of three cryptic nematode species of Eudorylainius through DNA analysis contributed to the understanding of controls over habitat preferences for individual species. Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis profiles revealed unexpectedly high diversity of bacteria. Distribution of distinct bacterial communities was associated with specific sites in northern and southern Victoria Land, as was the distribution of nematode and tardigrade species. Variation in soil metazoan communities was related to differences in soil organic matter, while bacterial diversity and community structure were not strongly correlated with any single soil property. There were no apparent correlations between metazoan and bacterial diversity, suggesting that controls over distribution and habitat suitability are different for bacterial and metazoan communities. Our results imply that top-down controls over bacterial diversity mediated by their metazoan consumers are not significant determinants of bacterial community structure and biomass in these ecosystems.

AB The metacommunity framework predicts that local coexistence depends on the outcome of local species interactions and regional migration. In analogous fashion, spatial structure among populations can shape species interactions through evolutionary mechanisms. Yet, most metacommunity theories assume that populations do not evolve. Here, we evaluate how evolution shapes local species coexistence and exclusion within the multiscale and multispecies context embodied by the metacommunity framework. In general, coexistence in joint ecological-evolutionary models requires low to intermediate dispersal rates that can promote maintenance of both regional species and genetic diversity. These conditions support a set of key mechanisms that modify patterns of species coexistence including local adaptation, gene storage effects, genetic rescue effects, spatial genetic subsidies, and metacommunity evolution. Multispecies extensions indicate that correlated selection can further alter the outcome of interspecific interactions depending on the magnitude and direction of correlations and shape of fitness trade-offs. We suggest that an evolving metacommunity perspective has the potential to generate novel predictions about community structure and function by incorporating the genetic and species diversity that characterize. natural communities. In adopting such A perspective, we seek to facilitate understanding about the interactions between evolutionary and metacommunity dynamics.

AB This paper reviews the use of stable nitrogen isotopes (delta N-15) to delineate the influence of sewage nitrogen (N) in coastal ecosystems, drawing extensively on the case of Himmerfjarden, a Baltic Sea bay that receives N-15-enriched tertiary treated sewage that is discharged mainly as dissolved inorganic N (DIN). Gradients of delta N-15 in macroalgae (Fucus vesiculosus) and surface sediments traced sewage-derived N to 24 km from the outfall but elevated WIN values (> 7 parts per thousand) indicated that the sewage influence was most pronounced within 10 km. Comparison of macroalgal delta N-15 values before and after enhanced tertiary treatment showed a decrease in the spatial impact of sewage N from about 24 km to 12 km from the outfall and a decrease to more marine delta N-15 values in more recent growth tissues. Sedimentary WIN records showed that sewage has had a dominant influence on organic matter production in the bay with dramatic increases in sedimentary during the years of maximum sewage N loads. In cases where sewage N introduces a distinct isotopic signature into a system and where it has had a dominant influence on organic matter production, delta N-15 values in biota and sediments can be used to trace the spatial and temporal influence of sewage N in aquatic ecosystems.

AB Desert ecosystems are characterized by distinct spatial patterning in soil biogeochemistry and biodiversity. In the Antarctic Dry Valleys, soil polygons are prominent features of the landscape and may be key units for scaling local ecological information to the greater region. We examined polygon soils in each of the three basins of Taylor Valley, Antarctica. Our objectives were to characterize variability in soil biogeochemistry and biodiversity at local to regional scales, and to test the influence of soil properties upon invertebrate communities. We found that soil biogeochemical properties and biodiversity vary over multiple spatial scales from fine (< 10 m) to broad (> 10 km) scales. Differences in biogeochemistry were most pronounced at broad scales among the major lake basins of Taylor Valley corresponding to differences in geology and microclimate, while variation in invertebrate biodiversity and abundance occurred at landscape scales of 10-500 m, and within individual soil polygons. Variation in biogeochernistry and invertebrate communities across these scales reflects the influence of physical processes and landscape development over ecosystem structure in the dry valleys. The development of soil polygons influences the spatial patterning of soil properties such as soil organic matter, salinity, moisture, and invertebrate habitat suitability. Nematode abundance and life history data indicate that polygon interiors are more suitable habitats than soils in the troughs at the edges of polygons. These data Suggest that physical processes (i.e., polygon development) and biogeochemistry are important influences on the spatial variability of biotic communities in dry valley soil ecosystems.

AB In general, amphibians are known to exhibit a higher degree of population subdivision than any other major animal taxa, but large-scale population genetic surveys of widely distributed species are still scarce, especially in the Eurasian continent. Using microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA sequences, we investigated the large-scale population genetic structure of the common frog (Rana temporaria) - one of the most widespread amphibians of the Palearctic region. Analyses of cytochrome b sequences revealed evidence for two distinct lineages inhabiting western and eastern parts of Europe. The separation of these lineages c. 700 000 years ago may have been induced by the onset of the Middle Pleistocene continental glaciations. Analyses of the variability of microsatellite loci within each of the clades revealed evidence for evolution of a high degree of population subdivision (F-ST similar to 0.23) even in northern Fennoscandia, colonized less than 10 000 years ago. The high level of substructuring is puzzling in the face of an apparently high dispersal capacity, as evidenced by the rather rapid recolonization of northern Europe. This suggests that processes other than restricted dispersal capacity need to be explored as explanations for the high degree of population subdivision in amphibians. The colonization of northern Europe has been accompanied by loss of genetic variability as evidenced by decreasing levels of intrapopulational genetic variability in microsatellite loci from south to north across Europe.

AB We examined the effects of decreasing plant diversity and functional group identity on root biomass, soil bulk density, soil nitrate and ammonium concentrations, microbial basal respiration, density of predaceous and non-predaceous nematodes, earthworm biomass and density and Shannon-Wiener indices of earthworm diversity in a temperate grassland. Plant species and functional group diversity did not have significant effects on any of these measured variables. However, functional group identity of the plants did significantly affect root biomass and soil abiotic factors. In addition, root biomass, Shannon-Wiener indices of earthworm diversity and density of epigeic earthworms were significantly higher in the presence of legumes, while we found no correlation between functional group identity and other groups of soil biota. We also found several significant relationships among root biomass density, soil microbial basal respiration, nematodes and earthworms.
   Thus, how can the lack of correlation between soil variables and plant diversity manipulation be explained? Firstly, plant litter input and historical land use have long-term effects on soil properties, which suggests effects of plant diversity manipulation might only be manifested over the long-term. However, we found significant relationships between root biomass density and soil biota suggesting that changes in root biomass density with declining plant diversity could lead to changes in soil biota that might be detectable despite large temporal lags in the soil system. Secondly, we did not find significant effects of plant diversity on root biomass but we found that it was significantly related to the identity of functional groups. Thirdly, we observed complex interactions among trophic levels of soil organisms, which may counteract and buffer effects of changes in plant diversity on soil biota. Fourth, our results suggest that belowground properties might be much more influenced by the identity (and litter quality) of plant functional groups than plant species diversity per se.

ID BIOTIC INTEGRITY; URBANIZATION; QUALITY; FISH; HABITAT; AREAS
AB We examined relations between the amounts and spatial patterns of urban land cover and fish assemblages, physical habitat, base flow, and water temperature at 39 sites in small. coldwater trout streams in Wisconsin and Minnesota. The amount of connected impervious surface area in the watershed was negatively correlated with a fish-based coldwater index of biotic integrity (IBI), catches of all coldwater and coolwater fishes and trout, and the percentage of intolerant fish; it was positively correlated with fish species richness and the percentage of tolerant fish. Nonlinear models were developed by means of 90% quantile regression to predict the maximum possible IBI score, abundance of trout, and percentage of intolerant fish at a given level of imperviousness. At a connected imperviousness of less than about 6% for a watershed, all three variables could have high values, whereas at a connected imperviousness above 11% the values were inevitably low. Between 6% and 11%, minor changes in urbanization could result in major changes in stream fishes. Canonical correspondence analysis identified water temperature and base flow its the key instream habitat factors explaining stream fish assemblages patterns. The percentage of connected impervious area in the watershed had a positive, linear relation with water temperature and a negative, nonlinear relation with base flow, suggesting pathways by which urbanization affected fish assemblages. Partial redundancy analysis indicated that land cover within 30 m of the stream channel explained considerably more variance in fish assemblages and instream habitat and physical conditions than land cover beyond 30 in. Our study Suggests that low levels of urban development can damage coldwater stream systems. Development strategies that protect the riparian area and minimize imperviousness may reduce this damage.

AB Understanding of the effects of wildland fire and fire management on aquatic and riparian ecosystems is an evolving field, with many questions still to be resolved. Limitations of current knowledge, and the certainty that fire management will continue, underscore the need to summarize available information. Integrating fire and fuels management with aquatic ecosystem conservation begins with recognizing that terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are linked and dynamic, and that fire can play a critical role in maintaining aquatic ecological diversity. To protect aquatic ecosystems we argue that it will be important to: (1) accommodate fire-related and other ecological processes that maintain aquatic habitats and biodiversity, and not simply control fires or fuels; (2) prioritize projects according to risks and opportunities for fire control and the protection of aquatic ecosystems; and (3) develop new consistency in the management and regulatory process. Ultimately, all natural resource management is uncertain; the role of science is to apply experimental design and hypothesis testing to management applications that affect fire and aquatic ecosystems. Policy-makers and the public will benefit from an expanded appreciation of fire ecology that enables them to implement watershed management projects as experiments with hypothesized outcomes, adequate controls, and replication.

AB Morphological correlates of diet were examined in 48 species of freshwater fishes front floodplain lakes in the central part of the Mamore River (Bolivian Amazon). The species were classified, according to the percentage occurrence of seven food items, into eight broad trophic categories: mud feeders, algivores, herbivores. terrestrial invertivores and omnivores, carnivores. zooplanktivores. aquatic invertivores and piscivores. There were significant relationships between the diet and morphology of the fishes even when the effect of taxonomical relatedness between species was eliminated. Relative gut length was the main morphological variable used to order species oil a carnivore to Mud feeder gradient. Standard length and head and mouth size were the morphological variables most closely associated with prey size. Mud feeder, algivore and piscivore species appeared as the most dietary and morphologically 9 specialized. These results support both the hypotheses that species morphology influences the diet and that morphological similarity is conserved even in comparison with taxonomically unrelated species.

AB An important issue in the debate about the use and conservation of natural ecosystems is the degree to which these ecosystems and their functions should be considered 'critical'. This paper presents some guidelines to determine the criticality of natural capital, based on two main criteria. The first criterion is the 'importance' of natural ecosystems (ecological, socio-cultural and economic) and the second is the degree of 'threat' based on the quantity and quality of the (remaining) natural areas in a given region. It is argued that the two criteria are complementary and need to be taken into account simultaneously when determining the criticality of natural capital. Finally, the paper presents and discusses some possibilities for the development of a (critical) natural capital index for Europe. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

   ESTABLISHMENT
AB Invasive plants reduce the capacity of ecosystems to provide goods and services required by society, alter ecological processes, and can displace desirable species. They can reduce wildlife habitat quality, riparian area integrity, rangeland economic value, and enterprise net returns. The invasion process is regulated by characteristics of the invading plant and the community being invaded. The presence and spread of invasive plants is often symptomatic of underlying management problems that must be corrected before acceptable, long-term rangeland improvement can be achieved. Disturbance appears to be important early in the invasion process because it creates vacant niches that alien plants can occupy. Control of invasive plants may only open niches for establishment of other undesirable plants unless desirable plants are present to fill the vacated niches. In many instances, rangelands have deteriorated to the point that desirable species are either not present, or in such low abundance that plant community recovery is slow or will not occur without revegetation after invasive plants are controlled. Integrated weed management employs the planned, sequential use of multiple tactics (e.g. chemical, biological, cultural, and mechanical control measures) to improve ecosystem function (energy flow and nutrient cycling) and maintain invasive plant damage below economic levels, and emphasizes managing rangeland ecosystem functions to meet objectives rather than emphasizing a particular weed or control method. Sustainable, integrated invasive plant management strategies require assessing plant impacts, understanding and managing the processes influencing invasion, knowledge of invasive plant biology and ecology. and are based on ecological principles. Invasive plant management programs must be compatible with and integrated into overall rangeland resource management objectives and plans. Because of the complexity of managing invasive plants, it is imperative that relevant ecological and economic information be synthesized into user-friendly decision support systems.

AB Carabid beetles were sampled by pitfall trapping in 44 pine and spruce forest stands in England and Scotland using chronosequences of plots across different bioclimatic zones. The sample plots were selected on the basis of plantation age, tree species, and forest category. In each plot, a range of environmental variables were measured. some of which were used to interpret differences in carabid community composition. A total of 51 carabid species was identified; the highest individual plot total being 19 species, acid the lowest two species. Correspondence analysis showed that the most significant factors affecting carabid community composition were latitude. canopy structure, soil organic matter and vegetation diversity, General linear modelling indicated that carabid species richness was negatively related to both canopy vertical structure and soil organic matter, while species diversity was negatively related to canopy vertical structure and tree species, suggesting that more species-rich, diverse carabid communities are associated with open, drier conditions. The numbers of forest specialist carabids increased with increasing plantation age, together with a corresponding decrease in non-woodland species, even for previously non-woodland sites. Consequently, longer forest rotation lengths may be expected to benefit forest carabids, particularly where stands are structurally varied with canopy gaps present.

AB The main problem when adapting forest management to mimic natural processes and structures is the lack of detailed knowledge about historical forest conditions. One way to refine these management goals is by local analysis of change in forest conditions over time. The aim of this investigation was to perform a retrospective regional gap analysis by using historical data. Forest surveys and cadastral maps from the 19th and 20th century were compared with a recent forest survey in a 170 km(2) coniferous forest landscape in the middle boreal zone of Sweden. Changes in species composition, age distribution and landscape pattern were analysed at different spatial scales using a GIS. Spatio-temporal analyses were made to compare representative forest types. During the 20th century, dear-cutting has replaced fire as the most important factor influencing the landscape pattern. The old-growth forest is fragmented and the proportion is much lower than in other boreal forest landscapes, Since the 19th century, the landscape has changed from a matrix of forest older than 100 years to a highly fragmented landscape with only small patches of forest older than 100 years. Multi-aged stands have gradually been converted to even-aged stands. The gap analysis indicates: a large deficit of multi-aged pine forest. Restoring this forest type requires large areas where Scots pine is allowed to naturally regenerate from seed trees on burned sites. Some trees need to grow to natural maturity (i.e. 200+ years) and die naturally. The restoration of deciduous forest should be directed towards mixed stands. Currently used models to describe the natural landscape are inadequate to use as basis for ecological landscape planning. We conclude that retrospective gap analysis can be used to refine goal setting in Swedish FSC-certification. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Experimental disturbance and fertilization in two Mediterranean old fields, three and nine years old, respectively, were used to identify functional groups for response to disturbance. Five morphological traits (canopy structure, height, lateral spread, habit and plasticity) and five regeneration traits (life cycle, seed mass, fecundity, dispersal mode and germination seasonality) were used for species classification. Correlation patterns of species composition and species attributes with disturbance treatments were analysed in order to characterize groups of response to disturbance. The classification based on morphological traits was repeatable across fields and reflected natural correlation patterns among attributes. Erect rosettes with low morphological plasticity and moderate lateral spread, mostly grasses, were intolerant of disturbance. Partial rosettes with low morphological plasticity and wide lateral spread, e.g. Asteraceae species, colonized disturbed locations. Flat proto-rosettes with a plastic architecture were indifferent to disturbance in the young plot but required disturbance to establish in the older plot. The classification based on regeneration traits repeatedly identified germination period to be correlated with disturbance response. Species with early germination were intolerant of disturbance while late-germinating species colonized disturbances. These groups were clearly distinct from groups based on natural attribute correlation patterns which related primarily to seed mass, and secondarily to dispersal mode and fecundity. Effects of fertilization were detected only within disturbed quadrats of the old plot. Fertilization favoured the colonization of disturbances by species with a partial rosette and low plasticity and by species with late germination and high fecundity.
   These results, complemented by direct analyses on individual traits, are mostly consistent with previous descriptions of the ruderal strategy. This study shows that additional understanding can be gained from a deductive approach that examines more specific traits such as derailed descriptors of plant architecture and seasonal germination dynamics. Our results are intended to contribute to the general discussion on the identification and use of functional classifications. In particular, it is argued that communities such as Mediterranean old fields, where the dynamics is already well understood, should serve as testing grounds for new methods and the development of theories to be later applied to less well known vegetation types.

AB Depredation of seeds and eggs in a Belizian rainforest was investigated using peanuts and ben's eggs. Seed predation rates were significantly higher 500 m into the forest from the edge. than 30 m and 100 m from the edge. Conversely, egg predation was higher in a 100 m zone near the edge. These edge effects were evident even though the edge was a minor road through otherwise continuous forest. In a similar study, in Veracruz, Mexico, using seeds of the canopy tree Brosimum alicastrum, seed predation followed a similar trend to that observed in Belize. Having accounted for the variation in seed production between trees, the level of predation on Brosimum seeds increased with the distance from the forest edge.
   The effects of habitat edges on seed and egg predators have potential implications for their dynamics in fragmented landscapes. It is speculated that when an edge is created where previously there was continuous, pristine forest, edge effects may affect the community structure through their impact on the recruitment of plants and egg-laying animals.

AB Indoor and outdoor experiments demonstrated that allelopathy is an important factor explaining seed regeneration failures of Scots pine (Pinus silvestris L.) in forest floor vegetation dominated by the dwarf shrub Empetrum hermaphroditum Hagerup. Scanning electron micrograph views of the leaf surfaces of E. hermaphroditum reveal secretory glands that are shown to be involved in the release of water-soluble phytotoxic substances. Bioassays indicate that low doses and short exposure times of seeds to leachates have strong negative effects on germination and early root development. Activated carbon can eliminate the inhibitory effects of leachates and litter. This technique demonstrates the occurrence of allelopathic interference by E. hermaphroditum on seed germination of both Scots pine and aspen (Populus tremula L.). In a field experiment the allelopathic effects by E. hermaphroditum are strong during early spring when germination and growth initiate and ground ice still is present. Extracts passed through soils collected from an E. hermaphroditum site were detoxified, while those passed through sterilized soil were not. Therefore, microorganisms may detoxify the allelochemicals under some environmental conditions.

AB Actions taken to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have conspicuously reduced motor vehicle traffic, potentially alleviating auditory pressures on animals that rely on sound for survival and reproduction. Here, by comparing soundscapes and songs across the San Francisco Bay Area before and during the recent statewide shutdown, we evaluated whether a common songbird responsively exploited newly emptied acoustic space. We show that noise levels in urban areas were substantially lower during the shutdown, characteristic of traffic in the mid-1950s. We also show that birds responded by producing higher performance songs at lower amplitudes, effectively maximizing communication distance and salience. These findings illustrate that behavioral traits can change rapidly in response to newly favorable conditions, indicating an inherent resilience to long-standing anthropogenic pressures such as noise pollution.

AB Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) allow observation and reporting of global biodiversity change, but a detailed framework for the empirical derivation of specific EBVs has yet to be developed. Here, we re-examine and refine the previous candidate set of species traits EBVs and show how traits related to phenology, morphology, reproduction, physiology and movement can contribute to EBV operationalization. The selected EBVs express intra-specific trait variation and allow monitoring of how organisms respond to global change. We evaluate the societal relevance of species traits EBVs for policy targets and demonstrate how open, interoperable and machine-readable trait data enable the building of EBV data products. We outline collection methods, meta(data) standardization, reproducible workflows, semantic tools and licence requirements for producing species traits EBVs. An operationalization is critical for assessing progress towards biodiversity conservation and sustainable development goals and has wide implications for data-intensive science in ecology, biogeography, conservation and Earth observation.

AB Combating the surge of illegal wildlife trade (IWT) devastating wildlife populations is an urgent global priority for conservation. There are increasing policy commitments to take action at the local community level as part of effective responses. However, there is scarce evidence that in practice such interventions are being pursued and there is scant understanding regarding how they can help. Here we set out a conceptual framework to guide efforts to effectively combat IWT through actions at community level. This framework is based on articulating the net costs and benefits involved in supporting conservation versus supporting IWT, and how these incentives are shaped by anti-IWT interventions. Using this framework highlights the limitations of an exclusive focus on "top-down," enforcement-led responses to IWT. These responses can distract from a range of other approaches that shift incentives for local people toward supporting conservation rather than IWT, as well as in some cases actually decrease the net incentives in favor of wildlife conservation.

AB Organic inputs have a positive effect on the soil organic matter balance. They are therefore an important asset for soil fertility and crop growth. This study quantifies the additional yield effect due to organic inputs for arable crops in Europe when macro-nutrients are not a limiting factor.
   A meta-analysis was performed using data from 20 long-term experiments in Europe. Maxima of yield response curves to nitrogen were compared, with and without organic inputs, under abundant P and K supply.
   We were surprised to find that, across all experiments, the mean additional yield effect of organic inputs was not significant (+ 1.4 % +/- 1.6 (95 % confidence interval)). In specific cases however, especially for root and tuber crops, spring sown cereals, or for very sandy soils or wet climates, organic inputs did increase attainable yields. A significant correlation was found between increase in attainable yields and increase in soil organic matter content.
   Aggregating data from 20 long-term experiments in Europe, this study shows that organic inputs and/or soil organic matter do not necessarily increase yields, given sufficient nutrients are supplied by mineral fertilisers. Results show the relevance of some environmental factors for additional yield effect of organic inputs, but no simple relation between organic inputs and crop growth.

AB Hybrid zones provide a powerful opportunity to analyze ecological and evolutionary interactions between divergent lineages. As such, research on hybrid zones has played a prominent role in the fields of evolutionary biology and systematics. Herein, we clarify what hybrid zones are, what is (and is not) known about them, and how different types of genomic data contribute to our understanding of hybrid zones. We then review two key topics, namely, what genomic analyses of hybrid zones have revealed about the basis and dynamics of speciation and how hybrid zones directly affect evolutionary processes. In the latter case, we emphasize the importance of contingency and ecological and genomic context in outcomes of hybridization. Throughout, we highlight limitations and key unknowns, and suggest approaches most likely to advance our understanding of hybrid zones and evolutionary processes in general.

AB Because of a range of constraints, the availability of biodiversity-related information varies considerably over space, time, taxa, and types of data, thereby causing gaps in knowledge. Despite growing awareness of this issue among scientists, it is still poorly known how-and whether-scientific efforts have contributed to overcoming these information gaps. Focusing on spatial gaps in global biodiversity data, we show that the accumulation rates of nonbird species occurrence records stored in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility have not improved-and have even potentially declined-over the past three decades in data-poor, often biodiversity-rich regions. Meanwhile, one citizen-science project, eBird, has been making a considerable contribution to the collection and sharing of bird records, even in the data-poorest countries, and is accelerating the accumulation of bird records globally. We discuss the potentials and limitations of citizen-science projects for tackling gaps in biodiversity information, particularly from the perspective of biodiversity conservation.

AB The seasonal migration of a salt wedge and rainfall were the major factors influencing the spatiotemporal distribution of ichthyoplankton and microplastics along the main channel of the Goiana Estuary, NE Brazil. The most abundant taxa were the clupeids Rhinosardinia bahiensis and Harengula clupeola, followed by the achirid Trinectes maculatus (78.7% of the catch). Estuarine and mangrove larvae (e.g. Anchovia clupeoides, Gobionellus oceanicus), as well as microplastics were ubiquitous. During drier months, the salt wedge reaches the upper estuary and marine larvae (e.g. Cynoscion acoupa) migrated upstream until the zones of coastal waters influence. However, the meeting of waterfronts in the middle estuary forms a barrier that retains the microplastics in the upper and lower estuary most part of the year. During the late dry season, a bloom of zooplankton was followed by a bloom of fish larvae (12.74 ind. 100 m(-3)) and fish eggs (14.65 ind. 100 m(-3)) at the lower estuary. During the late rainy season, the high freshwater inflow flushed microplastics, together with the biota, seaward. During this season, a microplastic maximum (14 items 100 m(-3)) was observed, followed by fish larvae maximum (14.23 ind. 100 m(-3)) in the lower estuary. In contrast to fish larvae, microplastics presented positive correlation with high rainfall rates, being more strictly associated to flushing out/into the estuary than to seasonal variation in environmental variables. Microplastics represented half of fish larvae density. Comparable densities in the water column increase the chances of interaction between microplastics and fish larvae, including the ingestion of smaller fragments, whose shape and colour are similar to zooplankton prey.

AB Slash-and-burn clearing of forest typically results in increase in soil nutrient availability. However, the impact of these nutrients on the soil microbiome is not known. Using next generation sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic DNA, we compared the structure and the potential functions of bacterial community in forest soils to deforested soils in the Amazon region and related the differences to soil chemical factors. Deforestation decreased soil organic matter content and factors linked to soil acidity and raised soil pH, base saturation and exchangeable bases. Concomitant to expected changes in soil chemical factors, we observed an increase in the alpha diversity of the bacterial microbiota and relative abundances of putative copiotrophic bacteria such as Actinomycetales and a decrease in the relative abundances of bacterial taxa such as Chlamydiae, Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia in the deforested soils. We did not observe an increase in genes related to microbial nutrient metabolism in deforested soils. However, we did observe changes in community functions such as increases in DNA repair, protein processing, modification, degradation and folding functions, and these functions might reflect adaptation to changes in soil characteristics due to forest clear-cutting and burning. In addition, there were changes in the composition of the bacterial groups associated with metabolism-related functions. Co-occurrence microbial network analysis identified distinct phylogenetic patterns for forest and deforested soils and suggested relationships between Planctomycetes and aluminium content, and Actinobacteria and nitrogen sources in Amazon soils. The results support taxonomic and functional adaptations in the soil bacterial community following deforestation. We hypothesize that these microbial adaptations may serve as a buffer to drastic changes in soil fertility after slash-and-burning deforestation in the Amazon region.

AB In this paper, a case is made for the use of model-based approaches for the analysis of community data. This involves the direct specification of a statistical model for the observed multivariate data. Recent advances in statistical modelling mean that it is now possible to build models that are appropriate for the data which address key ecological questions in a statistically coherent manner. Key advantages of this approach include interpretability, flexibility, and efficiency, which we explain in detail and illustrate by example. The steps in a model-based approach to analysis are outlined, with an emphasis on key features arising in a multivariate context. A key distinction in the model-based approach is the emphasis on diagnostic checking to ensure that the model provides reasonable agreement with the observed data. Two examples are presented that illustrate how the model-based approach can provide insights into ecological problems not previously available. In the first example, we test for a treatment effect in a study where different sites had different sampling intensities, which was handled by adding an offset term to the model. In the second example, we incorporate trait information into a model for ordinal response in order to identify the main reasons why species differ in their environmental response.

AB Existing insight suggests that maternal effects have a substantial impact on evolution, yet these predictions assume that maternal effects themselves are evolutionarily constant. Hence, it is poorly understood how natural selection shapes maternal effects in different ecological circumstances. To overcome this, the current study derives an evolutionary model of maternal effects in a quantitative genetics context. In constant environments, we show that maternal effects evolve to slight negative values that result in a reduction of the phenotypic variance (canalization). By contrast, in populations experiencing abrupt change, maternal effects transiently evolve to positive values for many generations, facilitating the transmission of beneficial maternal phenotypes to offspring. In periodically fluctuating environments, maternal effects evolve according to the autocorrelation between maternal and offspring environments, favoring positive maternal effects when change is slow, and negative maternal effects when change is rapid. Generally, the strongest maternal effects occur for traits that experience very strong selection and for which plasticity is severely constrained. By contrast, for traits experiencing weak selection, phenotypic plasticity enhances the evolutionary scope of maternal effects, although maternal effects attain much smaller values throughout. As weak selection is common, finding substantial maternal influences on offspring phenotypes may be more challenging than anticipated.

AB By transforming landscapes, human activity creates new types of habitats with altered environmental characteristics that never existed before. As the process of habitat urbanization bears impact on more and more natural habitats, it is essential for us to understand the changes we bring forth in the ecological forces shaping urban animal communities. Birds are perhaps the most frequently studied model organisms by urban ecologists. It is a well known general pattern that urban avian communities have typically reduced species richness, while the density of a few successful species is often higher in cities than in adjacent more natural habitats. But it is less understood which mechanisms generate and uphold these community-level changes. In this review we discuss the most important components of the urban environment influencing birds' physiology, behaviour or morphology, and compile several recent studies to illustrate their effects. To understand urban food webs we also review the results of bottom-up and top-down approach which suggest that altered food availability and predation may play key roles in forming recent urban bird communities. We encourage future research to focus more on experimental, manipulative studies, that would help us not just to realize general patterns but shed more light on the mechanisms, the underlying processes prompting changes in urban bird communities.

AB It is well established that artificial night lighting can influence animal orientation, but there is less information about its effects on other behaviors. Previous work suggested that light pollution can affect both seasonal and daily patterns of behavior. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of artificial night lighting and daytime traffic noise on the timing of dawn and dusk singing in 6 common songbirds. We recorded singing behavior in 11 nonurban plots: 2 plots with light, but no noise, 3 with light and noise pollution, 3 with noise, but no light, and 3 undisturbed forests. Our results show that artificial night lighting, but not noise, leads to an earlier start of dawn singing in 5 out of 6 species, ranging on average from 10 min for the song thrush to 20 min for the robin and the great tit. This effect was strongest at higher light intensities. We further show that dusk song is also affected: 3 species continued dusk singing for longer in lighted areas, but the effect was smaller than that observed for dawn song (from about 8 min for the blackbird to 14 min for the great tit). For all species, onset and cessation of singing changed relative to sunrise and sunset with the progress of the season. Rain delayed the onset of singing at dawn and advanced the cessation at dusk. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of sexual selection.

AB Alterations in gray matter (GM) density/volume and cortical thickness (CT) have been demonstrated in small and heterogeneous samples of subjects with differing chronic pain syndromes, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Aggregating across 7 structural neuroimaging studies conducted at University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA, between August 2006 and April 2011, we examined group differences in regional GM volume in 201 predominantly premenopausal female subjects (82 IBS, mean age: 32 +/- 10 SD, 119 healthy controls [HCs], 30 +/- 10 SD). Applying graph theoretical methods and controlling for total brain volume, global and regional properties of large-scale structural brain networks were compared between the group with IBS and the HC group. Relative to HCs, the IBS group had lower volumes in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus, bilateral insula, bilateral amygdala, bilateral hippocampus, bilateral middle orbital frontal gyrus, left cingulate, left gyrus rectus, brainstem, and left putamen. Higher volume was found in the left postcentral gyrus. Group differences were no longer significant for most regions when controlling for the Early Trauma Inventory global score, with the exception of the right amygdala and the left postcentral gyrus. No group differences were found for measures of global and local network organization. Compared to HCs, in patients with IBS, the right cingulate gyrus and right thalamus were identified as being significantly more critical for information flow. Regions involved in endogenous pain modulation and central sensory amplification were identified as network hubs in IBS. Overall, evidence for central alterations in patients with IBS was found in the form of regional GM volume differences and altered global and regional properties of brain volumetric networks.

AB In landscape planning, land-use types need to be compared including the ecosystem services they provide. With multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), ecological economics offers a useful tool for environmental questions but mostly case-specific criteria are applied. This, however, makes it difficult to compare findings. Therefore, we present a systematic framework that includes the ecosystem services as criteria into MCDA. The ecological quantification of the provided ecosystem services is combined with the assigned importance of the single ecosystem services. In a case study from the central Alps, we compared three land-use alternatives resulting from land-use change caused by socio-economic pressures: traditional larch (Larix decidua) meadow, spruce forest (abandonment) and intensive meadow (intensification).
   Criteria for the MCDA model were selected by experts, criteria importance was ranked by stakeholders and criteria values were assessed with qualitative and quantitative indicators. Eventually spruce forest was ranked as the best land-use alternative followed by traditional larch meadow and intensive meadow. The combined approach of MCDA using ecosystem services as criteria showed how criteria weightings and criteria indicator values influence land-use alternatives' performance. The MCDA-model visualizes the consequences of land-use change for ecosystem service provision, facilitating landscape planning by structuring environmental problems and providing data for decisions.

AB 1. We review the effects of root and shoot competition on plant biomass by meta-analysis of 38 published studies, each reporting on the factorial effects of root-competition and shoot-competition on herbaceous plants.
   2. There were significant differences in the overall effects of root, shoot and full competition. Root competition generally resulted in larger biomass reduction than shoot competition, particularly among the smaller of the two competitors. An interaction between root and shoot competition was observed in some experiments but was generally not significant.
   3. While root competition was generally stronger than shoot competition at lower nutrient levels, there was no overall difference at higher nutrient levels due to much lower levels of root competition. In contrast, the overall effect of full competition increased considerably with nutrient level.
   4. Root competition was generally more important when the neighbour was a grass as compared with a herb or a legume, and when domesticated plants competed with wild neighbours, suggesting that wild genotypes are stronger competitors for below-ground resources than are crop plants.
   5. Effects of competition were generally stronger in experiments with additive designs than in those with substitutive designs. Also, experiments using single target individuals showed stronger effects of competition, root competition in particular, than did experiments using groups targets.
   6. Synthesis. Despite large variation among experiments, some general patterns were supported: effects of root competition are generally stronger than shoot competition, particularly (i) for smaller competitors, (ii) at low fertility levels, (iii) when the competitor is a grass rather than an herb, (iv) when the competitor is a wild rather than a domesticated species, and (v) in additive design experiments. The effects of root and shoot competition appear to be additive under many conditions. Whereas root competition may often be the primary limitation on mean plant performance, shoot competition will influence the variation around this mean and may determine which individuals or species dominate.

AB Aim Understanding patterns of species turnover along environmental gradients and their consistency across taxonomic groups is central to the study of biodiversity. We may expect congruence in diversity patterns across groups whose ranges could be influenced by species interactions. We explore associations between bird and vegetation communities in the tropical Andes to determine whether patterns of species richness and turnover in birds and trees are congruent with elevation, and whether tree species composition, vegetation structure, elevation, or a combination of these best predicts bird species composition. Location A forested 2600-m elevational gradient on the eastern slope of the Peruvian Andes. Methods Bird surveys and vegetation measurements were conducted at 172 points, and a subset of these were spatially matched with fourteen 1-ha tree inventory plots. Diversity patterns were described for trees, birds, and avian foraging guilds. We used dissimilarity matrices to examine patterns of turnover and nestedness. Turnover of birds and trees was examined by comparing compositional change of adjacent plots along the gradient. Multiple regression on distance matrices was employed to determine contributions of tree species composition, vegetation structure and elevation to explaining variation in bird species composition. Results Species richness was higher for trees than for birds, and whereas diversity in both taxa decreased with elevation, tree richness showed a low-elevation plateau before declining at higher elevations. Tree species had narrower distributions compared to birds, but patterns of turnover were largely congruent between taxa. Nestedness contributed much less to dissimilarity than turnover, although birds showed higher nestedness, particularly at high elevations. Tree species composition, elevation and vegetation structure were all important predictors of bird species composition; the best model explained 78% of bird dissimilarity across plots. Tree species composition was always included in the best models, for all birds and foraging guilds. Main conclusions Our assessment of Andean bird and vegetation communities suggests strong correspondence, perhaps due to direct interactions or similar underlying drivers. We hypothesize that with climate change, range shifts in these groups may not occur independently. Rather, birds may have delayed upslope shifts or may be limited to high-elevation patches where appropriate vegetation communities exist.

AB Interpreting the isotopic tree-ring responses of pines to drought provides insight into the causes of tree mortality. For this reason, we examine such responses for low elevation Pinus halepensis subsp. brutia trees that neighbor recently desiccated pine stands. A strong correlation between C-13 discrimination (Delta) signals recorded in tree-rings and concurrent drought indicates a rapid transfer of newly synthesized assimilates to wood formation. However, in dry years the limited moisture allows only early- to mid spring and mid- to late-autumn as productive periods. Thus, isotopic signals for summer drought may be missing in tree-rings. Yet, over a 30 year observation period, drought clearly reduced both, tree-ring width and Delta C-13. Intra-annual microtome slices (1/10 mm) indicate the highest delta C-13 signals in autumn (after growth resumed in response to rainfall) as a likely result of autumn wood (late-wood) incorporating carbon fixed and stored during the summer drought related growth cessation. Thus, non structural carbon reserves accumulating under drought are likely to leave a delta C-13 fingerprint when complete tree-rings (early-plus late-wood) are analyzed. Both inter- and intra-annually, delta O-18 in tree-rings from these pines declined following precipitation and in contrast to the rise in temperature. Any evaporative enrichment of leaf water in the heavier isotope under drought appears to be masked by the source water utilized for tree growth. Source water from deeper moisture pools is less enriched in O-18 than surface water. Therefore, as inter- or intra-annual drought intensifies, pines appear to use this deep water, which accumulates from precipitation over a series of years. This was also confirmed by Delta C-13 and tree growth data, as both were best correlated with multiple years of past precipitation rather than with seasonal precipitation. Consequently, the most likely cause of drought induced mortality for such plants is chronic depletion of deeper moisture pools and hydraulic failure rather than (C) starvation. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Parental investment in reproduction is generally limited by the availability of food and so avian life-history research has generally focused on the brood rearing phase, when food requirements are greatest. Only relatively recently has the focus extended to the incubation phase and, even more recently, to the nest-building phase where there is now observational, comparative and experimental evidence that avian nest building is an energetically and temporally expensive activity. This review emphasises that nest construction is energetically expensive and we suggest that such costs should be incorporated into avian life-history research.

TI How Multivariate Ejaculate Traits Determine Competitive Fertilization

AB Success in sperm competition, occurring whenever females mate with multiple males [1], is predicted to be influenced by variation in ejaculate quality and interactions among competing sperm [2]. Yet, apart from sperm number, relevant ejaculate characteristics and sperm-sperm interactions are poorly understood, particularly within a multivariate framework and the natural selective environment of the female reproductive tract. Here, we used isogenic lines of Drosophila melanogaster with distinguishable sperm to demonstrate and partition genetic variation in multiple sperm quality and performance traits. Next, by competing males from different lines, we show how rival sperm significantly influence each other's velocity and reveal that males with relatively slow and/or long sperm better displace rival sperm and resist displacement, thus avoiding ejection by the female from her reproductive tract. Finally, we establish fitness consequences of genetic variation in sperm quality and its role in securing a numerical advantage in storage by showing that offspring paternity is determined strictly by the representation of stored, competing sperm. These results provide novel insight into complex postcopulatory processes, illustrate that different ejaculate traits are critical at different biologically relevant time-points, and provide a critical foundation for elucidating the role of postcopulatory sexual selection in trait diversification and speciation.

TI Genome Patterns of Selection and Introgression of Haplotypes in Natural
   Populations of the House Mouse (Mus musculus)

ID POSITIVE SELECTION; NEUTRAL MODEL; GENE; SWEEPS; MICE; WILD;
   IDENTIFICATION; HYBRIDIZATION; EVOLUTION; BROWSER
AB General parameters of selection, such as the frequency and strength of positive selection in natural populations or the role of introgression, are still insufficiently understood. The house mouse (Mus musculus) is a particularly well-suited model system to approach such questions, since it has a defined history of splits into subspecies and populations and since extensive genome information is available. We have used high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing arrays to assess genomic patterns of positive selection and introgression of alleles in two natural populations of each of the subspecies M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus. Applying different statistical procedures, we find a large number of regions subject to apparent selective sweeps, indicating frequent positive selection on rare alleles or novel mutations. Genes in the regions include well-studied imprinted loci (e. g. Plagl1/Zac1), homologues of human genes involved in adaptations (e. g. alpha-amylase genes) or in genetic diseases (e. g. Huntingtin and Parkin). Haplotype matching between the two subspecies reveals a large number of haplotypes that show patterns of introgression from specific populations of the respective other subspecies, with at least 10% of the genome being affected by partial or full introgression. Using neutral simulations for comparison, we find that the size and the fraction of introgressed haplotypes are not compatible with a pure migration or incomplete lineage sorting model. Hence, it appears that introgressed haplotypes can rise in frequency due to positive selection and thus can contribute to the adaptive genomic landscape of natural populations. Our data support the notion that natural genomes are subject to complex adaptive processes, including the introgression of haplotypes from other differentiated populations or species at a larger scale than previously assumed for animals. This implies that some of the admixture found in inbred strains of mice may also have a natural origin.

AB Marine aquaculture relies on coastal habitats that will be affected by climate change. This review assesses current knowledge of the threats and opportunities of climate change for aquaculture in the UK and Ireland, focusing on the most commonly farmed species, blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). There is sparse evidence to indicate that climate change is affecting aquaculture in the UK and Ireland. Impacts to date have been difficult to discern from natural environmental variability, and the pace of technological development in aquaculture overshadows effects of climatic change. However, this review of broader aquaculture literature and the likely effects of climate change suggests that over the next century, climate change has the potential to directly impact the industry. Impacts are related to the industry's dependence on the marine environment for suitable biophysical conditions. For instance, changes in the frequency and strength of storms pose a risk to infrastructure, such as salmon cages. Sea-level rise will shift shoreline morphology, reducing the areal extent of some habitats that are suitable for the industry. Changes in rainfall patterns will increase the turbidity and nutrient loading of rivers, potentially triggering harmful algal blooms and negatively affecting bivalve farming. In addition, ocean acidification may disrupt the early developmental stages of shellfish. Some of the most damaging but least predictable effects of climate change relate to the emergence, translocation and virulence of diseases, parasites and pathogens, although parasites and diseases in finfish aquaculture may be controlled through intervention. The spread of nuisance and non-native species is also potentially damaging. Rising temperatures may create the opportunity to rear warmer water species in the UK and Ireland. Market forces, rather than technical feasibility, are likely to determine whether existing farmed species are displaced by new ones. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The paper describes an efficient approach for mapping multiple individual tree species over large spatial domains. The method integrates vegetation phenology derived from MODIS imagery and raster data describing relevant environmental parameters with extensive field plot data of tree species basal area to create maps of tree species abundance and distribution at a 250-m pixel size for the entire eastern contiguous United States. The approach uses the modeling techniques of k-nearest neighbors and canonical correspondence analysis, where model predictions are calculated using a weighting of nearest neighbors based on proximity in a feature space derived from the model. The approach also utilizes a stratification derived from the 2001 National Land-Cover Database tree canopy cover layer. Data pre-processing is also described, which includes the use of Fourier series transformation for data reduction and characterizing seasonal vegetation phenology patterns that are apparent in the MODIS imagery.
   A suite of assessment procedures is applied to each of the modeled dataset presented. These indicate high accuracies, at the scales of assessments used, for total live-tree basal area per hectare and for many of the most common tree species found in the study area. The end result is an approach that enables the mapping of individual tree species distributions, while retaining much of the species covariance found on the forest inventory plots, at a level of spatial detail approaching that required for many regional management and planning applications. The proposed approach has the potential for operational application for simultaneously mapping the distribution and abundance of numerous common tree species across large spatial domains.

AB We sampled 100 small lakes in Finland for bacterio-, phyto-, and zooplankton. The lakes were located in five drainage systems, 20 lakes for each system. We tested two main predictions: that the correlation between community similarity and geographical distance (spatial distance decay) is stronger at the across-drainage than at the within-drainage system scale, and that spatial distance decay is strongest for zooplankton and weakest for bacteria. We used a combination of direct ordination, multivariate statistical tests, and distance-based approaches to examine spatial patterns in our data. Our analyses confirmed both of our predictions. Spatial distance decay was scale-dependent; communities were overall weakly spatially structured within the drainage systems, yet distance decay was significant for all planktonic groups across drainage systems. Spatial distance decay was stronger for zooplankton, with higher slopes and shorter halving distances, than for phytoplankton and bacteria. These results provide evidence that distance decay of similarity is related to study scale, environment, and organism characteristics. Planktonic communities may be controlled by both dispersal-driven assembly and local ecological determinism, with the balance between these two forces depending on study scale.

AB The Alpine lake whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) species complex is a classic example of a recent radiation, associated with colonization of the Alpine lakes following the glacial retreat (less than 15 kyr BP). They have formed a unique array of endemic lake flocks, each with one to six described sympatric species differing in morphology, diet and reproductive ecology. Here, we present a genomic investigation of the relationships between and within the lake flocks. Comparing the signal between over 1000 AFLP loci and mitochondrial control region sequence data, we use phylogenetic tree-based and population genetic methods to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of the group and to delineate the principal centres of genetic diversity within the radiation. We find significant cytonuclear discordance showing that the genomically monophyletic Alpine whitefish clade arose from a hybrid swarm of at least two glacial refugial lineages. Within this radiation, we find seven extant genetic clusters centred on seven lake systems. Most interestingly, we find evidence of sympatric speciation within and parallel evolution of equivalent phenotypes among these lake systems. However, we also find the genetic signature of human-mediated gene flow and diversity loss within many lakes, highlighting the fragility of recent radiations.

AB Models of root system growth emerged in the early 1970s, and were based on mathematical representations of root length distribution in soil. The last decade has seen the development of more complex architectural models and the use of computer-intensive approaches to study developmental and environmental processes in greater detail. There is a pressing need for predictive technologies that can integrate root system knowledge, scaling from molecular to ensembles of plants. This paper makes the case for more widespread use of simpler models of root systems based on continuous descriptions of their structure. A new theoretical framework is presented that describes the dynamics of root density distributions as a function of individual root developmental parameters such as rates of lateral root initiation, elongation, mortality, and gravitropsm. The simulations resulting from such equations can be performed most efficiently in discretized domains that deform as a result of growth, and that can be used to model the growth of many interacting root systems. The modelling principles described help to bridge the gap between continuum and architectural approaches, and enhance our understanding of the spatial development of root systems. Our simulations suggest that root systems develop in travelling wave patterns of meristems, revealing order in otherwise spatially complex and heterogeneous systems. Such knowledge should assist physiologists and geneticists to appreciate how meristem dynamics contribute to the pattern of growth and functioning of root systems in the field.

TI Which birds adjust the frequency of vocalizations in urban noise?
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
DE acoustic adaptation; urban noise; vocalization frequency
ID VOCAL CONVERGENCE; PLASTICITY; COMMUNICATION; IMPACT
AB Urban environments present an opportunity to study the evolution of animal communication in acoustically novel habitats. Several species of birds raise the minimum frequency of vocalizations in urban noise, which is louder at lower frequencies. We recorded 12 species of birds in urban and nonurban environments, and tested whether the extent to which different species raise their minimum frequency is related to the frequency range they use. We found that raising the minimum frequency is common in urban birds and is not restricted to passerine song, but also occurs in other vocalizations of passerines and parrots. There was a strong curvilinear relation between the extent to which urban birds raise the minimum frequency and the typical minimum frequency of the species: species with intermediate minimum frequencies (around 1-1.5 kHz) raised the frequency more than species with either higher or lower minimum frequency. This suggests that high-frequency species, which are less affected by urban noise, do not need to adjust the frequency of vocalizations as much. It also suggests that for species with very low frequencies, in a frequency range where urban noise augments exponentially, increasing frequency may not overcome masking by noise efficiently, and these species may use different adaptations. This indicates that frequency differences between species influence the way in which they respond to the same communication problem (masking by low-frequency noise), and possibly also the subsequent evolution of acoustic signals.

AB Biological invasions and land-use changes are two major causes of the global modifications of biodiversity. Habitat suitability models are the tools of choice to predict potential distributions of invasive species. Although land-use is a key driver of alien species invasions, it is often assumed that land-use is constant in time. Here we combine historical and present day information, to evaluate whether land-use changes could explain the dynamic of invasion of the American bullfrog Rana catesbeiana (=Lithobathes catesbeianus) in Northern Italy, from the 1950s to present-day. We used maxent to build habitat suitability models, on the basis of past (1960s, 1980s) and present-day data on land-uses and species distribution. For example, we used models built using the 1960s data to predict distribution in the 1980s, and so on. Furthermore, we used land-use scenarios to project suitability in the future. Habitat suitability models predicted well the spread of bullfrogs in the subsequent temporal step. Models considering land-use changes predicted invasion dynamics better than models assuming constant land-use over the last 50 years. Scenarios of future land-use suggest that suitability will remain similar in the next years. Habitat suitability models can help to understand and predict the dynamics of invasions; however, land-use is not constant in time: land-use modifications can strongly affect invasions; furthermore, both land management and the suitability of a given land-use class may vary in time. An integration of land-use changes in studies of biological invasions can help to improve management strategies.

AB The present two-part review aims to put the different phenomena that have been called "beta diversity" over the years into a common conceptual framework and to explain what each of them measures. The first part (Tuomisto 2010) discussed basic definitions of "beta diversity". Each arises from a different way of combining a definition of "diversity" with a definition of its alpha component and with a mathematical relationship between the alpha and gamma components. This second part assumes that an appropriate basic definition of a beta component (which may or may not be true beta diversity) has been chosen, and the focus here will be on how to quantify it for a given dataset. About twenty different approaches have been used for this purpose. It turns out that only two of these approaches accurately quantify the selected beta component: one does so for the entire dataset, and the other for two sampling units at a time. The other approaches actually quantify other phenomena, such as mean species turnover between sampling units, compositional gradient length (with or without reference to an external gradient), distinctness of a focal sampling unit, rate of species accumulation with increasing sampling effort, rate of compositional turnover along an external gradient, or the rate of decay in compositional similarity with increasing geographical distance. Although most of these phenomena can be expressed as a function of a beta component of diversity, they do not equal a beta component of diversity. Many of these derived variables are not even numerically correlated with the beta component on which they are based, which needs to be taken into account when interpreting the results. The effects of sampling decisions when results are extrapolated beyond the available data will also be discussed.

AB Hemicelluloses are the second most abundant polysaccharide in nature after cellulose. So far, the chemical heterogeneity of cell-wall hemicelluloses and the relatively large sample-volume required in existing methods represent major obstacles for large-scale, cross-species analyses of this important plant compound. Here, we apply a new micro-extraction method to analyse hemicelluloses and the ratio of 'cellulose and lignin' to hemicelluloses in different tissues of 28 plant species comprising four plant functional types (broad-leaved trees, conifers, grasses and herbs). For this study, the fiber analysis after Van Soest was modified to enable the simultaneous quantitative and qualitative measurements of hemicelluloses in small sample volumes. Total hemicellulose concentrations differed markedly among functional types and tissues with highest concentration in sapwood of broad-leaved trees (31% d.m. in Fraxinus excelsior) and lowest concentration between 10 and 15% d.m. in leaves and bark of woody species as well as in roots of herbs. As for total hemicellulose concentrations, plant functional types and tissues exhibited characteristic ratios between the sum of cellulose plus lignin and hemicelluloses, with very high ratios (> 4) in bark of trees and low ratios (< 2) in all investigated leaves. Additional HPLC analyses of hydrolysed hemicelluloses showed xylose to be the dominant hemicellulose monosaccharide in tissues of broad-leaved trees, grasses and herbs while coniferous species showed higher amounts of arabinose, galactose and mannose. Overall, the micro-extraction method permitted for the simultaneous determination of hemicelluloses of various tissues and plant functional types which exhibited characteristic hemicellulose concentrations and monosaccharide patterns.

AB SDM performance varied for different range dynamics. Prediction accuracies decreased when abrupt range shifts occurred as species were outpaced by the rate of climate change, and increased again when a new equilibrium situation was realised. When ranges contracted, prediction accuracies increased as the absences were predicted well. Far-dispersing species were faster in tracking climate change, and were predicted more accurately by SDMs than short-dispersing species. BRTs mostly outperformed GLMs. The presence of a predator, and the inclusion of its incidence as an environmental predictor, made BRTs and GLMs perform similarly.
   Results are discussed in light of other studies dealing with effects of ecological traits and processes on SDM performance. Perspectives are given on further advancements of SDMs and for possible interfaces with more mechanistic approaches in order to improve predictions under environmental change.

Without such action, many organisms will be prevented from achieving the predicted range shifts they need to survive.
   2. Scattered trees are a prominent feature of many modified landscapes, and could play an important role in facilitating climate change adaptation. They are keystone structures because of the disproportionally large ecological values and ecosystem services that they provide relative to the area they occupy in these landscapes. The provision of habitat and connectivity will be particularly relevant.
   3. Scattered trees are declining in modified landscapes due to elevated tree mortality and poor recruitment often associated with intensive land use. The continuing global decline of scattered trees will undermine the capacity of many organisms to adapt to climate change.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The sustainable management of scattered trees in modified landscapes could complement other strategies for facilitating climate change adaptation. They create continuous, though sparse, vegetation cover that permits multi-directional movements of biota across landscapes and ecological networks. They have the capacity to span ecosystems and climatic gradients that cannot be captured in formal reserves alone. The management of scattered trees should be an integral part of conservation objectives and agricultural activities in modified landscapes. Public investment, through mechanisms such as agri-environmental schemes, in rotational grazing, temporary set-asides, tree-planting and regulations that reduce clearing and early mortality among standing trees will improve the capacity of biota to adapt to climate change.

AB Transhumance is a traditional livestock practice based on the movement of livestock between winter and summer pastures with importance placed on biodiversity conservation. We analyzed the transhumant activity of sheep and cows in the uplands of the Cantabrian Mountains, NW Spain, and its influence on the ecology and management of the griffon vulture, a scavenger with a relevant ecosystem function. For the first time, we provided strong evidence of the close relationship between vultures and transhumance, which was previously only suggested. Vultures occupied roosting sites very close to the summer pastures and often consumed livestock carcasses. There was a strong spatiotemporal adjustment in the use of these mountain areas by transhumant livestock, especially sheep, and vultures. The number of transhumant sheep and cows within 10-12.5 km around the roosts were the best predictors of vulture occurrence and abundance, respectively, in generalized linear mixed models. Our estimates of potentially available food from livestock carcasses for vultures indicated that our study area can maintain important griffon vulture populations through a system based on traditional livestock farming including transhumance. Thus, transhumance is able to influence the top of the ecosystem (scavengers) and could aid in sustainable management of griffon vulture populations. In our study area, transhumant sheep were reduced by 62% in the last 15 years and only 20% of summer pastures are now occupied. The potential impact that the ongoing loss of transhumant activity could have on Mountain ecosystem conservation should be assessed and taken into account by the new European Common Agricultural Policy.

AB Bactrocera invaders Drew Tsuruta & White (Diptera: Tephritidae) invaded Kenya in 2003. Before the arrival of B. invaders, the indigenous fruit fly species Ceratitis cosyra (Walker) was the predominant fruit fly pest of mango (Mangifera indica L.). Within 4 yr of invasion, B. invaders has displaced C. cosyra and has become the predominant fruit fly pest of mango, constituting 98 and 88% of the total population in traps and mango fruit at Nguruman, respectively. We tested two possible mechanisms responsible for the displacement namely; resource competition by larvae within mango fruit and aggression between adult flies. Under interspecific competition, larval duration in B. invaders was significantly shorter (6.2 +/- 0.6-7.3 +/- 0.3 d) compared with C. cosyra (8.0 +/- 1.2-9.4 +/- 0.4 d). Pupal mass in C. cosyra was affected by competition and was significantly reduced (7.4 +/- 0.3-9.6 +/- 0.6 mg) under competitive interaction compared with the controls (12.1 +/- 1.5-12.8 +/- 1.1 mg). Interspecific competition also had a significant adverse effect on C. cosyra eclosion, with fewer adults emerging under co-infestation compared with the controls. Interference competition through aggressive behavior showed that fewer C. cosyra (3.1 +/- 0.8) landed on mango dome compared with the controls (14.2 +/- 1.5) when adults were mixed with B. invadens adults in Plexiglas cages. Similarly the number of times C. cosyra was observed ovipositing was significantly lower (0.2 +/- 0.2) under competitive interaction compared with the controls (6.1 +/- 1.8). Aggressive encounters in the form of lunging/head-butting and chasing off other species from the mango dome was higher for B. invades compared with C. cosyra. Our results suggest that exploitative competition through larval scrambling for resources and interference competition through aggressive behaviors of the invader are important mechanisms contributing to the displacement of C. cosyra by B. invadens in mango agroecosystems.

AB Lake Tanganyika is not the most species-rich of the Great East African Lakes, but comprises the greatest diversity of cichlid fishes in terms of morphology, ecology, and breeding styles. The lake contains a polyphyletic assemblage of cichlid lineages, which evolved from several ancient species that colonized the emerging lake some 9-12 million years ago. Based on morphological characteristics, the Tanganyikan cichlids have been classified into 12, or, more recently, 16 tribes, which are largely supported by molecular data. The radiations of East African cichlids are believed to be driven by complex interactions between extrinsic factors, such as climatic changes and geological processes, and intrinsic biological characteristics of the involved organisms. Diversification within different lineages occurred simultaneously in response to drastic habitat changes such as the establishment of lacustrine deep-water conditions 5-6 MYA and subsequent major lake-level fluctuations. This seems particularly true for the mouthbrooding lineages whereas the substrate breeders underwent a more gradual process of diversification. This review presents an account of the taxonomy and phylogeny of the Lake Tanganyika cichlid species assemblage, its relationship to the African cichlid fauna, key factors leading to the astonishing diversity and discusses recently proposed alternative age estimates for the Lake Tanganyika cichlid species assemblage.

AB Seasonal changes of fish species composition in terms of biomass, density and number of species in three areas of the main channel of the Paranagua Estuary (axis east-west) are described in relation to seasonal fluctuations in salinity, water temperature and dissolved oxygen in the main channel. Two hundred and thirty-four samples were collected monthly, between July 2000 and June 2001, in the main channel. Seventy-nine species of 29 families were captured with a total estimated mean density and biomass of 1513 individuals ha(-1) and 34 kg ha(-1), respectively. The number of species and total mean density differed significantly among areas and seasons, but the total mean biomass differed only significantly throughout the ecocline (areas) of the Paranagua Estuary. For the most abundant species, the mean densities of Stellifer rastrifer, Aspistor luniscutis, Menticirrhus americanus, Sphoeroides testudineus, Cynoscion leiarchus and Symphurus tesselatus (with the exception of Cathorops spixii and Genidens genidens) differed significantly among seasons. The mean biomass of these species, with the exception of G. genidens, S. rastrifer, A. luniscutis and S. testudineus, also differed significantly for the factor seasons. Area was a significant factor for the eight most abundant species (density and biomass), except S. testudineus (density), G. genidens, C. leiarchus and S. tesselatus (biomass). The season v. area interaction term was significant for C. leiarchus (density). Most of these differences occurred during the rainy season when fishes concentrated principally in the middle of the estuary, where the salinity remained stable. It is suggested that the salinity stability in the middle of the estuary is the main reason why the most estuarine resident fish species move downstream and remain there, regardless of the increased freshwater runoff. Moreover, canonical correspondent analysis output detected that during the late rainy season, the variable dissolved oxygen (P < 0.01) was the most important environmental variable, responsible for structuring patterns of fishes assemblages in the west-east axis of Paranagua Estuary. During the end of the dry season, both salinity (P < 0.01) and dissolved oxygen (P < 0.05) were responsible for this ecological feature in the estuary. Finally, it was possible to detect that juveniles and adults of some important species respond differently to seasonal fluctuations of the ecocline-determining environmental factors. This behaviour is suggested as a strategy to avoid competition and predation during the rainy season in the middle estuary. The Paranagua Estuary did not fit with the pre-existing models described in the tropical and subtropical estuarine fish literature since its main channel fish assemblages remained within its bounds even during the rainy season.

AB Traditional measures of biodiversity, such as species richness, usually treat species as being equal. As this is obviously not the case, measuring diversity in terms of features accumulated over evolutionary history provides additional value to theoretical and applied ecology. Several phylogenetic diversity indices exist, but their behaviour has not yet been tested in a comparative framework. We provide a test of ten commonly used phylogenetic diversity indices based on 40 simulated phylogenies of varying topology. We restrict our analysis to a topological fully resolved tree without information on branch lengths and species lists with presence-absence data. A total of 38,000 artificial communities varying in species richness covering 5-95% of the phylogenies were created by random resampling. The indices were evaluated based on their ability to meet a priori defined requirements. No index meets all requirements, but three indices turned out to be more suitable than others under particular conditions. Average taxonomic distinctness (AvTD) and intensive quadratic entropy (J) are calculated by averaging and are, therefore, unbiased by species richness while reflecting phylogeny per se well. However, averaging leads to the violation of set monotonicity, which requires that species extinction cannot increase the index. Total taxonomic distinctness (TTD) sums up distinctiveness values for particular species across the community. It is therefore strongly linked to species richness and reflects phylogeny per se weakly but satisfies set monotonicity. We suggest that AvTD and J are best applied to studies that compare spatially or temporally rather independent communities that potentially vary strongly in their phylogenetic composition-i.e. where set monotonicity is a more negligible issue, but independence of species richness is desired. In contrast, we suggest that TTD be used in studies that compare rather interdependent communities where changes occur more gradually by species extinction or introduction. Calculating AvTD or TTD, depending on the research question, in addition to species richness is strongly recommended.

AB It is poorly understood whether female morphological and behavioural traits can be used as 'signals'. In particular, experimental tests of the hypothesis that female ornaments reflect quality are scarce. Here, we experimentally examine whether female plumage coloration might signal maternal quality in the blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus by forcing half of the females breeding in our population to produce a replacement clutch. Using statistical models that controlled for the effects of male coloration, and the effects of age and condition of both parents, we found that carotenoid-based female coloration was positively linked to key proxies of bird lifetime reproductive success: clutch size, fledgling success and recruitment. Importantly, the relationships between maternal yellow carotenoid coloration and both clutch size and recruitment were stronger in the experimental group than in the control group, indicating that breeding females with higher values of yellow coloration were better able to handle the cost of producing a second clutch. Finally, UV-blue female coloration was positively linked to female survival and marginally linked to laying date. Taken together, these results show for the first time in a natural population that female coloration can indicate individual and maternal quality under natural and adverse reproductive conditions. They highlight the potential for the evolution of female ornamental traits through sexual selection.

AB A fundamental challenge to understanding patterns in ecological systems lies in employing methods that can analyse, test and draw inference from measured associations between variables across scales. Hierarchical linear models (HLM) use advanced estimation algorithms to measure regression relationships and variance-covariance parameters in hierarchically structured data. Although hierarchical models have occasionally been used in the analysis of ecological data, their full potential to describe scales of association, diagnose variance explained, and to partition uncertainty has not been employed. In this paper we argue that the use of the HLM framework can enable significantly improved inference about ecological processes across levels of organization. After briefly describing the principals behind HLM, we give two examples that demonstrate a protocol for building hierarchical models and answering questions about the relationships between variables at multiple scales. The first example employs maximum likelihood methods to construct a two-level linear model predicting herbivore damage to a perennial plant at the individual- and patch-scale; the second example uses Bayesian estimation techniques to develop a three-level logistic model of plant flowering probability across individual plants, microsites and populations. HLM model development and diagnostics illustrate the importance of incorporating scale when modelling associations in ecological systems and offer a sophisticated yet accessible method for studies of populations, communities and ecosystems. We suggest that a greater coupling of hierarchical study designs and hierarchical analysis will yield significant insights on how ecological processes operate across scales.

AB Our understanding of leaf acclimation in relation to irradiance of fully grown or juvenile trees is mainly based on research involving tropical wet forest species. We studied sun-shade plasticity of 24 leaf traits of 43 tree species in a Bolivian dry deciduous forest. Sampling was confined to small trees. For each species, leaves were taken from five of the most and five of the least illuminated crowns. Trees were selected based on the percentage of the hemisphere uncovered by other crowns. We examined leaf trait variation and the relation between trait plasticity and light demand, maximum adult stature, and ontogenetic changes in crown exposure of the species. Leaf trait variation was mainly related to differences among species and to a minor extent to differences in light availability. Traits related to the palisade layer, thickness of the outer cell wall, and N-area and P-area had the greatest plasticity, suggesting their importance for leaf function in different light environments. Short-lived pioneers had the highest trait plasticity. Overall plasticity was modest and rarely associated with juvenile light requirements, adult stature, or ontogenetic changes in crown exposure. Dry forest tree species had a lower light-related plasticity than wet forest species, probably because wet forests cast deeper shade. In dry forests light availability may be less limiting, and low water availability may constrain leaf trait plasticity in response to irradiance.

   SPRUCE
AB Dendroecological techniques were used to examine the relationships between topographic aspects, climatic variation and radial growth of Qilian juniper (Sabina przewalskii Kom.) and Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia Kom.) on the northeast Tibetan Plateau. Both tree species exhibit a lower growth rate, a larger interannual growth variability and a higher percentage of missing rings on the west- than east-facing slopes. The two tree-ring chronologies of the west-facing slope are positively correlated with monthly precipitation and relative air humidity, but negatively correlated with monthly maximum temperature in prior July-September and current May-June, suggesting a severe limitation of moisture availability on tree growth. On both topographic aspects, the two tree species show a significant and positive correlation with winter temperature. In comparison, the two tree-ring chronologies of the east-facing slope are positively related to July temperature. Interspecific differences in climatic responses can only be seen by a different strength of the climatic signal. Overall, the biophysical setting is critical in determining the nature of growth responses to climate. This study might provide useful information for looking forward in ecological forecasting of where and how possible future climate change will affect subalpine forests on the northeast Tibetan Plateau.

AB The diversity of a species assemblage has been studied extensively for many decades in relation to its possible connection with ecosystem functioning and organization. In this view most diversity measures, such as Shannon's entropy, rely upon information theory as a basis for the quantification of diversity. Also, traditional diversity measures are computed using species relative abundances and cannot account for the ecological differences between species. Rao first proposed a diversity index, termed quadratic diversity (Q) that incorporates both species relative abundances and pairwise distances between species. Quadratic diversity is traditionally defined as the expected distance between two randomly selected individuals. In this paper, we show that quadratic diversity can be interpreted as the expected conflict among the species of a given assemblage. From this unusual interpretation, it naturally follows that Rao's Q can be related to the Shannon entropy through a generalized version of the Tsallis parametric entropy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

ID ALIEN PLANTS; PATTERNS; HAWAII
AB We studied 28 alien tree species currently Planted for forestry purposes in the Czech Republic to determine the probability of their escape from cultivation and naturalization. Indicators of propagule pressure (number of administrative units in which a species is planted and total planting area) and time of introduction into cultivation were used as explanatory variables in multiple regression models. Fourteen species escaped from cultivation, and 39% of the variance was explained by the number of planting units and the time of introduction, the latter being more important. Species introduced early bad a higher probability of escape than those introduced later, with more than 95% probability of escape for those introduced before 1801 and < 5% for those introduced after 1892. Probability of naturalization was more difficult to predict, and eight species were misclassified. A model omitting two species with the largest influence on the model yielded similar predictors of naturalization as did the probability of escape. Both phases of invasion therefore appear to be driven by Planting and introduction history in a similar way. Our results demonstrate the importance of forestry for recruitment of invasive trees. Six alien forestry trees, classified as invasive in the Czech Republic, are currently reported in nature reserves. In addition, forestry authorities want to increase the diversity of alien species and planting area in the country.

AB The hypothesis that migratory bird populations are limited during the non-breeding season is increasingly supported by empirical studies that also suggest consequences that carry-over into subsequent seasons. Although variation in food supply is the best supported explanation for non-breeding season limitation, the ecological mechanisms and physiological consequences are not well understood. We both supplemented and reduced Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) food availability on replicate plots in Jamaica in each of 3 years to determine the direct role of food in limiting the physical condition of Ovenbirds. Annual variation in rainfall and food supply created a natural experiment in parallel with manipulations. Sex and age-classes of Ovenbirds did not respond differently in terms of body condition to either food manipulation or natural variation in environmental conditions, suggesting that this population is not structured by strong dominance relationships. Ovenbird body mass, fat, and pectoralis muscle shape were positively and predictably related to manipulated food availability. Feather regrowth rate also responded positively to food supplementation and negatively to food reduction in the drier of 2 years. Prior to manipulation, annual variation in body mass corresponded to annual variation in food supply and rainfall, providing additional, correlational evidence of food limitation. Since multiple intercorrelated body condition indices of Ovenbirds responded directly to food supply, and since food supply influenced body condition independently of other habitat features, we argue that food is a primary driver of non-breeding season population limitation. Moreover, since these effects were observed during the late non-breeding period, when individuals are preparing to migrate, we infer that food availability likely initiates carry-over effects.

AB Several studies have demonstrated that poor early nutrition, followed by growth compensation, can have negative consequences later in life. However, it remains unclear whether this is attributable to the nutritional deficit itself or a cost of compensatory growth. This distinction is important to our understanding both of the proximate and ultimate factors that shape growth trajectories and of how best to manage growth in our own and other species following low birth weight. We reared sibling pairs of zebra finches on different quality nutrition for the first 20 d of life only and examined their learning performance in adulthood. Final body size was not affected. However, the speed of learning a simple task in adulthood, which involved associating a screen colour with the presence of a food reward, was negatively related to the amount of growth compensation that had occurred. Learning speed was not related to the early diet itself or the amount of early growth depression. These results show that the level of compensatory growth that occurs following a period of poor nutrition is associated with long-term negative consequences for cognitive function and suggest that a growth-performance trade-off may determine optimal growth trajectories.

AB Despite the importance of carnivores in terrestrial ecosystems, many nations have implemented well-coordinated, state:funded initiatives to remove predators, largely because of conflicts with humans over livestock. Although these control efforts have been successful in terms of the number of carnivores removed, their effects on the viability of the industries they seek to protect are less understood. I assessed the efficacy of long-term efforts by the US. government to improve the viability of the sheep industry by reducing predation losses. I used regression analysis and hierarchical partitioning of a 60-year data set to explore associations among changes in sheep numbers and factors such as predator control effort, market prices, and production costs. In addition, I compared trends in the sheep industry in the western United States, where predator control is subsidized and coyotes (Canis latrans) are abundant, with trends in eastern states that lack federally subsidized predator control and that were (1) colonized by coyotes before 1950 or (2) colonized by coyotes between 1950 and 1990. Although control efforts were positively correlated with fluctuations in sheep numbers, production costs and market prices explained most of the model variation, with a combined independent contribution of 77%. Trends in sheep numbers in eastern and western states were highly correlated (r >= 0.942) independent of the period during which they were colonized by coyotes, indicating either that control has been ineffective at reducing predation losses or that factors other than predation account for the declines in both regions. These results suggest that government-subsidizedpredator control has failed to prevent the decline in the sheep industry and alternative support mechanisms need to be developed if the goal is to increase sheep production and not simply to kill carnivores.

AB Introgressive hybridization is an important evolutionary process and new analytical methods provide substantial power to detect and quantify it. In this study we use variation in the frequency of 657 AFLP fragments and DNA sequence variation from 15 genes to measure the extent of admixture and the direction of interspecific gene flow among three Heliconius butterfly species that diverged recently as a result of natural selection for Mullerian mimicry, and which continue to hybridize. Bayesian clustering based on AFLP genotypes correctly delineated the three species and identified four H. cydno, three H. pachinus, and three H. melpomene individuals that were of mixed ancestry. Gene genealogies revealed substantial shared DNA sequence variation among all three species and coalescent simulations based on the Isolation with Migration (IM) model pointed to interspecific gene flow as its cause. The IM simulations further indicated that interspecific gene flow was significantly asymmetrical, with greater gene flow from H. pachinus into H. cydno (2Nm = 4.326) than the reverse (2Nm = 0.502), and unidirectional gene flow from H. cydno and H. pachinus into H. melpomene (2Nm = 0.294 and 0.252, respectively). These asymmetries are in the directions expected based on the genetics of wing patterning and the probability that hybrids of various phenotypes will survive and reproduce in different mimetic environments. This empirical demonstration of extensive interspecific gene flow is in contrast to a previous study which found little evidence of gene flow between another pair of hybridizing Heliconius species, H. himera and H. erato, and it highlights the critical role of natural selection in maintaining species diversity. Furthermore, these results lend support to the hypotheses that phenotypic diversification in the genus Heliconius has been fueled by introgressive hybridization and that reinforcement has driven the evolution of assortative mate preferences.

AB Near real-time vegetation indices derived from MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) observations (http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov) provide a first opportunity to monitor ecohydrological systems globally at a spatial resolution consistent with biophysical processes at the field scale. Here, we present work toward the quantitative estimation of the uncertainty associated with MODIS Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), an end-product that depends on several MODIS derived vegetation indices. GPP products, available at 8-day and 1-km resolutions, were evaluated in two representative tropical ecosystems: a mixed forest site in the humid tropics (the Marsyandi river basin in the Nepalese Himalayas), and an open shrubland site in a semi-arid region (the Sonora river basin in northern Mexico). The MODIS-GPP products were compared against simulations made with a process-based biochemical-hydrology model driven by flux tower meteorological observations. Whereas the temporal march of vegetation indices and GPP products is consistent between the model and the algorithm, our study indicates that that there is a positive bias in the case of the mixed forest biome in the Marsyandi basin, and a negative bias in the case of open shrublands in the Sonora basin. We examined the error contribution from the DAO meteorological data used in the standard MODIS GPP products. The bias between the GPP estimates using DAO and tower meteorology is - 2.77 gC/m(2)/day (i.e., -77% of the mean of the tower-based GPP) in the Marsyandi, and 0.33 gC/m2/day (i.e., 18% of the mean of the tower-based GPP) in Sonora. Analysis of the temporal evolution of the discrepancies between the model and the MODIS algorithm points to the need for examining the light use efficiency parameterization, especially with regard to the representation of nonlinear functional dependencies on vapor pressure deficit (VPD), photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), and seasonal evolution of the productive capacity of vegetation as influenced by water stress.

AB Question: Are populations of a native California annual plant locally adapted to serpentine and non-serpentine soils?
   Study species: Collinsia sparsiflora (Scrophulariaceae s.l.), which grows both on and off serpentine soils.
   Field sites: We studied six populations at the McLaughlin University of California Natural Reserve, in the North Coast Range of California. All sites were within 1 km of each other, but were notably variable for a number of soil characters, including concentrations of calcium and magnesium, key factors in serpentine soils.
   Methods: We conducted reciprocal transplant experiments in 2002 and 2003. The 2002 experiment involved four study populations, two serpentine and two non-serpentine. In 2003, an additional population on each soil type was included in a second reciprocal transplant study. Seeds generated in greenhouse crosses were planted reciprocally into each population, providing replication within the soil types.
   Results: Both experiments demonstrated the presence of significant reciprocal adaptation to soil type. We also observed variation in phenology between transplants on the two soil types. We conclude that plants from these six populations represent two distinct, soil-specific ecotypes, raising questions about the relative role of selection and gene flow in promoting genetic differentiation in these contrasting environments.

AB Genetic data can provide a powerful tool for those interested in the ecology and management of wildlife, especially when it is combined with behavioral, demographic, or spatial information. Although the full potential of genetic approaches to the Study of wildlife populations has yet to be realized, the application of genetic analyses is becoming increasingly feasible and cost-effective. This is due primarily to recent advances in the number and types of genetic markers available, the development of sophisticated data analysis methods, and increased automation of laboratory instrumentation. These technological advances have broadened the list of questions that can be answered with genetic data, allowing inference at multiple levels of resolution (inter-individual to inter-specific) and temporal and spatial scales. Genetic data can be used to assess mating systems, hybridization, gene flow, effective population size, and population viability. Genetic data can also be used to define management units; identify individuals, sex, and species; and to provide insights into demographic patterns associated with the reduction and expansion of populations. All of these factors are either related to a species' ecology or provide important information for management and conservation. We describe some applications of genetic data, discuss processes affecting genetic variation within and among populations, and provide an overview of genetic terminology and how genetic variation is measured. As genetic methods become progressively more accessible and adaptable to an ever-widening array of questions, it is expected that they will play an increasingly important role in the ecology and management of wildlife.

AB There is a need for biological information to support current stock designations of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Gulf of Mexico. The existence of many inshore, resident "communities" raises questions as to the relationship these dolphins may hold with dolphins inhabiting neighboring inshore and coastal areas. In this study, population subdivision was examined among four resident, inshore bottlenose dolphin stocks (Sarasota Bay, FL, Tampa Bay, FL, Charlotte Harbor, FL and Matagorda Bay, TX) and one coastal stock (1-12 km offshore) in the Gulf of Mexico. Evidence of significant population structure among all areas was found on the basis of both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequence data and nine nuclear microsatellite loci. Estimates of relatedness showed no population contained a significantly high number of related individuals, while separate AMOVAs for males and females indicated that both sexes exhibit a significant level of site philopatry. Results presented here provide the first genetic evidence of population subdivision between the coastal Gulf of Mexico and adjacent inshore areas along the central west coast of Florida. Such strong genetic subdivision is surprising given the short geographical distance between many of these areas and the lack of obvious geographic barriers to prevent gene flow. These findings support the current, separate identification of stocks for bottlenose dolphins inhabiting the eastern coastal and inshore areas of the Gulf of Mexico.

AB This paper demonstrates how the power form of the Species-Area Relationship (SAR) can be used to set conservation targets for land classes using biodiversity survey data. The log-transformation of the power model is a straight line; therefore, if one knows the average number of species recorded per survey site and can estimate the true species number present in the land class, using EstimateS software, it is possible to calculate the slope of the curve, or z-value. The z-value is the exponent in the power model and it can then be used to estimate the proportion of area required to represent a given proportion of species present in any land class. This application of the SAR is explored using phytosociological releve data from South Africa's Succulent Karoo biome. We also provide suggestions for extrapolating the estimated z-values to other land classes within a bioregion that lack sufficient survey data, using the relationship between z-values and remotely determined landscape variables such as habitat diversity (topographic diversity) and geographic location (latitude and longitude). The SAR predicts that for most Succulent Karoo vegetation types a conservation target of 10% of the land area would not be sufficient to conserve the majority of species. We also demonstrate that not all land classes are equal from a plant biodiversity perspective, so applying one target to all land classes in a region will lead to significant gaps and inefficiencies in any reserve network based on this universal target.

AB Male ornamentation in socially monogamous birds has been shown to provide information to potential mates on aspects of condition and behaviour. We studied female ornamentation in the socially monogamous, biparental northern cardinal to determine whether expressions of multiple ornaments correlate with aspects of female condition and behaviour. Expressions of the ornamental red-orange bill, red underwing feathers, head crest and blackish face mask were compared to several measures of condition, parental behaviour and intrasexual aggression. Red-orange bill colour of females was correlated with both body size and an index of body condition. Redness of the underwing feathers was correlated with body size, body condition, date of first nest produced and reproductive success. Face mask expression was correlated with both nestling feeding rate and level of intrasexual aggression. The length of head crest feathers did not correlate with any measured aspect of condition or behaviour. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that ornaments in female cardinals provide redundant information to prospective mates on aspects of female condition and behaviour.

AB In the first part of the paper urban sustainability issues in African countries are considered with a focus on urban growth. The need for urban management tools that are able to provide prospective scenarios is addressed. Urban simulations can represent a useful approach to an understanding of the consequences of current planning policies or their incompleteness. Simulations of future urban growth are usually quite difficult without tools that embrace the complexity of the urban system. The second part of this paper describes an urban growth simulation for the city of Lagos in Nigeria using a dynamic spatial model prototype. We propose a bottom-up approach, integrating land-use factors with a dynamic approach for modelling future urban land-use scenarios. The model for Lagos was calibrated and tested using measured time-series data on land-use, through a set of spatial metrics and Kappa (K) coefficients. Afterwards, a twenty-year simulation was run until 2020. The simulation results are realistic and relatively accurate, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed model. This work was performed in the framework of the European Commission's MOLAND project. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 1 Responses of a Scandinavian sub-Arctic dwarf shrub heath community to 9 years of nutrient and temperature treatments were examined. Our objective was to assess the responses of plant and insect herbivore communities to these treatments, and to determine how vegetation responses scale-up to those of a second trophic group.
   2 There were strong effects of nutrient addition on the above-ground biomass of both dominant (dwarf shrubs) and subordinate (grasses and mosses) plant functional groups, with responses by the latter being of greater magnitude. Responses to temperature were less frequent and of a smaller magnitude.
   3 There were marked changes in the abundance of insect herbivores in response to the treatments. Changes in the above-ground biomass of subordinate plant species had a greater impact on the composition of the insect herbivore community than the smaller responses of dominant dwarf shrubs. For example, the abundance of a moss-feeding Heteropteran in fertilized plots was as little as 6% that of controls, while Homoptera specializing on grasses were over 400% more abundant. In addition, gramnivorous taxa. (the Delphacidae) were present only in those plots that received nutrients.
   4 Despite some species-specific effects of the perturbations on the quality of dwarf shrub annual shoots (defined as the concentrations of nitrogen and phenolic compounds), little change in leaf herbivory was observed. Insect herbivores removed less than 1% of annual biomass from dominant dwarf shrub species.
   5 It is proposed that insect community change was driven by subordinate plant groups and not by the dominant dwarf shrub species, suggesting a wider importance of subordinate species for community structure.

AB The U.S. Geological Survey examined 25 agricultural streams in eastern Wisconsin to determine relations between fish, invertebrate, and algal metrics and multiple spatial scales of land cover, geologic setting, hydrologic, aquatic habitat, and water chemistry data. Spearman correlation and redundancy analyses were used to examine relations among biotic metrics and environmental characteristics. Riparian vegetation, geologic, and hydrologic conditions affected the response of biotic metrics to watershed agricultural land cover but the relations were aquatic assemblage dependent. It was difficult to separate the interrelated effects of geologic setting, watershed and buffer land cover, and base flow. Watershed and buffer land cover, geologic setting, reach riparian vegetation width, and stream size affected the fish IBI, invertebrate diversity, diatom IBI, and number of algal taxa; however, the invertebrate FBI, percentage of EPT, and the diatom pollution index were more influenced by nutrient concentrations and flow variability. Fish IBI scores seemed most sensitive to land cover in the entire stream network buffer, more so than watershed-scale land cover and segment or reach riparian vegetation width. All but one stream with more than approximately 10 percent buffer agriculture had fish IBI scores of fair or poor. In general, the invertebrate and algal metrics used in this study were not as sensitive to land cover effects as fish metrics. Some of the reach-scale characteristics, such as width/depth ratios, velocity, and bank stability, could be related to watershed influences of both land cover and geologic setting. The Wisconsin habitat index was related to watershed geologic setting, watershed and buffer land cover, riparian vegetation width, and base flow, and appeared to be a good indicator of stream quality. Results from this study emphasize the value of using more than one or two biotic metrics to assess water quality and the importance of environmental characteristics at multiple scales.

ID GLOBAL PATTERNS
AB Aim To attack a widespread myth.
   Location World-wide.
   Methods Simple mathematical logical and empirical examples.
   Results As both species and area are finite and non-negative, the species-area relationship is limited at both ends. The log species-log area relationship is normally effectively linear on scales from about 1 ha to 10(7) km(2). There are no asymptotes. At the intercontinental scale it may get steeper; at small scales it may in different cases get steeper or shallower or maintain its slope.
   Main conclusion The species-area relationship does not have an asymptote.

AB Animal movement and dispersal can be described as a correlated random walk dependent on three parameters: number of steps, step size, and distribution of random turning angles. Equations of Kareiva and Shigesada use the parameters to predict the mean square displacement distance (MSDD), but this is less meaningful than the mean dispersal distance (MDD) about which the population would be distributed. I found that the MDD can be estimated by multiplying the square root of the MSDD by a three-dimensional surface correction factor obtained from simulations. The correction factors ranged from 0.89 to 1 depending on the number of steps and the variation in random turns, expressed as the standard deviation of the turning angles (SDA) about 0 degrees (straight ahead). Corrected equations were used to predict MDDs for bark beetles, butterflies, ants, and beetles (based on parameters from the literature) and the nematode Steinernema carocapasae (Weiser). Another equation from the literature finds the MDD directly, and this agreed with the MDD obtained by simulation at some combinations of SDA and numbers of steps. However. the equation has an error that increases as a power function when the standard deviation of turning angles becomes smaller (e.g., <6 degrees at 1000 steps or < 13 degrees at 250 steps). Lower numbers of steps also increase the error. Equivalent values of AMT tangle of maximum turn) in uniform random models and of SDA in normal random models were found that allowed these two models to yield similar MDD values. The step size and turning angle variation of animal paths during dispersal and host and mate starching were investigated and found to be correlated; thus, use of different measured step sizes gives consistent estimates of the MDD.

AB We assessed genetic differentiation and diversity in 14 populations of sika deer (Cervus nippon) from Japan and four populations of sika deer introduced to the UK, using nine microsatellite loci. We observed extreme levels of differentiation and significant differences in diversity between populations. Our results do not support morphological subspecies designations, but are consistent with previous mitochondrial DNA analyses which suggest the existence of two genetically distinct lineages of sika deer in Japan. The source of sika introduced to the UK was identified as Kyushu. The underlying structure of Japanese populations probably derives from drift in separate glacial refugia and male dispersal limited by distance. This structure has been perturbed by bottlenecks and habitat fragmentation, resulting from human activity from the mid-nineteenth century. Most current genetic differentiation and differences in diversity among populations probably result from recent drift. Coalescent model analysis suggests sika on each of the main Japanese islands have experienced different recent population histories. Hokkaido, which has large areas of continuous habitat, has maintained high levels of gene now. In Honshu the population is highly fragmented and is likely to have been evolving by drift alone. In Kyushu there has been a balance between gene flow and drift but all the populations have experienced high levels of drift. Habitat fragment size was not significantly associated with genetic diversity in populations but there was a significant correlation between habitat fragment size and effective population size.

ID DUNG BEETLES COLEOPTERA; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; HABITAT; PATTERNS
AB Protection of natural areas has caused the elimination of traditional grazing activity on many occasions. As a result, in Mediterranean ecosystems a loss of biodiversity is usually related to a decrease of grassland and grassland-bush mosaic areas. In order to establish relationships between land use and the relative importance of each type of habitat in terms of species richness and endemicity, the Font Roja Natural Park in Alicante Province (SE Iberian Peninsula) was studied. Four sites were selected representing the four different existing habitats: a wooded area (holm-oak forest), a dense shrubland, a dense grassland, and a grassland-shrubland mosaic area. In each site, the species composition of vegetation and dung beetle fauna were analysed. The results showed that the highest diversity and endemicity, for plants and beetles, were concentrated in the dense grasslands and the grassland-shrubland mosaic. Thus, controlled grazing activity of sheep and goats which maintained a diverse variegated landscape would favour the historical sustenance of the biodiversity of Mediterranean ecosystems, as that would allow a remarkable diversity of habitats with higher conservation levels of existing species richness and endemicity. Therefore, we propose a reintroduction of traditional grazing of sheep and goats throughout ecological, cultural and economical measures, which would include guidelines and regulations, set out to boost an integrated rural policy.

SO JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM

DT Article
ID SOUTHERN BIGHT; MARINE NEMATODES; ECOLOGY; WATERS; MEIOFAUNA; FAUNA
AB Nematode assemblages were sampled seasonally at three subtidal stations along the Belgian coast. The stations were characterized by muddy sediments (station 115), fine sand (station 702) and fine to coarse sand (station 790). The forces structuring vertical distribution were investigated by evaluating abundance, species composition, diversity and trophic composition, and relating these to sediment composition, redox state and food sources.
   The nematode assemblages at the two finer grained stations (115, 702) were dominated by Daptonema tenuispiculum and Sabatieria punctata. For both species, the vertical distribution in the sediment seemed not dependent on the redoxchemistry, as former believed for S. punctata, but primarily influenced by food availability. This feature could also be recognized for Ixonema sordidum and Viscosia langrunensis, the most abundant nematodes at the coarse sandy station (790).
   In general, nematode diversity was regulated primarily by sediment granulometry. Coarser sediments (station 790) yielded more diverse communities compared to the fine sediments (station 115, 702), however seasonal fluctuations and variations with depth into the sediment were not obvious. At the silty stations, when the sediment column was more oxidized in March, overall diversity was higher and showed a positive relationship to the mud content which varied with depth into the sediment. This positive relation is probably explained by an enhanced deposition of organic matter associated with the accumulation of fine particles near the river-mouths. Furthermore, the higher abundance, the lower diversity and the higher dominance found at the two silty stations of the eastern and the western part of the Belgian coast, pointed to a stressed, organically enriched environment.
   The results demonstrate that controls on nematode community structure are complex and that information at both species and community level are required to properly evaluate the effects of natural and anthropogenic impacts.

AB 1. Discriminant factorial analysis (DFA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) were used to develop models of presence/absence for three species of small-bodied fish (minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus, gudgeon, Gobio gobio, and stone leach, Barbatula barbatula). 2. Fish and ten environmental variables were sampled using point abundance sampling by electrofishing in the Ariege River (France) at 464 sampling points. 3. Using DFA, the percentage of correct assignments, expressed as the percentage of individuals correctly classified over the total number of examined individuals, was 62.5% for stone leach, 66.6% for gudgeon and 78% for minnow. With back-propagation of ANN, the recognition performance obtained after 500 iterations was: 82.1% for stone leach, 87.7% for gudgeon and 90.1% for minnow. 4. The better predictive performance of the artificial neural networks holds promise for other situations with non-linearly related variables.

AB To better understand patterns of fish assemblage composition in Wisconsin streams in relation to major environmental gradients, I carried out multivariate direct gradient analysis (canonical correspondence analysis) of two large independent datasets on fish species abundance in Wisconsin streams. Analysis of the two datasets yielded similar results, suggesting that observed patterns and relationships were real. Stream sites were distributed along fish species-environment gradients, but segregation into distinct stream temperature and geographic groups was also evident. The strongest gradient in both datasets was related to summer water temperature patterns, and encompassed a transition from small, coldwater streams dominated by salmonids, cottids, certain cyprinids, and few other species, to both small and large, warmwater streams dominated by a high diversity of different cyprinids, catostomids, ictalurids, centrarchids, and percids. A second gradient in both datasets was complex but largely geographic. Within it,sites from each of the four ecoregions that occupy Wisconsin formed fairly discrete groups. The strongest differences were between sites in the two southern Wisconsin ecoregions, the Driftless Area and the Southeastern Wisconsin Till Plains, that were dominated by certain cyprinids, ictalurids, and centrarchids, and sites in the two northern Wisconsin ecoregions, the North Central Hardwood Forests and the Northern Lakes and Forests, that were dominated by a different set of cyprinids and ictalurids, plus some petromyzontids, salmonids, catostomids, and percids. Sites from the Driftless Area that were mostly higher-gradient (steep stream slope) and had many riffle-dwelling species could also be distinguished from sites in the Southeastern Wisconsin Till Plains that were mostly lower-gradient and had many pool-dwelling species. The patterns of fish assemblage composition among sites and the associated fish species-environment relationships that were revealed by the analyses provided a framework for developing an ecologically meaningful hierarchical classification of Wisconsin stream sites based on stream thermal regime, ecoregion, stream size, and stream gradient.

AB The exchange of heat, momentum, and mass in the atmosphere over mountainous terrain is controlled by synoptic-scale dynamics, thermally driven mesoscale circulations, and turbulence. This article reviews the key challenges relevant to the understanding of exchange processes in the mountain boundary layer and outlines possible research priorities for the future. The review describes the limitations of the experimental study of turbulent exchange over complex terrain, the impact of slope and valley breezes on the structure of the convective boundary layer, and the role of intermittent mixing and wave-turbulence interaction in the stable boundary layer. The interplay between exchange processes at different spatial scales is discussed in depth, emphasizing the role of elevated and ground-based stable layers in controlling multi-scale interactions in the atmosphere over and near mountains. Implications of the current understanding of exchange processes over mountains towards the improvement of numerical weather prediction and climate models are discussed, considering in particular the representation of surface boundary conditions, the parameterization of sub-grid-scale exchange, and the development of stochastic perturbation schemes.

AB The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel (EEAP) is one of three Panels of experts that inform the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. The EEAP focuses on the effects of UV radiation on human health, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, air quality, and materials, as well as on the interactive effects of UV radiation and global climate change. When considering the effects of climate change, it has become clear that processes resulting in changes in stratospheric ozone are more complex than previously held. Because of the Montreal Protocol, there are now indications of the beginnings of a recovery of stratospheric ozone, although the time required to reach levels like those before the 1960s is still uncertain, particularly as the effects of stratospheric ozone on climate change and vice versa, are not yet fully understood. Some regions will likely receive enhanced levels of UV radiation, while other areas will likely experience a reduction in UV radiation as ozone- and climate-driven changes affect the amounts of UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface. Like the other Panels, the EEAP produces detailed Quadrennial Reports every four years; the most recent was published as a series of seven papers in 2015 (Photochem. Photobiol. Sci., 2015, 14, 1-184). In the years in between, the EEAP produces less detailed and shorter Update Reports of recent and relevant scientific findings. The most recent of these was for 2016 (Photochem. Photobiol. Sci., 2017, 16, 107-145). The present 2017 Update Report assesses some of the highlights and new insights about the interactive nature of the direct and indirect effects of UV radiation, atmospheric processes, and climate change. A full 2018 Quadrennial Assessment, will be made available in 2018/2019.

AB 1. The environmental filtering hypothesis predicts that the abiotic environment selects species with similar trait values within communities. Testing this hypothesis along multiple -and interacting gradients of climate and soil variables constitutes a great opportunity to better understand and predict the responses of plant communities to ongoing environmental changes.
   2. Based on two key plant traits, maximum plant height and specific leaf area (SLA), we assessed the filtering effects of climate (mean annual temperature and precipitation, precipitation seasonality), soil characteristics (soil pH, sand content and total phosphorus) and all potential interactions on the functional structure and diversity of 124 dryland communities spread over the globe. The functional structure and diversity of dryland communities were quantified using the mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis of plant trait distributions.
   3. The models accurately explained the observed variations in functional trait diversity across the 124 communities studied. All models included interactions among factors, i.e. climate-climate (9% of explanatory power), climate-soil (24% of explanatory power) and soil-soil interactions (5% of explanatory power). Precipitation seasonality was the main driver of maximum plant height, and interacted with mean annual temperature and precipitation. Soil pH mediated the filtering effects of climate and sand content on SLA. Our results also revealed that communities characterized by a low variance can also exhibit low kurtosis values, indicating that functionally contrasting species can co-occur even in communities with narrow ranges of trait values.
   4. Synthesis. We identified the particular set of conditions under which the environmental filtering hypothesis operates in drylands world-wide. Our findings also indicate that species with functionally contrasting strategies can still co-occur locally, even under prevailing environmental filtering. Interactions between sources of environmental stress should be therefore included in global trait-based studies, as this will help to further anticipate where the effects of environmental filtering will impact plant trait diversity under climate change.

AB Accurate estimation of terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) remains a challenge despite its importance in the global carbon cycle. Chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) has been recently adopted to understand photosynthesis and its response to the environment, particularly with remote sensing data. However, it remains unclear how ChlF and photosynthesis are linked at different spatial scales across the growing season. We examined seasonal relationships between ChlF and photosynthesis at the leaf, canopy, and ecosystem scales and explored how leaf-level ChlF was linked with canopy-scale solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) in a temperate deciduous forest at Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA. Our results show that ChlF captured the seasonal variations of photosynthesis with significant linear relationships between ChlF and photosynthesis across the growing season over different spatial scales (R-2 = 0.73, 0.77, and 0.86 at leaf, canopy, and satellite scales, respectively; P < 0.0001). We developed a model to estimate GPP from the tower-based measurement of SIF and leaf-level ChlF parameters. The estimation of GPP from this model agreed well with flux tower observations of GPP (R-2 = 0.68; P < 0.0001), demonstrating the potential of SIF for modeling GPP. At the leaf scale, we found that leaf F-q'/F-m', the fraction of absorbed photons that are used for photochemistry for a light-adapted measurement from a pulse amplitude modulation fluorometer, was the best leaf fluorescence parameter to correlate with canopy SIF yield (SIF/APAR, R-2 = 0.79; P < 0.0001). We also found that canopy SIF and SIF-derived GPP (GPP(SIF)) were strongly correlated to leaf-level biochemistry and canopy structure, including chlorophyll content (R-2 = 0.65 for canopy GPP(SIF) and chlorophyll content; P < 0.0001), leaf area index (LAI) (R-2 = 0.35 for canopy GPP(SIF) and LAI; P < 0.0001), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (R-2 = 0.36 for canopy GPP(SIF) and NDVI; P < 0.0001). Our results suggest that ChlF can be a powerful tool to track photosynthetic rates at leaf, canopy, and ecosystem scales.

AB Resource managers and decision-makers are increasingly tasked with integrating climate change science into their decisions about resource management and policy development. This often requires climate scientists, resource managers, and decision-makers to work collaboratively throughout the research processes, an approach to knowledge development that is often called "coproduction of knowledge." The goal of this paper is to synthesize the social science theory of coproduction of knowledge, the metrics currently used to evaluate usable or actionable science in several federal agencies, and insights from experienced climate researchers and program managers to develop a set of 45 indicators supporting an evaluation framework for coproduced usable climate science. Here the proposed indicators and results from two case studies that were used to test the indicators are presented, as well as lessons about the process of evaluating the coproduction of knowledge and collaboratively producing climate knowledge.

AB The recovery of forests following stand-replacing disturbance is of widespread interest; however, there is both a lack of definitional clarity for the term "recovery" and a dearth of empirical data on the rates of forest recovery associated with different disturbance types. We conducted a quantitative review of literature to determine recovery times following wildfire and timber harvest and to evaluate variation in recovery rates across Canada's diverse forest ecosystems. Recovery was assessed according to the rate of change associated with certain forest structural attributes that have traditionally been used as indicators of forest growth and productivity. The recovery of forest canopy cover, tree height, and stand basal area varied at rates that depended on disturbance type, forest biome, and ecozone. We found that, on average, it took 5-10 years, depending on factors such as location and species, for most forest ecosystems of Canada to attain a benchmark canopy cover of 10% after wildfire or harvest. Similarly, regenerating stands in Canada's boreal forests were capable of attaining average heights of 5 m within five to ten years after wildfire or harvest. Stands in the Boreal Plains ecozone post-harvest reached stand basal area, benchmarked at 10 m(2) ha(-1), faster than those in the Boreal Shield, attributable to differences in tree species composition and the rich mineral deposits of the Boreal Plains. Overall, recovery of canopy cover, tree height, and stand basal area was similar or more rapid following wildfire than harvest. Our review provides temporal benchmarks for gauging recovery times after disturbance. Building upon these temporal benchmarks, and conditioned by disturbance type, site conditions, and location, we present opportunities for using dense time series of remotely sensed data to inform on regional and national trends in forest recovery following disturbance.

AB High-throughput sequencing (HTS) of immune repertoires has enabled the quantitative analysis of adaptive immune responses and offers the potential to revolutionize research in lymphocyte biology, vaccine profiling, and monoclonal antibody engineering. Advances in sequencing technology coupled to an exponential decline in sequencing costs have fueled the recent over-whelming interest in immune repertoire sequencing. This, in turn, has sparked the development of numerous methods for bioinformatic and statistics-driven interpretation and visualization of immune repertoires. Here, we review the current literature on bioinformatic and statistical analysis of immune repertoire HTS data and discuss underlying assumptions, applicability, and scope. We further highlight important directions for future research, which could propel immune repertoire HTS to becoming a standard method for measuring adaptive immune responses.

AB The implementation of the European Flood Directive 2007/60/EC requires the establishment of public participation mechanisms to ensure citizens' involvement in the flood management cycle. This raises questions on how to achieve this goal and successfully translate the directive into meaningful and effective participation. Innovative means, such as citizen observatories enabled by information and communication technologies, have the potential to provide citizens with a substantially new role in decision-making. In this paper, we present a framework developed for analysing the potential for participation via ICT-enabled citizen observatories and undertake a comparative analysis of the UK, the Netherlands and Italy. Expository and qualitative research was undertaken in the three case study areas, with the aim of identifying and comparing the transposition of the EU Flood directive and the mechanisms in place for citizens' participation during different phases of the disaster cycle (prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery). Our analysis of the transposition of legal obligations for citizen participation shows that implementation is limited when examining both the respective roles and types of interactions between citizen and authorities and the impact of citizen participation on decision-making. Different authorities have differing perceptions of citizen participation in flood risk management in terms of their roles and influence. Our results also indicate that these perceptions are related to the importance that the authorities place on the different stages of the disaster cycle. This understanding is crucial for identifying the potential of citizen observatories to foster greater citizen engagement and participation. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Projected global change will increase the level of land-use and environmental stressors such as drought and grazing, particularly in drylands. Still, combined effects of drought and grazing on plant production are poorly understood, thus hampering adequate projections and development of mitigation strategies. We used a large, cross-continental database consisting of 174 long-term datasets from >30 dryland regions to quantify ecosystem responses to drought and grazing with the ultimate goal to increase functional understanding in these responses. Two key aspects of ecosystem stability, resistance to and recovery after a drought, were evaluated based on standardized and normalized aboveground net primary production (ANPP) data. Drought intensity was quantified using the standardized precipitation index. We tested effects of drought intensity, grazing regime (grazed, ungrazed), biome (grassland, shrubland, savanna) or dominant life history (annual, perennial) of the herbaceous layer to assess the relative importance of these factors for ecosystem stability, and to identify predictable relationships between drought intensity and ecosystem resistance and recovery. We found that both components of ecosystem stability were better explained by dominant herbaceous life history than by biome. Increasing drought intensity (quasi-) linearly reduced ecosystem resistance. Even though annual and perennial systems showed the same response rate to increasing drought intensity, they differed in their general magnitude of resistance, with annual systems being ca. 27% less resistant. In contrast, systems with an herbaceous layer dominated by annuals had substantially higher postdrought recovery, particularly when grazed. Combined effects of drought and grazing were not merely additive but modulated by dominant life history of the herbaceous layer. To the best of our knowledge, our study established the first predictive, cross-continental model between drought intensity and drought-related relative losses in ANPP, and suggests that systems with an herbaceous layer dominated by annuals are more prone to ecosystem degradation under future global change regimes.

AB A performance assessment was conducted of regional fisheries management organizations' (RFMOs') bycatch governance, one element of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. Obtaining a mean score of 25%, with a 64% CV, collectively the RFMOs have large governance deficits. Individually, there has been mixed progress, with some RFMOs having made substantial progress for some governance elements. There has been nominal progress in gradually transitioning to ecosystem-based fisheries management: controls largely do not account for broad or multispecies effects of fishing, and cross-sectoral marine spatial planning is limited. Regional observers collect half of minimum information needed to assess the efficacy of bycatch measures. Over two-thirds of RFMO-managed fisheries lack regional observer coverage. International exchange of observers occurs in one-third of programmes. There is no open access to research-grade regional observer data. Ecological risk assessments focus on effects of bycatch removals on vulnerable species groups and effects of fishing on vulnerable benthic marine ecosystems. RFMOs largely do not assess or manage cryptic, generally undetectable sources of fishing mortality. Binding measures address about one-third of bycatch problems. Eighty per cent of measures lack explicit performance standards against which to assess efficacy. Measures are piecemeal, developed without considering potential conflicts across vulnerable groups. RFMOs employ 60% of surveillance methods required to assess compliance. A lack of transparency and limited reporting of inspection effort, identified infractions, enforcement actions and outcomes further limits the ability to assess compliance. Augmented harmonization could help to fill identified deficits.

AB Knowledge of the number and distribution of species is fundamental to biodiversity conservation efforts, but this information is lacking for the majority of species on earth. Consequently, subsets of taxa are often used as proxies for biodiversity; but this assumes that different taxa display congruent distribution patterns. Here we use a global meta-analysis to show that studies of cross-taxon congruence rarely give consistent results. Instead, species richness congruence is highest at extreme spatial scales and close to the equator, while congruence in species composition is highest at large extents and grain sizes. Studies display highest variance in cross-taxon congruence when conducted in areas with dissimilar areal extents (for species richness) or latitudes (for species composition). These results undermine the assumption that a subset of taxa can be representative of biodiversity. Therefore, researchers whose goal is to prioritize locations or actions for conservation should use data from a range of taxa.

AB The metabolic rate of organisms may be viewed as a basic property from which other vital rates and many ecological patterns emerge and that follows a universal allometric mass scaling law, or it may be considered a property of the organism that emerges as a result of the adaptation to the environment, with consequently fewer universal mass scaling properties. Here, we examine the mass scaling of respiration and maximum feeding (clearance and ingestion rates) and growth rates of heterotrophic pelagic organisms over an similar to similar to 10(15) range in body mass. We show that clearance and respiration rates have life-form-dependent allometries that have similar scaling but different intercepts, such that the mass-specific rates converge on a rather narrow size-independent range. In contrast, ingestion and growth rates follow a near-universal taxa-independent similar to similar to 3/4 mass scaling power law. We argue that the declining mass-specific clearance rates with size within taxa is related to the inherent decrease in feeding efficiency of any particular feeding mode. The transitions between feeding mode and simultaneous transitions in clearance and respiration rates may then represent adaptations to the food environment and be the result of the optimization of trade-offs that allow sufficient feeding and growth rates to balance mortality.

AB Butterflies are charismatic insects that have long been a focus of biological research. They are also habitats for microorganisms, yet these microbial symbionts are little-studied, despite their likely importance to butterfly ecology and evolution. In particular, the diversity and composition of the microbial communities inhabiting adult butterflies remain uncharacterized, and it is unknown how the larval (caterpillar) and adult microbiota compare. To address these knowledge gaps, we used Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from internal bacterial communities associated with multiple life stages of the neotropical butterfly Heliconius erato. We found that the leaf-chewing larvae and nectar-and pollen-feeding adults of H. erato contain markedly distinct bacterial communities, a pattern presumably rooted in their distinct diets. Larvae and adult butterflies host relatively small and similar numbers of bacterial phylotypes, but few are common to both stages. The larval microbiota clearly simplifies and reorganizes during metamorphosis; thus, structural changes in a butterfly's bacterial community parallel those in its own morphology. We furthermore identify specific bacterial taxa that may mediate larval and adult feeding biology in Heliconius and other butterflies. Although male and female Heliconius adults differ in reproductive physiology and degree of pollen feeding, bacterial communities associated with H. erato are not sexually dimorphic. Lastly, we show that captive and wild individuals host different microbiota, a finding that may have important implications for the relevance of experimental studies using captive butterflies.

AB With the increased availability of high-resolution sequence information, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have become feasible in a number of species(1-8). The vast majority of these studies are conducted in human populations, where it is difficult to provide strong evidence for the functional involvement of unknown genes that are identified using GWA. Here we used the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana to combine high-throughput confocal microscopy imaging of traits at the cellular level, GWA and expression analyses to identify genomic regions that are associated with developmental cell-type traits. We identify and characterize a new F-box gene, KUK, that regulates meristem and cell length. We further show that polymorphisms in the coding sequence are the major causes of KUK allele-dependent natural variation in root development. This work demonstrates the feasibility of GWA using cellular traits to identify causal genes for basic biological processes such as development.

AB Functional traits may predict tree growth rates and survival in plantings aimed to accelerate natural succession in pastures. We evaluate the growth and survival of 24 tree species used for forest restoration in pastures in the wet tropics in Mexico for 42 months. We relate their performance to 13 underlying functional traits that are important for leaf display, tree architecture and reproduction. Pioneers realized both faster growth rates and higher survival than non-pioneer species. No consistent ontogenetic cross-overs in species growth and survival were found during 42 months, which implies that species performance early after planting (12 months) predicted performance well after 42 months, probably because environmental conditions changed little over time in these early-successional pastures. Nine out of 12 functional traits were good predictors of growth rates and/or survival measures across all 24 species or for pioneer or non-pioneer species separately. Growth rates and survival were positively related to crown size and negatively to seed mass, but they were - surprisingly - not related to the leaf traits we measured. Multivariate plant trait axes explained species growth rates and survival better than individual traits only for the non-pioneer species group. Selection of additional traits may be needed for better predictions of overall performance of restoration plantings. Combining the basic science of functional ecology with the applied goals of forest management and restoration allow us to select the best mid-term performing tree species for planting in pastures using a short-term screening of growth and survival rates. Pioneers and non-pioneer species with small seeds and large crown length are good candidates for plantings in pastures since they have the best mid-term performance. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB The present review was undertaken to add more information on the place taken by humus forms in plant-soil interactions. Three questions were asked: (i) are humus forms under the control of plant soil relationships, (ii) are humus forms the main seat of these relationships, and (iii) can humus forms explain interactions between aboveground and belowground biodiversity. Some conflicting views about humped-back models of species richness may be resolved by considering a limited number of stable humus forms (here considered as ecosystem strategies) which should be treated separately rather than in a single model. Mull, moder and mor pathways are each characterized by a fine tuning between aboveground and belowground communities, the humus form (including litter) being the place where resonance between these communities takes place, both in functional and evolutionary sense.

AB Eradication aims at eliminating populations of alien organisms from an area. Since not all eradications are successful, several factors have been proposed in the literature (mainly by referring to case studies) to be crucial for eradication success, such as infestation size or reaction time. To our knowledge, however, no study has statistically evaluated which factors affect eradication success and attempted to determine their relative importance. We established a unique global dataset on 136 eradication campaigns against 75 species (invasive alien invertebrates, plants and plant pathogens) and statistically tested whether the following factors, proposed by others were significantly related to eradication success: (1) the reaction time between the arrival/detection of the organism and the start of the eradication campaign; (2) the spatial extent of the infestation; (3) the level of biological knowledge of the organism; and (4) insularity. Of these, only the spatial extent of the infestation was significantly related to the eradication outcome: local campaigns were more successful than regional or national campaigns. Reaction time, the level of knowledge and insularity were all unrelated to eradication success. Hence, some factors suggested as being crucial may be less important than previously thought, at least for the organisms tested here. We found no differences in success rates among taxonomic groups or geographic regions. We recommend that eradication measures should generally concentrate on the very early phase of invasions when infestations are still relatively small.

AB We investigated the control of postwildfire runoff by physical and hydraulic properties of soil, hydrologic states, and an ash layer immediately following wildfire. The field site is within the area burned by the 2010 Fourmile Canyon Fire in Colorado, USA. Physical and hydraulic property characterization included ash thickness, particle size distribution, hydraulic conductivity, and soil water retention curves. Soil water content and matric potential were measured indirectly at several depths below the soil surface to document hydrologic states underneath the ash layer in the unsaturated zone, whereas precipitation and surface runoff were measured directly. Measurements of soil water content showed that almost no water infiltrated below the ash layer into the near-surface soil in the burned site at the storm time scale (i.e., minutes to hours). Runoff generation processes were controlled by and highly sensitive to ash thickness and ash hydraulic properties. The ash layer stored from 97% to 99% of rainfall, which was critical for reducing runoff amounts. The hydrologic response to two rain storms with different rainfall amounts, rainfall intensity, and durations, only ten days apart, indicated that runoff generation was predominantly by the saturation-excess mechanism perched at the ash-soil interface during the first storm and predominantly by the infiltration-excess mechanism at the ash surface during the second storm. Contributing area was not static for the two storms and was 4% (saturation excess) to 68% (infiltration excess) of the catchment area. Our results showed the importance of including hydrologic conditions and hydraulic properties of the ash layer in postwildfire runoff generation models.

AB Net primary productivity (NPP) is one of the most important ecosystem parameters, representing vegetation activity, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystem services. To assess how well the scientific community understands the biospheric function, a historical meta-analysis was conducted. By surveying the literature from 1862 to 2011, I extracted 251 estimates of total terrestrial NPP at the present time (NPPT) and calculated their statistical metrics. For all the data, the mean +/- standard deviation and median were 56.2 +/- 14.3 and 56.4 Pg C yr(-1), respectively. Even for estimates published after 2000, a substantial level of uncertainty (coefficient of variation by +/- 15%) was inevitable. The estimates were categorized on the basis of methodology (i.e., inventory analysis, empirical model, biogeochemical model, dynamic global vegetation model, and remote sensing) to examine the consistency among the statistical metrics of each category. Chronological analysis revealed that the present NPPT estimates were directed by extensive field surveys in the 1960s and 1970s (e. g., the International Biological Programme). A wide range of uncertainty remains in modern estimates based on advanced biogeochemical and dynamic vegetation models and remote-sensing techniques. Several critical factors accounting for the estimation uncertainty are discussed. Ancillary analyses were performed to derive additional ecological and human-related parameters related to NPP. For example, interannual variability, carbon-use efficiency (a ratio of NPP to gross photosynthesis), human appropriation, and preindustrial NPPT were assessed. Finally, I discuss the importance of improving NPPT estimates in the context of current global change studies and integrated carbon cycle research.

AB Trees act as ecosystem engineers and invasions by exotic tree species profoundly impact recipient communities. Recently, research on invasive trees has dramatically increased, enabling the assessment of general trends in tree invasion. Analysing 90 studies dealing with 45 invasive tree species, we conducted a quantitative review and a meta-analysis to estimate the relevance of eight leading hypotheses for explaining tree invasions. We also tested whether species functional traits (growth rate, density/cover, germination, biomass and survival) equally promote tree invasiveness. Overall, our results suggest that several hypotheses, linked to invasibility or invasiveness, are pertinent to explain tree invasions. Furthermore, more than one hypothesis has been supported for a given species, which indicates that multiple factors lead to the success of invasive tree species. In addition, growth rate appears to be the most efficient predictor of invasiveness for invasive trees and could thus be used as a means to identify potential alien tree invasions. We conclude that further investigations are needed to test the consistency of some hypotheses across a broader pool of invasive tree species, whilst experimental studies with the same tree species across a larger range of sites would help to reveal the full suite of factors that affect tree invasions.

AB There is increasing evidence for epigenetically mediated transgenerational inheritance across taxa. However, the evolutionary implications of such alternative mechanisms of inheritance remain unclear. Herein, we show that epigenetic mechanisms can serve two fundamentally different functions in transgenerational inheritance: (i) selection-based effects, which carry adaptive information in virtue of selection over many generations of reliable transmission; and (ii) detection-based effects, which are a transgenerational form of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. The two functions interact differently with a third form of epigenetic information transmission, namely information about cell state transmitted for somatic cell heredity in multicellular organisms. Selection-based epigenetic information is more likely to conflict with somatic cell inheritance than is detection-based epigenetic information. Consequently, the evolutionary implications of epigenetic mechanisms are different for unicellular and multicellular organisms, which underscores the conceptual and empirical importance of distinguishing between these two different forms of transgenerational epigenetic effect.

AB Identifying drivers of deforestation in tropical biodiversity hotspots is critical to assess threats to particular ecosystems and species and proactively plan for conservation. We analyzed land cover change between 2002 and 2007 in the northern Andes, Choco, and Amazon forests of Colombia, the largest producer of coca leaf for the global cocaine market, to quantify the impact of this illicit crop on forest dynamics, evaluate the effectiveness of protected areas in this context, and determine the effects of eradication on deforestation. Landscape-level analyses of forest conversion revealed that proximity to new coca plots and a greater proportion of an area planted with coca increased the probability of forest loss in southern Colombia, even after accounting for other covariates and spatial autocorrelation. We also showed that protected areas successfully reduced forest conversion in coca-growing regions. Neither eradication nor coca cultivation predicted deforestation rates across municipalities. Instead, the presence of new coca cultivation was an indicator of municipalities, where increasing population led to higher deforestation rates. We hypothesize that poor rural development underlies the relationship between population density and deforestation in coca-growing areas. Conservation in Colombia's vast forest frontier, which overlaps with its coca frontier, requires a mix of protected areas and strategic rural development to succeed.

TI Planting the Living City Best Practices in Planning Green
   Infrastructure-Results From Major U.S. Cities

AB Problem: Critics have problematized infrastructure for its inability to keep pace with the rising social and ecological impacts of urbanization. Researchers identify urban green infrastructure (GI), including urban forests, as an important strategy for providing public goods and increasing resiliency while reducing ecological footprints and social inequity in metropolitan areas; however, realizing these benefits through planning is still uncertain ground, as most contemporary urban GI endeavors in the United States are small, individual projects rather than integrated, community-wide efforts. This underinvestment has left planners with little experience in developing GI at a metropolitan scale.
   Purpose: We address this deficit in infrastructure planning by studying planning's role in advancing large-scale, urban tree-planting initiatives (TPI) in eight major U. S. cities and one metropolitan county. In this study, we explore stakeholder perspectives on successes and setbacks in TPI planting, stewardship, business, and out-reach plans. From these perspectives, we identify possible best practices that can better inform future efforts to plan GI on a metropolitan scale.
   Methods: From a review of the literature, we identified ideal planning elements researchers and practitioners considered fundamental to well-planned, urban forestry-based GI programs. We interviewed key stakeholders (n = 86) in eight major cities and one metropolitan county (New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Baltimore, Seattle, Denver, Albuquerque, Sacramento, and Salt Lake County), using multiple-choice and open-ended questions to explore their perceptions of TPI successes, failures, and opportunities for improvement. We used this data to compare TPI planning and implementation with ideal urban forestry and GI planning elements, to identify TPI best practices, and to locate TPI program elements such as business and stewardship planning in relation to traditional infrastructure. We discuss these findings in light of opportunities to bring GI into the mainstream of metropolitan infrastructure planning.
   Results and conclusions: We found that cities employed a spectrum of planning strategies to advance TPI, ranging from highly institutionalized, data-driven initiatives to decentralized, grassroots efforts. Participants viewed TPI as bringing GI to the mainstream; however, uncertainties in funding and long-term stewardship belie this perspective. Lacking access to traditional infrastructure financing, several TPI used creative development and contracting strategies to maintain program funding and momentum, while others stagnated. Additionally, programs lost momentum when mayors who launched TPI were not reelected. Successful underfunded initiatives focused on community-level engagement. However, institutionalized, diverse funding structures and robust, agency-level commitment to maintaining and expanding urban forests were considered most effective in advancing urban forestry-based GI. Overall geographic distribution of TPI, and the relatively sophisticated financial and institutional approaches achieved by New York and Seattle, provide insight into possible national strategies to advance metropolitan-scale GI. Similarly, Los Angeles's and Baltimore's use of focused corporate sponsorship and community engagement to advance underfunded programs could inform international GI efforts.
   Takeaway for practice: Through large-scale TPI, planners are beginning to engage in planning metropolitan-scale GI as a conscious strategy to address urban ecological issues and deliver public goods. Initiatives benefit from being launched early in an administration's term. Further, detailed, data-driven planting plans, combined with diversified funding sources and the institutionalization of tree-acquisition in the capital budget, can enable TPI to establish a) long-term contracts, b) control over supply chains, and c) stability in recessionary times. Contracting with grassroots and advocacy organizations to perform education and fieldwork can provide means for underfunded programs to maintain momentum toward meeting TPI goals; however, accessing traditional infrastructure financing mechanisms and institutionalizing stewardship plans are fundamental to long-term expansion and maintenance of investments in metropolitan GI.

AB Sperm competition is expected to favour the evolution of traits that influence the performance of sperm when they compete to fertilize a female's eggs. While there is considerable evidence that selection favours increases in sperm numbers, much less is known about how sperm quality contributes towards competitive fertilization success. Here, we determine whether variation in sperm quality influences competitive fertilization success in the green swordtail Xiphophorus helleri, a highly promiscuous livebearing fish. We use artificial insemination as a method of controlled sperm delivery and show that sperm swimming velocity is the primary determinant of fertilization success when ejaculates from two males compete to fertilize a female's eggs. By contrast, we found no evidence that sperm length had any effect on siring success. We also found no evidence that pre- and postcopulatory sexual traits were phenotypically integrated in this species, suggesting that the previous observation that reproductive skew favours males with high mating rates is unlikely to be due to any direct association between sperm quality and male sexual ornamentation.

AB In this paper, a multiobjective genetic fuzzy system (GFS) to learn the granularities of fuzzy partitions, tuning the membership functions (MFs), and learning the fuzzy rules is presented. It uses dynamic constraints, which enable three-parameter MF tuning to improve the accuracy while guaranteeing the transparency of fuzzy partitions. The fuzzy models (FMs) are initialized by a method that combines the benefits of Wang-Mendel (WM) and decision-tree algorithms. Thus, the initial FMs have less rules, rule conditions, and input variables than if WM initialization were to be used. Moreover, the fuzzy partitions of initial FMs are always transparent. Our approach is tested against recent multiobjective and monoobjective GFSs on six benchmark problems. It is concluded that the accuracy and interpretability of our FMs are always comparable or better than those in the comparative studies. Furthermore, on some benchmark problems, our approach clearly outperforms some comparative approaches. Suitability of our approach for higher dimensional problems is shown by studying three benchmark problems that have up to 21 input variables.

AB The response of the antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD; EC 1.15.1.1) and peroxidase (POD; EC 1.11.1.7), to Aluminum (Al) stress was studied in roots of two inbred lines of maize (Zea mays L.) differing in their tolerance to Al. In addition, the production of malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured to evaluate the level of lipid peroxidation as well as the accumulation of proline (Pro) and carbohydrates under 72 h Al stress. Roots of Al (0, 120, 240, 360 and 480 mu M, at pH 4.2) -treated plants were sampled at various times (12, 24, 48, 72 h) after commencement of stress. A major difference in the antioxidant enzymes between the two maize lines associated with Al tolerance was observed after 24 In of Al exposure. A gradual increase in the membrane lipid peroxidation in Al-stressed root of the susceptible maize line was accompanied by decreased activities of the antioxidant enzymes SOD and POD. In contrast, increased activities of the SOD and POD were found in Al-treated roots of the tolerant maize line, in which the level of membrane lipid peroxidation remained almost unchanged. After 72 h exposure to 480 mu M Al the accumulation of Al in roots was almost from 90 times (tolerant) to 140 times (sensitive) than the control (without Al), while at the same time Al treatment resulted in 2.2 to 2.5-fold (at 240, 360 and 480 mu M Al) increased Pro content in the roots of the tolerant line compared to 0 mu M Al. Yet, 72 h exposure to 480 mu M Al increased 1.7-fold the carbohydrate concentration in the roots of the Al tolerant maize line VA-22 while in the sensitive line A(4/67) remained almost unchanged. These data provide evidence of an internal mechanism of tolerance that increase the antioxidant system activity in order to limit cellular damages and possibly linked to the Al tolerance of the maize line VA-22. Analyses of the 12, 24, 48, and 72 h POD and SOD isoforms showed that in the Al-tolerant maize plants the anionic POD isoforms A(1), A(3) and A(4) and the SOD isoforms SOD1 and SOD2 were induced by increased Al-stress. It seemed that in the Al tolerant maize line, the anionic POD isoforms A(1), A(3) and A(4) and the SOD isoforms SOD1 and SOD2 were required for adaptation as the oxidant level increased by the increased Al stress. Our results suggest that Al toxicity may be mediated by oxidative stress and that the better protection of the Al tolerant maize roots from Al-induced oxidative damage results, at least partially, from the increased activity of their antioxidative system.

AB There is a lack in representation of biosphere atmosphere interactions in current climate models. To fill this gap, one may introduce vegetation dynamics in surface transfer schemes or couple global climate models (GCMs) with vegetation dynamics models. As these vegetation dynamics models were not designed to be included in GCMs, how are the latest generation dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) suitable for use in global climate studies? This paper reviews the latest developments in DGVM modelling as well as the development of DGVM-GCM coupling in the framework of global climate studies. Limitations of DGVM and coupling are shown and the challenges of these methods are highlighted. During the last decade, DGVMs underwent major changes in the representation of physical and biogeochemical mechanisms such as photosynthesis and respiration processes as well as in the representation of regional properties of vegetation. However, several limitations such as carbon and nitrogen cycles, competition, land-use and land-use changes, and disturbances have been identified. In addition, recent advances in model coupling techniques allow the simulation of the vegetation atmosphere interactions in GCMs with the help of DGVMs. Though DGVMs represent a good alternative to investigate vegetation atmosphere interactions at a large scale, some weaknesses in evaluation methodology and model design need to be further investigated to improve the results.

AB Mercury is a ubiquitous contaminant in aquatic ecosystems, posing a significant health risk to humans and wildlife that eat fish. Mercury accumulates in aquatic food webs as methylmercury (MeHg), a particularly toxic and persistent organic mercury compound. While mercury in the environment originates largely from anthropogenic activities, MeHg accumulation in freshwater aquatic food webs is not a simple function of local or regional mercury pollution inputs. Studies show that even sites with similar mercury inputs can produce fish with mercury concentrations ranging over an order of magnitude. While much of the foundational work to identify the drivers of variation in mercury accumulation has focused on freshwater lakes, mercury contamination in stream ecosystems is emerging as an important research area. Here, we review recent research on mercury accumulation in stream-dwelling organisms. Taking a hierarchical approach, we identify a suite of characteristics of individual consumers, food webs, streams, watersheds, and regions that are consistently associated with elevated MeHg concentrations in stream fish. We delineate a conceptual, mechanistic basis for explaining the ecological processes that underlie this vulnerability to MeHg. Key factors, including suppressed individual growth of consumers, low rates of primary and secondary production, hydrologic connection to methylation sites (e.g., wetlands), heavily forested catchments, and acidification are frequently associated with increased MeHg concentrations in fish across both streams and lakes. Hence, we propose that these interacting factors define a syndrome of characteristics that drive high MeHg production and bioaccumulation rates across these freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Finally, based on an understanding of the ecological drivers of MeHg accumulation, we identify situations when anthropogenic effects and management practices could significantly exacerbate or ameliorate MeHg accumulation in stream fish.

AB Recent developments in ecological statistics have reached behavioral ecology, and an increasing number of studies now apply analytical tools that incorporate alternatives to the conventional null hypothesis testing based on significance levels. However, these approaches continue to receive mixed support in our field. Because our statistical choices can influence research design and the interpretation of data, there is a compelling case for reaching consensus on statistical philosophy and practice. Here, we provide a brief overview of the recently proposed approaches and open an online forum for future discussion (https://bestat.ecoinformatics.org). From the perspective of practicing behavioral ecologists relying on either correlative or experimental data, we review the most relevant features of information theoretic approaches, Bayesian inference, and effect size statistics. We also discuss concerns about data quality, missing data, and repeatability. We emphasize the necessity of moving away from a heavy reliance on statistical significance while focusing attention on biological relevance and effect sizes, with the recognition that uncertainty is an inherent feature of biological data. Furthermore, we point to the importance of integrating previous knowledge in the current analysis, for which novel approaches offer a variety of tools. We note, however, that the drawbacks and benefits of these approaches have yet to be carefully examined in association with behavioral data. Therefore, we encourage a philosophical change in the interpretation of statistical outcomes, whereas we still retain a pluralistic perspective for making objective statistical choices given the uncertainties around different approaches in behavioral ecology. We provide recommendations on how these concepts could be made apparent in the presentation of statistical outputs in scientific papers.

AB Interspecific gene flow via hybridization may play a major role in evolution by creating reticulate rather than hierarchical lineages in plant species. Occasional diploid pine hybrids indicate the potential for introgression, but reticulation is hard to detect because ancestral polymorphism is still shared across many groups of pine species. Nucleotide sequences for 53 accessions from 17 species in subsection Ponderosae (Pinus) provide evidence for reticulate evolution. Two discordant patterns among independent low-copy nuclear gene trees and a chloroplast haplotype are better explained by introgression than incomplete lineage sorting or other causes of incongruence. Conflicting resolution of three monophyletic Pinus coulteri accessions is best explained by ancient introgression followed by a genetic bottleneck. More recent hybridization transferred a chloroplast from P. jeffreyi to a sympatric P. washoensis individual. We conclude that incomplete lineage sorting could account for other examples of non-monophyly, and caution against any analysis based on single-accession or single-locus sampling in Pinus.

AB Revegetation plantings have been established to ameliorate the negative effects of clearing remnant vegetation and to provide new habitat for fauna. We assessed the vegetation development of revegetation established on agricultural land in Gippsland, southeastern Australia. We compared (1) woodlot plantings (overstory eucalypts only) and (2) ecological plantings (many species of local trees, shrubs, and understory) with remnants and paddocks for development of vegetation structural complexity and colonizing plant species. We also assessed structural complexity and plant species composition in response to several site parameters. Structural complexity increased with age of planting, toward that of remnants, even when very few species were planted at establishment. Richness of all plants and native plants, however, did not increase with age. Native ground cover plants were not included at establishment in either planting type, and their richness also did not increase with age of planting. This indicated that colonization did not occur through time, which does not support the "foster ecosystem hypothesis.'' Weed species richness was unrelated to native plant richness, which does not support the "diversity-resistance hypothesis.'' Weed cover increased with age of planting in woodlot plantings but decreased with age in ecological plantings. Richness of all plants and native plants in plantings did not increase with planting size or with the presence of old remnant trees and was greater in gullies and where vegetation cover in the landscape was greater. Structural complexity was unaffected by planting size but was positively correlated with floristic richness. Ecological plantings had higher condition scores, greater shrub cover, more plant life-forms and fewer weeds than woodlot plantings indicating a possible greater benefit as habitat for wildlife. We conclude that ecological plantings can achieve similar overall structural complexity as remnant vegetation within 30-40 years but will not gain a native ground layer and will not necessarily contain some important structural features by this age. Ecological plantings may provide habitat for the conservation of fauna (through the development of structural complexity), but they may not provide for the conservation of non-planted. ora (given the absence of re-colonizing smaller life-forms).

AB The idea that productivity regulates species diversity is deeply ingrained in the field of ecology. Yet, over the past few decades, an increasing number of experiments have shown that species diversity controls, rather than simply responds to, biomass production. These contrasting perspectives have led to a seeming paradox: Is diversity the cause or the consequence of biological production? Here we present empirical evidence for the multivariate productivity-diversity (MPD) hypothesis, which argues that differing perspectives on productivity-diversity relationships can be resolved by recognizing that historical research has focused on how resource supply regulates both the productivity and richness of local competitors, whereas more recent studies have focused on how the richness of a colonist pool regulates the efficiency by which resources are captured and converted into new tissue. The MPD hypothesis predicts that three pathways operate concurrently to generate productivity-diversity relationships in nature: (1) resource supply directly limits the standing biomass and/or rate of new production by primary producers, (2) producer biomass is directly influenced by the richness of species that locally compete for resources, and (3) resource supply rate indirectly affects producer biomass by influencing the fraction of species from a colonist pool that locally coexist. To examine whether this set of pathways explains covariation between productivity and diversity in natural streams, we used nutrient-diffusing agar "patches'' to manipulate resource supply rates in 20 streams throughout the Sierra Nevada mountain range, California, USA. We then measured the fraction of periphyton species from the stream colonist pool co-occurring on each nutrient patch, as well as the standing biomass and rates of primary production. Natural patterns of covariation agreed with predictions of the MPD hypothesis. Algal biomass was an increasing function of nutrient supply, and an increasing function of local richness. The fraction of species from the colonist pool found co-occurring on a patch was a concave-down function of nutrient supply, causing nutrients to indirectly affect biomass via control over local richness. These results suggest that the MPD hypothesis is a viable explanation of patterns of diversity and productivity in natural stream ecosystems, and that it has potential to merge the historical view that productivity drives diversity with a parallel view that diversity drives productivity.

AB Reproductive investment decisions form an integral part of life-history biology. Selection frequently favours plasticity in investment that can generate maternal effects on offspring development. For example, if females differentially allocate resources based on mate attractiveness or quality, this can create a non-genetic link between mate attractiveness and offspring fitness with potential consequences for ecological and evolutionary dynamics. It is therefore important to understand under what conditions differential investment into offspring in relation to male quality is expected to occur and the direction of the effect. Two opposite predictions, increased investment into offspring produced with high-quality mates ( differential allocation (DA)) and increased investment with low-quality males ( reproductive compensation ( RC)) have been suggested but no formal theoretical treatment justifying the assumptions underlying these two hypotheses has been conducted to date. Here, we used a state-based approach to investigate the circumstances under which the variation in mate quality results in differential female investment into offspring and how this interacts with female energetic resource levels. We found that a pattern of increased investment when mating with high-quality mates (i.e. DA) was the most common optimal investment strategy for females in our model. By contrast, increased investment when mating with low-quality mates (i.e. RC) was predicted only when the relative impact of parental investment on offspring quality was low. Finally, we found that the specific pattern of investment in relation to male quality depends on female energetic state, the likelihood for future mating opportunities and the expected future distribution of mate quality. Thus, the female's age and body condition should be important factors mediating DA and RC, which may help to explain the equivocal results of empirical studies.

AB Afforestation often causes direct habitat losses for farmland birds of conservation concern, but it is uncertain whether negative effects also extend significantly into adjacent open land. Information is thus required on how these species react to wooded edges, and how their responses are affected by edge and landscape characteristics. These issues were examined in Mediterranean arable farmland, using bird counts at 0, 100, 200, 300 and >300 m from oak, pine and eucalyptus edges, embedded in landscapes with variable amounts and spatial configurations of forest plantations. Bird diversity declined away from edges, including that of woodland, farmland and ground-nesting birds. Positive edge responses were also found for overall and woodland bird abundances, and for five of the nine most widespread and abundant species (Galerida larks, stonechat, linnet, goldfinch and corn bunting). Strong negative edge effects were only recorded for steppe birds, with reduced abundances near edges of Calandra larks and short-toed larks, but not of little bustards and tawny pipits. Edge contrast affected the magnitude of edge effects, with a tendency for stronger responses to old and tall eucalyptus plantations (hard edges) than to young and short oak plantations (soft edges). There were also species-specific interactions between edge and fragmentation effects, with positive edge responses tending to be strongest in less fragmented landscapes, whereas steppe birds tended to increase faster away from edges and to reach the highest species richness and abundances in large arable patches. Results suggest that forest plantations may increase overall bird diversity and abundance in adjacent farmland, at the expenses of steppe birds of conservation concern. Clustering forest plantations in a few large patches and thus reducing the density of wooded edges at the landscape-scale might reduce such negative impacts. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ecological communities are structured in part by evolutionary interactions among their members. A number of recent studies incorporating phylogenetics into community ecology have upheld the paradigm that competition drives ecological divergence among species of the same guild. However, the role of other interspecific interactions, in particular positive interactions such as mutualism, remains poorly explored. We characterized the ecological niche and inferred phylogenetic relationships among members of a diverse community of neotropical Mullerian mimetic butterflies. Mullerian mimicry is one of the best studied examples of mutualism, in which unpalatable species converge in wing pattern locally to advertize their toxicity to predators. We provide evidence that mutualistic interactions can drive convergence along multiple ecological axes, outweighing both phylogeny and competition in shaping community structure. Our findings imply that ecological communities are adaptively assembled to a much greater degree than commonly suspected. In addition, our results show that phenotype and ecology are strongly linked and support the idea that mimicry can cause ecological speciation through multiple cascading effects on species' biology.

AB To test whether the altitudinal distribution of trees is determined by a carbon shortage or an insufficient sugar fraction (sugar:starch ratio) in treeline trees, we studied the status of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) and their components (total soluble sugars and starch) in Abies fabri (Mast.) Craib and Picea balfouriana var. hirtella Rehd. et Wils. trees along three elevational gradients, ranging from lower elevations to the alpine treeline, oil the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. For comparison, we investigated a low-altitude species (Tsuga, yunnanensis (Franch.) Pritz.) which served as a warm-climate reference because it is distributed in closed montane forests below 3100 m a.s.l. in the Study area. The carbon status of T.yunnanensis responded to altitude differently from that of the treeline species. At the species level, total NSC was not consistently more abundant in treeline trees than in trees of the same species growing at lower elevations. Thus there was no consistent evidence for carbon limitation of growth in treeline trees. For the three treeline species Studied (P. balfouriana and A. fabri in Kang-Ding Valley and A. fabri in the Mo-Xi Valley), winter NSC concentrations in treeline trees were significantly lower than in lower-elevation trees of the same species, suggesting that, in winter, carbon is limited in treeline trees. However, in no case was there total overwinter depletion of NSC or its components in treeline trees. Treeline and low-altitude species had similar sugar:starch ratios of about three at their upper-elevational limits in April. We conclude that survival and growth of trees at the elevational or latitudinal climate limit depend not only oil NSC concentration in perennial tissues, but also oil the maintenance of an over-wintering sugar:starch ratio greater than three.

AB The classic evidence for vocal production learning involves imitation of novel. often anthropogenic sounds. Among mammals, this has been reported for dolphins, elephants, harbor seals, and humans. A broader taxonomic distribution has been reported for vocal convergence, where the acoustic properties of calls from different individuals converge when they are housed together in captivity or form social bonds in the wild. Vocal convergence has been demonstrated for animals as diverse as songbirds, parakeets. hummingbirds, bats, elephants. cetaceans, and primates. For most species, call convergence is thought to reflect a group-distinctive identifier, with shared calls reflecting and strengthening social bonds. A ubiquitous function for vocal production learning that is starting to receive attention involves modifying signals to improve communication in a noisy channel. Pooling data on vocal imitation, vocal convergence, and compensation for noise suggests a wider taxonomic distribution of vocal production learning among mammals than has been generally appreciated. The wide taxonomic distribution of this evidence for vocal production learning suggests that perhaps more of the neural underpinnings for vocal production learning are in place in mammals than is usually recognized.

AB We explored predictive models relating body condition and age to nesting propensity, timing of nest initiation, clutch size of first nests, aggregated nest survival, hatching success, and timing of hatch in Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Nesting propensity had a positive linear relationship with body condition, and second-year (SY) females had a lower probability of nesting than after-second-year (ASY) females (84% and 94%, respectively, at average body condition). Females in better body condition initiated nesting similar to 15 days earlier than those in poor condition, and SY females nested similar to 4 days later than ASY females at average body condition. Clutch size of first nests exhibited a curvilinear decline with body condition, such that large clutches were characteristic of females in the best condition that nested early. Nest Survival and hatching probability were unaffected by body condition. Younger females had somewhat lower nest survival (11%) than older females (14%), which, in combination with renesting effort, resulted in an age difference in hatching probability (22% and 33%, respectively). Females in better condition hatched nests similar to 15 days earlier than those in poor condition, and SY females hatched nests similar to 4 days later, on average, than ASY females. Our results indicate that factors influencing the body condition of female Mallards arriving on breeding areas could influence subsequent reproductive investment and success. Condition effects are primarily through the mechanisms of nesting propensity, clutch size, and timing of nest initiation and hatch. Additionally, we provide evidence that Mallards in their first breeding season have lower reproductive potential than older females.

AB Plant population modelling has been around since the 1970s, providing a valuable approach to understanding plant ecology from a mechanistic standpoint. It is surprising then that this area of research has not grown in prominence with respect to other approaches employed in modelling plant systems. In this review, we provide an analysis of the development and role of modelling in the field of plant population biology through an exploration of where it has been, where it is now and, in our opinion, where it should be headed. We focus, in particular, on the role plant population modelling could play in ecological forecasting, an urgent need given current rates of regional and global environmental change. We suggest that a critical element limiting the current application of plant population modelling in environmental research is the trade-off between the necessary resolution and detail required to accurately characterize ecological dynamics pitted against the goal of generality, particularly at broad spatial scales. In addition to suggestions how to overcome the current shortcoming of data on the process-level we discuss two emerging strategies that may offer a way to overcome the described limitation: (1) application of a modern approach to spatial scaling from local processes to broader levels of interaction and (2) plant functional-type modelling. Finally we outline what we believe to be needed in developing these approaches towards a 'science of forecasting'. (c) 2007 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB The numerous physiological and phenotypic differences between the sexes, as well as the disparity between male and female reproductive interests, result in sexual conflicts, which are often manifested at the genomic level. Sexually antagonistic genes benefit one sex at the expense of the other and experience strong pressure to evolve male- and female-specific expression patterns to resolve sexual conflicts and maximize fitness for both sexes. Sex-biased gene expression has recently been demonstrated for much of the metazoan transcriptome, suggesting that many loci are sexually antagonistic. However, many coding regions function in multiple processes throughout the organism. This pleiotropy increases the complexity of selection for any given gene, which in turn may obscure sex-specific selective pressures and hamper the evolution of sex-biased gene expression. Here we use microarray gene expression data, in conjunction with data on transcript abundance from expressed sequence tag libraries, to demonstrate that loci with sex-biased gene expression are significantly less pleiotropic than unbiased genes. This relationship was independent of sex chromosome gene dosage effects, and the results were concordant across two study organisms, chicken and mouse. These results suggest that the resolution of sexually antagonistic gene expression is determined by the evolutionary constraints acting on any given antagonistic locus.

AB The pattern of species abundances is central to ecology. But direct measurements of species abundances at ecologically relevant scales are typically unfeasible. This limitation has motivated a long-standing interest in the relationship between the abundance distribution in a large, regional community and the distribution observed in a small sample from the community. Here, we develop a statistical sampling theory to describe how observed patterns of species abundances are influenced by the spatial distributions of populations. For a wide range of regional-scale abundance distributions we derive exact expressions for the sampled abundance distributions, as a function of sample size and the degree of conspecific spatial aggregation. We show that if populations are randomly distributed in space then the sampled and regional-scale species-abundance distribution typically have the same functional form: sampling can be expressed by a simple scaling relationship. In the case of aggregated spatial distributions, however, the shape of a sampled species-abundance distribution diverges from the regional-scale distribution. Conspecific aggregation results in sampled distributions that are skewed towards both rare and common species. We discuss our findings in light of recent results from neutral community theory, and in the context of estimating biodiversity.

AB In interspecific hybrids, novel phenotypes often emerge from the interaction of two divergent genomes. Interactions between the two transcriptional networks are assumed to contribute to these unpredicted new phenotypes by inducing novel patterns of gene expression. Here we provide a review of the recent literature on the accumulation of regulatory incompatibilities. We review specific examples of regulatory incompatibilities reported at particular loci as well as genome- scale surveys of gene expression in interspecific hybrids. Finally, we consider and preview novel technologies that could help decipher how divergent transcriptional networks interact in hybrids between species.

AB We investigate using relative amounts of prey DNA recovered from pinniped faeces to obtain diet composition data. Faeces were obtained from captive sea lions being fed a diet containing three fish species (50%, 36% and 14% by mass). Real-time PCR was used to quantify mtDNA in undigested tissue and in the faecal samples. The percent composition of fish mtDNA extracted from tissue corresponded reasonably well to the mass of fish in the mixture. In faecal samples the absolute amount of fish mtDNA recovered varied 100-fold, but the percent composition of the samples was relatively consistent (57.5 +/- 9.3%, 19.3 +/- 6.6% and 23.2 +/- 12.2%). These results indicate there are prey-specific biases in DNA survival during digestion. However, the biases may be less than those commonly observed in conventional diet studies.

AB Background. Sperm design varies enormously across species and sperm competition is thought to be a major factor influencing this variation. However, the functional significance of many sperm traits is still poorly understood. The sperm of most murid rodents are characterised by an apical hook of the sperm head that varies markedly in extent across species. In the European woodmouse Apodemus sylvaticus(Muridae), the highly reflected apical hook of sperm is used to form sperm groups, or "trains,'' which exhibited increased swimming velocity and thrusting force compared to individual sperm. Methodology/Principal Findings. Here we use a comparative study of murine rodent sperm and demonstrate that the apical hook and sperm cooperation are likely to be general adaptations to sperm competition in rodents. We found that species with relatively larger testes, and therefore more intense sperm competition, have a longer, more reflected apical sperm hook. In addition, we show that sperm groups also occur in rodents other than the European woodmouse. Conclusions. Our results suggest that in rodents sperm cooperation is more widespread than assumed so far and highlight the importance of diploid versus haploid selection in the evolution of sperm design and function.

AB Global biodiversity decline has prompted great interest in the effects of habitat modi. cation and diversity on the functioning and stability of ecosystem processes. However, the applicability of previous modeled or mesocosm community studies to real diverse communities in different habitats remains ambiguous.
   We exposed standardized nesting resources for naturally occurring communities of cavity-nesting bees and wasps and their parasitoids in coastal Ecuador, to test the effects of host and parasitoid diversity on an ecosystem function ( parasitism rates) and temporal variability in this function. In accordance with predictions of complementary host use, parasitism rates increased with increasing diversity, not simply abundance, of parasitoids. In contrast, parasitism decreased with increasing host diversity, possibly due to positive prey interactions or increased probability of selecting unpalatable species. Temporal variability in parasitism was lower in plots with high mean parasitoid diversity and higher in plots with temporally variable host and parasitoid diversity. These effects of diversity on parasitism and temporal stability in parasitism rates were sufficiently strong to be visible across five different habitat types, representing a gradient of increasing anthropogenic modi. cation. Habitat type did not directly affect parasitism rates, but host and parasitoid diversity and abundance were higher in highly modified habitats, and parasitoid diversity was positively correlated with rates of parasitism. The slope of the richness - parasitism relationship did not vary significantly across habitats, although that for Simpson's diversity was significant only in rice and pasture. We also show that pooling data over long time periods, as in previous studies, can blur the effect of diversity on parasitism rates, and the appropriate spatiotemporal scale of study must be considered.

AB 1 Metabolic scaling theory predicts that the rate of resource use per unit area is independent of the average mass per individual and that the slope of the log mass-log density relationship should be -4/3.
   2 Data were obtained from plant communities along a natural gradient of moisture and latitude in north-west China to test the generality of this theory.
   3 The allometric exponents (slopes of the log mass-log density relationship) for above-ground biomass decreased with natural moisture levels and plant cover, deviating from the predictions of the energy equivalence theory. Allometric exponents for below-ground and total biomass were similar among the three sites and were much closer to the predicted value of -4/3.
   4 Metabolic scaling theory may be applicable under many growth conditions, but not when restricted to above-ground biomass under drought stress. The rate of supply of the limiting resource per unit area determines which plant parts behave according to theory.

AB Unionid mussels often occur as multispecies aggregates called mussel beds and in dense patches within the mussel beds themselves. Thus, their distributions are patchy at 2 spatial scales. We examined the association between mussel assemblage structure and macroinvertebrate assemblage structure at these 2 spatial scales in rivers of the Ouachita Highlands, Arkansas and Oklahoma, USA. We used multivariate variation partitioning techniques to relate variation in benthic macroinvertebrate distribution and abundance to variation in mussel assemblages, environmental variables, spatial variables, and overlapping or shared variation between these components. At the patch scale, total densities of macroinvertebrates and dominant groups (Oligochaeta, Chironomidae, Ephemeroptera, and Trichoptera) were significantly higher in patches containing mussels than where mussels were absent, and densities of macroinvertebrates were positively correlated with unionid density. In variation partitioning analyses, mussel assemblages explained almost 1/2 of the variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages at both spatial scales, even after removing effects of similar habitat (environmental variables) and biogeographic history (spatial variables).

AB Recent progress in protistology has shown that these organisms (protists) are far more diverse than traditionally assumed by soil ecologists. Most studies have grouped these into motility groups, as amoebae, flagellates, and ciliates. Unfortunately, these do not represent functionally useful groups and do not have any ecological relevance to food web processes and community structure. Typically, abundance values have relied on the most probable number estimate based on bacterivore cultures. In fact, there are many functional groups of protists besides the bacterivores. These other functional groups are very much part of the forest soil decomposition food web, but they remain unaccounted for in models. Modelling studies have shown repeatedly that protozoan bacterivores are responsible for much of the nutrient turnover and flux through the soil food,web, as they are in the aquatic microbial loop. The contribution of other protist functional groups to this nutrient cycling remains to be quantified. To this end, new sampling strategies are required, and functional diversity needs to be considered in future studies. We consider both temporal and spatial stratification as contributing factors, to explain the apparent redundancy of function. Finally, drawing on data from agricultural fields, we consider new ideas on rates of recovery after disturbance.

AB Ecologists routinely use Bonferroni-based methods to control the alpha inflation associated with multiple hypothesis testing, despite the aggravating loss of power incurred. Some critics call for abandonment of this approach of controlling the familywise error rate (FWER), contending that too many unwary researchers have adopted it in the name of scientific rigour even though it often does more harm than good. We do not recommend rejecting multiplicity correction altogether. Instead, we recommend using an alternative approach. In particular, we advocate the Benjamini-Hochberg and related methods for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Unlike the FWER approach, which safeguards against falsely rejecting even a single null hypothesis, the FDR approach controls the rate at which null hypotheses are falsely rejected (i.e., false discoveries are made). The FDR approach represents a compromise between outright refusal to control for multiplicity, which maximizes alpha inflation, and strict adherence to FWER control, which minimizes power. We review the multiplicity problem, illustrate the advantage of the FDR approach, and promote this approach for widespread adoption in ecology.

   PATTERNS
AB Different mechanisms, including equilibrium and non-equilibrium processes, have been taken into account as possible theoretical explanations of species coexistence. Despite the ample evidence on the existence of negative plant-soil feedback in both agriculture and natural vegetation, the role of these processes in the organization and dynamics of plant communities has so far been neglected. In this study, simulations by an individual-based competition model show how the intensity of negative feedback on individual plant performance can produce faster successional dynamics and allow species coexistence in two- and multi-species systems. The results show that even low levels of negative plant-soil feedback can enable species coexistence and often produce cyclic population dynamics. Moreover, the model highlights how negative feedback can generate positive reciprocal interspecific interactions at the population level, despite the fact that only competitive interactions is present between individual plants. In fact, competitive effects occur on a short-term scale, but positive reciprocal species interactions emerge only if negative feedback affects all species and if longer periods of simulation, more than the species life span, are considered. An important outcome of the model is the evidence that the effects at population level are timescale-dependent, thus showing the limitation of short-term species removal experiments used in traditional competition studies.

AB South Africa's Mediterranean-climate fynbos shrubland is a hot spot of species diversity, but its diversity patterns contrast strongly with other high-diversity areas, including the Amazon rain forest. With its extremely high levels of endemism and species turnover, fynbos is made up of dissimilar local communities that are species-rich but relatively poor in rare species. Using neutral ecological theory, we show that the relative species-abundance distributions in fynbos can be explained by migration rates that are two orders of magnitude lower than they are in tropical rain forests. Speciation rates, which are indexed by the "biodiversity parameter" Theta, are estimated to be higher than they are in any previously examined plant system.

AB Characterizing host and parasite population genetic structure and estimating gene flow among populations is essential for understanding coevolutionary interactions between hosts and parasites. We examined the population genetic structure of the trematode Schistosoma mansoni and its two host species (the definitive host Rattus rattus and the intermediate host Biomphalaria glabrata) using microsatellite markers. Parasites were sampled from rats. The study was conducted in five sites of the Guadeloupe Island, Lesser Antilles. Mollusks display a pattern of isolation by distance whereas such a pattern is not found neither in schistosomes nor in rats. The comparison of the distribution of genetic variability in S. mansoni and its two host species strongly suggests that migration of parasites is principally determined by that of the vertebrate host in the marshy focus of Guadeloupe. However, the comparison between genetic differentiation values in schistosomes and rats suggests that the efficacy of the schistosome rat-mediated dispersal between transmission sites is lower than expected given the prevalence, parasitic load and migration rate of rats among sites. This could notably suggest that rat migration rate could be negatively correlated to the age or the infection status of individuals. Models made about the evolution of local adaptation in function of the dispersal rates of hosts and parasites suggest that rats and mollusks should be locally adapted to their parasites.

AB Biodiversity has become a central concept in agronomical research since the Rio de Janeiro summit in 1992. Agricultural areas include a unique biological diversity which is the basis of human activities. Conservation of this biodiversity in agricultural and protected areas is therefore fundamental and requires an operational approach. Biodiversity is a complex entity which can be spread over several levels (genes, species, ecosystems and ecological processes) and can be related to three main functions: (i) patrimonial functions, (ii) agronomical functions and (iii) ecological functions. The patrimonial function concerns conservation of the landscape aesthetic and threatened species. The biodiversity function according to relationships with agricultural activities describes resistance to biotic and abiotic stress, and the production of cultivated ecosystems. Biodiversity is also involved in ecological functioning through the existence of special habitats with particular species. The relevance of assessment tools is required in order to understand and evaluate the impact of farm practices on the different compartments of biodiversity on the patch scale to the landscape scale. Different methods, such as direct measurements with biodiversity indexes, biotic indicators and models are described and their suitability and limits are discussed.

AB Numerous studies have shown how interactions between nonindigenous species (NIS) can accelerate the rate at which they establish and spread in invaded habitats, leading to an "invasional meltdown." We investigated facilitation at an earlier stage in the invasion process: during entrainment of propagules in a transport pathway. The introduced bryozoan Watersipora subtorquata is tolerant of several antifouling biocides and a common component of hull-fouling assemblages, a major transport pathway for aquatic NIS. We predicted that colonies of W. subtorquata act as nontoxic refugia for other, less tolerant species to settle on. We compared rates of recruitment of W. subtorquata and other fouling organisms to surfaces coated with three antifouling paints and a nontoxic primer in coastal marinas in Queensland, Australia. Diversity and abundance of fouling taxa were compared between bryozoan colonies and adjacent toxic or nontoxic paint surfaces. After 16 weeks immersion, W. subtorquata covered up to 64% of the tile surfaces coated in antifouling paint. Twenty-two taxa occurred exclusively on W. subtorquata and were not found on toxic surfaces. Other fouling taxa present on toxic surfaces were up to 248 times more abundant on W. subtorquata. Because biocides leach from the paint surface, we expected a positive relationship between the size of W. subtorquata colonies and the abundance and diversity of epibionts. To test this, we compared recruitment of fouling organisms to mimic W. subtorquata colonies of three different sizes that had the same total surface area. Secondary recruitment to mimic colonies was greater when the surrounding paint surface contained biocides. Contrary to our predictions, epibionts were most abundant on small mimic colonies with a large total perimeter. This pattern was observed in encrusting and erect bryozoans, tubiculous amphipods, and serpulid and sabellid polychaetes, but only in the presence of toxic paint. Our results show that W. subtorquata acts as a foundation species for fouling assemblages on ship hulls and facilitates the transport of other species at greater abundance and frequency than would otherwise be possible. Invasion success may be increased by positive interactions between NIS that enhance the delivery of propagules by human transport vectors.

AB 1. Interspecific variation in leaf life span of woody plants should have important consequences for ontogenetic variation in biomass distribution, and hence carbon balance, in low light. This proposal was examined by measuring foliage turnover, growth, biomass allocation and biomass distribution of juveniles (25-1180 mm tall) of four evergreens differing in shade tolerance, growing in low light (2-5% canopy openness) in temperate rainforest understoreys in south-central Chile.
   2. As predicted, ontogenetic trends in leaf area ratio (LAR) of two very shade-tolerant species with long-lived leaves (Aextoxicon punctatum and Myrceugenia planipes) contrasted strongly with those of mid-tolerant Eucryphia cordifolia and intolerant Aristotelia chilensis. Low-light LAR fell rapidly with increasing plant size in Eucryphia and Aristotelia, but was size-invariant in the two shade-tolerant taxa. As a result, although small seedlings of Eucryphia and Aristotelia displayed more leaf area than shade-tolerant seedlings of similar size (largely because of differences in specific leaf area), this relationship was reversed for plants over approximate to500 mm tall.
   3. Although the slower foliage turnover of the shade-tolerant species at least partly explains this reversal, allocational differences may also be involved. Root mass fraction of both shade-tolerant species was significantly negatively correlated with size, possibly reflecting declining allocation to roots in larger plants. In contrast, root mass fraction was not correlated with size in Eucryphia or Aristotelia.
   4. Above-ground relative growth rate in low light followed similar ontogenetic trends to LAR, declining more quickly in light-demanding species than in shade-tolerant associates. As a result, large seedlings (>400 mm tall) of shade-tolerant Myrceugenia and Aextoxicon grew more quickly than their light-demanding associates at the same height. The steeply declining LAR and growth of Eucryphia and Aristotelia suggest that these taxa will eventually die of energy starvation in low light.
   5. Results are consistent with the idea that accumulation of an extensive leaf area eventually gives juvenile shade-tolerant evergreens a net carbon gain advantage over their light-demanding associates in low light. Awareness of long-term ontogenetic trends will enhance understanding of relationships of shade-tolerance variation with morphology and growth of woody evergreens.

AB Diagnostic tests for organic production of crops would be useful. In this study, the difference in natural N-15 abundances (delta(15)N) of soils and plants between fertilizer-applied upland (FU) and compost-applied upland (CU) fields was investigated to study using delta(15)N as a marker of organic produce. Twenty samples each of soils and plants were collected from each field in early summer after applying fertilizer or compost. The delta(15)N of fertilizers and composts was - 1.6 +/- 1.5parts per thousand (n = 8) and 17.4 +/- 1.2parts per thousand (n = 10), respectively. The delta(15)N of total soil-N was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in CU fields (8.8 +/-2.0parts per thousand) than in FU fields (5.9 4 +/- 0.7parts per thousand) due to long-term continuous application of N-15-enriched compost, as indicated by a positive correlation (r = 0.62) between N content and delta(15)N of total soil-N. The NO3- Pool Of CU Soils (11.6 +/- 4.5parts per thousand) was also significantly (P < 0.05) enriched in N-15 compared to FU soils (4.7 +/- 1.1parts per thousand), while the N-15 contents of NH4+ Pool were not different between both soils. Compost application resulted in N-15 enrichment of plants; the delta(15)N values were 14.6 +/- 3.3parts per thousand for CU and 4.1 +/- 1.7parts per thousand for FU fields. These results showed that long-term application of compost resulted in a significant N-15-enrichment of soils and plants relative to fertilizer. Therefore, this study suggested that delta(15)N could serve as promising indicators of organic fertilizers application when used with other independent evidence. However, further studies under many conditions should be conducted to prepare reliable delta(15)N guidelines for organic produce, since the delta(15)N of inorganic soil-N and plant-N are influenced by various factors such as soil type, plant species, the rate of N application, and processes such as mineralization, nitrification, and dnitrification.

AB An experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of temperature, feed fat content and dietary oil source on growth and nutrient utilisation of Atlantic salmon parr ( similar to 19 g). The fish were reared in freshwater at 2 or 8 degreesC for 6 months at light/dark cycles of 12 h: 12 h. Each of four feeds was provided to triplicate groups of fish at each temperature. The feeds were formulated with marine fish oil or a blend of rapeseed and linseed oil at low or high inclusion levels to give feeds with 340 g kg(-1) fat and 400 g kg(-1) protein or 210 g kg(-1) fat and 500 g kg(-1) protein. Fish weights doubled over the 6 months at the lower temperature, whereas a fivefold increase was seen over the same period at the higher temperature. At the lower temperature, growth was similar for fish in all four dietary groups (SGR; 0.40 +/- 0.01% day(-1)), whereas significantly better growth was found for fish fed the low fat feeds at the higher temperature (SGR; 0.99 +/- 0.01% vs. 0.93 +/- 0.01% day-1). Feed efficiencies were higher for fish at the lower temperature. Apparent fat and protein digestibilities were high at both temperatures, but fat digestibility was significantly lower at the lower temperature (ADC(fat); 96.3 +/- 0.5% vs. 98.2 +/- 0.4%). Fat digestibility was higher for the high fat feeds, but significant differences between the groups were found only at the lower temperature. Protein digestibility was also lower at the lower temperature (ADC(protein); 90.8 +/- 0.4% vs. 91.2 +/- 0.4%), and was significantly improved when vegetable oils were used in the feed. Protein retention efficiency (PRE: [g protein gain g protein ingested(-1)] x 100) was significantly higher at 8 degreesC than at 2 degreesC (PRE; 52 +/- 1 vs. 49 +/- 2), and high feed fat content improved protein retention. Energy retention (ERE: [kJ gain U ingested(-1)] x 100) tended to be higher for fish at the lower temperature (ERE; 55 +/- 2 vs. 50 +/- 1). Energy retention was also significantly higher for fish fed the high fat feeds. There was no evidence that vegetable oils were inferior to marine fish oils at either temperature, and at low temperature vegetable oil enhanced protein digestibility.

AB Agricultural expansion has resulted in loss of natural habitats worldwide, threatening remnant populations and communities. However, during the past several centuries in much of Europe and eastern North America, extensive forest clearance (usually resulting in <20% forest cover) has been followed by widespread expansion of forest onto abandoned agricultural land. Since ancient forests (those remaining at the peak of forest loss) provide seed sources for recolonization of recent (post-agricultural) forests, the extent of forest loss should influence the rate of population recovery in recent forest. Data compiled from the literature for 10 regions of Europe and North America indicate that the proportion of ancient forest in a landscape can account for >65% of the variation in species diversity of "ancient forest herbs" in recent forests relative to ancient forests. This result suggests that ancient-forest loss has had a strong influence on the recovery of herbaceous plant diversity in post-agricultural forests. In addition, a simple mainland-island metapopulation model suggests that with increasing severity of habitat loss the return time to equilibrium patch occupancy in recent forests is greatly extended, perhaps for centuries after forest clearance has ceased and restoration begun.

AB Rapid environmental changes have fostered debates and motivated research on how to effectively preserve or restore ecosystem processes. One such debate deals with the effects of biodiversity, and the loss thereof, on ecosystem processes. Recent studies demonstrate that resource-use complementarity, now known as the "niche-differentiation effect," and the presence of a competitive species with strong effects on ecosystem processes, now known as the "sampling effect," can explain why productivity and nutrient retention are sometimes enhanced with increasing species richness. In a well-replicated outdoor mesocosm experiment, we tested these and other alternative mechanisms that could explain the effects of submersed aquatic plant (macrophyte) diversity on wetland ecosystem processes. Algal biomass increased and phosphorus loss decreased as species richness increased. This result can best be explained by an indirect sampling effect caused by one of the weakest competitors, which appeared to facilitate algal growth and thereby filtering of particles, and thus phosphorus, from the water column. The dominant competitor also appeared to decrease phosphorus loss through direct effects on phosphorus availability in the soil and water. Thus, the effects by one of the weakest and the most dominant competitors combine to produce a diversity effect on phosphorus loss. Macrophyte biomass was not enhanced, but converged toward the intermediate biomass of the most competitive species. Such an "inverse sampling effect" may be produced when the most competitive species is not the most productive species owing to species-specific feedbacks and adaptations to the wetland environment. In summary, we reject the niche-differentiation effect as the dominant mechanism in our macrophyte communities and expand on the role of sampling effects in explaining the relationship between plant communities and ecosystem processes. In particular, indirect and inverse sampling effects combine to drive the relationship between species richness and wetland ecosystem processes. Thus, we demonstrate that plant diversity may affect wetland ecosystem processes when inferior competitors drive system productivity and nutrient retention. To ensure coexistence of such species with superior competitors, wetland systems may need to be maintained in a nonequilibrium state, such as with hydrologic disturbances, which would maintain both higher diversity and enhance ecosystem functioning.

AB Fragmentation of breeding habitat has been hypothesized as a cause of population declines in forest-nesting migratory birds. Negative correlations between the degree of fragmentation and bird density or fecundity at local or regional scales support the fragmentation hypothesis. Yet, in spite of reduced fecundity and densities in fragmented systems, many forest-nesting passerine species have increased in numbers over time. We hypothesized that range-wide population change in species for which habitat fragmentation negatively affects reproductive success should depend on the proportion of the population that actually occupies fragmented landscapes. We predicted that fragmentation-sensitive species (e.g., species that occur in reduced densities in fragmented landscapes) should increase globally in numbers at a greater rate than species that readily occupy fragmented landscapes, because fragmentation-sensitive distributions place a large proportion of the global population in contiguous landscapes that are superior for breeding. We used Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data and associated landscape metrics, to test this prediction for 10 species of forest-nesting passerines in the United States that experience reproductive dysfunction associated with habitat fragmentation: Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus), Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorus), Kentucky Warbler (Oporornis formosus), Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), Scarlet Tanager (Piranga olivacea), Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), and Hooded Warbler (Wilsonia citrina).
   Our approach was to: (1) quantify landscape features associated with BBS routes across the eastern United States, (2) classify landscapes around BBS routes as "fragmented" or "contiguous," (3) estimate the proportion of detected individuals that occurred in fragmented landscapes on a species-by-species basis, and then (4) associate 10-yr trends for each species, with the proportion of breeding individuals occupying fragmented landscapes. Regression analysis indicated a significant, negative relationship between the proportion of the breeding population occupying fragmented landscapes and the population trend from 1970 to 1980. Although this result links habitat fragmentation to population change and provides support for the fragmentation hypothesis, other factors (e.g., land use change, weather, varying life history traits, varying winter survivorship, habitat amount thresholds) could generate similar results. More work is needed to partition the relative influence of these factors on regional bird population dynamics if conservationists are to understand more clearly the effects of fragmentation on the distribution and abundance of species across their ranges.

AB To explore genetic architecture and adaptive evolution, we conducted environmental and genetic experiments with two recently (ca. 100 generations) diverged, geographically adjacent races of the soapberry bug. One race occurs on a native host plant species, the other on an introduced host. We focused on three traits: length of the mouthparts, body size and development time. The first experiment was an environmental manipulation, comparing individuals of each population reared on one or the other host species ('cross-rearing') and estimating three evolutionary rates for each trait. The first rate, 'evolutionary path' compares ancestral-derived populations when both were reared on the introduced host. The second, 'current ecological contrast' compares populations with each reared on its natal host. The third, 'evolved tradeoff' compares the two races when reared on the native host. Differences among these rates are striking and informative. For example, development time, which appears to be relatively undifferentiated phenotypically, has actually evolved very rapidly via countergradient selection. The pattern differs for each trait, and clear developmental tradeoffs have evolved as quickly as adaptation to the new host in each. The second experiment was a two-generation 'line cross' study. With joint-scaling analyzes, we compared purebred, hybrid and backcrossed individuals to describe genetic architecture. Additive genetic variance for mouthpart length was consistently large (ca. 60%), but the interaction of dominance, maternal effects and epistasis was important in the other traits. Rearing host strongly affected genetic architecture. There was no clear relationship between genetic architecture and rate of evolution. Selection has produced both additive and nonadditive differentiation between the host races with surprising speed, consistent with theoretical predictions about evolution in fitness-associated traits.

AB The responses of sweet corn biomass and yield to timing and severity of water deficit were determined in an experiment using a mobile rainshelter. Six irrigation treatments were applied such that plots experienced: (1) no water deficit; (2) full water deficit; (3) moderate pre-silking deficit; (4) severe pre-silking deficit; (5) moderate post-silking deficit; or (6) severe post-silking deficit. Drought was quantified using the concept of potential soil moisture deficit, which was calculated from climatic data. Potential soil moisture deficit can be related simply to a wide range of plant performance variables, making it possible to compare the relative importance of variables in determining the overall response of the crop to drought. For all treatments, yield was related strongly to biomass, especially that accumulated after silking. Biomass, in turn, was reduced by water deficit, mainly because of reduced radiation use efficiency, but also because of reduced total radiation interception, particularly in early deficit treatments. Both water use efficiency and transpiration efficiency increased with water deficit, even though soil evaporation as a proportion of total water use also increased with deficit. There was no stage of crop development at which yield was particularly sensitive to water deficit, although yield components changed with timing of deficit. Importantly, measures of potential soil moisture deficit integrated the effects of timing and severity of drought, making it possible to simply and mechanistically account for the effects of water deficit on biomass and particularly yield.

AB This study reports temporal (based on cross-dated dead trees) and spatial patterns of availability of coarse woody debris (CWD) from Picea abies in a Swedish boreal landscape with discrete old-growth forest patches in a wetland matrix. Data were collected from 29 patches ranging in size from 0.3 to 28 ha. A total of 897 dead trees with a minimum diameter of > 15 cm occurred on the 7.2 ha area analysed. The year of death was established for 50 % of these trees.
   CWD volume ranged from 17 to 65 m(3)/ha for downed logs and from 0.5 to 13 m(3)/ha for standing snags. CWD of all decay stages and diameter classes occurred abundantly and the probability of finding logs of all decay stages and sizes was very high at the scale of single hectares. Tree mortality differed among 5 yr periods. However, during the last 50 yr no 5 yr period produced less than 3 logs/ha. Decay rates were highly variable among different logs. Logs with soft wood and some wood pieces lost (decay stage 5) died ca. 34 years ago. This suggests a fairly rapid decay in this northern forest. The data indicate a high and continuous availability of CWD of all types. It is likely, therefore, that selection pressures for efficient dispersal among CWD dependent species may not be very high. Consequently, species with narrow habitat demands and/or low dispersal ability may have evolved and this may contribute to the decrease of certain species in the managed landscape.

AB With large tracts of once continuous forest now modified by human use to leave reduced and highly fragmented stands of trees, the determination of the genetic consequences of forest fragmentation is a priority for ascertaining the conservation value of resultant stands, and in formulating sustainable management strategies. The levels and distribution of genetic diversity over 10 microsatellite loci were investigated within a fragmented population of the neotropical tree Swietenia humilis Zucc. High levels of genetic variation, typical of a highly outcrossing species, were found in all fragments at all loci (mean H-E = 0.548). The majority of the variation was within rather than between fragments (R-ST = 0.032), giving high indirect estimates of gene now (Nm = 8.9), probably reflecting the genetic structure of the trees present under more continuous forest. A high proportion of loci also showed significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with associated significant levels of F-IS. The initial effects of fragmentation were, however, seen in the fragments through the loss of low-frequency alleles present in the continuous 'control' stand. The percentage of this allelic loss increased with a decrease in fragment size.

AB Nest predation studies hare typically documented patterns related to habitat characteristics rather than investigate predation as an interaction between predator and prey. In contrast, this article presents a simple model that seeks an explanation for variation in nest predation rates through an application of foraging theory. Changes in the environment or to the predator-pre!: community will manifest as measurable changes in, e,g,, nest encounter rates, nest vigilance or defense, and the predator's search effort and strategy;, and thus ultimately in the rate of nest predation. In accord with the model's predictions, (1) as the relative density of active nests declines so does predation by inefficient predators; (2) increasing the abundance of alternative foods decreases the nest predation rate; (3) decreasing the prey's food abundance increases predation by avian predators via the tradeoff between foraging and nest vigilance; and (4) nest site characteristics influence predation rates via changes in, e.g,, nest encounter rates and recognition time. I argue that behavior and abiotic factors are important, but often neglected variables in our current conceptualization of avian nest predation.

AB According to the traditional Volterra-Gause viewpoint, the number of species in ecological communities (local richness) was thought to be controlled mainly by species interactions operating within the community itself. In order for this viewpoint to be correct, communities had to be close to equilibrium, species interactions had to be intense, and local richness had to be limited by the number of resources and physical factors. Here I argue that resource limitation and other local factors often fail to set upper limits on local richness. Revised theoretical models that add realism in the form of environmental complexity and non-equilibrium population densities of the constituent species do not predict such limits. In addition, critical evidence for such limits in real communities is often lacking. Local richness frequently correlates with the number of species in the surrounding region, and does not become independent of the latter in the richest regions as would be expected if the community became saturated. Similarly, communities in comparable environments but in regions supporting different numbers of species are not always convergent. In some cases, the effects of local environmental factors, which are known to have strong effects on local richness under some circumstances, can be severely constrained by history under other circumstances. Finally, evidence for classical interaction-imposed limits on local richness, such as density compensation and invasion resistance, does not consistently appear in many assemblages. Taken together, the evidence suggests that a more complete understanding of species richness in communities requires information on regional/historical as well as local processes. Hence, we need to broaden our perspective beyond the familiar Volterra-Gause equilibrium viewpoint and embrace community history as a relevant determinant of community structure and species composition.

AB Empirical evidence to assess the hypothesis that nest predation pressure influences avian assemblage composition is mostly lacking. We examined distribution of predation risk for artificial bird nests in the understory of coniferous and deciduous forests in southeastern Alaska and adjacent western Canada to determine whether habitat-specific nest predation pressure could be a factor influencing habitat selection and, in turn, breeding bird diversity. Two sizes of open-cup nests were constructed of natural materials and placed in nest sites representative of those used by local breeding bird species although, on average, artificial nests were more conspicuous than natural nests monitored in a companion study. Artificial nests were exposed to predation during early and late nesting seasons in 1993 and 1994. Principal nest predators identified using automated cameras were red squirrel (Tamiasciurus huclsonicus), Steller's Jay (Cyanocitta stelleri; Alaska only), Gray Jay (Perisoreus canadensis; Canada only), and small mammals. Systematic point-count censuses recorded significantly more red squirrels than jays in coniferous forest, and both jay species reached peak abundances at the border between coniferous and deciduous forest, relative to interior forest of both types. In repeated-measures analysis of variance, predation of artificial nests was significantly higher in coniferous than deciduous forest, and greater for large (thrush size) than for small (warbler size) nests. Nest height (shrub vs. ground) was not an important factor, due to a significant interaction with time (early vs, late nesting season). Natural and artificial nest predation losses were comparable in deciduous forest, but artificial nests were more susceptible than natural nests in coniferous forest understory. Artificial nest losses reflected the distribution of predators, especially red squirrels, and was negatively associated with breeding bird diversity in northwestern forest understory-confirming that nest predation pressure is one (of several) plausible determinants of avian habitat selection and assemblage organization.

AB Temporal and spatial relationships in a maple-forest soil among mycophagous microarthropods, total hyphal length, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungus spores, microfungus diversity, root biomass and some abiotic variables (temperature, water content, pH, organic matter content) were investigated. Samples were obtained from spring 1991 to winter 1992 at four soil depths. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to analyze the data. Four species of sporulating VAM fungi were identified, along with 23 species of mites and springtails, 9 of which were common. Hyphal length, VAM fungus spores, and soil animals peaked in spring and autumn. Canonical correspondence analysis suggests that animal abundance and success in the soil is dependent on a number of environmental variables. The most important variables that influence microarthropod community structure are: (i) temperature, (ii) water content, (iii) pH, (iv) total length of fungal hyphae, and (v) diversity of darkly-pigmented fungi. However, the relative importance of these variables changes with increasing soil depth. We have also shown a relationship between arthropod populations and their food supply under field conditions, a phenomenon that has been demonstrated previously under controlled laboratory conditions.

AB We propose a new approach to the multivariate analysis of data sets with known sampling site spatial positions. A between-sites neighbouring relationship must be derived from site positions and this relationship is introduced into the multivariate analyses through neighbouring weights (number of neighbours at each site) and through the matrix of the neighbouring graph. Eigenvector analysis methods (e.g. principal component analysis, correspondence analysis) can then be used to detect total, local and global structures. The introduction of the D-centring (centring with respect to the neighbouring weights) allows us to write a total variance decomposition into local and global components, and to propose a unified view of several methods. After a brief review of the matrix approach to this problem, we present the results obtained on both simulated and real data sets, showing how spatial structure can be detected and analysed. Freely available computer programs to perform computations and graphical displays are proposed.

AB We identified all essential Anastrepha obliqua (Macquart) resources (i.e., food, shelter, oviposition substrate [larval rearing medium], sites to perform sexual activities, and pupation medium) within a diversified agroecosystem (plum trees planted adjacent to mango trees), and examined the relationship between the spatial arrangement and temporal characteristics (e.g., variable degree of foliage coverage in plum trees) of habitat patches and resource use by local fly populations. Patterns of resource use were correlated with habitat characteristics (e.g., availability of shade, temperature, relative humidity, light intensity) and varied significantly between sexes. Overall, females used plum trees for feeding and oviposition, whereas males used them only for feeding. In contrast, females principally used mango trees for resting and feeding and males for sexual activities (courtship, copulation) and resting. We report significant differences in fly sightings according to sex, hour of day, and microhabitat. Of all fly sightings in the plum microhabitat (n = 396), 72.2% were females. In the mango microhabitat, 33.5% of 424 individuals sighted were female. Flies moved back and forth between microhabitats, especially during early morning and late afternoon. We also provide data on sightings of the fly parasitoid Doryctobracon aerolatus (Szepligeti) in plum trees and adjacent native vegetation. The high degree of behavioral plasticity observed seems to allow flies to respond efficiently to a heterogeneous and variable environment. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our results with respect to insect behavioral responses to variable environments, insect movement, and control strategies based on habitat manipulation (use of trap crops).

LA English
DT Article
ID ELAPHE-OBSOLETA; NEST PREDATION; POPULATION; PATTERNS; ONTARIO; EDGE
AB Black rat snakes (Elaphe o. obsoleta) are important predators of nesting birds and small mammals in fragmented landscapes. Thus, we used radiotelemetry to study movements of 32 black rat snakes at Remington Farms, Maryland, during 1988-89 to determine potential ways to minimize their depredations. Yearly home ranges were similar (P > 0.05) for males and females (xBAR +/- SE) (convex polygon, 9.49 +/- 1.01 ha; 95% harmonic contour, 10.52 +/- 1.24 ha), but males covered more (P < 0.05) of the home range earlier in the spring. Snakes were familiar with habitat features within their home range, returning to the same areas after prolonged absences. Snakes used forest edge, residential, hedgerow, and herbaceous/brush habitats more (P < 0.05-0.001) than expected by chance. Use of hayfields increased, and use of forest decreased from early (mid-May-30 Jun) to late (I Jul-28 Aug) season. Snakes rarely used crop fields. Low frequency of movement within forest interior and residential areas indicated their importance as refuges. Activity was high in non-forest habitat and forest edge, suggesting their importance for foraging. Males traveled more often (P < 0.01-0.001) than females during late spring and early summer. Movements were infrequent (<5%) between dusk and dawn. Use of major structural features in the home range differed (P < 0.05-0.001) between sexes and among seasons. Females used shelter (trees and buildings) more often (P < 0.001) than males, especially during early season. Snakes used elevated sites on >50% of all observations. Females used higher (P < 0.001) perches (xBAR +/- SE) (6.3 +/- 0.2 m) than males (3.4 +/- 0.1 m). Suitable habitat for black rat snakes in agricultural landscapes contained small forest blocks with a high edge-to-area ratio. Fallow fields, fields planted to orchard grass and clover, and a network of strip vegetation, especially brushy hedgerows, provided important foraging habitat. To minimize predation on nesting birds and small mammals, we suggest decreasing habitat suitability by creating broad expanses of unsuitable habitat bordering forests, or maintaining large forest blocks with a low edge-to-area ratio.

AB Nitrogen fertilization increases yield of perennial grasses, but little knowledge exists on the effect of N fertilization on growth processes at the sward level. Growth of an irrigated tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreber) sward fertilized with different rates of N was analyzed during two summer regrowths (1987 and 1988) and two spring regrowths (1987 and 1989). When no N was applied, cumulative shoot growth at the end of each regrowth period (summer 1987, summer 1988, spring 1987, and spring 1989) was 29, 15, 36, and 42% of that obtained with the highest N rate used in that period (160, 240, 200, and 180 kg N ha-1), respectively. Analysis of the N nutrition status of the sward based on the concept of an optimal N content indicated that N was not limiting shoot growth at the highest N rates used in any of the regrowths except during the summer of 1987. Radiation-use efficiency at the highest N rate was 1.68 and 1.82 g DM MJ-1 in the summer regrowths of 1987 and 1988, and 1.83 and 2.16 g DM MJ-1 in the spring regrowths of 1987 and 1989. Cumulative intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and radiation-use efficiency both increased with an increase in N rates. The effect of the N deficiency on cumulative intercepted PAR was, for the most part, limited to situations where the relative N concentration was <0.5. Radiation-use efficiency, however, was affected through most of the range of relative N concentrations.

AB Patterns in the community structure of marsh-edge fishes occupying the ecotone between marsh surface and open water were revealed through intensive surveys with a drop sampler along two 25 km transects in a Louisiana estuary during spring and summer 1989. We quantified abundances of organisms and measured environmental variables to characterize community structure and population responses, along large-scale as well as local environmental gradients. Reciprocal averaging ordination of species-by-sample matrices and subsequent visual pattern recognition of superimposed environmental information were used to identify large-scale temporal and spatial changes in community structure. We also recognized responses to gradients in selected local environmental variables, like water depth and emergent stem density. Although responses to local gradients were subordinate to large-scale changes in community structure, local responses were still important in segregating species that co-occurred along large-scale gradients. A close correspondence existed between large-scale spatial and temporal changes in community structure and several abiotic variables, such as salinity, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen. Temporal changes in community structure were more important in spring than in summer. A species turnover during spring involved the virtual replacement of young-of-year of one dominant water-column species, gulf menhaden Brevoortia patronus, by another water-column species, bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli. A coenocline comprised of several demersal fishes appeared along the transects in summer, and this spatial change in community structure closely followed the salinity gradient. This study extends the applicability of the gradient model of community structure to Gulf of Mexico coastal salt marshes and underscores the importance of nested environmental gradients to ecological segregation.

AB Increasing the potential of soil to store carbon (C) is an acknowledged and emphasized strategy for capturing atmospheric CO2. Well-recognized approaches for soil C accretion include reducing soil disturbance, increasing plant biomass inputs, and enhancing plant diversity. Yet experimental evidence often fails to support anticipated C gains, suggesting that our integrated understanding of soil C accretion remains insufficient. Here we use a unique combination of X-ray micro-tomography and micro-scale enzyme mapping to demonstrate for the first time that plant-stimulated soil pore formation appears to be a major, hitherto unrecognized, determinant of whether new C inputs are stored or lost to the atmosphere. Unlike monocultures, diverse plant communities favor the development of 30-150 mu m pores. Such pores are the micro-environments associated with higher enzyme activities, and greater abundance of such pores translates into a greater spatial footprint that microorganisms make on the soil and consequently soil C storage capacity.

AB There is growing concern over tipping points arising in ecosystems because of the crossing of environmental thresholds. Tipping points lead to abrupt and possibly irreversible shifts between alternative ecosystem states, potentially incurring high societal costs. Trait variation in populations is central to the biotic feedbacks that maintain alternative ecosystem states, as they govern the responses of populations to environmental change that could stabilize or destabilize ecosystem states. However, we know little about how evolutionary changes in trait distributions over time affect the occurrence of tipping points and even less about how big-scale ecological shifts reciprocally interact with trait dynamics. We argue that interactions between ecological and evolutionary processes should be taken into account in order to understand the balance of feedbacks governing tipping points in nature.

AB To keep global warming possibly below 1.5 degrees C and mitigate adverse effects of climate change, agriculture, like all other sectors, will have to contribute to efforts in achieving net negative emissions by the end of the century. Cost-efficient distribution of mitigation across regions and economic sectors is typically calculated using a global uniform carbon price in climate stabilization scenarios. However, in reality such a carbon price would substantially affect food availability. Here, we assess the implications of climate changemitigation in the land use sector for agricultural production and food security using an integrated partial equilibrium modelling framework and explore ways of relaxing the competition between mitigation in agriculture and food availability. Using a scenario that limits global warming cost-efficiently across sectors to 1.5 degrees C, results indicate global food calorie losses ranging from 110-285 kcal per capita per day in 2050 depending on the applied demand elasticities. This could translate into a rise in undernourishment of 80-300 million people in 2050. Less ambitious greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation in the land use sector reduces the associated food security impact significantly, however the 1.5 degrees C target would not be achieved without additional reductions outside the land use sector. Efficiency of GHG mitigation will also depend on the level of participation globally. Our results show that if non-Annex-I countries decide not to contribute to mitigation action while other parties pursue their mitigation efforts to reach the global climate target, food security impacts in these non-Annex-I countries will be higher than if they participate in a global agreement, as inefficient mitigation increases agricultural production costs and therefore food prices. Land-rich countries with a high proportion of emissions from land use change, such as Brazil, could reduce emissions with only a marginal effect on food availability. In contrast, agricultural mitigation in high population (density) countries, such as China and India, would lead to substantial food calorie loss without a major contribution to global GHG mitigation. Increasing soil carbon sequestration on agricultural land would allow reducing the implied calorie loss by 65% when sticking to the initially estimated land use mitigation requirements, thereby limiting the impact on undernourishment to 20-75 million people, and storing significant amounts of carbon in soils.

AB Temperate lakes may contain both coolwater fish species such as walleye (Sander vitreus) and warmwater fish species such as largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). Recent declining walleye and increasing largemouth bass populations have raised questions regarding the future trajectories and management actions for these species. We developed a thermodynamic model of water temperatures driven by downscaled climate data and lake-specific characteristics to estimate daily water temperature profiles for 2148 lakes in Wisconsin, US, under contemporary (1989-2014) and future (2040-2064 and 2065-2089) conditions. We correlated contemporary walleye recruitment and largemouth bass relative abundance to modeled water temperature, lake morphometry, and lake productivity, and projected lake-specific changes in each species under future climate conditions. Walleye recruitment success was negatively related and largemouth bass abundance was positively related to water temperature degree days. Both species exhibited a threshold response at the same degree day value, albeit in opposite directions. Degree days were predicted to increase in the future, although the magnitude of increase varied among lakes, time periods, and global circulation models (GCMs). Under future conditions, we predicted a loss of walleye recruitment in 33-75% of lakes where recruitment is currently supported and a 27-60% increase in the number of lakes suitable for high largemouth bass abundance. The percentage of lakes capable of supporting abundant largemouth bass but failed walleye recruitment was predicted to increase from 58% in contemporary conditions to 86% by mid-century and to 91% of lakes by late century, based on median projections across GCMs. Conversely, the percentage of lakes with successful walleye recruitment and low largemouth bass abundance was predicted to decline from 9% of lakes in contemporary conditions to only 1% of lakes in both future periods. Importantly, we identify up to 85 resilient lakes predicted to continue to support natural walleye recruitment. Management resources could target preserving these resilient walleye populations.

AB Traditionally metacommunity studies have quantified the relative importance of dispersal and environmental processes on observed beta-diversity. Separating beta-diversity into its replacement and nestedness components and linking such patterns to metacommunity drivers can provide richer insights into biodiversity organization across spatial scales. It is often very difficult to measure actual dispersal rates in the field and to define the boundaries of natural metacommunities. To overcome those limitations, we revisited an experimental metacommunity dataset to test the independent and interacting effects of environmental heterogeneity and dispersal on each component of beta-diversity. We show that the balance between the replacement and nestedness components of beta-diversity resulting from eutrophication changes completely depending on dispersal rates. Nutrient enrichment negatively affected local zooplankton diversity and generated a pattern of beta-diversity derived from nestedness in unconnected, environmentally heterogeneous landscapes. Increasing dispersal erased the pattern of nestedness, whereas the replacement component gained importance. In environmentally homogeneous metacommunities, dispersal limitation created community dissimilarity via species replacement whereas the nestedness component remained low and unchanged across dispersal levels. Our study provides novel insights into how environmental heterogeneity and dispersal interact and shape metacommunity structure.

AB Despite the disproportionate influence that propagule production, dispersal, seed-to-seedling recruitment and vegetative reproduction can have on plant population and community dynamics, progress has been slow in the directed collection of regeneration traits to inform community assembly outcomes. While seed mass is globally available and linked to growth and reproductive output, there are limits to its explanatory ability. In this essay, we call for expanded efforts to integrate a more diverse set of regeneration traits into community assembly models. First, we extend an existing community assembly framework to conceptualize regeneration as a series of transitional processes whose outcomes are influenced by abiotic filters, biotic interactions and species traits. We then briefly review the literature, highlighting filters and traits of demonstrated or theorized importance for each transition. Finally, we place regeneration in the context of existing and emerging modelling approaches in trait-based community assembly, summarizing key areas of progress needed to integrate regeneration traits into these efforts.Synthesis. By incorporating influential regeneration traits into empirical studies and global data bases, we can begin to disentangle regenerative mechanisms underlying community assembly outcomes and enhance rapidly developing models of species' abundances, distributions and responses to environmental change.

AB An enormous recent research effort focused on how plant biodiversity (notably species richness) influences ecosystem functioning, usually through experiments in which diversity is varied through random draws of species from a species pool. Such experiments are increasingly used to predict how species losses influence ecosystem functioning in real' ecosystems. However, this assumes that comparisons of experimental communities with low vs high species richness are analogous to comparisons of natural communities from which species either have or have not been lost. I explore the validity of this assumption, and highlight difficulties in using such experiments to draw conclusions about the ecosystem consequences of biodiversity loss in natural systems. Notably, these experiments do not mimic what happens in real ecosystems either when local extinctions occur or when species losses are offset by gains of new species. Despite limitations, this single experimental approach for studying how biodiversity loss affects ecosystems has often been advocated and implemented at the expense of other approaches; this limits understanding of how natural ecosystems respond to biodiversity loss. I conclude that a broader spectrum of approaches, and more explicit consideration of how species losses and gains operate in concert to influence ecosystems, will help progress this field.

AB 1. Landscape heterogeneity represents two aspects of landscape simplification: (i) compositional heterogeneity (diversity of habitat types); and (ii) configurational heterogeneity (number, size and arrangement of habitat patches), both with different ecological implications for community composition.
   2. We examined how independent gradients of compositional and configurational landscape heterogeneity, at eight spatial scales, shape taxonomic and functional composition of butterfly communities in 91 managed grasslands across Germany. We used landscape metrics that were calculated from functional maps based on habitat preferences of individual species during different life stages. The relative effects of compositional and configurational landscape heterogeneity were compared with those of local land-use intensity on butterfly taxonomic diversity, community composition and functional diversity of traits related to body size, feeding breadth and migratory tendency.
   3. As expected, compositional heterogeneity had strong positive effects on taxonomic diversity, while configurational heterogeneity had strong positive effects on trait dominance within the community. When landscapes had smaller mean patch size and greater boundary area, communities were dominated by species with more specialized larval feeding, decreased forewing length and limited migratory tendency.
   4. The positive effects of increased configurational landscape heterogeneity outweighed the negative effects of local land-use intensity on larval-feeding specialization, at all spatial scales, highlighting its importance for specialists of all dispersal capabilities.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We show that landscapes with high compositional heterogeneity support communities with greater taxonomic diversity, while landscapes with high configurational heterogeneity support communities that include vulnerable species (feeding specialists with larger body size, sedentary nature and more negatively affected by local management intensity). A decline in functional community composition can lead to functional homogenization, affecting the viability of the ecosystems by decreasing the variability in their responses to disturbance and altering their functioning. A landscape management for grasslands that promotes the maintenance of small patch sizes and a diversity of land uses in the surrounding landscape (within 250-1000 m) is recommended for the conservation of diverse butterfly communities. These strategies could also benefit government programmes such as the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy in their efforts to reduce the loss of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.

AB Understanding which species are introduced and become invasive, and why, are central questions in invasion science. Comparative studies on model taxa have provided important insights, but much more needs to be done to unravel the context dependencies of these findings. The cactus family (Cactaceae), one of the most popular horticultural plant groups, is an interesting case study. Hundreds of cactus species have been introduced outside their native ranges; a few of them are among the most damaging invasive plant species in the world. We reviewed the drivers of introductions and invasions in the family and seek insights that can be used to minimize future risks. We compiled a list of species in the family and determined which have been recorded as invasive. We also mapped current global distributions and modelled the potential global distributions based on distribution data of known invasive taxa. Finally, we identified whether invasiveness is phylogenetically clustered for cacti and whether particular traits are correlated with invasiveness. Only 57 of the 1922 cactus species recognized in this treatment have been recorded as invasive. There are three invasion hotspots: South Africa (35 invasive species recorded), Australia (26 species) and Spain (24 species). However, there are large areas of the world with climates suitable for cacti that are at risk of future invasion-in particular, parts of China, eastern Asia and central Africa. The invasive taxa represent an interesting subset of the total species pool. There is a significant phylogenetic signal: invasive species occur in 2 of the 3 major phylogenetic clades and in 13 of the 130 genera. This phylogenetic signal is not driven by human preference, i.e. horticultural trade, but all invasive species are from 5 of the 12 cactus growth forms. Finally, invasive species tend to have significantly larger native ranges than non-invasive species, and none of the invasive species are of conservation concern in their native range. These results suggest fairly robust correlates of invasiveness that can be used for proactive management and risk assessments.

AB Despite the demonstrated functional importance of gut microbes, our understanding of how animals regulate their metabolism in response to nutritionally beneficial symbionts remains limited. Here, we elucidate the functional importance of the African cotton stainer's (Dysdercus fasciatus) association with two actinobacterial gut symbionts and subsequently examine the insect's transcriptional response following symbiont elimination. In line with bioassays demonstrating the symbionts' contribution towards host fitness through the supplementation of B vitamins, comparative transcriptomic analyses of genes involved in import and processing of B vitamins revealed an upregulation of gene expression in aposymbiotic (symbiont-free) compared with symbiotic individuals; an expression pattern that is indicative of B vitamin deficiency in animals. Normal expression levels of these genes, however, can be restored by either artificial supplementation of B vitamins into the insect's diet or reinfection with the actinobacterial symbionts. Furthermore, the functional characterization of the differentially expressed thiamine transporter 2 through heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes confirms its role in cellular uptake of vitamin B1. These findings demonstrate that despite an extracellular localization, beneficial gut microbes can be integral to the host's metabolic homeostasis, reminiscent of bacteriome-localized intracellular mutualists.

AB Top predators can dramatically suppress populations of smaller predators, with cascading effects throughout communities, and this pressure is often unquestioningly accepted as a constraint on mesopredator populations. In this study, we reassess whether African lions suppress populations of cheetahs and African wild dogs and examine possible mechanisms for coexistence between these species. Using long-term records from Serengeti National Park, we tested 30years of population data for evidence of mesopredator suppression, and we examined six years of concurrent radio-telemetry data for evidence of large-scale spatial displacement. The Serengeti lion population nearly tripled between 1966 and 1998; during this time, wild dogs declined but cheetah numbers remained largely unchanged. Prior to their local extinction, wild dogs primarily occupied low lion density areas and apparently abandoned the long-term study area as the lion population saturated' the region. In contrast, cheetahs mostly utilized areas of high lion density, and the stability of the cheetah population indicates that neither high levels of lion-inflicted mortality nor behavioural avoidance inflict sufficient demographic consequences to translate into population-level effects. Population data from fenced reserves in southern Africa revealed a similar contrast between wild dogs and cheetahs in their ability to coexist with lions. These findings demonstrate differential responses of subordinate species within the same guild and challenge a widespread perception that lions undermine cheetah conservation efforts. Paired with several recent studies that document fine-scale lion-avoidance by cheetahs, this study further highlights fine-scale spatial avoidance as a possible mechanism for mitigating mesopredator suppression.

AB Bushmint (Hyptis suaveolens (L.) Poit) is one among the world's most noxious weeds. Bushmint is rapidly invading tropical ecosystems across the world, including India, and is major threat to native biodiversity, ecosystems and livelihoods. Knowledge about the likely areas under bushmint invasion has immense importance for taking rapid response and mitigation measures. In the present study, we model the potential invasion range of bushmint in India and investigate prediction capabilities of two popular species distribution models (SDM) viz, MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) and GARP (Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Production). We compiled spatial layers on 22 climatic and non-climatic (soil type and land use land cover) environmental variables at India level and selected least correlated 14 predictor variables. 530 locations of bushmint along with 14 predictor variables were used to predict bushmint distribution using MaxEnt and GARP. We demonstrate the relative contribution of predictor variables and species-environmental linkages in modeling bushmint distribution. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess each model's performance and robustness. GARP had a relatively lower area under curve (AUC) score (AUC: 0.75), suggesting its lower ability in discriminating the suitable/unsuitable sites. Relative to GARP, MaxEnt performed better with an AUC value of 0.86. Overall the outputs of MaxEnt and GARP matched in terms of geographic regions predicted as suitable/unsuitable for bushmint in India, however, predictions were closer in the spatial extent in Central India and Western Himalayan foothills compared to North-East India, Chottanagpur and Vidhayans and Deccan Plateau in India.

AB Fire is a complex physical and ecological process and one that has dramatically affected New Zealand's landscapes and ecosystems in the post-settlement era. Prior to human settlement in the late 13th century, the Holocene palaeoenvironmental record suggests that fire frequencies were low across most of New Zealand, with the notable exception of some wetland systems. Because few of New Zealand's indigenous plant species show any real adaptation to fire, the greatly increased fire activity that accompanied human settlement resulted in widespread, and in some cases permanent, shifts in the composition, structure and function of many terrestrial ecosystems. The combined effects of Maori and European fire have left long-lasting legacies in New Zealand's landscapes with the most obvious being the reduction of forest cover from 85-90% to 25% of the land area. Here we review the long-term ecological history of fire in New Zealand's terrestrial ecosystems and describe what is known about the fire ecology of New Zealand's plant species and communities, highlighting key uncertainties and areas where future research is required. While considerable emphasis has been placed on describing and understanding the 'initial burning period' that accompanied Maori arrival, much less ecological emphasis has been placed on the shifts in fire regime that occurred during the European period, despite the significant effects these had. Post-fire successional trajectories have been described for a number of wetland and forest communities in New Zealand, but in contemporary landscapes are complicated by the effects of exotic mammalian species that act as seed and seedling predators and herbivores, reduced pollination and dispersal services due to declines in the avifauna, and the presence of pyrophyllic exotic plant species. Many invasive plant species (e.g. Pinus spp., Acacia spp., Hakea spp., Ulex europaeus) are favoured by fire and now co-occur with indigenous plant species in communities whose long-term composition and trajectory are unclear. On the other hand, some highly-valued ecosystems such as tussock grasslands may require recurrent fire for their long-term persistence. Combined, the direct and indirect effects of the introduction of anthropic fire to New Zealand may have shifted large areas into successional 'traps' from which, in the face of recurrent fire, escape is difficult. Developing appropriate management strategies in such a context requires a nuanced understanding of the place of fire in New Zealand's ecosystems.

TI Multi-generational long-distance migration of insects: studying the

AB Long-range, seasonal migration is a widespread phenomenon among insects, allowing them to track and exploit abundant but ephemeral resources over vast geographical areas. However, the basic patterns of how species shift across multiple locations and seasons are unknown in most cases, even though migrant species comprise an important component of the temperate-zone biota. The painted lady butterfly Vanessa cardui is such an example; a cosmopolitan continuously-brooded species which migrates each year between Africa and Europe, sometimes in enormous numbers. The migration of 2009 was one of the most impressive recorded, and thousands of observations were collected through citizen science programmes and systematic entomological surveys, such as high altitude insect-monitoring radar and ground-based butterfly monitoring schemes. Here we use V. cardui as a model species to better understand insect migration in the Western Palaearctic, and we capitalise on the complementary data sources available for this iconic butterfly. The migratory cycle in this species involves six generations, encompassing a latitudinal shift of thousands of kilometres (up to 60 degrees of latitude). The cycle comprises an annual poleward advance of the populations in spring followed by an equatorward return movement in autumn, with returning individuals potentially flying thousands of kilometres. We show that many long-distance migrants take advantage of favourable winds, moving downwind at high elevation (from some tens of metres from the ground to altitudes over 1000 m), pointing at strong similarities in the flight strategies used by V. cardui and other migrant Lepidoptera. Our results reveal the highly successful strategy that has evolved in these insects, and provide a useful framework for a better understanding of long-distance seasonal migration in the temperate regions worldwide.

AB An age effect on growth trends and climate/growth relationships of trees can possibly be discovered by analysing the seasonal dynamics of xylem development. The aims of this study, therefore, were to compare xylem formation of young (43 +/- 4 years) and old (162 +/- 26 years) Smith fir (Abies georgei var. smithii (Viguie & Gaussen) W. C. Cheng & L. K. Fu) trees in the Sygera Mountains, south-eastern Tibetan Plateau and, to identify the association between wood formation and climate. The seasonal radial growth dynamics of young and old trees was monitored on microcores collected at weekly intervals during two growing seasons. Transverse sections through phloem, cambium and outermost xylem of 9-12 mu m thickness were observed with a light microscope under bright field and polarized light to follow the cambial activity and differentiation of the developing xylem. Young trees were characterized by an earlier onset of xylogenesis, a longer growing season and a higher growth rate, resulting in a higher number of xylem cells. Both young and old trees responded fast to changes of the minimum air temperature, confirming that this factor was dominant by controlling Smith fir growth on the south-eastern Tibetan Plateau.

AB Little is known of the population dynamics of long-range insect migrants, and it has been suggested that the annual journeys of billions of nonhardy insects to exploit temperate zones during summer represent a sink from which future generations seldom return (the "Pied Piper" effect). We combine data from entomological radars and ground-based light traps to show that annual migrations are highly adaptive in the noctuid moth Autographa gamma (silver Y), a major agricultural pest. We estimate that 10-240 million immigrants reach the United Kingdom each spring, but that summer breeding results in a fourfold increase in the abundance of the subsequent generation of adults, all of which emigrate southward in the fall. Trajectory simulations show that 80% of emigrants will reach regions suitable for winter breeding in the Mediterranean Basin, for which our population dynamics model predicts a winter carrying capacity only 20% of that of northern Europe during the summer. We conclude not only that poleward insect migrations in spring result in major population increases, but also that the persistence of such species is dependent on summer breeding in high-latitude regions, which requires a fundamental change in our understanding of insect migration.

AB The theoretical description of the forces that shape ecological communities focuses around two classes of models. In niche theory, deterministic interactions between species, individuals, and the environment are considered the dominant factor, whereas in neutral theory, stochastic forces, such as demographic noise, speciation, and immigration, are dominant. Species abundance distributions predicted by the two classes of theory are difficult to distinguish empirically, making it problematic to deduce ecological dynamics from typical measures of diversity and community structure. Here, we show that the fusion of species abundance data with genome-derived measures of evolutionary distance can provide a clear indication of ecological dynamics, capable of quantifying the relative roles played by niche and neutral forces. We apply this technique to six gastrointestinal microbiomes drawn from three different domesticated vertebrates, using high-resolution surveys of microbial species abundance obtained from carefully curated deep 16S rRNA hypervariable tag sequencing data. Although the species abundance patterns are seemingly well fit by the neutral theory of metacommunity assembly, we show that this theory cannot account for the evolutionary patterns in the genomic data; moreover, our analyses strongly suggest that these microbiomes have, in fact, been assembled through processes that involve a significant nonneutral (niche) contribution. Our results demonstrate that high-resolution genomics can remove the ambiguities of process inference inherent in classic ecologicalmeasures and permits quantification of the forces shaping complex microbial communities.

AB The goal of ecosystem-based marine spatial management is to maintain marine ecosystems in a healthy, productive and resilient condition; hence, they can sustainably provide the needed goods and services for human welfare. However, the increasing pressures upon the marine realm threaten marine ecosystems, especially seabed biotopes, and thus a well-planned approach of managing use of marine space is essential to achieve sustainability. The relative value of seabed biotopes, evaluated on the basis of goods and services, is an important starting point for the spatial management of marine areas. Herein, 56 types of European seabed biotopes and their related goods, services, sensitivity issues, and conservation status were compiled, the latter referring to management and protection tools which currently apply for these biotopes at European or international level. Fishing activities, especially by benthic trawls, and marine pollution are the main threats to European seabed biotopes. Increased seawater turbidity, dredged sediment disposal, coastal constructions, biological invasions, mining, extraction of raw materials, shipping-related activities, tourism, hydrocarbon exploration, and even some practices of scientific research, also exert substantial pressure. Although some first steps have been taken to protect the European sea beds through international agreements and European and national legislation, a finer scale of classification and assessment of marine biotopes is considered crucial in shaping sound priorities and management guidelines towards the effective conservation and sustainability of European marine resources.

AB In the practice of molecular dating, substitution saturation will bias the results if not properly modeled. Date estimates based on commonly used mitochondrial DNA sequences likely suffer from this problem because of their high substitution rate. Nevertheless, the patterns and extent of such expected bias remain unknown for many major evolutionary lineages, which often differ in ages, available calibrations, and substitution rates of their mitochondrial genome. In this case study of salamanders, we used estimates based on multiple nuclear exons to assess the effects of saturation on dating divergences using mitochondrial genome sequences on a timescale of similar to 200-300 My. The results indicated that, due to saturation for older divergences and in the absence of younger effective calibration points, dates derived from the mitochondrial data were considerably overestimated and systematically biased toward the calibration point for the ingroup root. The overestimate might be as great as 3-10 times (about 20 My) older than actual divergence dates for recent splitting events and 40 My older for events that are more ancient. For deep divergences, dates estimated were strongly compressed together. Furthermore, excluding the third codon positions of protein-coding genes or only using the RNA genes or second codon positions did not considerably improve the performance. In the order Caudata, slowly evolving markers such as nuclear exons are preferred for dating a phylogeny covering a relatively wide time span. Dates estimated from these markers can be used as secondary calibrations for dating recent events based on rapidly evolving markers for which mitochondrial DNA sequences are attractive candidates due to their short coalescent time. In other groups, similar evaluation should be performed to facilitate the choice of markers for molecular dating and making inferences from the results.

AB Sperm are the most diverse of all animal cell types, and much of the diversity in sperm design is thought to reflect adaptations to the highly variable conditions under which sperm function and compete to achieve fertilization. Recent work has shown that these conditions often evolve rapidly as a consequence of multiple mating, suggesting a role for sexual selection and sexual conflict in the evolution of sperm design. However, very little of the striking diversity in sperm design is understood functionally, particularly in internally fertilizing organisms. We use phylogenetic comparative analyses covering 16 species of the hermaphroditic flatworm genus Macrostomum to show that a complex sperm design is associated with reciprocal mating and that this complexity is lost secondarily when hypodermic insemination-sperm injection through the epidermis-evolves. Specifically, the complex sperm design, which includes stiff lateral bristles, is likely a male persistence trait associated with sexual conflicts over the fate of received ejaculates and linked to female resistance traits, namely an intriguing postcopulatory sucking behavior and a thickened epithelium of the sperm-receiving organ. Our results suggest that the interactions between sperm donor, sperm, and sperm recipient can change drastically when hypodermic insemination evolves, involving convergent evolution of a needle-like copulatory organ, a simpler sperm design, and a simpler female genital morphology. Our study documents that a shift in the mating behavior may alter fundamentally the conditions under which sperm compete and thereby lead to a drastic change in sperm design.

AB 1. Ecosystem properties may be determined by the number of different species or groups of species in a community, the identity of those groups, and their relative abundance. The mass ratio theory predicts that the effect of species or groups of species on ecosystem properties will be dependent on their proportional abundance in a community.
   2. Single plant functional groups (graminoids, legumes, non-leguminous forbs) were removed from a natural grassland in northern Canada to examine the role of group identity in determining both ecosystem properties and biomass compensation by remaining species. Removals were conducted across two different environmental treatments (fertilization and fungicide) to examine the context dependency of functional group identity effects.
   3. The degree of biomass compensation in the first 4 years after removal was influenced by the identity of the functional group removed and also of those remaining. When graminoids were removed, none of the remaining functional groups compensated for the loss of biomass. Graminoids partially compensated for the removal of forbs or legumes, with the degree of compensation depending on environmental treatments.
   4. Light interception, soil moisture and soil nutrients were all influenced by functional group identity, with graminoids having a greater impact than expected based on their biomass contribution to the community. Legumes, in contrast, had very little effect on any of the ecosystem properties measured.
   5. For most ecosystem properties measured, the role of plant functional groups was not context dependent; functional groups had the same effect on ecosystem properties regardless of fertilization or fungicide treatments.
   6. Synthesis. We have shown that the effects of losing a functional group do not solely depend on the group's dominance. In this northern grassland, there are greater effects of losing graminoids than one would predict based on their biomass contributions to the community, and functional group identity plays a critical role in determining the effects of diversity loss.

AB Cities are the dominant form of human settlement. As centers of economic growth and population they are focal points of both ecological disturbance (through resource consumption and land conversion) and the provision of public goods. Ecosystem services provided by municipal forests and green space are positioned to address both these arenas. While technical means to mainstreaming this approach have grown, the importance municipal foresters' departments place on pursuing this objective and their department's engagement in actions necessary for its realization is under-researched. I surveyed the membership of the Society for Municipal Arborists to address this gap. I found that municipal foresters perceived the management of municipal green space to enhance ecosystem services to be increasingly significant to the goals and actions of their departments. Survey respondents expected this role to grow in importance, matching or exceeding some traditional objectives of their profession. While most perceived traditional services such as tree planting and maintenance, and social outputs like beautification and enhancing public health to remain high departmental priorities; respondents rated managing municipal green space to produce ecosystem services such as enhanced energy and climate management, water quality and habitat and biodiversity as more important to their department than traditional objectives such as maintenance of property values and protection of power lines. As responsibility for the management of urban green space resides predominantly at the municipal level, the importance municipal foresters' departments place on managing for ecosystem services is fundamental to advancing this strategy for the delivery of public goods in urban centers.

AB 1. A central concept in forest ecology is that differences in the growth rates and shade tolerances of tree species determine patterns of secondary succession. The most shade-tolerant tree species are the competitive dominants in late-successional forests, while species with fast growth rates persist through rapid establishment after disturbance. There is ample support for niche differentiation along the shade-tolerance axis, at least for temperate forests, but less thought has been given to the range of shade tolerances and growth rates encountered within a community and to how it might vary along environmental gradients.
   2. We hypothesized that a wider range of growth rates and shade tolerances are found on nutrient-rich soils, because such soils not only support fast-growing species with high metabolic rates, but also species capable of tolerating the very deep shade cast by forest canopies growing where nutrients are plentiful. We test our hypothesis by quantifying light transmission through two neighbouring forests in southern New Zealand, one on phosphorus-rich alluvial soil and one on phosphorus-depleted marine-terrace soil, and comparing the growth rates of saplings on these contrasting sites.
   3. Less light was transmitted to the forest floor on alluvial sites than on marine terraces (2.5% vs. 7.5% daylight, on average) and neighbourhood analyses within mapped stands indicated that large-leaved subcanopy species were responsible for intercepting that extra light. Sapling growth was strongly inhibited by shade in the understorey of the alluvial forests, but was less inhibited under the terrace forests.
   4. Fast-growing subcanopy species were common on the alluvial sites and these species had characteristically soft leaves and high foliar-nutrient concentrations. Slow-growing shade-tolerant species were also abundant on these sites. Therefore, the interspecific variance in growth rates was greater on nutrient-rich sites, supporting our hypothesis of a greater range of shade tolerance niches on better soils. Of the five species found on both forest sites, all five had greater high-light growth rate on the alluvial sites.
   5. Synthesis : A wider range of growth rates was observed in the nutrient-rich forests. This wider range may translate into a greater number of shade tolerance niches and thereby provides an explanation for the greater numbers of species commonly found on nutrient-rich soils when compared with neighbouring nutrient-poor sites.

AB Despite its key role in population dynamics and evolutionary ecology, little is known about factors shaping survival in long-lived territorial species. Here, we assessed several hypotheses that might explain variability in survival in a migratory Spanish population of a long-lived territorial species, the Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus, using a 16-year monitoring period and live-encounter histories of 835 individually marked birds. Cormack-Jolly-Seber capture-recapture models showed no evidence for effects of sex or nestling body condition on survival. However, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; an indicator of primary productivity) of natal territories had positive effects on juvenile survival, indicating that environmental conditions experienced early in life can determine survival prospects. Survival increased with age (0.73 +/- 0.02 in the first 2 years to 0.78 +/- 0.03 in years 3 and 4) to later decrease when birds were five years old (0.60 +/- 0.05), the age at which they acquire the adult plumage, abandon the communal lifestyle of juveniles, and may look for a breeding territory. At older ages, survival was higher for non-breeding (0.75 +/- 0.02) and breeding adults (0.83 +/- 0.02). Among the latter, birds that recruited into better territories had higher survival prospects. Age-specific variation in survival in this species may be related to behavioural changes linked to dispersal and recruitment into the breeding population, while survival prospects of adult birds strongly depend on breeding territory selection. These results suggest a tradeoff between recruiting soon, and thus reducing mortality costs of a long and extensive dispersal period, and trying to recruit into a good quality territory. Finally, annual survival rates for birds of all age classes were positively related with the NDVI in their African wintering grounds. Although this relationship was probably mediated by food availability, further research is needed to properly identify the limiting factors that are affecting trans-Saharan migrants, especially in light of global climate change.

AB A basic understanding of the taxonomy, diversity, and distributions of primates is essential for their conservation. This review of the status of the taxonomy of lemurs is based on a 5-d workshop entitled "Primate Taxonomy for the New Millennium," held at the Disney Institute, Orlando, Florida, in February 2000. The aim is not to present a taxonomic revision, but to review our current understanding of the diversity and current and past ranges of lemurs and indicate where there is controversy, discrepancy, or lack of knowledge. Our goal therefore is to provide a baseline for future taxonomic investigation, as well as a clearer focus for research and conservation priorities. We here focus on the lemurs of Madagascar and recognize 5 families, 15 genera, and 99 species and subspecies. We list 39 species of lemurs described since 2000: 2 dwarf lemurs, Cheirogaleus; 11 mouse lemurs, Microcebus; a giant mouse lemur, Mirza; a bamboo lemur, Hapalemur; 17 sportive lemurs, Lepilemur; and 7 woolly lemurs, Avahi. Taxonomic revisions have resulted in the resurrection of a further 9 taxa. However, the figures do not represent the total diversity of Malagasy lemurs because more new species are being identified via new field studies and accompanying genetic research, and should be described in the near future.

AB Boreal permafrost soils store large amounts of organic carbon (OC). Parts of this carbon (C) might be black carbon (BC) generated during vegetation fires. Rising temperature and permafrost degradation is expected to have different consequences for OC and BC, because BC is considered to be a refractory subfraction of soil organic matter. To get some insight into stocks, variability, and characteristics of BC in permafrost soils, we estimated the benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) method-specific composition and storage of BC, i.e. BPCA-BC, in a 0.44 km(2)-sized catchment at the forest tundra ecotone in northern Siberia. Furthermore, we assessed the BPCA-BC export with the stream draining the catchment. The catchment is composed of various landscape units with south-southwest (SSW) exposed mineral soils characterized by thick active layer or lacking permafrost, north-northeast (NNE) faced mineral soils with thin active layer, and permafrost-affected raised bogs in plateau positions showing in part thermokarst formation. There were indications of vegetation fires at all landscape units. BC was ubiquitous in the catchment soils and BPCA-BC amounted to 0.6-3.0% of OC. This corresponded to a BC storage of 22-3440 g m(-2). The relative contribution of BPCA-BC to OC, as well as the absolute stocks of BPCA-BC were largest in the intact bogs with a shallow active layer followed by mineral soils of the NNE aspects. In both landscape units, a large proportion of BPCA-BC was stored within the permafrost. In contrast, mineral soils with thick active layer or lacking permafrost and organic soils subjected to thermokarst formation stored less BPCA-BC. Permafrost is, hence, not only a crucial factor in the storage of OC but also of BC. In the stream water BPCA-BC amounted on an average to 3.9% of OC, and a yearly export of 0.10 g BPCA-BC m(-2) was calculated, most of it occurring during the period of snow melt with dominance of surface flow. This suggests that BC mobility in dissolved and colloidal phase is an important pathway of BC export from the catchment. Such a transport mechanism may explain the high BC concentrations found in sediments of the Arctic Ocean.

AB Large fires coincident with drought Occurred in south-eastern Australia during 2001-2007. Perceptions of large, intense fires as being ecologically 'disastrous' are common. These are summarised by four hypotheses characterising large fires as: (i) homogenous in extent and intensity; (ii) causing large-scale extinction due to perceived lack of survival and regeneration capacity among biota; (iii) degrading due to erosion and related edaphic effects; (iv) unnatural, as a consequence of contemporary land management. These hypotheses are examined using available evidence and shown to inadequately account for effects of large fires on biodiversity, Large fires do not burn homogeneously, though they may produce intensely burnt patches and areas. The bulk of biota are resilient through a variety of in situ persistence mechanisms that are reinforced by landscape factors. Severe erosive episodes following fire tend to be local and uncertain rather than global and inevitable. Redistribution of soil and nutrients may reinforce habitat variation in some cases. Signals of fire are highly variable over prehistoric and historic eras, and, in some cases, contemporary and pre-European signal levels are equivalent, The most important effects of large fires in these diverse ecological communities and landscapes stern from their recurrence rate. Adaptive management of fire regimes rather than fire events is required, based on an understanding of risks posed by particular regimes to biota.

AB Recent discoveries show that small unicellular nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria are more widespread than previously thought and can make major contributions to the nitrogen budget of the oceans. We combined theory and experiments to investigate competition for nitrogen and light between these small unicellular diazotrophs and other phytoplankton species. We developed a competition model that incorporates several physiological processes, including the light dependence of nitrogen fixation, the switch between nitrate assimilation and nitrogen fixation, and the release of fixed nitrogen. Model predictions were tested in nitrogen-limited and light-limited chemostat experiments using the unicellular nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp. Miami BG 043511, the picocyanobacterium Synechococcus bacillaris CCMP 1333, and the small green alga Chlorella_ cf sp. CCMP 1227. Parameter values of the species were estimated by calibration of the model in monoculture experiments. The model predictions were subsequently tested in a series of competition experiments at different nitrate levels. The model predictions were generally in good agreement with observed population dynamics. As predicted, in experiments with high nitrate input concentrations, the species with lowest critical light intensity ( S. bacillaris) competitively excluded the other species. At low nitrate input concentration, nitrogen release by Cyanothece enabled stable coexistence of Cyanothece and S. bacillaris. More specifically, model simulations predicted that fixed nitrogen release by Cyanothece enabled S. bacillaris to become four times more abundant in the species mixture than it would have been in monoculture. This intricate interplay between competition and facilitation is likely to be a major determinant of the relative abundances of unicellular nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and non-nitrogen-fixing phytoplankton species in the oligotrophic ocean.

AB The premise of this paper is that continued improvement in the understanding of wildfire impacts on soil erosion and better prediction of resulting hazards can be best achieved by adopting a concept of global regional variants and endemic factors that distinguish some regions in terms of post-fire erosion characteristics. The need for such an approach is exemplified here based on the fire-prone eucalypt forests in south-east Australia. Wildfire effects on vegetation, fauna, soil erodibility and erosion in this environment are evaluated and placed in the context of the global state-of-the-art for forest environments. In addition to expected variation resulting from, for example, geology, topography and climate of the area, it is argued that a distinctive post-fire behaviour is caused in these eucalypt forests by the interaction between specific characteristics of the vegetation, litter, soil properties, faunal activity and micro-scale surface features. Soil erosion limited only by post-fire rainfall intensity and quantity, or until bedrock is exposed, might be expected after wildfire on steep slopes in these forests given the non-cohesive character of the often sandy soils and their universally water repellent character. That this scenario is not realised, except possibly under extreme rainfall conditions, which rarely occur during the vulnerable post-fire period, can be attributed to a unique suite of features that disrupt or provide sinks for overland flow, bind the loose in situ soil and trap mobilised sediment. These include mats of fine roots, litter dam-microterrace complexes and faunal activity by small mammals and ants. In combination, these characteristics reduce post-fire hillslope-channel sediment transfer, at least under light to moderate intensity rainfall typical of post-fire periods following recent wildfires. Evidence is discussed suggesting that the long-term geomorphological role of wildfires in south-east Australia may be of relatively minor importance and confined largely to enhanced weathering of exposed outcrops and redistribution of soil across existing erosional and depositional landforms. The soil fertility and downstream water quality implications of widespread transfer of topsoil to watercourses resulting from frequent, often severe wildfires are nevertheless significant.

AB Domestication occurs as humans select and cultivate wild plants in agricultural habitats. The amount and structure of variation in contemporary cultivated populations has been shaped, in part, by how genetic material was transferred from one cultivated generation to the next. In some cultivated tree species, domestication involved a shift from sexually reproducing wild populations to vegetatively propagated cultivated populations; however, little is known about how domestication has impacted variation in these species. We employed AFLP data to explore the amount, structure, and distribution of variation in clonally propagated domesticated populations and sexually reproducing wild populations of the Neotropical fruit tree, Spondias purpurea (Anacardiaceae). Cultivated populations from three different agricultural habitats were included: living fences, backyards, and orchards. AFLP data were analysed using measures of genetic diversity (% polymorphic loci, Shannon's diversity index, Nei's gene diversity, panmictic heterozygosity), population structure (F-ST analogues), and principal components analyses. Levels of genetic variation in cultivated S. purpurea populations are significantly less than variation found in wild populations, although the amount of diversity varies in different agricultural habitats. Cultivated populations have a greater proportion of their genetic variability distributed among populations than wild populations. The genetic structure of backyard populations resembles that of wild populations, but living fence and orchard populations have 1/3 more variability distributed among populations, most likely a reflection of relative levels of vegetative reproduction. Finally, these results suggest that S. purpurea was domesticated in two distinct regions within Mesoamerica.

AB To explore the evolutionary consequences of climate-induced fluctuations in distribution of rainforest habitat we contrasted demographic histories of divergence among three lineages of Australian rainforest endemic skinks. The red-throated rainbow skink, Carlia rubrigularis, consists of morphologically indistinguishable northern and southern mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages that are partially reproductively isolated at their parapatric boundary. The third lineage (C. rhomboidalis) inhabits rainforests just to the south of C. rubrigularis, has blue, rather than red-throated males, and for mtDNA is more closely related to southern C. rubrigularis than is northern C. rubrigularis. Multigene coalescent analyses supported more recent divergence between morphologically distinct lineages than between morphologically conservative lineages. There was effectively no migration and therefore stronger isolation between southern C. rubrigularis and C. rhomboidalis, and low unidirectional migration between morphologically conservative lineages of C. rubrigularis. We found little or no evidence for strong differences in effective population size, and hence different contributions of genetic drift in the demographic history of the three lineages. Overall the results suggest contrasting responses to long-term fluctuations in rainforest habitats, leading to varying opportunities for speciation.

AB Despite the many benefits that testosterone has on male reproduction, sustaining high levels of testosterone for long periods can be costly. The challenge hypothesis predicts that males will show temporarily sustained elevations of testosterone at critical periods, counterbalanced by decreased levels during noncritical periods. We investigated male testosterone measures extracted from fecal samples in a group of chacma baboons (Papio hamadryas ursinus) living in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Because rank serves as a proxy for competition for mates, we examined how male testosterone was related to dominance rank, age, aggression, and mating activity. Males showed an elevation in testosterone at maturity; young adult males had the highest testosterone levels followed by a steady decline with age. Among dispersing males, testosterone was temporarily elevated in the month following dispersal. After controlling for age, testosterone and rank were unrelated, but testosterone and changes in rank were positively correlated, such that males rising in rank had higher testosterone than males falling in rank. Thus, for males in this group, testosterone was predictive of a male's rank trajectory, or future rank. Similarly, male testosterone levels predicted future, rather than current, mating activity. Finally, male testosterone and aggression rates were unrelated during stable periods in the dominance hierarchy but positively related during unstable periods when high ranks were being contested. In general, our results support the challenge hypothesis with males exhibiting elevated testosterone in association with the acquisition of high rank (ensuring access to mates), rather than with mating itself.

AB Advances in computing power in the past 20 years have led to a proliferation of spatially explicit, individual-based models of population and ecosystem dynamics. In forest ecosystems, the individual-based models encapsulate an emerging theory of "neighborhood" dynamics, in which fine-scale spatial interactions regulate the demography of component tree species. The spatial distribution of component species, in turn, regulates spatial variation in a whole host of community and ecosystem properties, with subsequent feedbacks on component species. The development of these models has been facilitated by development of new methods of analysis of field data, in which critical demographic rates and ecosystem processes are analyzed in terms of the spatial distributions of neighboring trees and physical environmental factors. The analyses are based on likelihood methods and information theory, and they allow a tight linkage between the models and explicit parameterization of the models from field data. Maximum. likelihood methods have a long history of use for point and interval estimation in statistics. In contrast, likelihood principles have only more gradually emerged in ecology as the foundation for an alternative to traditional hypothesis testing. The alternative framework stresses the process of identifying and selecting among competing models, or in the simplest case, among competing point estimates of a parameter of a model. There are four general steps involved in a likelihood analysis: (1) model specification, (2) parameter estimation using maximum likelihood methods, (3) model comparison, and (4) model evaluation. Our goal in this paper is to review recent developments in the use of likelihood methods and modeling for the analysis of neighborhood processes in forest ecosystems. We will focus on a single class of processes, seed dispersal and seedling dispersion, because recent papers provide compelling evidence of the potential power of the approach, and illustrate some of the statistical challenges in applying the methods.

AB Our main aim was to determine the contribution of the seed bank to vegetation regeneration following a disturbance consisting in a deep ploughing and a thorough homogenisation of a perennial grassland. In the seed bank prior to disturbance, seed distribution through the vertical soil profile was evaluated to determine the initial seed species structure. Then, several characteristics of the shallow seed bank and the extant vegetation were evaluated prior and following field disturbance: seed species composition and abundance, and species composition of the aboveground vegetation. The contribution of seed rain versus seed bank was evaluated by means of the comparison of the vegetation developed in plots filled with sterilised soil (seed bank removal) and the vegetation developed in non-sterilised plots in the field. The distribution of seeds through the profile indicated a sharp decline in abundance with depth, and it was probably linked to propagule morphology, with small and rounded seeds proner to being buried deeper than larger seeds. In the grassland prior to disturbance, the aboveground vegetation and seed bank species composition showed very low similarity index, most likely because during the 5 years following field abandonment, sheep pressure had caused a faster change in aboveground vegetation species composition than in seed bank species composition. Ploughing and homogenisation of the grassland led to low seed abundance in the shallow soil layer caused by dilution of the seed bank. Regardless of impoverishment in seed abundance and species richness, comparison between sterilised and non-sterilised plots showed that the seed bank acted as an effective source of colonising species and determined the aboveground species composition. To summarise, this Study outlines the importance of considering several characteristics of the seed bank, such as species composition and seed abundance, in the understanding of the function of seed bank and dynamics of the vegetation following a deep ploughing and homogenisation treatment.

AB Invasive species are a major threat to global biodiversity and an important cause of biotic homogenization of ecosystems. Exotic plants have been identified as a particular concern because of the widely held belief that they competitively exclude native plant species. We examined the correlation between native and invasive species richness in 58 Ontario inland wetlands. The relationship between exotic and native species richness was positive even when we controlled for important covarying factors. In addition, we examined the relationship between the abundance of four native species (Typha latifolia, T angustifolia, Salix petiolaris, Nuphar variegatum) and four invasive species (Lythrum salicaria, Hydrocharis morsus-ranae, Phalaris arundinacea, Rhamnus frangula) that often dominate temperate wetlands and native and rare native species richness. Exotic species were no more likely to dominate a wetland than native species, and the proportion of dominant exotic species that had a significant negative effect on the native plant community was the same as the proportion of native species with a significant negative effect. We conclude that the key to conservation of inland wetland biodiversity is to discourage the spread of community dominants, regardless of geographical origin.

AB That data from polar orbiting satellites have detected a widespread increase in photosynthetic activity over the last 20 years in the grasslands of the Sahel is justifies investigating its role in the tropical carbon cycle. But this task is undermined because ground data that are generally used to support the use of primary production models elsewhere are lacking. In this paper, we profile a Light Use Efficiency (LUE) model of primary production parameterised with satellite information, and test it for the West African Sahel; solar radiation is absorbed by plants to provide energy for photosynthesis, while moisture shortfalls control the efficiency of light usage. In particular, we show how an economical use of existing, yet meagre data sets can be used to circumvent nominal, yet untenable approaches for achieving this for the region. Specifically, we use a cloudiness layer provided with the NOAA/NASA 8 km Pathfinder Land data archive (PAL) data set to derive solar radiation (and other energy balance terms) required to implement the model (monthly time-step). Of particular note, we index growth efficiency via transpiration by subsuming rangeland-yield formulations into our model. This is important for partially vegetated landscapes where the fate of rainfall is controlled by relative vegetation cover. We accomplish this by using PAL-derived Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to partition the landscape into fractional vegetation cover. A bare soil evaporation model that feeds into bucket model is then applied, thereafter deriving actual transpiration (quasi-daily time-step). We forgo a formal validation of the model due to problems of spatial scale and data limitations. Instead, we generate maps showing model robustness via Monte Carlo simulation. The precision of our Gross Primary Production (GPP) estimates is acceptable, but falls off rapidly for the northern fringes of the Sahel. We also map the locations where errors in the driving variables are mostly responsible for the bulk of uncertainty in predicted GPP, in this case the water stress factor and the NDVI. Comparisons with an independent model of primary production, CENTURY, are relatively poor, yet favourable comparisons are made with previous primary production estimates found for the region in the literature. A spatially exhaustive evaluation of our GPP map is carried out by regressing randomly sampled observations against integrated NDVI, a method traditionally used to quantify absolute amounts of primary production. Our model can be used to quantify stocks and flows of carbon in grasslands over the recent historical period. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Morphological investigations of motile cells and cysts of a small dinoflagellate (strain CCMP 2088) isolated from Canadian Arctic waters were carried out under both light and scanning electron microscopy. This species strongly resembled Polarella glacialis (strain CCMP 1383), which up to now was known only from Antarctic sea ice. The photosynthetic pigment composition of strain CCMP 2088 is typical of dinoflagellates, with peridinin as a major accessory pigment. Phylogenetic relationships between the two strains and other dinoflagellate species were inferred from SSU nrDNA using Neighbour Joining and weighted parsimony analyses. Our results showed that strain CCMP 2088 and P. glacialis (strain CCMP 1383) grouped in the same clade (Suessiales clade), showing high similarity values (0.99%). Morphological and molecular data support the assignment of the Arctic strain to P. glacialis. The free-living Gymnodinium simplex and the two P. glacialis strains have a basal position in the Suessiales clade, as compared to Symbiodinium spp.

AB Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. and Q. pubescens Willd. are two closely related taxa. No specific single marker, either morphological or molecular, has been identified to distinguish the two species until now. In the present study morphoanatomical and molecular traits (simple sequence repeats = SSR loci) were investigated in an attempt to characterize and to discriminate between these two oak species. At the morphological level, the applied statistics (nested ANOVA and discriminant analysis) suggest that the micromorphological features are the most effective for this purpose. The wide range of macromorphological variation observed can confound the classification of many individuals into either Q. petraea and Q. pubescens. Analysis of microsatellite data indicates that most of the genetic variation is contained within, rather than between, species. The lack of molecular divergence could be attributed to either relatively rapid and recent differentiation or to extensive hybridization following secondary contact of the taxa.

AB To understand the reasons for population change we need to understand the mechanisms through which it occurs. Throughout western Europe there have been declines in farmland birds. These declines have been paralleled by major changes in agricultural management, which have resulted in major changes in habitat structure. This paper describes the habitat selection at two scales (within and between fields) of a number of seed-eating farmland birds. Habitat preferences for most species were related to the density of seeds present, which differed markedly between habitats. Seed density declined with distance from hedgerow in cultivated fields but not stubble Fields. Yellowhammers were restricted to foraging close to hedgerows, whilst skylarks foraged in the centre of fields, but moved closer towards the edges as the winter progressed and seed densities declined. This work has clear consequences for agricultural management and the conservation of declining bird populations.

AB 1. The pristine part of the Bialowieza Primeval Forest (protected as Bialowieza National Park, 47.5 km(2)) is dominated by stands of deciduous trees (mainly oak Quercus robur, hornbeam Carpinus betulus, lime Tilia cordata, and maple Acer platanoides) (72.5% of forested area). The average age of the tree stands is 130 years. The managed part of the Bialowieza Primeval Forest (530 km(2)) has been heavily exploited for timber since 1915. Forestry practices have reduced the area of deciduous mature stands (currently 46% of area) and have greatly increased young-age coniferous stands. Pine Pinus silvestris and spruce Picea abies are the most widely replantated species. The average age of these tree stands is 72 years.
   2. Five species of ungulates inhabit Bialowieza Primeval Forest: red deer Cervus elaphus, roe deer Capreolus capreolus, moose Alces alces, European bison Bison bonasus, and wild boar Sus scrofa. Their total density in winter was 13-41 (mean 28) individuals km(-2) (total biomass 1104-3338 kg, mean 2286 kg) in the pristine forests, and 11-24 (mean 15) individuals km(-2) (total biomass 1000-1654 kg, mean 1238 kg) in the exploited forests. In pristine forests, red deer and wild boar were dominant (on average 43% and 51% of total number of ungulates, respectively), while in the exploited forests, red deer and roe deer were the dominant species (39% and 27%).
   3. Two factors, the percentage of deciduous tree stands and the percentage of mature stands (>80 years), in the 11 censused sections of Bialowieza Forest explained 71% of the variation in ungulate biomass per unit area. Both factors positively correlated with ungulate abundance.
   4. Wolves (Canis lupus) preyed selectively on red deer and took fewer wild boar than expected on a random basis. Roe deer fell prey to wolves relatively more often in the exploited forests, where it was the second most numerous ungulate in the community, than in the pristine forests.
   5. Comparison of ungulate densities in the pristine and exploited forests of Bialowieza with the data for six other woodlands in Poland showed that the total biomass of ungulates per unit area was positively correlated with the percentage area of deciduous forest sites. High food availability in deciduous forests (browse supply, acorn crop, soil invertebrates) is the main factor in determining the abundance of ungulates in Polish lowland forests. 'Borealization' of deciduous forests due to forestry practices (favouring pine and spruce in silviculture) is diminishing their carrying capacity, especially for red deer and wild boar.

AB Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) is a key topic in conservation and agricultural research. Decision makers need evidence-based information to design sustainable management plans and policy instruments. However, providing objective decision support can be challenging because realities and perceptions of human-wildlife interactions vary widely between and within rural, urban, and peri-urban areas. Land users who incur costs through wildlife argue that wildlife-related losses should be compensated and that prevention should be subsidized. Supporters of human-wildlife coexistence policies, such as urban-dwelling people, may not face threats to their livelihoods from wildlife. Such spatial heterogeneity in the cost and benefits of living with wildlife is germane in most contemporary societies. This Special Section features contributions on wildlife-induced damages that range from human perspectives (land use, psychology, governance, local attitudes and perceptions, costs and benefits, and HWC and coexistence theory) to ecological perspectives (animal behavior). Building on current literature and articles in this section, we developed a conceptual model to help frame HWC and coexistence dimensions. The framework can be used to determine damage prevention implementation levels and approaches to HWC resolution. Our synthesis revealed that inter- and transdisciplinary approaches and multilevel governance approaches can help stakeholders and institutions implement sustainable management strategies that promote human-wildlife coexistence.

AB With the expansion in the quantity and types of biodiversity data being collected, there is a need to find ways to combine these different sources to provide cohesive summaries of species' potential and realized distributions in space and time. Recently, model-based data integration has emerged as a means to achieve this by combining datasets in ways that retain the strengths of each. We describe a flexible approach to data integration using point process models, which provide a convenient way to translate across ecological currencies. We highlight recent examples of large-scale ecological models based on data integration and outline the conceptual and technical challenges and opportunities that arise.

DT Article

ID GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACTS; STOCKS; LIMITS
AB Climate change adaptation, mitigation and food security may be addressed at the same time by enhancing soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration through environmentally sound land management practices. This is promoted by the "4 per 1000" Initiative, a multi-stakeholder platform aiming at increasing SOC storage through sustainable practices. The scientific and technical committee of the Initiative is working to identify indicators, research priorities and region-specific practices needed for their implementation. The Initiative received its name due to the global importance of soils for climate change, which can be illustrated by a thought experiment showing that an annual growth rate of only 0.4% of the standing global SOC stocks would have the potential to counterbalance the current increase in atmospheric CO2. However, there are numerous barriers to the rise in SOC stocks and while SOC sequestration can contribute to partly offsetting greenhouse gas emissions, its main benefits are related to increased soil quality and climate change adaptation. The Initiative provides a collaborative platform for policy makers, practitioners, scientists and stakeholders to engage in finding solutions. Criticism of the Initiative has been related to the poor definition of its numerical target, which was not understood as an aspirational goal. The objective of this paper is to present the aims of the initiative, to discuss critical issues and to present challenges for its implementation. We identify barriers, risks and trade-offs and advocate for collaboration between multiple parties in order to stimulate innovation and to initiate the transition of agricultural systems toward sustainability.

AB Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), an electromagnetic signal that can potentially indicate vegetation photosynthetic activity, can be retrieved from ground-based, airborne and satellite measurements. However, due to the scattering and re-absorption effects inside the leaves and canopy, SIF measured at the canopy level is only a small part of the total SIF emission at the photosystem level. Therefore, a downscaling mechanism of SIF from the canopy level to the photosystem level is important for better understanding the relationship between SIF and the vegetation gross primary production (GPP). In this study, firstly, we analyzed the canopy scattering effects using a simple parameterization model based on the spectral invariant theory. The probability for SIF photons to escape from the canopy was found to be related to the anisotropic spectral reflectance, canopy interception of the upward solar radiation, and leaf absorption. An empirical approach based on a Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm was applied to downscale SIF constrained by the red, red-edge and far-red anisotropic reflectance. The RF was trained using simulations conducted with the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model. The performance of the SIF downscaling method was evaluated with SCOPE and Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model simulations, ground measurements and airborne data. Results show that estimated SIF at the photosystem level matches well with simulated reference data, and the relationship between SIF and photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by chlorophyll is improved by SIF downscaling. This finding in combination with other evaluation criteria suggests the downscaling of canopy SIF as an efficient strategy to normalize species dependent effects of canopy structure and varying solar-view geometries. Based on our results for the SIF-APAR relationship, we expect that such normalization approaches can be helpful to improve estimates of photosynthesis using remote sensing measurements of SIF.

AB Biodiversity encompasses multiple attributes such as the richness and abundance of species (taxonomic diversity), the presence of different evolutionary lineages (phylogenetic diversity), and the variety of growth forms and resource use strategies (functional diversity). These biodiversity attributes do not necessarily relate to each other and may have contrasting effects on ecosystem functioning. However, how they simultaneously influence the provision of multiple ecosystem functions related to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling (multifunctionality) remains unknown. We evaluated the effects of the taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional attributes of dominant (mass ratio effects) and subordinate (richness effect) plant species on the multifunctionality of 123 drylands from six continents. Our results highlight the importance of the phylogenetic and functional attributes of subordinate species as key drivers of multifunctionality. In addition to a higher taxonomic richness, we found that simultaneously increasing the richness of early diverging lineages and the functional redundancy between species increased multifunctionality. In contrast, the richness of most recent evolutionary lineages and the functional and phylogenetic attributes of dominant plant species (mass ratio effects) were weakly correlated with multifunctionality. However, they were important drivers of individual nutrient cycles. By identifying which biodiversity attributes contribute the most to multifunctionality, our results can guide restoration efforts aiming to maximize either multifunctionality or particular nutrient cycles, a critical step to combat dryland desertification worldwide.

DT Review

AB Spreading processes have been largely studied in the literature, both analytically and by means of large-scale numerical simulations. These processes mainly include the propagation of diseases, rumors and information on top of a given population. In the last two decades, with the advent of modern network science, we have witnessed significant advances in this field of research. Here we review the main theoretical and numerical methods developed for the study of spreading processes on complex networked systems. Specifically, we formally define epidemic processes on single and multilayer networks and discuss in detail the main methods used to perform numerical simulations. Throughout the review, we classify spreading processes (disease and rumor models) into two classes according to the nature of time: (i) continuous-time and (ii) cellular automata approach, where the second one can be further divided into synchronous and asynchronous updating schemes. Our revision includes the heterogeneous mean-field, the quenched-mean field, and the pair quenched mean field approaches, as well as their respective simulation techniques, emphasizing similarities and differences among the different techniques. The content presented here offers a whole suite of methods to study epidemic-like processes in complex networks, both for researchers without previous experience in the subject and for experts.

AB It has long been assumed that social animals, such as humans, are born with a brain system that has evolved to support social affiliation. However, the evidence does not necessarily support this assumption. Alternatively, social animals can be defined as those who cannot survive alone and rely on members from their group to regulate their ongoing physiology (or allostasis). The rather simple evolutionary constraint of social dependency for survival can be sufficient to make the social environment vitally salient, and to provide the ultimate driving force for socially crafted brain development and learning. In this Perspective, we propose a framework for sociality and specify a set of hypotheses on the mechanisms of social development and underlying neural systems. The theoretical shift proposed here implies that profound human characteristics, including but not limited to sociality, are acquired at an early age, while social interactions provide key wiring instructions that determine brain development.

AB Ultrasound (US) can noninvasively activate intact brain circuits, making it a promising neuromodulation technique. However, little is known about the underlying mechanism. Here, we apply transcranial US and perform brain mapping studies in guinea pigs using extracellular electrophysiology. We find that US elicits extensive activation across cortical and subcortical brain regions. However, transection of the auditory nerves or removal of cochlear fluids eliminates the US-induced activity, revealing an indirect auditory mechanism for US neural activation. Our findings indicate that US activates the ascending auditory system through a cochlear pathway, which can activate other non-auditory regions through cross-modal projections. This cochlear pathway mechanism challenges the idea that US can directly activate neurons in the intact brain, suggesting that future US stimulation studies will need to control for this effect to reach reliable conclusions.

AB Understanding the timing and character of the expansion of Homo sapiens out of Africa is critical for inferring the colonization and admixture processes that underpin global population history. It has been argued that dispersal out of Africa had an early phase, particularly similar to 130-90 thousand years ago (ka), that reached only the East Mediterranean Levant, and a later phase, similar to 60-50 ka, that extended across the diverse environments of Eurasia to Sahul. However, recent findings from East Asia and Sahul challenge this model. Here we show that H. sapiens was in the Arabian Peninsula before 85 ka. We describe the Al Wusta-1 (AW-1) intermediate phalanx from the site of Al Wusta in the Nefud desert, Saudi Arabia. AW-1 is the oldest directly dated fossil of our species outside Africa and the Levant. The palaeoenvironmental context of Al Wusta demonstrates that H. sapiens using Middle Palaeolithic stone tools dispersed into Arabia during a phase of increased precipitation driven by orbital forcing, in association with a primarily African fauna. A Bayesian model incorporating independent chronometric age estimates indicates a chronology for Al Wusta of similar to 95-86 ka, which we correlate with a humid episode in the later part of Marine Isotope Stage 5 known from various regional records. Al Wusta shows that early dispersals were more spatially and temporally extensive than previously thought. Early H. sapiens dispersals out of Africa were not limited to winter rainfall-fed Levantine Mediterranean woodlands immediately adjacent to Africa, but extended deep into the semi-arid grasslands of Arabia, facilitated by periods of enhanced monsoonal rainfall.

ID SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; CONSERVATISM; RANGES; MODELS; PREDICTION;
   INVASIONS; ECOLOGY; SPACE
AB Our understanding of how climate influences species distributions and our ability to assess the risk of introduced species depend on the assumption that species' climatic niches remain stable across space and time. While niche shifts have been detected in individual invasive species, one assessment of similar to 50 plants in Europe and North America concluded that niche shifts were rare, while another concluded the opposite. These contradictory findings, limited in species number and geographic scope, leave open a need to understand how often introduced species experience niche shifts and whether niche shifts can be predicted. We found evidence of climatic niche shifts in 65-100% of 815 terrestrial plant species introduced across five continents, depending on how niche shifts were measured. Individual species responses were idiosyncratic, but we generally saw that niche shifts reflected changes in climate availability at the continent scale and were largest in long-lived and cultivated species. Smaller intercontinental niche shifts occurred within species' native ranges. Overall, the climatic niches of terrestrial plant species were not conserved as they crossed continents. These results have major consequences for applying environmental niche models to assess the risk of invasive species and for predicting species responses to climate change. Our findings challenge the tenet that species' niches are conserved aspects of their ecology.

AB Although urban ecosystems are hotspots for biological invasions, the field of invasion science has given scant attention to invasion dynamics and the challenges facing managers in towns and cities. This paper provides an introduction to the growing challenges of understanding and managing invasive species in urban systems, and the context for a special issue of Biological Invasions, comprising 17 papers, that arose from a workshop on "Non-native species in urban environments: patterns, processes, impacts and challenges" held in Stellenbosch, South Africa, in November 2016. Contributions explore the following key questions: Are patterns and processes of urban invasions different from invasions in other contexts? Why is it important to manage non-native species in urban ecosystems? What are the special management needs in an urban context? How can we bridge the gaps between science, management, and policy with regards to biological invasions in urban ecosystems? The papers in this special issue show that patterns and processes of urban invasions differ in many ways from invasions in other contexts, and that managing invasive species in cities poses unique and increasingly complex challenges. Progress in urban invasion science requires further work to: (1) address key limitations that hinder our understanding of invasion dynamics in cities; (2) clarify whether fundamental concepts in the field of invasion science are appropriate for urban ecosystems; (3) integrate insights from invasion science with those from the burgeoning literature on the "Anthropocene biosphere", novel ecosystems, social-ecological systems, human-wildlife conflicts, urban green infrastructure, urban planning and design, and ecosystem services/disservices.

AB Invasive alien species (IASs) on islands have broad impacts across biodiversity, agriculture, economy, health and culture, which tend to be stronger than on continents. Across small-island developing states (SIDSs), although only a small number of IASs are widely distributed, many more, including those with greatest impact, are found on only a small number of islands. Patterns of island invasion are not consistent across SIDS geographic regions, with differences attributable to correlated patterns in island biogeography and human development. We identify 15 of the most globally prevalent IASs on islands. IAS impacts on islands are exacerbated through interactions with a number of other global change threats, including over-exploitation, agricultural intensification, urban development and climate change. Biosecurity is critical in preventing IAS invasion of islands. Eradication of IASs on islands is possible at early stages of invasion, but otherwise is largely restricted to invasive mammals, or otherwise control is the only option. Future directions in IAS management and research on islands must consider IASs within a broader portfolio of threats to species, ecosystems and people's livelihoods on islands. We advocate for stronger collaborations among island countries and territories faced with the same IASs in similar socio-ecological environments.

   Invasive Species (GRIIS) has been developed with co-funding from the
   European Union through the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological
   Diversity (CBD) within the framework of the Global Invasive Alien
   Species Information Partnership (GIASIP). The GIASIP has come together
   to assist Parties to the CBD, and others, implement Article 8(h) and
   Target 9 of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets: "By 2020, invasive alien
   species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species

AB The PREDICTS project-Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing Terrestrial Systems (www.predicts.org.uk)-has collated from published studies a large, reasonably representative database of comparable samples of biodiversity from multiple sites that differ in the nature or intensity of human impacts relating to land use. We have used this evidence base to develop global and regional statistical models of how local biodiversity responds to these measures. We describe and make freely available this 2016 release of the database, containing more than 3.2 million records sampled at over 26,000 locations and representing over 47,000 species. We outline how the database can help in answering a range of questions in ecology and conservation biology. To our knowledge, this is the largest and most geographically and taxonomically representative database of spatial comparisons of biodiversity that has been collated to date; it will be useful to researchers and international efforts wishing to model and understand the global status of biodiversity.

AB Current interest and debate on pollen-assemblage richness as a proxy for past plant richness have prompted us to review recent developments in assessing whether modern pollen-assemblage richness reflects contemporary floristic richness. We present basic definitions and outline key terminology. We summarise four basic needs in assessing pollen-plant richness relationships - modern pollen data, modern vegetation data, pollen-plant translation tables, and quantification of the co-variation between modern pollen and vegetation compositional data. We discuss three key estimates and one numerical tool - richness estimation, evenness estimation, diversity estimation, and statistical modelling. We consider the inherent problems and biases in assessing pollen-plant richness relationships - taxonomic precision, pollen-sample:pollen-population ratios, pollen-representation bias, and underlying concepts of evenness and diversity. We summarise alternative approaches to studying pollen plant richness relationships. We show that almost all studies which have compared modern pollen richness with contemporary site-specific plant richness reveal good relationships between palynological richness and plant richness. We outline future challenges and research opportunities - interpreting past pollen-richness patterns, estimating richness from macrofossils, studying pollen richness at different scales, partitioning diversity and estimating beta diversity, estimating false, hidden, and dark richness, and considering past functional and phylogenetic diversity from pollen data. We conclude with an assessment of the current state-of-knowledge about whether pollen richness reflects floristic richness and explore what is known and unknown in our understanding of pollen-plant richness relationships.

AB In the context of sustainable forest management and climate change, increasing tree richness has been proposed as a possible strategy to reach both ecological and productivity goals. This review focuses on the effects of mixed stands and increasing tree richness on soil fauna in temperate forests. Effects on earthworm and microarthropod (Collembola and Oribatid Mites) species diversity and abundance and community structure are examined, and clues to the main factors affecting soil communities in these stands are proposed.
   Our statistical analyses showed no evidence of any general trend for the effect of mixture either on earthworm or microarthropod diversity or on their abundance. Indeed, positive, negative and nonsignificant effects have all been reported. Nevertheless, the majority of the studies did find that increased tree richness or the introduction of broad-leaves had a positive effect. In addition, our review shows that soil organism abundance and diversity can be strongly affected by the presence of certain tree species and that the soil organism community structure is, in most cases, significantly affected by an increase in. tree richness or by a mixing effect. Litter features appear to be important drivers of soil fauna community composition, while mixture effect seems to have less impact on soil biota. Soil fauna are directly affected by the physical characteristics (microhabitats) and chemical composition (resource quality) of the litter specific to each tree species. Soil communities are then indirectly affected by the subsequent humus characteristics. We conclude our review with some guidelines for forest management and further research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Climate change is an important cause of the irreversible transformation of habitats, of the rapid extinction of species, and of the dramatic changes in entire communities, especially for tropical assemblages and for habitat and range-restricted species, such as mountaintop and polar species.
   In particular, climate change effects several aspects of animal sounds (e.g., song amplitude and frequency, song post, and sound phenology). Animal sounds, which are life traits characterized by high plasticity, are able to cope with even modest variations of environmental fundamentals like vegetation cover, land mosaic structure, temperature, humidity, and pH (for aquatic medium). Moreover, the climatic effects on these biophonies can be observed earlier than change in vegetation patterns and visible landscape structures.
   Ecoacoustics, the discipline that investigates the role of sound on animal ecology from species to landscapes, offers robust models, such as acoustic adaptation, acoustic niche, acoustic active space, acoustic community, and acoustic phenology to investigate the effect of climate change on species, populations, communities, and landscapes.
   From an operational perspective, ecoacoustics procedures can be applied in different contexts, such as locations, weather, species, populations, behavior, physiology, and phenology. In addition, thematic priorities can be selected, such as latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, restricted habitats, stopover areas, extreme environments, weather conditions, short distance migrants, species at high vocal plasticity, sink-source status, active space, social attraction, physiological modifications, dawn and dusk choruses, sound from stressed plants, and time series analysis.
   The noninvasiveness of passive acoustic recording, the simultaneous collection of important data, such as community richness and diversity, immigration and extinction events, and singing dynamics as well as the availability of innovative noninvasive technologies operating over a long-term period, establish ecoacoustics as a new and important tool with which it is possible to analyze massive acoustic data sets and quickly predict and/or evaluate the effects of climate change on the environment. Moreover, passive recording is supported by cheap, user-friendly field sensors and robust data processing and may be part of the citizen science research agenda on climate change.

   RECOMBINATION
AB Genomewide scans for natural selection (GWSS) have become increasingly common over the last 15years due to increased availability of genome-scale genetic data. Here, we report a representative survey of GWSS from 1999 to present and find that (i) between 1999 and 2009, 35 of 49 (71%) GWSS focused on human, while from 2010 to present, only 38 of 83 (46%) of GWSS focused on human, indicating increased focus on nonmodel organisms; (ii) the large majority of GWSS incorporate interpopulation or interspecific comparisons using, for example F-ST, cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity or the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions; (iii) most GWSS focus on detection of directional selection rather than other modes such as balancing selection; and (iv) in human GWSS, there is a clear shift after 2004 from microsatellite markers to dense SNP data. A survey of GWSS meant to identify loci positively selected in response to severe hypoxic conditions support an approach to GWSS in which a list of a priori candidate genes based on potential selective pressures are used to filter the list of significant hits a posteriori. We also discuss four frequently ignored determinants of genomic heterogeneity that complicate GWSS: mutation, recombination, selection and the genetic architecture of adaptive traits. We recommend that GWSS methodology should better incorporate aspects of genomewide heterogeneity using empirical estimates of relevant parameters and/or realistic, whole-chromosome simulations to improve interpretation of GWSS results. Finally, we argue that knowledge of potential selective agents improves interpretation of GWSS results and that new methods focused on correlations between environmental variables and genetic variation can help automate this approach.

AB Many established models of animal foraging assume that individuals are ecologically equivalent. However, it is increasingly recognized that populations may comprise individuals who differ consistently in their diets and foraging behaviors. For example, recent studies have shown that individual foraging site fidelity (IFSF, when individuals consistently forage in only a small part of their population's home range) occurs in some colonial breeders. Short-term IFSF could result from animals using a win-stay, lose-shift foraging strategy. Alternatively, it may be a consequence of individual specialization. Pelagic seabirds are colonial central-place foragers, classically assumed to use flexible foraging strategies to target widely dispersed, spatiotemporally patchy prey. However, tracking has shown that IFSF occurs in many seabirds, although it is not known whether this persists across years. To test for long-term IFSF and to examine alternative hypotheses concerning its cause, we repeatedly tracked 55 Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus) from a large colony in the North Sea within and across three successive breeding seasons. Gannets foraged in neritic waters, predictably structured by tidal mixing and thermal stratification, but subject to stochastic, wind-induced overturning. Both within and across years, coarse to mesoscale (tens of kilometers) IFSF was significant but not absolute, and foraging birds departed the colony in individually consistent directions. Carbon stable isotope ratios in gannet blood tissues were repeatable within years and nitrogen ratios were also repeatable across years, suggesting long-term individual dietary specialization. Individuals were also consistent across years in habitat use with respect to relative sea surface temperature and in some dive metrics, yet none of these factors accounted for IFSF. Moreover, at the scale of weeks, IFSF did not decay over time and the magnitude of IFSF across years was similar to that within years, suggesting that IFSF is not primarily the result of win-stay, lose-shift foraging. Rather, we hypothesize that site familiarity, accrued early in life, causes IFSF by canalizing subsequent foraging decisions. Evidence from this and other studies suggests that IFSF may be common in colonial central-place foragers, with far-reaching consequences for our attempts to understand and conserve these animals in a rapidly changing environment.

AB Global biodiversity is affected by numerous environmental drivers. Yet, the extent to which global environmental changes contribute to changes in local diversity is poorly understood. We investigated biodiversity changes in a meta-analysis of 39 resurvey studies in European temperate forests (3988 vegetation records in total, 17-75years between the two surveys) by assessing the importance of (i) coarse-resolution (i.e., among sites) vs. fine-resolution (i.e., within sites) environmental differences and (ii) changing environmental conditions between surveys. Our results clarify the mechanisms underlying the direction and magnitude of local-scale biodiversity changes. While not detecting any net local diversity loss, we observed considerable among-site variation, partly explained by temporal changes in light availability (a local driver) and density of large herbivores (a regional driver). Furthermore, strong evidence was found that presurvey levels of nitrogen deposition determined subsequent diversity changes. We conclude that models forecasting future biodiversity changes should consider coarse-resolution environmental changes, account for differences in baseline environmental conditions and for local changes in fine-resolution environmental conditions.

AB The numerical weather prediction of radiation fog is challenging, as many models typically show large biases for the timing of the onset and dispersal of the fog, as well as for its depth and liquid water content. To understand the role of physical processes, i.e. turbulence, radiation, land-surface coupling, and microphysics, we evaluate the HARMONIE and Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale models for two contrasting warm fog episodes at the relatively flat terrain around the Cabauw tower facility in the Netherlands. One case involves a radiation fog that arose in calm anticyclonic conditions, and the second is a radiation fog that developed just after a cold front passage. The WRF model represents the radiation fog well, while the HARMONIE model forecasts a stratus lowering fog layer in the first case and hardly any fog in the second case. Permutations of parametrization schemes for boundary-layer mixing, radiation and microphysics, each for two levels of complexity, have been evaluated within the WRF model. It appears that the boundary-layer formulation is critical for forecasting the fog onset, while for fog dispersal the choice of the microphysical scheme is a key element, where a double-moment scheme outperforms any of the single-moment schemes. Finally, the WRF model results appear to be relatively insensitive to horizontal grid spacing, but nesting deteriorates the modelled fog formation. Increasing the domain size leads to a more scattered character of the simulated fog. Model results with one-way or two-way nesting show approximately comparable results.

AB Unraveling the distribution patterns of plants and animals along the elevational gradients has been attracting growing scientific interests of ecologists, whether the microbial communities exhibit similar elevational patterns, however, remains largely less documented. Here, we investigate the biogeographic distribution of soil archaeal and bacterial communities across three vertical climate zones (3,106-4,479 m.a.s.l.) in Mt. Shegyla on the Tibetan Plateau, by combining quantitative PCR and high-throughput barcoded pyrosequencing approaches. Our results found that the ratio of bacterial to archaeal 16S rRNA gene abundance was negatively related with elevation. Acidobacteria dominated in the bacterial communities, Marine benthic group A dominated in the archaeal communities, and the relative abundance of both taxa changed significantly with elevation. At the taxonomic levels of domain, phylum, and class, more bacterial taxa than archaeal exhibited declining trend in diversity along the increasing elevational gradient, as revealed by Shannon and Faith's phylogenetic diversity indices. Unweighted UniFrac distance clustering showed that the bacterial communities from the mountainous temperate zone clustered together, whereas those from the subalpine cool temperate zone clustered together. However, the partitioning effect of elevational zones on the archaeal community was much weaker compared to that on bacteria. Redundancy analysis revealed that soil geochemical factors explained 58.3 % of the bacterial community variance and 75.4 % of the archaeal community variance. Taken together, we provide evidence that soil bacteria exhibited more apparent elevational zonation feature and decreased diversity pattern than archaea with increasing elevation, and distribution patterns of soil microbes are strongly regulated by soil properties along elevational gradient in this plateau montane ecosystem.

AB In cold climates, the expected global warming will lead to earlier cambial resumptions in spring, with a resultant lengthening of the growing season but unknown consequences on forest productivity. The phenological traits of cambium activity and xylem formation were analyzed at a short time scale along a thermal gradient represented by an alti-latitudinal range from the 48th to 53rd parallels and covering the whole closed black-spruce [ Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP] forest in Quebec, Canada. A hypothesis was tested that warmer temperatures influence cambium phenology, allowing longer duration and higher intensity of growth, and resulting in proportionally increased xylem production. From April to October 2012, cell division in cambium and post-cambial differentiation of xylem were observed on anatomical sections obtained from microcores collected weekly from the stem of fifty trees. The southern and warmer site was characterized by the highest radial growth, which corresponded to both the highest rates and longest durations of cell production. The differences in terms of xylem phenology and growth were marginal between the other sites. Xylem growth was positively correlated with rate and duration of cell production, with the latter explaining most variability in growth. Within the range analyzed, the relationship between temperature and most phenological phases of xylogenesis was linear. On the contrary, temperature was related with cell production according to an exponential pattern. Periods of xylogenesis of 14 days longer (+13.1%) corresponded to a massive increase in cell production (33 cells, +109%). This disproportionate change occurred at a May-September average temperature of ca. 14 degrees C and a snow-free period of 210-235 days. At the lower boundary of the distribution of black spruce, small environmental changes allowing marginal lengthening of the period of cell division could potentially lead to disproportionate increases in xylem cell production, with substantial consequences for the productivity of this boreal species.

AB Phylogeography and ecological niche models (ENMs) suggest that late Quaternary glacial cycles have played a prominent role in shaping present population genetic structure and diversity, but have not applied quantitative methods to dissect the relative contribution of past and present climate vs. other forces. We integrate multilocus phylogeography, climate-based ENMs and multivariate statistical approaches to infer the effects of late Quaternary climate change on contemporary genetic variation of valley oak (Quercus lobata Nee). ENMs indicated that valley oak maintained a stable distribution with local migration from the last interglacial period (similar to 120ka) to the Last Glacial Maximum (similar to 21ka, LGM) to the present compared with large-scale range shifts for an eastern North American white oak (Quercus alba L.). Coast Range and Sierra Nevada foothill populations diverged in the late Pleistocene before the LGM [104ka (28-1622)] and have occupied somewhat distinct climate niches, according to ENMs and coalescent analyses of divergence time. In accordance with neutral expectations for stable populations, nuclear microsatellite diversity positively correlated with niche stability from the LGM to present. Most strikingly, nuclear and chloroplast microsatellite variation significantly correlated with LGM climate, even after controlling for associations with geographic location and present climate using partial redundancy analyses. Variance partitioning showed that LGM climate uniquely explains a similar proportion of genetic variance as present climate (16% vs. 11-18%), and together, past and present climate explains more than geography (19%). Climate can influence local expansion-contraction dynamics, flowering phenology and thus gene flow, and/or impose selective pressures. These results highlight the lingering effect of past climate on genetic variation in species with stable distributions.

AB A stochastic advection-reaction-diffusion model with terms of multiplicative white Gaussian noise, valid for weakly mixed waters, is studied to obtain the vertical stationary spatial distributions of two groups of picophytoplankton, i.e., picoeukaryotes and Prochlorococcus, which account about for 60% of total chlorophyll on average in Mediterranean Sea. By numerically solving the equations of the model, we analyze the one-dimensional spatio-temporal dynamics of the total picophytoplankton biomass and nutrient concentration along the water column at different depths. In particular, we integrate the equations over a time interval long enough, obtaining the steady spatial distributions for the cell concentrations of the two picophytoplankton groups. The results are converted into chlorophyll a and divinil chlorophyll a concentrations and compared with experimental data collected in two different sites of the Sicily Channel (southern Mediterranean Sea). The comparison shows that real distributions are well reproduced by theoretical profiles. Specifically, position, shape and magnitude of the theoretical deep chlorophyll maximum exhibit a good agreement with the experimental values.

AB The question of why there are so many plant species needs two kinds of answer: an explanation for the origin of plant species, and an explanation for how they can coexist. Pollinators are often implicated in the origin of plant species because adaptation to different modes of pollination can drive divergence in floral traits and bring about reproductive isolation. However, very few studies have attempted to answer the next question: 'Can plant species that differ only in their mode of pollination coexist?' Fragmentary evidence supports the idea that intraspecific competition for pollination resources can limit population growth rate, thus allowing the coexistence of species that use different pollinators, or the same pollinators at different times.

AB The development of fine-resolution climate grids is an important priority in explaining species' distributions at the regional scale and predicting how species may respond to variable and changing climates. Recent studies have demonstrated advantages of producing these grids using large networks of inexpensive climate loggers, as the resulting grids can capture local climatic variations over a range of environments. In this study we extend these methods to develop innovative fine-resolution (25 m) climate grids for a large region (similar to 200 x 300 km) of New South Wales, Australia. The key aspects of these grids is that they: (1) are based on near-surface (5 cm) observations to better reflect where many species live; (2) cover a wide variety of habitats including forests, woodlands and grasslands so that they are broadly applicable; (3) include both temperature and humidity, the latter of which has often been neglected in similar studies; (4) are developed using a variety of climate-forcing factors rather than relying only on elevation and geographic location; and (5) they focus on the extreme temperatures and humidities regardless of when these occur. Analyses showed that elevation was the dominant factor explaining mild temperatures (low maximums, high minimums), but cold air drainage, distance from coast, canopy cover and topographic exposure had more effect on the extreme maximum and minimum temperatures. Humidities were predominately determined by distance to coast, elevation, canopy cover and topography; however, the relationships were nonlinear and varied in both shape and effect size between dry and moist extremes. Extreme climates occur under specific weather conditions, and our results highlight how averaging climates over seasons or periods of consecutive days will include different weather patterns and obscure important trends. Regional-scale climate grids can potentially be further improved through a better understanding of how the effects of different climate-forcing factors vary under different weather conditions.

AB The CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford) ecosystem model has been used to estimate monthly carbon fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems from 2000 to 2009, with global data inputs from NASA's Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation cover mapping. Net primary production (NPP) flux for atmospheric carbon dioxide has varied slightly from year-to-year, but was predicted to have increased over short multi-year periods in the regions of the high-latitude Northern Hemisphere, South Asia, Central Africa, and the western Amazon since the year 2000. These CASA results for global NPP were found to be in contrast to other recently published modeling trends for terrestrial NPP with high sensitivity to regional drying patterns. Nonetheless, periodic declines in regional NPP were predicted by CASA for the southern and western Untied States, the southern Amazon, and southern and eastern Africa. NPP in tropical forest zones was examined in greater detail to discover lower annual production values than previously reported in many global models across the tropical rainforest zones, likely due to the enhanced detection of lower production ecosystems replacing primary rainforest.

AB 1. Species diversity of arboreal arthropods tends to increase during rainforest succession so that primary forest communities comprise more species than those from secondary vegetation, but it is not well understood why. Primary forests differ from secondary forests in a wide array of factors whose relative impacts on arthropod diversity have not yet been quantified. 2. We assessed the effects of succession-related determinants on a keystone ecological group, arboreal ants, by conducting a complete census of 1332 ant nests from all trees with diameter at breast height = 5 cm occurring within two (unreplicated) 0.32-ha plots, one in primary and one in secondary lowland forest in New Guinea. Specifically, we used a novel rarefaction-based approach to match number, size distribution and taxonomic structure of trees in primary forest communities to those in secondary forest and compared the resulting numbers of ant species. 3. In total, we recorded 80 nesting ant species from 389 trees in primary forest but only 42 species from 295 trees in secondary forest. The two habitats did not differ in the mean number of ant species per tree or in the relationship between ant diversity and tree size. However, the between-tree similarity of ant communities was higher in secondary forest than in primary forest, as was the between-tree nest site similarity, suggesting that secondary trees were more uniform in providing nesting microhabitats. 4. Using our rarefaction method, the difference in ant species richness between two forest types was partitioned according to the effects of higher tree density (22.6%), larger tree size (15.5%) and higher taxonomic diversity of trees (14.3%) in primary than in secondary forest. The remaining difference (47.6%) was because of higher beta diversity of ant communities between primary forest trees. In contrast, difference in nest density was explained solely by difference in tree density. 5. Our study shows that reduction in plant taxonomic diversity in secondary forests is not the main driver of the reduction in canopy ant species richness. We suggest that the majority of arboreal species losses in secondary tropical forests are attributable to simpler vegetation structure, combined with lower turnover of nesting microhabitats between trees.

AB Because of the uncertainties and complexities of the factors involved in causing landslides, it is generally difficult to analyze their influences quantitatively and to predict the probability of landslide occurrence. In this work, a hybrid method based on Bayesian network (BN) is proposed to analyze earthquake-induced landslide-causing factors and assess their effects. Our study area is Beichuan, China, where landslides have occurred in recent years, including mass landslides triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. To provide a robust assessment of landslide probability, key techniques from landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA) modeling with BN are explored, including data acquisition and processing, BN modeling, and validation. In the study, eight landslide-causing factors were chosen as the independent variables for BN modeling. And this study shows that lithology and Arias intensity are the major factors affecting landslides in the study area. On the basis of the a posteriori probability distribution, the occurrence of a landslide is highly sensitive to relief amplitudes above 116.5 m. Using a 10-fold cross-validation and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the resulting accuracy of the BN model was determined to be 93%, which demonstrates that the model achieves a high probability of landslide detection and is a good alternative tool for landslide assessment.

AB Both ploidy and hybridity affect cell size and growth vigor in plants and animals, but the relative effects of genome dosage and hybridization on biomass, fitness, and gene expression changes have not been systematically examined. Here we performed the first comparative analysis of seed, cell, and flower sizes, starch and chlorophyll content, biomass, and gene expression changes in diploid, triploid, and tetraploid hybrids and their respective parents in three Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes: Columbia, C24, and Landsberg erecta (Ler). Ploidy affects many morphological and fitness traits, including stomatal size, flower size, and seed weight, whereas hybridization between the ecotypes leads to altered expression of central circadian clock genes and increased starch and chlorophyll content, biomass, and seed weight. However, varying ploidy levels has subtle effects on biomass, circadian clock gene expression, and chlorophyll and starch content. Interestingly, biomass, starch content, and seed weight are significantly different between the reciprocal hybrids at all ploidy levels tested, with the lowest and highest levels found in the reciprocal triploid hybrids, suggesting parent-of-origin effects on biomass, starch content, and seed weight. These findings provide new insights into molecular events of polyploidy and heterosis, as well as complex agronomic traits that are important to biomass and seed production in hybrid and polyploid crops.

AB Aim To investigate how species richness and similarity of non-native plants varies along gradients of elevation and human disturbance.
   Location Eight mountain regions on four continents and two oceanic islands.
   Methods We compared the distribution of non-native plant species along roads in eight mountainous regions. Within each region, abundance of plant species was recorded at 41-84 sites along elevational gradients using 100-m(2) plots located 0, 25 and 75 m from roadsides. We used mixed-effects models to examine how local variation in species richness and similarity were affected by processes at three scales: among regions (global), along elevational gradients (regional) and with distance from the road (local). We used model selection and information criteria to choose best-fit models of species richness along elevational gradients. We performed a hierarchical clustering of similarity to investigate human-related factors and environmental filtering as potential drivers at the global scale.
   Results Species richness and similarity of non-native plant species along elevational gradients were strongly influenced by factors operating at scales ranging from 100 m to 1000s of km. Non-native species richness was highest in the New World regions, reflecting the effects of colonization from Europe. Similarity among regions was low and due mainly to certain Eurasian species, mostly native to temperate Europe, occurring in all New World regions. Elevation and distance from the road explained little of the variation in similarity. The elevational distribution of non-native species richness varied, but was always greatest in the lower third of the range. In all regions, non-native species richness declined away from roadsides. In three regions, this decline was steeper at higher elevations, and there was an interaction between distance and elevation.
   Main conclusions Because non-native plant species are affected by processes operating at global, regional and local scales, a multi-scale perspective is needed to understand their patterns of distribution. The processes involved include global dispersal, filtering along elevational gradients and differential establishment with distance from roadsides.

AB Identifying factors shaping variation in resource selection is central for our understanding of the behaviour and distribution of animals. We examined summer habitat selection and space use by 108 Global Positioning System (GPS)-collared moose in Norway in relation to sex, reproductive status, habitat quality, and availability. Moose selected habitat types based on a combination of forage quality and availability of suitable habitat types. Selection of protective cover was strongest for reproducing females, likely reflecting the need to protect young. Males showed strong selection for habitat types with high quality forage, possibly due to higher energy requirements. Selection for preferred habitat types providing food and cover was a positive function of their availability within home ranges (i.e. not proportional use) indicating functional response in habitat selection. This relationship was not found for unproductive habitat types. Moreover, home ranges with high cover of unproductive habitat types were larger, and smaller home ranges contained higher proportions of the most preferred habitat type. The distribution of moose within the study area was partly related to the distribution of different habitat types. Our study shows how distribution and availability of habitat types providing cover and high-quality food shape ungulate habitat selection and space use.

AB Aim Species specialization, which plays a fundamental role in niche differentiation and species coexistence, is a key biological trait in relation to the responses of populations to changing environments. Species with a limited niche breadth are considered to experience a higher risk of extinction than generalist species. This work aims to measure the degree of specialization in the regional flora of the French Alps and test whether species specialization is related to species rarity and ecological characteristics.
   Location This study was conducted in the French Alps region, which encompasses a large elevational gradient over a relatively limited area (26,000 km(2)).
   Methods Specialization was estimated for approximately 1200 plant species found in the region. Given the inherent difficulty of pinpointing the critical environmental niche axes for each individual species, we used a co-occurrence-based index to estimate species niche breadths (specialization index). This comprehensive measurement included crucial undetermined limiting niche factors, acting on both local and regional scales, and related to both biotic and abiotic interactions. The specialization index for each species was then related to a selection of plant typologies such as Grime strategies and Raunkiaer life-forms, and to two measurements of plant rarity, namely regional area of occupancy and local abundance.
   Results Specialist species were mainly found in specific and harsh environments such as wetlands, cold alpine habitats and dry heathlands. These species were usually geographically restricted but relatively dominant in their local communities. Although none of the selected traits were sufficient predictors of specialization, pure competitors were over-represented amongst generalist species, whereas stress-tolerant species tended to be more specialized.
   Main conclusions Our results suggest that co-occurrence-based indices of niche breadth are a satisfactory method for inferring plant specialization using large species samples across very heterogeneous environments. Our results are an empirical validation of the tolerance-dominance trade-off and also provide interesting insights into the long-standing question of which biological properties characterize species with narrow niche breadth that are potentially threatened by global changes in the environment.

In the case of European mammals, key potential drivers of large-scale beta diversity include current climate, neutral dynamics and two historical factors: Pleistocene glaciations and peninsular dynamics (immigration from extra-regional eastern faunal source areas and inter-linked relictual survival and evolutionary differentiation in isolated areas).
   2. We assessed the relative importance of these drivers using a novel analytical framework to deconstruct beta diversity of non-volant mammals in Europe (138 species) into its turnover (change in species composition because of species replacements) and nestedness components (change in species composition because of species richness differences) at continental and regional (250 000 km2) scales.
   3. We found continental-scale mammal beta diversity to be mainly caused by spatial turnover (99 center dot 9%), with only a small contribution (0 center dot 1%) from nestedness.
   4. Current climate emerged as an important driver of beta diversity, given the strong continental-scale turnover, particularly in north-south direction, i.e., in line with the latitudinal climate gradient, and, more directly, the strong correlation of climate with spatial turnover at both continental and regional scales.
   5. However, there was also evidence for the importance of non-climatic drivers. Notably, the compositional variation purely accounted for by space was greater than that purely accounted for by environment for both the turnover and the nestedness component of beta diversity. Furthermore, the strong longitudinal turnover within Southern Europe is in accordance with the region's long-term climatic stability having allowed multiple refugia and local evolutionary diversification. As expected from peninsular dynamics, there was increasing dissimilarity with geographic distance in an east-west direction because of nestedness, but only in Central and Northern Europe.
   6. In conclusion, European mammal beta diversity mainly reflects spatial turnover and only to a limited extent nestedness and is driven by current climate in combination with historical - and perhaps, neutral - dynamics. These findings suggest that a key challenge for climate-change predictive studies will be taking the influence of non-climatic factors into account.

AB Background: Twelve distinct explanations have been proposed for the co-existence of species in ecological communities.
   Types of mechanism: The mechanisms can be divided into those that are stabilizing, i.e. with an increase-when-rare mechanism, and those that are equalizing, the latter on their own only delaying the exclusion of species. However, by evening out fitness, equalizing mechanisms can facilitate the operation of stabilizing mechanisms.
   Importance: It is suggested that circular interference networks, co-evolution of similar interference ability, cyclic succession, equal chance (neutrality) and initial patch composition are likely to be unimportant, or perhaps not even occur. Equal chance is an equalizing mechanism. Allogenic disturbance, alpha-niche differentiation, environmental fluctuation (relative non-linearity and/or the storage effect) and pest pressure are probably important. All four are stabilizing. More evidence is needed on aggregation, interference/dispersal trade-offs and the spatial mass effect. Aggregation and the spatial mass effect are equalizing. Suggestions are made of the evidence needed to make informed judgements on which contribute the most to co-existence in plant communities.

AB Urban growth is a key concern for planners as it has considerable ecological impact. In both Switzerland and the European Union this growth has mostly proceeded at the expense of agricultural land. It is not yet, however, well understood what drives this extensive land-use change. This study assesses the influence of proximity to motorway exits on urban growth and analyses urban growth along some of the main motorways in Switzerland. The analysis is based on two data collection campaigns from the Land Use Statistics with a time difference of 12 years. Proximity is measured as the distance from a motorway exit, which we related to changes in the entire urban areas and their subclasses 'Building areas', 'Industrial areas' and 'Transportation areas'. Linear regression revealed a significant distance trend whereby the closer an area lies to a motorway exit, the higher the rate of urban growth. Industrial areas show the strongest distance trend. Further, variance partitioning revealed the exclusive explanatory power of distance from a motorway exit by partialling out two further potential predictors, the previous urban area and the local relief. We found significant effects of distance, e.g. on industrial areas in the Central Plateau and on building areas in the Central Alps. There, we can assume a causal relationship between proximity to motorway exits and urban growth. Regarding ecoregions or urban subclasses, no uniform picture emerged. We thus recommend discussing urban sprawl separately for different areas and subcategories of urban land. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim
   To identify the biogeographical factors underlying spider species richness in the Macaronesian region and assess the importance of species extinctions in shaping the current diversity.
   Location
   The European archipelagos of Macaronesia with an emphasis on the Azores and Canary Islands.
   Methods
   Seven variables were tested as predictors of single-island endemics (SIE), archipelago endemics and indigenous spider species richness in the Azores, Canary Islands and Macaronesia as a whole: island area; geological age; maximum elevation; distance from mainland; distance from the closest island; distance from an older island; and natural forest area remaining per island - a measure of deforestation (the latter only in the Azores). Different mathematical formulations of the general dynamic model of oceanic island biogeography (GDM) were also tested.
   Results
   Island area and the proportion of remaining natural forest were the best predictors of species richness in the Azores. In the Canary Islands, area alone did not explain the richness of spiders. However, a hump-shaped relationship between richness and time was apparent in these islands. The island richness in Macaronesia was correlated with island area, geological age, maximum elevation and distance to mainland.
   Main conclusions
   In Macaronesia as a whole, area, island age, the large distance that separates the Azores from the mainland, and the recent disappearance of native habitats with subsequent unrecorded extinctions seem to be the most probable explanations for the current observed richness. In the Canary Islands, the GDM model is strongly supported by many genera that radiated early, reached a peak at intermediate island ages, and have gone extinct on older, eroded islands. In the Azores, the unrecorded extinctions of many species in the oldest, most disturbed islands seem to be one of the main drivers of the current richness patterns. Spiders, the most important terrestrial predators on these islands, may be acting as early indicators for the future disappearance of other insular taxa.

AB Seasonal drought can severely impact leaf photosynthetic capacity. This is particularly important for Mediterranean forests, where precipitation is expected to decrease as a consequence of climate change. Impacts of increased drought on the photosynthetic capacity of the evergreen Quercus ilex were studied for two years in a mature forest submitted to long-term throughfall exclusion. Gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence were measured on two successive leaf cohorts in a control and a dry plot. Exclusion significantly reduced leaf water potential in the dry treatment. In both treatments, light-saturated net assimilation rate (A(max)), stomatal conductance (g(s)), maximum carboxylation rate (V-cmax), maximum rate of electron transport (J(max)), mesophyll conductance to CO2 (g(m)) and nitrogen investment in photosynthesis decreased markedly with soil water limitation during summer. The relationships between leaf photosynthetic parameters and leaf water potential remained identical in the two treatments. Leaf and canopy acclimation to progressive, long-term drought occurred through changes in leaf area index, leaf mass per area and leaf chemical composition, but not through modifications of physiological parameters.

AB Effective ecosystem management in the face of human alterations depends on our ability to quantify ecologically significant changes and to discriminate among impact levels and types We reviewed the literature on biological responses of freshwater biota to human disturbances over the last century. Many of the main methods for assessing ecological integrity originated in Europe [e g, Saprobien Index, Trent Biotic Index, Biological Monitoring Working Party, River InVertebrate Prediction And Classification System, multiple traits] or in North America [e.g., Index of Biotic Integrity, leaf-litter breakdown, functional feeding groups] We used bibliometric data to detail the contribution of J-NABS to developments in assessment of ecological integrity. A total of 225 bioassessment articles were published in J-NABS from 1986 to 2007 This total was similar to 1/2 of the number of bioassessment articles published over the same period in Freshwater Biology (FWB, another leading freshwater journal used for comparison), but the proportion of bioassessment articles in the 2 journals was similar (similar to 20%). The proportion of bioassessment articles in J-NABS has increased over the last 25 y. This trend indicates the growing interest in the topic and the delay (similar to 30 y since the Clean Water Act) of scientific action in response to water legislation Taxonomic composition and multivariate techniques, multimetric indices, lotic systems, macroinvertebrates, land use, and overall human impacts were major themes in J-NABS bioassessment articles. Progress in bioassessment is needed in 3 main areas First, bioassessments done at large spatial scales are needed to meet requirements of new environmental policies Second, bioassessment should shift from consideration of taxon losses to losses of ecological functions Third, statistical techniques are needed for predictive assessment of deviation in ecological integrity between expected (natural) and observed (natural or impacted) conditions. Assessment of functional integrity based on multiple traits is a promising area because biological traits represent universal biological characteristics that are connected to ecosystem functions However, the relationships between ecophysiological traits of individuals and ecosystem-scale responses must be properly defined for specific types of human impairment, and utility of the approach for routine bioassessments applied by managers must be tested.

AB As carbon and energy flow through the soil food web they are depleted by the metabolic and production functions of organisms. To be sustained, a "long" food web, with a large biomass at higher trophic levels, must receive a high rate of rhizode-position or detrital subsidy, or be top-populated by organisms of slow growth and long life cycle. Disturbed soil flood webs tend to be bottom heavy and recalcitrant to restoration due to the slow growth of upper predator populations, physical and chemical constraints of the soil matrix, biological imbalances, and the relatively low mobility and invasion potential of soil organisms. The functional roles of nematodes, determined by their metabolic and behavioral activities, may be categorized as ecosystem services, disservices or effect-neutral. Among the disservices attributable to nematodes are overgrazing, which diminishes services of prey organisms, and plant-damaging herbivory, which reduces carbon fixation and availability to other organisms in the food web. Unfortunately, management to ameliorate potential disservices of certain nematodes results in unintended but long-lasting diminution of the services of others. Beneficial roles of nematodes may be enhanced by environmental stewardship that fosters greater biodiversity and, consequently, complementarity and continuity of their services.

AB The modeling of mid-trophic organisms of the pelagic ecosystem is a critical step in linking the coupled physical-biogeochemical models to population dynamics of large pelagic predators. Here, we provide an example of a modeling approach with definitions of several pelagic mid-trophic functional groups. This application includes six different groups characterized by their vertical behavior, i.e., occurrence of diet migration between epipelagic, mesopelagic and bathypelagic layers. Parameterization of the dynamics of these components is based on a temperature-linked time development relationship. Estimated parameters of this relationship are close to those predicted by a model based on a theoretical description of the allocation of metabolic energy at the cellular level, and that predicts a species metabolic rate in terms of its body mass and temperature. Then, a simple energy transfer from primary production is used, justified by the existence of constant slopes in log-log biomass size spectrum relationships. Recruitment, ageing, mortality and passive transport with horizontal currents, taking into account vertical behavior of organisms, are modeled by a system of advection-diffusion-reaction equations. Temperature and currents averaged in each vertical layer are provided independently by an Ocean General Circulation Model and used to drive the mid-trophic level (MTL) model. Simulation outputs are presented for the tropical Pacific Ocean to illustrate how different temperature and oceanic circulation conditions result in spatial and temporal lags between regions of high primary production and regions of aggregation of mid-trophic biomass. Predicted biomasses are compared against available data. Data requirements to evaluate outputs of these types of models are discussed, as well as the prospects that they offer both for ecosystem models of lower and upper trophic levels.

AB 1. Although plant nitrogen (N) strategies may play an important role for community structure and ecosystem functioning, there is not a clear understanding of the link between N acquisition by roots and N utilization by shoots. Particularly, it is unclear how the co-variations between size-and physiology-related traits determine N acquisition and N utilization at the plant scale.
   2. We used 13 co-occurring temperate pasture grasses to study inter-specific variations in above-ground N yield and in root N acquisition and shoot N utilization traits. N acquisition traits concerned root influx capacities for NO3- and NH4+, root mass and specific root area in ingrowth cores. N utilization traits concerned leaf life span, leaf N content, leaf N resorption, mean residence time of N and leaf N use efficiency.
   3. We found evidence for three trade-offs across species concerning root N acquisition: (i) root mass increased when specific root area declined; (ii) an increase in NO3- root area was observed when total N influx capacity decreased; and (iii) root influx capacity increased when NH4+ capacity declined.
   4. High total root uptake capacity gave rise to high leaf N content and was associated across species to low leaf N use efficiency. Tall grasses were characterized by high shoot N yield, high root biomass and high leaf N use efficiency. Physiology-related traits and size-related traits were generally found independent.
   5. Our study demonstrates how size and N uptake related root traits are associated to major axes of plant specialization ((i) plant size and (ii) conservation vs. exploitation of N) which were previously identified based on shoot traits. Contrasted N strategies were segregated across species according to four combinations along these two axes.

AB Condition indices are commonly used in an attempt to link body condition of birds to ecological variables of interest, including demographic attributes such as survival and reproduction. Most indices are based on body mass adjusted for structural body size, calculated as simple ratios or residuals from regressions. However, condition indices are often applied without confirming their predictive value (i.e., without being validated against measured values of fat and protein), which we term 'unverified' use. We evaluated the ability of a number of unverified indices frequently found in the literature to predict absolute and proportional levels of fat and protein across five species of waterfowl. Among indices we considered, those accounting for body size never predicted absolute protein more precisely than body mass, however, some indices improved predictability of fat, although the form of the best index varied by species. Further, the gain in precision by using a condition index to predict either absolute or percent fat was minimal (rise in r(2)<= 0.13), and in many cases model fit was actually reduced. Our data agrees with previous assertions that the assumption that indices provide more precise indicators of body condition than body mass alone is often invalid. We strongly discourage the use of unverified indices, because subjectively selecting indices likely does little to improve precision and might in fact decrease predictability relative to using body mass alone.

AB Little is known about the nature of species boundaries between closely related plant species and about the extent of introgression as a consequence of hybridization upon secondary contact. To address these topics we analyzed genome-wide differentiation between two closely related Silene species, Silene latifolia and S. dioica, and assessed the strength of introgression in sympatry. More than 300 AFLP markers were genotyped in three allopatric and three sympatric populations of each species. Outlier analyses were performed separately for sympatric and allopatric populations. Both positive and negative outlier loci were found, indicating that divergent and balancing selection, respectively, have shaped patterns of divergence between the two species. Sympatric populations of the two species were found to be less differentiated genetically than allopatric populations, indicating that hybridization has led to gene introgression. We conclude that differentiation between S. latifolia and S. dioica has been shaped by a combination of introgression and selection. These results challenge the view that species differentiation is a genome-wide phenomenon, and instead support the idea that genomes can be porous and that species differentiation has a genic basis.

AB Mate searching is a risky behavior that decreases survival by increasing predation risk and the risk of energy depletion. However, few studies have quantified actual mortality during mate search, making it difficult to predict mate searching and mating strategies. Using a mark and recapture study, we examined mate-searching success in a highly sexually dimorphic species, the golden orb-web spider (Nephila plumipes). We show that despite the high-density aggregations of this species, male survival during mate searching is extremely low (36%) and is phenotype independent. Surprisingly, males that survived mate search were in better condition after recapture than prior to release, most likely due to kleptoparasitism on females' webs. In a complementary release experiment in a field enclosure, we show that males are choosy and adjust their choice of female depending on their own condition and weight. Thus, the high mortality rate of searching males in the field may be a cost of choosiness because released males traveled further than necessary to settle on females. Although males were choosy about female phenotypes, they did not avoid webs with rival males already present. This suggests that the cost of continued searching outweighs the cost of competition but not the cost of mating with certain females. Further examinations of mate-searching risk in other species in reference to their mating system and environmental conditions are necessary to determine the occurrence and effects of high mortality rates during searching.

AB Relatively little is known about the evolutionary and demographic histories of gorillas, one of our closest living relatives. In this study, we used samples from both western (Gorilla gorilla) and eastern (Gorilla beringei) gorillas to infer the timing of the split between these geographically disjunct populations and to elaborate the demographic history of gorillas. Here we present DNA sequences from 16 noncoding autosomal loci from 15 western gorillas and 3 eastern gorillas, including 2 noninvasively sampled free-ranging individuals. We find that the genetic diversity of gorillas is similar to that of chimpanzees but almost twice as high as that of bonobos and humans. A significantly positive Fu & Li's D was observed for western gorillas, suggesting a complex demographic history with a constant, long-term population size and ancestral population structure. Among different population-split scenarios, our data suggest a complex history of western and eastern gorillas including an initial population split at around 0.9-1.6 MYA and subsequent, primarily male-mediated gene flow until approximately 80,000-200,000 years ago. Furthermore, simulations revealed that more gene flow took place from eastern to western gorilla populations than vice versa.

AB The global-scale natural experiment created by the widespread dissemination of most of the I I I species of pines (genus Pinus, family Pinaceae) has shed light on many aspects of plant invasion ecology. Introductions and the fate of alien pines have been well documented worldwide, facilitating the accurate labelling of species as "naturalized", "invasive", or "non-invasive" using objective criteria. Thirty species are naturalized and 21 are invasive. Three life-history traits that clearly separate invasive from non-invasive taxa define the inherent ability of species to disperse over long distances, win in competition against other plants, and to survive or proliferate under a range of disturbance regimes. The realization of colonization opportunities for potentially invasive pines is determined by extrinsic factors, especially those that mediate seedling establishment. Meta-analysis of many introduction/invasion events revealed the interplay of factors. Detailed studies of pine invasions have elucidated the roles of long-distance seed dispersal and propagule pressure in driving invasions. Enhanced understanding of the ecology of pine invasions has improved our ability to manage these invasions. No other speciose genus of plants has yielded important insights on so many facets of invasion ecology.

AB The genetic variability and population structure of Plasmodium falciparum are key factors in malaria control strategies. Studies have suggested no P. falciparum population structure although linkage disequilibrium was observed in some African areas. We have assessed length polymorphism at 6-22 microsatellites in four urban and rural sites (Djibouti, Dakar, Niamey, and Zouan-Hounien, n = 240 blood samples). Results have shown a P. falciparum population structure in Africa (Fst = 0.17-0.24), lower genetic diversity in Djibouti (He = 0.53) than in the other sites (He = 0.73-0.76), and 3) significant linkage disequilibrium in Djibouti. These results could be related to geographic isolation and low flow of parasites between sites. They also suggest a potential effect of rural suburbs to generate genetic diversity in towns. This could affect the dispersal of selected drug resistance and should be considered when adapting urban malaria control strategies.

AB We define a genetic similarity rule that predicts how genetic variation in a dominant plant affects the structure of an arthropod community. This rule applies to hybridizing cottonwood species where plant genetic variation determines plant-animal interactions and structures a dependent community of leaf-modifying arthropods. Because the associated arthropod community is expected to respond to important plant traits, we also tested whether plant chemical composition is one potential intermediate link between plant genes and arthropod community composition. Two lines of evidence support our genetic similarity rule. First, in a common garden experiment we found that trees with similar genetic compositions had similar chemical compositions and similar arthropod compositions. Second, in a wild population, we found a similar relationship between genetic similarity in cottonwoods and the dependent arthropod community. Field data demonstrate that the relationship between genes and arthropods was also significant when the hybrids were analysed alone, i.e. the pattern is not dependent upon the inclusion of both parental species. Because plant-animal interactions and natural hybridization are common to diverse plant taxa, we suggest that a genetic similarity rule is potentially applicable, and may be extended, to other systems and ecological processes. For example, plants with similar genetic compositions may exhibit similar litter decomposition rates. A corollary to this genetic similarity rule predicts that in systems with low plant genetic variability, the environment will be a stronger factor structuring the dependent community. Our findings argue that the genetic composition of a dominant plant can structure higher order ecological processes, thus placing community and ecosystem ecology within a genetic and evolutionary framework. A genetic similarity rule also has important conservation implications because the loss of genetic diversity in one species, especially dominant or keystone species that define many communities, may cascade to negatively affect the rest of the dependent community.

AB Experiments addressing the role of plant species diversity for ecosystem functioning have recently proliferated. Most studies have focused on plant biomass responses. However, microbial processes involved in the production of N(2)O and the oxidation of atmospheric CH(4) could potentially be affected via effects on N cycling, on soil diffusive properties (due to changes in water relations and root architecture) and by more direct interactions of plants with soil microbes. We studied ecosystem-level CH(4) and N(2)O fluxes in experimental communities assembled from two pasture soils and from combinations of 1, 3, 6, 8 or 9 species typical for these pastures. The soils contrasted with respect to texture and fertility. N(2)O emissions decreased with diversity and increased in the presence of legumes. Soils were sinks for CH(4) at all times; legume monocultures were a smaller sink for atmospheric CH(4) than non-legume monocultures, but no effect of species richness per se was detected. However, both the exchange of CH(4) and N(2)O strongly depended on plant community composition, and on the interaction of composition with soil type, indicating that the functional role of species and their interactions differed between soils. N(2)O fluxes were mainly driven by effects on soil nitrate and on nitrification while soil moisture had less of an effect. Soil microbial C and N and N mineralisation rates were not altered. The driver of the interactive soil typexplant community composition-effects was less clear. Because soil methanotrophs may take longer to respond to alterations of N cycling than the 1/2 year treatment in this study, we also tested species richness-effects in two separate 5-year field studies, but results were ambiguous, indicating complex interactions with soil disturbance. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that plant community composition can affect the soil trace gas balance, whereas plant species richness per se was less important; it also indicates a potential link between the botanical composition of plant communities and global warming.

AB Aim To test predictions of different large-scale biodiversity hypotheses by analysing species richness patterns of vascular plants in the Austrian Alps.
   Location The Austrian part of the Alps (c. 53,500 km(2)).
   Methods Within the floristic inventory of Central Europe the Austrian part of the Alps were systematically mapped for vascular plants. Data collection was based on a rectangular grid of 5 x 3 arc minutes (34-35 km(2)). Emerging species richness patterns were correlated with several environmental factors using generalized linear models. Primary environmental variables like temperature, precipitation and evapotranspiration were used to test climate-related hypotheses of species richness. Additionally, spatial and temporal variations in climatic conditions were considered. Bedrock geology, particularly the amount of calcareous substrates, the proximity to rivers and lakes and secondary variables like topographic, edaphic and land-use heterogeneity were used as additional predictors. Model results were evaluated by correlating modelled and observed species numbers.
   Result Our final multiple regression model explains c. 50% of the variance in species richness patterns. Model evaluation results in a correlation coefficient of 0.64 between modelled and observed species numbers in an independent test data set. Climatic variables like temperature and potential evapotranspiration (PET) proved to be by far the most important predictors. In general, variables indicating climatic favourableness like the maxima of temperature and PET performed better than those indicating stress, like the respective minima. Bedrock mineralogy, especially the amount of calcareous substrate, had some additional explanatory power but was less influential than suggested by comparable studies. The amount of precipitation does not have any effect on species richness regionally. Among the descriptors of heterogeneity, edaphic and land-use heterogeneity are more closely correlated with species numbers than topographic heterogeneity.
   Main conclusions The results support energy-driven processes as primary determinants of vascular plant species richness in temperate mountains. Stressful conditions obviously decrease species numbers, but presence of favourable habitats has higher predictive power in the context of species richness modelling. The importance of precipitation for driving global species diversity patterns is not necessarily reflected regionally. Annual range of temperature, an indicator of short-term climatic stability, proved to be of minor importance for the determination of regional species richness patterns. In general, our study suggests environmental heterogeneity to be of rather low predictive value for species richness patterns regionally. However, it may gain importance at more local scales.

AB Climate change will test the evolutionary potential of populations. Information regarding the genetic architecture within and among populations is essential for prediction of evolutionary outcomes. However, little is known about the distribution of genetic variation for relevant traits in natural populations or alteration of genetic architecture in a changing environment. In this study, pedigreed families from three populations of the annual prairie legume Chamaecrista fasciculata were reciprocally transplanted in three environments across a broad latitudinal range in the Great Plains. The underlying premise of this work is that northern populations will in the future experience climates similar to current-day climates further south. Estimates of narrow-sense heritability ranged from 0.053 to 0.481, suggesting the potential for evolutionary change is possible for most traits. In general, the northern population harbored less genetic variation and had lower heritability for traits than the southern population. This population also experienced large reductions in fitness, as measured by estimated lifetime fecundity, when raised in either the intermediate or the southern climate, whereas the difference between the intermediate and southern population was less extreme. For fecundity, the pattern of cross-environment additive genetic correlations was antagonistic to evolutionary change in four of six cases when native and normative sites were compared. Six additional antagonistic positive correlations were found for the rate of phenological development and leaf thickness. Overall, the data suggest that if climate changes as predicted, the northern population will face a severe evolutionary challenge in the future because of low heritabilities, cross-environment genetic correlations antagonistic to selection, and demographic instability due to lower seed production in a hotter and drier climate.

AB A study on some biological features of Prosopis juliflora, a multipurpose leguminous species introduced to Ethiopia, was carried out at Melka-Worer, North-east Ethiopia. The study focused on the number of seeds produced in a pod during the study period, seed dispersal through droppings of animals, soil seed banks, seed germination and stumping height of trees and coppicing ability of P. juliflora. The overall mean number of seeds was 23 +/- 4 seeds/pod. The width and length of seeds ranged between 0.8-1.7 and 8-29 cm, respectively. The mean weight of a seed of Prosopis was 0.0275 g +/- 0.001 (S.E.) while there were 36,000-37,000 seeds/kg. The number of seeds recovered from 1 kg of droppings of each animal ranged between 760 (goats) and 2833 (cattle), suggesting that cattle are the major dispersers of seeds of the study species followed by warthogs, camels and goats. There was a highly significant difference in vertical distribution of the seed density of P. juliflora recovered from the soil samples while the horizontal distribution exhibited a great disparity in the density of soil seeds among the sample plots. The total mean soil seed density, in the litter layer and down to 9 cm depth, was 1932 seeds/m(2) (+/- 307S.E.). Germination of seeds of P. juliflora differed significantly among the various treatments. The highest germination percentage was obtained from seeds that were treated with mechanical scarification (100%) and sulfuric acid for 15-60 min (97-99%). About 37% and 47% of the seeds recovered from droppings of goats and warthogs, respectively, germinated. All stumped trees of P. juliflora produced coppices except those stumped at 10 cm below ground. The overall mean number of coppices at the studied plots was 17.8 +/- 0.9 (S.E.) while the overall mean height of coppices, in 6 months after stumping, was 68.4 cm +/- 2.7 (S.E.). The results clearly demonstrated that Prosopis is equipped with a number of biological characteristics that foster its rapid invasion of new areas. These include: (i) production of many, small and hard seeds capable of surviving passage through the digestive system of animals, entering into the soil to form soil seed banks and remaining viable until favorable conditions for germination and seedling establishment appear; (ii) attractive and rewarding pods for animals, containing fleshy and sweet mesocarp embodying the numerous small seeds, which is sought after by both domestic and wild animals, meant for long-distance dispersal; (iii) accumulation of dormant but long-lived viable seed reserves that would serve as sources of regeneration of new Prosopis plants in the event of disturbance that might eliminate the above-ground stands; (iv) production of a mixture of seeds, with a few capable of germinating immediately after dispersal to exploit the favorable conditions that might exist at the time of dispersal, while the majority remain dormant for spreading germination over time and space; and (v) great ability of resprouting and fast coppice growth from stumped/damaged trees, making it a very strong competitive invader combined with its sexual reproduction. Combinations of all these characteristics make Prosopis a powerful noxious invader as can be evidenced from its rampant invasion in the study site and elsewhere in the tropics. Therefore, any effort in the management, control or elimination of Prosopis, which does not take these biological characteristics is bound to fail.
   The results also revealed that stumping trees at 10 cm below the ground eliminates the chance of resprouting of Prosopis and, hence, might offer a viable option for controlling and even eliminating the plants from areas whee they are undesirable. The fact that Prosopis has great ecological and socio-economical importance, which have not been fully realized in Ethiopia, makes its control through utilization a very attractive, purposive and viable option.

AB The social and ecological conditions that individuals experience during early development have marked effects on their developmental trajectory. In songbirds, brood size is a key environmental factor affecting development, and experimental increases in brood size have been shown to have negative effects on growth, condition and fitness. Possible causes of decreased growth in chicks from enlarged broods are nutritional stress, crowding and increased social competition, i.e. environmental factors known to affect adult steroid levels (especially of testosterone and corticosteroids) in mammals and birds. Little, however, is known about environmental effects on steroid synthesis in nestlings. We addressed this question by following the development of zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) chicks that were cross-fostered and raised in different brood sizes. In line with previous findings, nestling growth and cell-mediated immunocompetence were negatively affected by brood size. Moreover, nestling testosterone levels covaried with treatment: plasma testosterone increased with experimental brood size. This result provides experimental evidence that levels of circulating testosterone in nestlings can be influenced by their physiological response to environmental conditions.

AB Elaeagnus angustifolia (Russiah olive) is an alien tree that is increasingly common in riparian habitats of western North America. This paper reviews the pertinent scientific literature in order to determine the status of E. anigustifolia as a riparian invader and, to suggest ecological reasons for its success. Elaeagnus angustifolia meets the biogeographic, spread, and impact critetia for invasivie species. Ecological characteristics likely enabling its invasiveness include adaptation to the physical environmental conditions that characterize semi-arid riparian habitats, lack of intense pressure from herbivores, and tolerance of the competitive effects of established vegetation. We believe that the success of this species is at least partly due to its ability to take advantage of the reduced levels of physical disturbance that characterize, riparian habitats downstream from dams. Control of E. angustifolia is likely to be most promising where natural river flow regimes remain relatively intact.

AB Honesty of sexual advertisement is thought to be the result of signalling costs. Because production costs of depigmented plumage patches are probably very low, their role as honest signals of individual quality has been questioned. Costs of bearing these traits, however, should also be taken into account. Studies on proximate determination and possible information content of white badges are very rare. We investigated repeatability, sensu lato heritability, and condition- and age-dependence of white wing patch size, a male display trait in a population of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis), based on 4 years of data. By comparing relationships between age and wing patch size (1) within individuals among years versus (2) among individuals within years, we could address the viability indicator value of the trait. Wing patch size approximately doubled at the transition from subadult to adult plumage, and its change was significantly related to body condition the previous season. Repeatability and heritability values suggest that the trait is informative already in subadult plumage, and that genetic and early environmental effects are important in its determination, the latter only during the first year of life. Thus, wing patch size can act as a condition-dependent signal of genetic quality. Indeed, discrepancy between results from the horizontal and vertical age-dependence approaches shows that the trait was positively related to expected lifespan. After examining several alternative explanations, we conclude that wing patch size indicates genetically based viability. This is the first study to demonstrate a good genes viability benefit conferred by a depigmented plumage patch.

AB Light partitioning is thought to contribute to the coexistence of rain forest tree species. This study evaluates the three premises underlying the light partitioning hypothesis; 1) there is a gradient in light availability at the forest floor, 2) tree species show a differential distribution with respect to light, and 3) there is a trade-off in species performance that explains their different positions along the light gradient. To address these premises, we studied the light environment, growth, and survival of saplings of ten non-pioneer tree species in a Bolivian moist forest. Light availability in the understorey was relatively high, with a mean canopy openness of 3.5% and a mean direct site factor of 6.8%. Saplings of two light demanding species occurred at significantly higher light levels than the shade tolerant species. The proportion of saplings in low-light conditions was negatively correlated with the successional position of the species. Light-demanding species were characterised by a low share of their saplings in low-light conditions, a high sapling mortality, a fast height growth and a strong growth response to light. These data show that all three premises for light partitioning are met. There is a clear gradient in shade-tolerance within the group of non-pioneer species leading to a tight packing of species along the small range of light environments found in the understorey.

AB If strategies in natural resource management are to 'work with nature', reliable biophysical baseline data on ecosystem structure and function are required. The River Styles framework provides a geomorphic template upon which spatial and temporal linkages of biophysical processes are assessed within a catchment context. River Styles record river character and behaviour. As the capacity for a river reach to adjust varies for each style, so too do management issues and associated rehabilitation programmes. The framework also provides a basis for assessing geomorphic river condition and recovery potential, framed in terms of the evolutionary pathways of differing River Styles in the period since the European settlement of Australia. Within a catchment context, the River Styles framework provides a unified baseline upon which an array of additional information can be applied, thereby providing a consistent framework for management decision-making. The framework was developed as a research tool by geomorphologists working in collaboration with the New South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation, which has used it for a range of river management applications. Target conditions for rehabilitation programmes are framed within a catchment vision that integrates understanding of the character, behaviour, condition and recovery potential of each reach. A prioritization procedure determines the most cost-effective and efficient strategies that should be implemented to work towards the catchment vision. In addition, the River Styles framework is being used to identify rare or unusual geomorphic features that should be pre-served, assess riparian vegetation patterns and habitat availability along river courses, and derive water licensing., environmental flow and water quality policies that are relevant to river needs in each valley. Based on these principles, representative biomonitoring, benchmarking and auditing procedures are being developed to evaluate river health. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Null models have proven to be an important quantitative tool in the search for ecological processes driving local diversity and species distribution. However, there remains an important concern that different processes, such as environmental conditions and biotic interactions may produce similar patterns in species distributions. In this paper we present an analytical protocol for incorporating habitat suitability as an occupancy criterion in null models. Our approach involves modeling species presence or absence as a function of environmental conditions, and using the estimated site-specific probabilities of occurrence as the likelihood of species occupancy of a site during the generation of "null communities". We validated this approach by showing that type I error is not affected by the use of probabilities us a site occupancy criterion and is robust against a variety of predictive performances of the species-environmental models. We describe the expected differences when contrasting classical and the environmentally constrained null models, and illustrate our approach with a data set of Dutch dune hunting spider assemblages. An environmentally constrained approach to null models will provide a more robust evaluation of species associations by facilitating the distinction between mutually exclusive processes that may shape species distributions and community assembly.

AB Dry season survival of Anopheles funestus, Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles arabiensis in the Kilombero valley a dry savannah zone of east Africa, was investigated with over 400 collections from 23 areas, covering 300 sq km of the valley. Anopheles gambiae was found only in association with humans, in forested areas of high annual rainfall, while An. funestus occurred at high densities at the valley edge where large non-moving bodies of water remained. A large population of An. arabiensis was present along the river system throughout the middle of the valley, and mosquitoes probably derived from this population were occasionally caught in villages bordering the valley. No evidence was obtained of aestivation in any mosquito species. Anopheles gambiae was the most long lived, 6.3% compared to 2.0% of the An. arabiensis and 4% of the An. funestus surviving for four or more gonotrophic cycles, the approximate duration of the extrinsic cycle of most malaria parasites. Oocysts of malaria parasites were found in 5.4% of An. funestus and 2.3% of An. arabiensis from villages. Oocyst rates in An. funestus differed significantly between areas but not between houses within areas. Anopheles funestus is the most important dry season malaria vector in the valley, and remains in foci closely associated with groups of houses. All three species survive at high densities but as otherwise hidden refugia populations.

AB Two prominent conceptual frameworks, environmental gradients and patch hierarchies, are used in combination to describe vegetation patterns along a riparian corridor in a semi-arid South African system. We adopt both approaches, since riparian corridors are characterized by both strong environmental gradients above, away from and along the river, as well as a mosaic of patches in the geomorphology at multiple hierarchical scales. Constrained and unconstrained ordinations were used to determine the variability in vegetation pattern accounted for by the gradient and the geomorphic patch hierarchy data sets. The gradient data set consisted of vertical, lateral and longitudinal dimensions of the macro-channel, while the patch hierarchy data set consisted of substratum type, morphological unit and channel type. Elevation up the macro-channel bank, of the gradient data set, explained the main variation in vegetation pattern, and alluded to overriding processes of flooding frequency and water availability as determinants of vegetation pattern. Along the fluvially dynamic macro-channel floor (lower elevation range), patchiness at the scale of the morphological unit best explained vegetation pattern. This relationship with morphological units suggests that the formation of well developed alluvial bars, and the degree of bedrock influence are important processes. The nested hierarchical framework used provided a good basis for identifying scale specific pattern in a relational manner. In systems characterized by strong environmental gradients as well as a patch mosaic at different spatial and temporal scales, the combined use of both perspectives to develop a fuller understanding of vegetation pattern is imperative and is encouraged.

AB We present and apply a method for analyzing size-dependent patterns of resource acquisition by individuals within stands of competing plants. Our approach relies on curve-fitting to relate empirical measures of resource acquisition with various aspects of plant size and form. These relationships are referred to as size-uptake relationships (SURs). We demonstrate the use of this approach by characterizing the size dependence of light and nitrogen acquisition within developing stands of birch seedlings. Results of a number of phenomenological studies have predicted that competition for light is expected to be size asymmetric and that competition for belowground resources is expected to be size symmetric. Our study provides the first direct empirical test far these hypotheses.
   Application of the SUR approach largely confirms predictions regarding the size-dependent nature of light and belowground resource (nitrogen) acquisition. The uptake of nitrogen by birch seedlings was size symmetric, regardless of which aspect of size we considered (i.e., root mass, root length, root surface area, number of root tips, number of mycorrhizal root tips). In contrast, light interception was size asymmetric in relation to height and leaf area, but size symmetric in relation to total plant biomass. Differences in the degree of size-asymmetry of Light acquisition between different measures of size were driven by the nature of the allometric relationships between plant height, biomass, and leaf area.
   SURs offer a tool for exploring some of the mechanistic processes related to resource-based interactions. Using this approach, we demonstrate that it is possible to characterize simultaneously the size-dependent patterns of multiple resources within competing plant populations. We suggest that this approach may prove valuable for identifying how size-dependent patterns of resource acquisition vary through ontogeny. We conclude with a discussion of the need for a more mechanistic understanding of plant-plant interactions and the role that the SUR approach can play towards this goal.

AB This paper reviews the knowledge on crowberry (Empetrum nigrum ssp. nigrum and ssp. hermaphroditum) dominated ecosystems in the Nordic region. Empetrum leaves and litter have high phenolic content resulting in slow decomposition, and with the formation of an organic top soil, nutrients are kept in an organic nutrient bank in the soil mainly available for plants with ericoid mycorrhiza. Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum is a strong nutrient competitor and outcompetes most plants in late successional stages. This is due to chemical interference (allelopathy) and resource competition. Crowberry as an organism is resistant to atmospheric pollution and may even increase in vigor by high atmospheric N deposition in nemoral coastal heaths, but is very sensitive to mechanical disturbances and fire. However, there are indications that the closed nutrient cycle established when Empetrum is dominant may be disturbed after airborne inputs of inorganic N.

TI Aquatic macrophyte distribution in relation to water and sediment

AB Aquatic macrophyte community distribution along the eastern shoreline of the Itaipu Reservoir (one of the South America's largest impoundments) is described in relation to limnological and sedimentological factors. The central body of the reservoir is mesotrophic, while the arms (flooded influent river valleys) along the eastern shore may be oligo-mesotrophic to eutrophic, depending on time of year and sub-catchment characteristics. Macrophyte community composition and species cover were surveyed at 30 sites in four arms, in relation to sediment total P and organic matter; underwater light regime; and water total P and Kjeldahl N concentration, alkalinity, conductivity, depth and pH. Seventeen euhydrophyte and six emergent macrophyte species were recorded. Large stands of Egeria najas dominated the euhydrophyte vegetation, together with free-floating weed species (Pistia stratiotes Linn., Salvinia auriculata Aublet and Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms.). Canonical Correspondence Analysis of the data showed that two sets of variables were important predictors of aquatic macrophyte community structure. Floating macrophyte assemblage was closely related to concentration of nutrients in both water and sediment, while light penetration was the strongest predictor of submerged species occurrence. Although a large number of potential nuisance species were present, dense growths were restricted to shallower areas of the Itaipu Reservoir, causing localised problems. The possibility of increasing interference by these plants with fisheries, recreational use, transport and hydroelectricity generation suggests a need for continued monitoring of weed distribution and abundance, and investigation of appropriate management measures.

AB A modern diatom-pH calibration data-set consisting of surface-sediment diatom assemblages from 118 lakes and 530 taxa is presented. The AL:PE data-set is from high-altitude or high-latitude lakes in the Alps, Norway, Svalbard, Kola Peninsula, UK, Slovenia, Slovakia, Poland, Portugal, and Spain (pH range = 4.5-8.0; DOC range = 0.2-3.2 mg l(-1)). In addition, 92 epilithon samples from 22 high-altitude or high-latitude lakes comprise an AL:PE epilithon diatom-pH data-set. Weighted averaging partial least squares regression is used to develop pH-inference models. The AL:PE data-set has a root-mean-square-error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.33 and a maximum bias of 0.36 pH units and r(2) of 0.82, as assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation. The epilithon data-set has, after data-screening and the deletion of one very obvious outlier, a RMSEP of 0.23 and a maximum bias of 0.18 pH units and r(2) of 0.88. The 167 sample SWAP diatom-pH data-set from lowland or upland lakes in the UK, Norway, and Sweden has a RMSEP of 0.29 and a maximum bias of 0.23 pH units and r(2) of 0.86.
   The pH optima, as estimated by weighted averaging and Gaussian regression, are compared for the three data-sets (AL:PE, SWAP, AL:PE epilithon). There is a good correspondence between the AL:PE and the AL:PE epilithon optima, but a consistent bias between the AL:PE and SWAP optima, with the SWAP optima being lower than the AL:PE estimates.
   The predictive performances of the AL:PE and SWAP calibration data-sets are compared using independent test samples and six core sequences, all from high-altitude lakes, one in south-east Siberia and five in eastern Scotland. The results show the importance of using the AL:PE data-set for inferring lake-water pH from diatom assemblages in high-altitude or high latitude lakes with low DOC concentrations.

AB It has been estimated that Lake Malawi, Africa, contains 500-650 endemic species of cichlid fishes, the largest number of vertebrate species endemic to any comparable sized area on the planet. As many of these putative species cannot be distinguished anatomically, these estimates of species richness depend to a great extent on the assumption that sympatrically occurring male colour morphs represent biological species. We have tested this assumption using a combination of behavioural observations of courtship and microsatellite DNA analysis for six putative species of the Pseudotropheus (Tropheops) complex and three of the Pseudotropheus (Maylandia) complex occurring sympatrically at Nkhata Bay. We were unable to demonstrate assortative courtship for the species pairs Pseudotropheus (Maylandia) zebra/P. 'gold zebra' or P. (Tropheops) 'band'/P. (T.) 'rust' because we were unable to distinguish between the females of these taxa. All other taxa showed clear assortative courtship, except for P. (T.) 'deep', a deep-water species which was rarely observed. Fixation indices (theta(ST) for the infinite allele model, and R-ST for the stepwise mutation model) calculated from six microsatellite DNA loci demonstrated significant deviations from panmixia in all pairwise comparisons of putative species, indicating little or no gene flow between populations. All taxa showed high levels of allelic diversity providing evidence that genetic bottlenecking may have been of limited importance in the speciation process. Assortative mating among taxa differing only in male colouration is supportive of theories that speciation in these fishes has been driven by sexual selection by female choice.

AB A hydrophobic folding unit cutting algorithm, originally developed for dissecting single-chain proteins, has been applied to a dataset of dissimilar two-chain protein-protein interfaces. Rather than consider each individual chain separately, the two-chain complex has been treated as a single chain. The two-chain parsing results presented in this work show hydrophobicity to be a critical attribute of two-state versus three-state protein-protein complexes, The hydrophobic folding units at the interfaces of two-state complexes suggest that the cooperative nature of the two-chain protein folding is the outcome of the hydrophobic effect, similar to its being the driving force in a single-chain folding. In analogy to the protein-folding process, the two-chain, two-state model complex may correspond to the formation of compact, hydrophobic nuclei. On the other hand, the three-state model complex involves binding of already folded monomers. similar to the association of the hydrophobic folding units within a single chain. The similarity between folding entities in protein cores and in two-state protein-protein interfaces, despite the absence of some chain connectivities in the latter, indicates that chain linkage does not necessarily affect the native conformation This further substantiates the notion that tertiary, non-local interactions play a critical role in protein folding. These compact, hydrophobic, two-chain folding units, derived from structurally dissimilar protein-protein interfaces, provide a rich set of data useful in investigations of the role played by chain connectivity and by tertiary interactions in studies of binding and of folding. Since they are composed of non-contiguous pieces of protein backbones, they may also aid in defining folding nuclei.

AB Investigations into different stages of secondary succession (from a wheat field to a beechwood on limestone; Northern Germany) demonstrated the formation of a carbon rich top soil in later successional stages. Parallel to changes in plant species and soil formation, there were also changes in species composition and diversity of saprophagous macro-invertebrates (Lumbricidae, Diplopoda, Isopoda) and oribatid mites (Acari: Oribatida). Diversity of diplopod and isopod species increased after cessation of cultivation, but in a late successional stage (ca 50 y-old fallow, ash-dominated wood) species number of diplopods and isopods declined strongly. In comparison with the other soil invertebrate groups, species composition of earthworms among the sites was more similar. Accumulation of soil C was assumed to be related to wood formation and occurrence of woody debris and recalcitrant leaf litter of beech trees. Incorporation of recalcitrant litter materials by earthworm species living in the upper mineral soil presumably contributed significantly to accumulation of soil C. Accumulation of soil C was accompanied by the development of an oribatid mite community rich in species. In early successional stages oribatids predominantly colonized the litter layer, while most oribatid mites of the beechwood inhabited the upper mineral soil. Maximum diversity of oribatid mites in the beechwood is assumed to be related to instability of the mineral soil caused by earthworm activity. Changes in species composition and diversity are discussed considering succession theory. Even soil invertebrates of similar trophic groups appear to respond very differently to successional changes. It is concluded that conservation strategies to maintain high diversity of soil invertebrates are most likely to be successful if a wide range of habitats of different successional stages is included.

AB We review current knowledge of the diet and predator-prey relationships of the feral cat (Felis catus), fox (Vulpes vulpes) and dingo (Canis familiaris dingo) (including wild dogs), and consider how forest fragmentation by roads may influence the use of native forest ecosystems by these species and the significance of this for native fauna. The cat, fox and dingo are significant predators in Australia that interact with native fauna in various ways, including predation, competition for resources, and transmission of disease. On the basis of current knowledge, it is clear that the nature and impact of predation by the cat, fox and dingo on native fauna are primarily determined by prey availability, although there are exceptions to this rule. Generally, dingoes prey upon large to medium-sized prey species (e.g. wallabies, common wombats and possums), foxes prey upon medium-sized to small prey (e.g. possums and rats) and consume a significant component of scavenged material and vegetation, while cats also prey upon medium-sized to small prey, but may have a greater proportion of reptiles and birds in their diet. The cat is generally considered to be an opportunistic predator and to have contributed to the demise of a number of mammals. The fox is considered more of a threat to small native mammals than is the cat and it has been asserted that all species of mammals that fall within the critical weight range (CWR) of 120-5000 g are at risk of local extinction when the fox is present. The severity of the impact of the dingo upon the native fauna is considered to be minimal, at least in comparison with the impact that the cat and fox can have on populations. The dingo is not considered a threat to CWR mammals in undisturbed environments. The fox, feral cat and dingo are all considered to have the ability to selectively prey upon species and, to some extent, individual sexes and age-classes of a number of larger prey species.
   Although many of Australia's forested areas are relatively heavily fragmented by roads, there are no published studies specifically investigating the use of roads by feral predators. Information on the distribution and abundance of foxes, cats and dingoes in these ecosystems, their ecology and their impact on native fauna is particularly limited. Further, the extent to which roads influence the distribution and abundance of these species and the consequences of these for native fauna are poorly known. Given this, we suggest that one of the most important research needs is to establish the relative impact that exotic predators may have on native fauna under varying degrees of road construction within native forests. For example, are areas with and without roads in forests used differently by exotic predators and what is the significance of this in terms of the potential impact on fauna? The extent to which feral predators forage away from roads needs further investigation, as does the rates of predation within edges, because this may have several consequences for the design, location and size of retained strips and wildlife corridors as well as restoration programmes. Further observations on regional differences influencing predator-prey interactions are required, as is research on the potential impacts on native fauna resulting from prey selection in forests subjected to various degrees of fragmentation and modification.

AB We examined the response of understory vegetation beneath monotypic, even-aged stands of lodgepole pine to increasing tree mortality following an epidemic of mountain pine beetles. We hypothesized that understory biomass would increase continually as the tree canopy was reduced and competition with trees for light and soil moisture decreased, but that plant species diversity and heterogeneity would peak at intermediate levels of beetle-caused tree mortality. Mean understory biomass clipped from 50 1-m(2) circular plots/stand was an order of magnitude greater (40 g m(-2)) in beetle-killed stands, with typical levels of overstory tree mortality (50-75%), than in unaffected stands (4 g m(-2)); and it increased exponentially with disturbance severity. Frequency of fruit occurrence was positively related to increasing tree mortality, but was highly variable. Understory plant species richness and, to lesser degrees indices of diversity that incorporate evenness, peaked in stands with moderate mortality. Measures of vegetation patchiness (the coefficient of variation in mean plot biomass and an index of habitat interspersion) also peaked in stands with intermediate levels of disturbance. The response of understory plant species diversity to increasing disturbance severity is consistent with the pattern predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. However, other explanations of this pattern are discussed. Although understory plant community richness was higher in beetle-killed stands than in unaffected stands, new species were not abundant and therefore did not contribute substantially to greater evenness in understory plant diversity.

AB Biochar is a carbonaceous, solid, and recalcitrant compound derived from the pyrolysis of waste biomass. Its yield and properties are strongly influenced by pyrolysis conditions and feedstock composition. Biochar has been engineered using various physical and chemical activation methods to alter its structural and physicochemical properties in order to suit the final application and finds wide applicability in the field of soil remediation, wastewater treatment, and energy generation. Owing to its low-cost, presence of surface functional groups, porosity, and moderate surface area, biochar has recently been explored as a support material for the immobilization of enzymes. This paper aims to review the recent findings in biochar production, factors affecting the biochar properties and biochar engineering. Further, this also gives an insight into the potential of biochar as an immobilization support in terms of its properties, contributing factors and comparison with other support materials.

AB A key focus in ecology is to search for community assembly rules. Here we compare two community modelling frameworks that integrate a combination of environmental and spatial data to identify positive and negative species associations from presence-absence matrices, and incorporate an additional comparison using joint species distribution models (JSDM). The frameworks use a dichotomous logic tree that distinguishes dispersal limitation, environmental requirements, and interspecific interactions as causes of segregated or aggregated species pairs. The first framework is based on a classical null model analysis complemented by tests of spatial arrangement and environmental characteristics of the sites occupied by the members of each species pair (Classic framework). The second framework, (SDM framework) implemented here for the first time, builds on the application of environmentally-constrained null models (or JSDMs) to partial out the influence of the environment, and includes an analysis of the geographical configuration of species ranges to account for dispersal effects. We applied these approaches to examine plot-level species co-occurrence in plant communities sampled along a wide elevation gradient in the Swiss Alps. According to the frameworks, the majority of species pairs were randomly associated, and most of the non-random positive and negative species associations could be attributed to environmental filtering and/or dispersal limitation. These patterns were partly detected also with JSDM. Biotic interactions were detected more frequently in the SDM framework, and by JSDM, than in the Classic framework. All approaches detected species aggregation more often than segregation, perhaps reflecting the important role of facilitation in stressful high-elevation environments. Differences between the frameworks may reflect the explicit incorporation of elevational segregation in the SDM framework and the sensitivity of JSDM to the environmental data. Nevertheless, all methods have the potential to reveal general patterns of species co-occurrence for different taxa, spatial scales, and environmental conditions.

AB Diversity is a concept central to ecology, and its measurement is essential for any study of ecosystem health. But summarizing this complex and multidimensional concept in a single measure is problematic. Dozens of mathematical indices have been proposed for this purpose, but these can provide contradictory results leading to misleading or incorrect conclusions about a community's diversity. In this review, we summarize the key conceptual issues underlying the measurement of ecological diversity, survey the indices most commonly used in ecology, and discuss their relative suitability. We advocate for indices that: (i) satisfy key mathematical axioms; (ii) can be expressed as so-called effective numbers; (iii) can be extended to account for disparity between types; (iv) can be parameterized to obtain diversity profiles; and (v) for which an estimator (preferably unbiased) can be found so that the index is useful for practical applications.

AB Human activities such as the transport of species to new regions and modifications of the environment are increasingly reshaping the distribution of biota. Accordingly, developing robust, repeatable, and consistent definitions of alien species that serve scientific and policy purposes has become of prime importance. We provide a set of classification criteria that are widely applicable across taxa and realms and offer guidance on their use in practice. The criteria focus on (a) acknowledging the role of assessment uncertainty, (b) incorporating time since introduction, (c) considering infraspecific taxonomic ranks, and (d) differentiating between alien species whose survival depends on explicit human assistance from those that survive without such assistance. Furthermore, we make recommendations for reducing assessment uncertainty, suggest thresholds for species assessment, and develop an assessment scheme. We illustrate the application of the assessment criteria with case studies. Finally, the implications for alien species management, policy, and research are discussed.

AB Deciphering invasion routes from molecular data is crucial to understanding biological invasions, including identifying bottlenecks in population size and admixture among distinct populations. Here, we unravel the invasion routes of the invasive pest Drosophila suzukii using a multi-locus microsatellite dataset (25 loci on 23 worldwide sampling locations). To do this, we use approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), which has improved the reconstruction of invasion routes, but can be computationally expensive. We use our study to illustrate the use of a new, more efficient, ABC method, ABC random forest (ABC-RF) and compare it to a standard ABC method (ABC-LDA). We find that Japan emerges as the most probable source of the earliest recorded invasion into Hawaii. Southeast China and Hawaii together are the most probable sources of populations in western North America, which then in turn served as sources for those in eastern North America. European populations are genetically more homogeneous than North American populations, and their most probable source is northeast China, with evidence of limited gene flow from the eastern US as well. All introduced populations passed through bottlenecks, and analyses reveal five distinct admixture events. These findings can inform hypotheses concerning how this species evolved between different and independent source and invasive populations. Methodological comparisons indicate that ABC-RF and ABC-LDA show concordant results if ABC-LDA is based on a large number of simulated datasets but that ABC-RF out-performs ABC-LDA when using a comparable and more manageable number of simulated datasets, especially when analyzing complex introduction scenarios.

AB Intraspecific variation is a major component of biodiversity, yet it has received relatively little attention from governmental and nongovernmental organizations, especially with regard to conservation plans and the management of wild species. This omission is ill-advised because phenotypic and genetic variations within and among populations can have dramatic effects on ecological and evolutionary processes, including responses to environmental change, the maintenance of species diversity, and ecological stability and resilience. At the same time, environmental changes associated with many human activities, such as land use and climate change, have dramatic and often negative impacts on intraspecific variation. We argue for the need for local, regional, and global programs to monitor intraspecific genetic variation. We suggest that such monitoring should include two main strategies: (i) intensive monitoring of multiple types of genetic variation in selected species and (ii) broad-brush modeling for representative species for predicting changes in variation as a function of changes in population size and range extent. Overall, we call for collaborative efforts to initiate the urgently needed monitoring of intraspecific variation.

AB Measuring the microbial diversity in natural and engineered environments is important for ecosystem characterization, ecosystem monitoring and hypothesis testing. Although the conventional assessment through single marker gene surveys has resulted in major advances, the complete procedure remains slow (i.e. weeks to months), labour-intensive and susceptible to multiple sources of laboratory and data processing bias. Growing interest, in highly resolved, temporal surveys of microbial diversity, necessitates rapid, inexpensive and robust analytical platforms that require limited computational effort. Here, we demonstrate that sensitive single-cell measurements of phenotypic attributes, obtained via flow cytometry, can provide fast (i.e. within minutes) first-line assessments of microbial diversity dynamics, without demanding extensive sample preparation and downstream data processing. We developed a data processing pipeline that fits bivariate kernel density functions to phenotypic parameter combinations of an entire microbial community and concatenates them to a single one-dimensional phenotypic fingerprint. By calculating established diversity metrics from such phenotypic fingerprints, we construct an alternative interpretation of the microbial diversity that incorporates distinct phenotypic traits underlying cell-to-cell heterogeneity (i.e. morphology and nucleic acid content). Based on a detailed longitudinal study of a highly dynamic microbial ecosystem, our approach delivered temporal alpha diversity profiles that strongly correlated with the reference diversity, as estimated by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. This strongly suggests that the distribution of a limited amount of phenotypic features within a microbial community already provides sufficient resolving power for the measurement of diversity dynamics at the species level. We present a fast, robust analysis method for monitoring the microbial biodiversity of natural and engineered ecosystems that correlates well with the conventional marker gene surveys. Our work has both applied and fundamental implications that stretch from ecosystem monitoring and studies on microbial community dynamics, to supervised sampling strategies. Furthermore, our approach offers perspectives for the development of online and insitu monitoring systems for microbial ecosystems.

AB Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) is a complex conservation issue and acknowledging the human dimensions of the problem is critical. Here we propose the Wildlife Tolerance Model (WTM), a novel theoretical framework to identify key drivers of tolerance to living with damage-causing wildlife. The WTM proposes an outer model, where the extent to which a person experiences a species determines perceptions of costs relative to benefits of living with a species. This in turn determines tolerance. A second component, the inner model predicts eleven variables that may further drive perceptions of costs and benefits. In the current paper we test the outer model while in a forthcoming publication we test the inner model using a case study of human-baboon conflict in Cape Town, South Africa. Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling we found support for the outer model. Experience explained 30% of variance in costs and benefits and 60% of tolerance was explained by perceptions of costs and benefits. Intangible costs and intangible benefits equally contributed to driving tolerance but tangible costs had no significant effect on tolerance. Separating two dimensions of experience, (i) exposure to a species explained costs more than benefits, and (ii) positive experiences explained intangible costs and benefits more than tangible costs while negative experiences equally explained costs and benefits. We discuss management implications of the findings and conclude that the WTM could be a useful diagnostic tool and theoretical framework to inform management interventions and policies to mitigate HWC.

AB Parallel speciation occurs when selection drives repeated, independent adaptive divergence that reduces gene flow between ecotypes. Classical examples show parallel speciation originating from shared genomic variation, but this does not seem to be the case in the rough periwinkle (Littorina saxatilis) that has evolved considerable phenotypic diversity across Europe, including several distinct ecotypes. Small wave' ecotype snails inhabit exposed rocks and experience strong wave action, while thick-shelled, crab' ecotype snails are larger and experience crab predation on less exposed shores. Crab and wave ecotypes appear to have arisen in parallel, and recent evidence suggests only marginal sharing of molecular variation linked to evolution of similar ecotypes in different parts of Europe. However, the extent of genomic sharing is expected to increase with gene flow and more recent common ancestry. To test this, we used de novo RAD-sequencing to quantify the extent of shared genomic divergence associated with phenotypic similarities amongst ecotype pairs on three close islands (<10km distance) connected by weak gene flow (Nm similar to 0.03) and with recent common ancestry (<10000years). After accounting for technical issues, including a large proportion of null alleles due to a large effective population size, we found similar to 8-28% of positive outliers were shared between two islands and similar to 2-9% were shared amongst all three islands. This low level of sharing suggests that parallel phenotypic divergence in this system is not matched by shared genomic divergence despite a high probability of gene flow and standing genetic variation.

AB Biodiversity conservation policies justified with science and intrinsic value arguments have produced disappointing outcomes, and the need for conservation is now being additionally justified with the concept of ecosystem services. However, little, if any empirical attention is paid to ways in which different types of ecosystem service decisions are made, to what arguments are effective in turning policy into practice and further into conservation outcomes and, in general, to how ecosystem services are governed. To close this gap, this paper identifies the different modes of governance in policy implementation from biodiversity and environmental conservation literature and incorporates them in a conceptual model of ecosystem services commonly utilised at present, the cascade model. The resulting conceptual framework encompasses: (1) hierarchical governance; (2) scientific-technical governance; (3) adaptive collaborative governance; and; (4) governing strategic behaviour. This comprehensive framework provides a structure for empirical analysis of ecosystem services governance, which takes into account the people and organisations making decisions, and, in particular, the different arguments that are used when implementing policies. The framework will facilitate holistic ecosystem service analyses and support policies in generating conservation and sustainability impact. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A Taiwan origin for the expansion of the Austronesian languages and their speakers is well supported by linguistic and archaeological evidence. However, human genetic evidence is more controversial. Until now, there had been no ancient skeletal evidence of a potential Austronesian-speaking ancestor prior to the Taiwan Neolithic similar to 6,000 years ago, and genetic studies have largely ignored the role of genetic diversity within Taiwan as well as the origins of Formosans. We address these issues via analysis of a complete mitochondrial DNA genome sequence of an similar to 8,000-year-old skeleton from Liang Island (located between China and Taiwan) and 550 mtDNA genome sequences from 8 aboriginal (highland) Formosan and 4 other Taiwanese groups. We show that the Liangdao Man mtDNA sequence is closest to Formosans, provides a link to southern China, and has the most ancestral haplogroup E sequence found among extant Austronesian speakers. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis allows us to reconstruct a history of early Austronesians arriving in Taiwan in the north similar to 6,000 years ago, spreading rapidly to the south, and leaving Taiwan similar to 4,000 years ago to spread throughout Island Southeast Asia, Madagascar, and Oceania.

AB Ecosystem service assessment has recently become one of the most important scientific frameworks to address the challenges inherent in environmental management, particularly those in agroecosystem management. Agroecosystems provide important ecosystem services to society including provisioning, regulating, and cultural services. However, the Mediterranean Basin agroecosystems have suffered the effects of two drivers of change, rural abandonment and intensification of agrarian practices, which threaten multifunctional landscapes and erode the capacity to deliver ecosystem services. In this study, we explored the knowledge landscape of ecosystem services research throughout the Mediterranean Basin's agroecosystems through a review of 165 publications. We (1) analyzed the current research state and trends; (2) examined the existing research gaps and biases; and (3) evaluated the associations between factors related to the methodologies employed, the ecosystem services analyzed, and the agroecosystem characteristics. Our results indicated that monetary approaches and provisioning ecosystem services are attracting most of the scientific attention, possibly jeopardizing the regulating and cultural services provided by these ecosystems. Moreover, results suggested that there is a lack of integrated approaches that consider the three dimensions of sustainability, i.e. biophysical, sociocultural and monetary. Most studies did not use primary data or involve stakeholders in the assessments and scarce evidence was available regarding ecosystem services provided under different management alternatives. Finally, specific relationships were detected between the methodologies applied, the ecosystem services assessed and the characteristics of the agroecosystem. We argue these gaps might have potential implications in current scientific and political debates, such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services and the Common Agricultural Policy reform. We therefore provide recommendations for research and policy-making, agendas. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Thousands of the world's offshore oil and gas structures are approaching obsolescence and will require decommissioning within the next decade. Many nations have blanket regulations requiring obsolete structures to be removed, yet this option is unlikely to yield optimal environmental, societal and economic outcomes in all situations. We propose that nations adopt a flexible approach that allows decommissioning options to be selected from the full range of alternatives (including 'rigs-to-reefs' options) on a case-by-case basis. We outline a method of multi-criteria decision analysis (Multi-criteria Approval, MA) for evaluating and comparing alternative decommissioning options across key selection criteria, including environmental, financial, socioeconomic, and health and safety considerations. The MA approach structures the decision problem, forces explicit consideration of trade-offs and directly involves stakeholder groups in the decision process. We identify major decommissioning options and provide a generic list of selection criteria for inclusion in the MA decision process. To deal with knowledge gaps concerning environmental impacts of decommissioning, we suggest that expert opinion feed into the MA approach until sufficient data become available. We conducted a limited trial of the MA decision approach to demonstrate its application to a complex and controversial decommissioning scenario; Platform Grace in southern California. The approach indicated, for this example, that the option 'leave in place intact' would likely provide best environmental outcomes in the event of future decommissioning. In summary, the MA approach will allow the environmental, social, and economic impacts of decommissioning decisions to be assessed simultaneously in a transparent manner. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Human societies, and their well-being, depend to a significant extent on the state of the ecosystems that surround them. These ecosystems are changing rapidly usually in response to anthropogenic changes in the environment. To determine the likely impact of environmental change on ecosystems and the best ways to manage them, it would be desirable to be able to predict their future states. We present a proposal to develop the paradigm of predictive systems ecology, explicitly to understand and predict the properties and behaviour of ecological systems. We discuss the necessary and desirable features of predictive systems ecology models. There are places where predictive systems ecology is already being practised and we summarize a range of terrestrial and marine examples. Significant challenges remain but we suggest that ecology would benefit both as a scientific discipline and increase its impact in society if it were to embrace the need to become more predictive.

AB Gross primary productivity (GPP) is a key component of land atmospheric carbon exchange. Reliable calculation of regional/global GPP is crucial for understanding the response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change and human activity. In recent years, many light use efficiency (LUE) models driven by remote sensing data have been developed for calculating GPP at various spatial and temporal scales. However, some studies show that GPP calculated by LUE models was biased by different degrees depending on sky clearness conditions.
   In this study, a two-leaf light use efficiency (TL-LUE) model is developed based on the MOD 17 algorithm to improve the calculation of GPP. This TL-LUE model separates the canopy into sunlit and shaded leaf groups and calculates GPP separately for them with different maximum light use efficiencies. Different algorithms are developed to calculate the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation for these two groups. GPP measured at 6 typical ecosystems in China was used to calibrate and validate the model. The results show that with the calibration using tower measurements of GPP, the MOD17 algorithm was able to capture the variations of measured GPP in different seasons and sites. But it tends to understate and overestimate GPP under the conditions of low and high sky clearness, respectively. The new TL-LUE model outperforms the MOD17 algorithm in reproducing measured GPP at daily and 8-day scales, especially at forest sites. The calibrated LUE of shaded leaves is 2.5-3.8 times larger than that of sunlit leaves. The newly developed TL-LUE model shows lower sensitivity to sky conditions than the MOD17 algorithm. This study demonstrates the potential of the TL-LUE model in improving GPP calculation due to proper description of differences in the LUE of sunlit and shaded leaves and in the transfer of direct and diffuse light beams within the canopy.

AB Beta diversity is a conceptual link between diversity at local and regional scales. Various additional methodologies of quantifying this and related phenomena have been applied. Among them, measures of pairwise (dis)similarity of sites are particularly popular. Undersampling, i.e. not recording all taxa present at a site, is a common situation in ecological data. Bias in many metrics related to beta diversity must be expected, but only few studies have explicitly investigated the properties of various measures under undersampling conditions. On the basis of an empirical data set, representing near-complete local inventories of the Lepidoptera from an isolated Pacific island, as well as simulated communities with varying properties, we mimicked different levels of undersampling. We used 14 different approaches to quantify beta diversity, among them dataset-wide multiplicative partitioning (i.e. true beta diversity') and pairwise site x site dissimilarities. We compared their values from incomplete samples to true results from the full data. We used these comparisons to quantify undersampling bias and we calculated correlations of the dissimilarity measures of undersampled data with complete data of sites. Almost all tested metrics showed bias and low correlations under moderate to severe undersampling conditions (as well as deteriorating precision, i.e. large chance effects on results). Measures that used only species incidence were very sensitive to undersampling, while abundance-based metrics with high dependency on the distribution of the most common taxa were particularly robust. Simulated data showed sensitivity of results to the abundance distribution, confirming that data sets of high evenness and/or the application of metrics that are strongly affected by rare species are particularly sensitive to undersampling. The class of beta measure to be used should depend on the research question being asked as different metrics can lead to quite different conclusions even without undersampling effects. For each class of metric, there is a trade-off between robustness to undersampling and sensitivity to rare species. In consequence, using incidence-based metrics carries a particular risk of false conclusions when undersampled data are involved. Developing bias corrections for such metrics would be desirable.

AB Questions How can we understand the limitations to plant growth at high altitudes? Our aim was to test the hypotheses that for alpine grasslands along a large altitudinal gradient in semi-arid regions, plant growth is mainly limited by drought at low altitudes but by low temperature at high altitudes, resulting in a unimodal pattern of biomass and productivity associated with an optimal combination of temperature and precipitation. Such knowledge is important to understanding the response of alpine ecosystems to climate change.
   Location We conducted a 5-yr livestock exclosure experiment along the south-facing slope of the Nyaiqentanglha Mountains, central Tibetan Plateau.
   Methods We measured above- and below-ground biomass, species richness, leaf d13C and water potential, and related climate and soil variables across 42 fenced and unfenced quadrats near seven HOBO weather stations along the slope. The vegetation changed from alpine steppe-meadow at 43904500 m to alpine meadow at 46005210 m.
   Results Total above- and below-ground biomass across fenced and unfenced quadrats increased with increasing altitude up to 49505100 m, and then decreased above 5100 m. Altitudinal trends in leaf d13C and water potential of dominant species also showed a unimodal pattern corresponding to that of vegetation biomass. Total above- and below-ground biomass as well as sedge above-ground biomass all showed a quadratic relationship with mean temperatures and the ratio of growing season precipitation (GSP) to =5 degrees C accumulated temperature (AccT; R2 = 0.83-0.88, P < 0.001). In general, above- and below-ground biomass increased with increasing water availability when the GSP/AccT ratio was lower than the threshold level of 0.800.84, but decreased when the GSP/AccT ratio was higher than this threshold level. No significant relationship was found between residuals of above-ground biomass and species richness after removing the effects of climate factors on both stand variables.
   Conclusions The results support our hypotheses, further suggesting a threshold of water limitation that is consistent with the model prediction over the Tibetan Plateau. Species richness per se appears to weakly affect community-level productivity. The response of alpine grasslands to climate warming may vary with altitude because of altitudinal shifts in factors limiting plant growth.

AB Invasions by alien plant species significantly affect biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Investigations of the soil seed banks of invasive plant species and changes in the composition and structure of resident seed banks following plant invasions can provide valuable insight into the long-term implications of plant invasions. Soil seed banks play a major role as reservoirs of species and genetic diversity and allow for the persistence of a species at a locality, buffering environmental changes that may occur over time. Despite the emerging body of literature on ecological impacts of invasive plants on the diversity of resident communities, the long-term implications of impoverished soil seed banks for vegetation dynamics and ecosystem functioning have only recently begun receiving attention. Evidence has so far indicated that there is a correlation between the invasiveness of a species and the characteristics of its seed bank, and that changes in the seed banks of resident communities associated with plant invasions affect their biotic resistance to primary and secondary invasions. To promote the study of soil seed banks in the context of invasive species, we (i) summarize the functional roles of soil seed banks; (ii) describe how the capacity to form a seed bank may contribute to a species' invasiveness using data from the flora of the Czech Republic, showing an increasing representation of species capable of forming long-term persistent seed bank from casual to naturalized to invasion stage; (iii) assess the impact of invasive plants on seed banks of resident communities, including the potential creation of conditions that favour secondary invasions by other alien species or native weeds, and long-term implications of such impact; and (iv) describe the potential effects of climate change on the soil seed bank in the context of plant invasions. We conclude with highlighting promising avenues for future research on invaded soil seed banks, and emphasize the importance of this knowledge in the development of control programs and restoration strategies.

AB Climate change is likely to affect the persistence of large, space-requiring species through habitat shifts, loss, and fragmentation. Anthropogenic land and resource use changes related to climate change can also impact the survival of wildlife. Thus, climate change has to be integrated into biodiversity conservation plans. We developed a hybrid approach to climate-adaptive conservation landscape planning for snow leopards in the Himalayan Mountains. We first mapped current snow leopard habitat using a mechanistic approach that incorporated field-based data, and then combined it with a climate impact model using a correlative approach. For the latter, we used statistical methods to test hypotheses about climatic drivers of treeline in the Himalaya and its potential response to climate change under three IPCC greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. We then assessed how change in treeline might affect the distribution of snow leopard habitat. Results indicate that about 30% of snow leopard habitat in the Himalaya may be lost due to a shifting treeline and consequent shrinking of the alpine zone, mostly along the southern edge of the range and in river valleys. But, a considerable amount of snow leopard habitat and linkages are likely to remain resilient to climate change, and these should be secured. This is because, as the area of snow leopard habitat fragments and shrinks, threats such as livestock grazing, retaliatory killing, and medicinal plant collection can intensify. We propose this approach for landscape conservation planning for other species with extensive spatial requirements that can also be umbrella species for overall biodiversity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sirex noctilio is an invasive wood-feeding wasp that threatens the world's commercial and natural pine forests. Successful tree colonization by this insect is contingent on the decline of host defenses and the ability to utilize the woody substrate as a source of energy. We explored its potential association with bacterial symbionts that may assist in nutrient acquisition via plant biomass deconstruction using growth assays, culture-dependent and -independent analysis of bacterial frequency of association and whole-genome analysis. We identified Streptomyces and gamma-Proteobacteria that were each associated with 94% and 88% of wasps, respectively. Streptomyces isolates grew on all three cellulose substrates tested and across a range of pH 5.6 to 9. On the basis of whole-genome sequencing, three Streptomyces isolates have some of the highest proportions of genes predicted to encode for carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZyme) of sequenced Actinobacteria. gamma-Proteobacteria isolates grew on a cellulose derivative and a structurally diverse substrate, ammonia fiber explosion-treated corn stover, but not on microcrystalline cellulose. Analysis of the genome of a Pantoea isolate detected genes putatively encoding for CAZymes, the majority predicted to be active on hemicellulose and more simple sugars. We propose that a consortium of microorganisms, including the described bacteria and the fungal symbiont Amylostereum areolatum, has complementary functions for degrading woody substrates and that such degradation may assist in nutrient acquisition by S. noctilio, thus contributing to its ability to be established in forested habitats worldwide.

AB Although it is well established that butterfly richness is affected by climate and human factors (e.g. habitat disturbance and degradation) at different spatial scales, the drivers behind these changes vary greatly according to the geographical region and the ecology of the species concerned. It is essential that this variation be understood if trends in diversity are to be predicted with any degree of confidence under a scenario of global change. Here we examine patterns of butterfly species richness among groups differing in degree of habitat specialization, diet breadth and mobility in the north-west Mediterranean Basin, a European hotspot for this taxon. We analyze a large number of butterfly communities and take into consideration the main potential drivers, that include climatic, geographic and resource variables, landscape structure and human environmental impact at different spatial scales. Our study shows that both climatic and anthropogenic factors play an important role in determining butterfly species richness in the north-west Mediterranean Basin, but that their relative impact differs between specialist and generalist groups. At lower altitudes, water availability, a product of the interplay between temperature and rainfall, and negative effects of temperature appear as the most determinant factors. Maximum diversity was observed at mid-altitudes, which reveals the importance from a conservation point of view of Mediterranean mountain ranges. The results suggest serious population declines in specialist species restricted to mountain areas as a result of climate warming in combination with habitat loss caused by the abandonment of grazing and mowing. They also suggest negative trends for generalist species due to an increase in aridity in combination with an increase in intensification of human land use in lowland areas. Such synergies are expected to lead to rapid declines in Mediterranean butterfly populations in the coming years, thereby posing a severe threat for the conservation of European biodiversity.

AB Molecular phylogeographic studies have recently begun to elucidate how plant species from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and adjacent regions responded to the Quaternary climatic oscillations. In this regard, however, far less attention has been paid to the southern and south-eastern declivities of the QTP, i.e. the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains (HHM) region. Here, we report a survey of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequence variation in the HHM endemic Sinopodophyllum hexandrum, a highly selfing alpine perennial herb with mainly gravity-dispersed berries (105 individuals, 19 localities). We specifically aimed to test a vicariant evolutionary hypothesis across the 'Mekong-Salween Divide', a known biogeographic and phytogeographic boundary of north-to-south trending river valleys separating the East Himalayas and Hengduan Mts. Both cpDNA and AFLPs identified two divergent phylogroups largely congruent with these mountain ranges. There was no genetic depauperation in the more strongly glaciated East Himalayas (AFLPs: H-E = 0.031; cpDNA: h(s) = 0.133) compared to the mainly ice-free Hengduan Mts. (AFLPs: H-E = 0.037; cpDNA: h(s) = 0.082), while population differentiation was consistently higher in the former region (AFLPs: Phi(ST) = 0.522 vs. 0.312; cpDNA: Phi(ST) = 0.785 vs. 0.417). Our results suggest that East Himalayan and Hengduan populations of S. hexandrum were once fragmented, persisted in situ during glacials in both areas, and have not merged again, except for a major instance of inter-lineage chloroplast capture identified at the MSD boundary. Our coalescent time estimate for all cpDNA haplotypes (c. 0.37-0.48 mya), together with paleogeological evidence, strongly rejects paleo-drainage formation as a mechanism underlying allopatric fragmentation, whereas mountain glaciers following the ridges of the MSD during glacials (and possible interglacials) could have been responsible. This study thus indicates an important role for mountain glaciers in driving (incipient) allopatric speciation across the MSD in the HHM region by causing vicariant lineage divergence and acting as barriers to post-divergence gene flow.

AB One of the most frequently applied methods for integrating controls on primary production through satellite data is the light use efficiency CLUE) approach, which links vegetation gross or net primary productivity (GPP or NPP) to remotely sensed estimates of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR). Eddy covariance towers provide continuous measurements of carbon flux, presenting an opportunity for evaluation of satellite estimates of GPP. Here we investigate relationships between eddy covariance estimated GPP, environmental variables derived from flux towers, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and GPP across African savanna ecosystems. MODIS GPP was found to underestimate GPP at the majority of sites, particularly at sites in the Sahel. EVI was found to correlate well with estimated GPP on a site-by-site basis. Combining EVI with tower-measured PAR and evaporative fraction (EF, a measure of water sufficiency) improved the direct relationship between GPP and EVI at the majority of the sites. The slope of this relationship was strongly related to site peak leaf area index (LAI). These results are promising for the extension of GPP through the use of remote sensing data to a regional or even continental scale. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The 2002 Hayman Fire was the largest fire in recent Colorado history (558 km(2)). The extent of high severity combustion and possible effects on Denver's water supply focussed public attention on the effects of wildfire on water quality. We monitored stream chemistry, temperature and sediment before the fire and at monthly intervals for 5 years after the fire. The proportional extent of a basin that was burned or that burned at high severity was closely related to post-fire streamwater nitrate and turbidity. Basins that burned at high severity on >45% of their area had twice the streamwater nitrate and four times the turbidity as basins burned to a lower extent; these analytes remained elevated through 5 years post-fire. In those basins, the highest post-fire streamwater nitrate concentrations (23% of USA drinking water standards) were measured during spring, the peak discharge period. Summer streamwater was 4.0 degrees C higher in burned streams on average compared with unburned streams; these persistent post-fire stream temperature increases are probably sufficient to alter aquatic habitat suitability. Owing to the slow pace of tree colonisation and forest regrowth, recovery of the watersheds burned by the Hayman Fire will continue for decades.

AB Eddy covariance (EC) measurements have greatly advanced our knowledge of carbon exchange in terrestrial ecosystems. However, appropriate techniques are required to upscale these spatially discrete findings globally. Satellite remote sensing provides unique opportunities in this respect, but remote sensing of the photosynthetic light-use efficiency (epsilon), one of the key components of Gross Primary Production, is challenging. Some progress has been made in recent years using the photochemical reflectance index, a narrow waveband index centered at 531 and 570 nm. The high sensitivity of this index to various extraneous effects such as canopy structure, and the view observer geometry has so far prevented its use at landscape and global scales. One critical aspect of upscaling PRI is the development of generic algorithms to account for structural differences in vegetation. Building on previous work, this study compares the differences in the PRI: epsilon relationship between a coastal Douglas-fir forest located on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and a mature Aspen stand located in central Saskatchewan, Canada. Using continuous, tower-based observations acquired from an automated multi-angular spectro-radiometer (AMSPEC II) installed at each site, we demonstrate that PRI can be used to measure epsilon throughout the vegetation season at the DF-49 stand (r(2)= 0.91, p<0.00) as well as the deciduous site (r(2) = 0.88, p <0.00). It is further shown that this PRI signal can be also observed from space at both sites using daily observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) and a multi-angular implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) (r(2) = 0.54 DF-49; r(2) = 0.63 SOA; p<0.00). By implementing a simple hillshade model derived from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to approximate canopy shadow fractions (alpha(s)), it is further demonstrated that the differences observed in the relationship between PRI and epsilon at DF-49 and SOA can be attributed largely to differences in alpha(s). The findings of this study suggest that algorithms used to separate physiological from extraneous effects in PRI reflectance may be more broadly applicable and portable across these two climatically and structurally different biome types, when the differences in canopy structure are known.

There are marked practical difficulties with employing the concept of naturalness in human dominated landscapes, and the management of such ecosystems is inevitably going to need to take account of human needs and expectations. We propose that ecological quality could be assessed by its ecosystem service profile (ESP): the overlap between societal expectations for, and the sustainable provision of, suites of ecosystem services. The status for each individual ecosystem service is defined by the ratio of its sustained provision to the expected level of provision for the service. The ESP measure is a multi-criterion, context-specific assessment of the match between expectation for and sustainable supply of ecosystem services. It provides a flexible measure of quality which takes into account that the "ideal" ecosystem state is largely dependent on the specific management context. The implementation of ESPs challenges us to develop indicators for the sustained provision of individual ecosystem services, much better understanding of the trade-offs among services, and practical tools for gauging societal demands. All of which are challenging problems. The proposed framework can help to strategically address research needs and monitoring requirements and foster a more integrative approach to ecosystem assessment and management in the future. The need for this follows from the fact that the undisturbed reference state represents only one aspect of an ecosystem and that ecological quality in human dominated landscapes will, ultimately, be determined by the value society places on the sustainable provision of multiple ecosystem services.

AB The periodic production of large seed crops by trees (masting) and its interaction with stern growth has long been the objective of tree physiology research. However, very little is known about the effects of masting on stern growth and total net primary productivity (NPP) at the stand scale. This study was conducted in an old-growth, mixed deciduous forest dominated by Fagus sylvatica (L.) and covers the period from 2003 to 2007, which comprised wet, dry and regular years as well as two masts of Fagus and one mast of the co-dominant tree species Fraxinus excelsior (L.) and Acer pseudoplatanus (L.). We combined analyses of weather conditions and stem growth at the tree level (inter- and intra-annual) with fruit, stem and leaf production, and estimates of total NPP at the stand level. Finally, we compared the annual demand of carbon for biomass production with net canopy assimilation (NCA), derived from eddy covariance flux measurements, chamber measurements and modelling. Annual stem growth of Fagus was most favoured by warm periods in spring and that of Fraxinus by high precipitation in June. For stem growth of Acer and for fruit production, no significant relationships with mean weather conditions were found. Intra-annual stem growth of all species was strongly reduced when the relative plant-available water in soil dropped below a threshold of about 60% between May and July. The inter-annual variations of NCA, total NPP and leaf NPP at the stand level were low (mean values 1313, 662 and 168 g C m(-2) year(-1), respectively), while wood and fruit production varied more and contrarily (wood: 169-241 g C m(-2) year(-1); fruits: 21-142 g C m(-2) year(-1)). In all years, an annual surplus of newly assimilated carbon was calculated (on average 100 g C m(-2) year(-1)). The results suggest that stem growth is generally not limited by insufficient carbon resources; only in mast years a short-term carbon shortage may occur in spring. In contrast to common assumption, stem growth alone is not a sufficient proxy for total biomass production or the control of carbon sequestration by weather extremes.

AB The emerald ash borer (EAB, Agrilus planipennis) is decimating native ashes (Fraxinus sp.) throughout midwestern North America, killing millions of trees over the years. With plenty of ash available throughout the continent, the spread of this destructive insect is likely to continue. We estimate that the insect has been moving along a "front" at about 20 km/year since about 1998, but more alarming is its long-range dispersal into new locations facilitated by human activities. We describe a spatially explicit cell-based model used to calculate risk of spread in Ohio, by combining the insect's flight and short-range dispersal ("insect flight") with human-facilitated, long-range dispersal ("insect ride"). This hybrid model requires estimates of EAB abundance, ash abundance, major roads and traffic density, campground size and usage, distance from the core infested zone, wood products industry size and type of wood usage, and human population density. With the "insect flight" model, probability of movement is dependent on EAB abundance in the source cells, the quantity of ash in the target cells, and the distances between them. With the "insect-ride" model, we modify the value related to ash abundance based on factors related to potential human-assisted movements of EAB-infested ash wood or just hitchhiking insects. We attempt to show the advantage of our model compared to statistical approaches and to justify its practical value to field managers working with imperfect knowledge. We stress the importance of the road network in distributing insects to new geographically dispersed sites in Ohio, where 84% were within 1 km of a major highway.

AB The flow regime is considered the primary driver of physical processes in riverine ecosystems; thus we expect that the trait composition of fish assemblages might respond similarly to hydrologic variability, even at broad spatial scales. Here, we test the hypothesis that freshwater fish life history strategies on two continents (southern United States and eastern Australia) converge along gradients of hydrologic variability and primary productivity at the drainage scale. Our results show that the fishes of the United States and Australia conform to the three-dimensional adaptive space arising from the trade-offs among three basic demographic parameters of survival, fecundity; and onset and duration of reproductive life. Species from both continents represent the endpoints in adaptive space defining the periodic (19% versus 33% for the United States and Australia, respectively), opportunistic (69% versus 52%), and equilibrium life history strategies (12% versus 15%). We found evidence that fish life history composition of drainage basins in the two continents have converged across similar gradients of hydrologic variability and productivity despite phylogenetic and historical differences. Moreover, these relationships were largely consistent with predictions from life history theory. Increasing hydrologic variability has promoted the greater prevalence of opportunistic strategists (a strategy that should maximize fitness in environmental settings dominated by unpredictable environmental change) while concurrently minimizing the persistence of periodic-type species (a strategy typically inhabits seasonal, periodically suitable environments). Our study provides a conceptual framework of management options for species in regulated rivers because life history strategies are the underlying determinants for population responses to environmental change and therefore can be used to classify typical population responses to flow alteration or mitigation via environmental flow prescriptions.

AB Resource availability, competition, and predation commonly drive body size evolution. We assess the impact of high food availability and the consequent increased intraspecific competition, as expressed by tail injuries and cannibalism, on body size in Skyros wall lizards (Podarcis gaigeae). Lizard populations on islets surrounding Skyros (Aegean Sea) all have fewer predators and competitors than on Skyros but differ in the numbers of nesting seabirds. We predicted the following: (1) the presence of breeding seabirds (providing nutrients) will increase lizard population densities; (2) dense lizard populations will experience stronger intraspecific competition; and (3) such aggression, will be associated with larger average body size. We found a positive correlation between seabird and lizard densities. Cannibalism and tail injuries were considerably higher in dense populations. Increases in cannibalism and tail loss were associated with large body sizes. Adult cannibalism on juveniles may select for rapid growth, fuelled by high food abundance, setting thus the stage for the evolution of gigantism.

AB Kinkingnehun et al. (Kinkingnehun, S., Volle, E., Pelegrini-Issac, M., Golmard, J. L., Lehericy, S., du Boisgueheneuc, F., Zhang-Nunes, S., Sosson, D., Duffau, H., Samson, Y., Levy, R., Dubois, B., 2007. A novel approach to clinical-radiological correlations: Anatomo-Clinical Overlapping Maps (AnaCOM): method and validation. NeuroImage 37: 1237-1249.) have recently described a novel approach for lesion-behavior mapping (LBM), referred to as Anatomo-Clinical Overlapping Maps (AnaCOM). Conventional voxelwise LBM tools apply statistics to contrast behavioral performance of patients with lesions that encompass given voxels to control patients where these voxels are spared. In contrast, AnaCOM contrasts performance of patients with injury involving given voxels to the performance of neurologically healthy participants. The authors correctly note that their procedure can offer substantially more statistical power than conventional LBM methods. We compared AnaCOM to conventional LBM techniques by examining hemiparesis (a common consequence of stroke) as the behavior of interest. We found that AnaCOM detected many regions of the middle cerebral artery territory not associated with the motor system. We suggest that conventional LBM techniques detect regions that are damaged in patients with a deficit while spared in those without a deficit, while AnaCOM detects regions that are associated with a deficit. Therefore, this new measure may offer poor specificity. Furthermore, on theoretical grounds we suggest that permutation-based thresholding will be a more sensitive method for controlling familywise error than the method of counting lesion-overlap clusters used by AnaCOM. Finally, we note that the within group variability tends to be smaller for neurologically healthy controls than in neurological patients, due to ceiling effects. Therefore, we suggest that nonparametric measures or the Welch's t-test are more appropriate than the conventional pooled variance t-test used by AnaCOM. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   SPRUCE
AB The study of past historical events that have led to ecological changes is a recurrent topic in many disciplines. Given that many of these events have left a large and long-lasting evolutionary imprint on the extant population genetic structure of species, phylogeographic studies on modern taxa have been largely used to infer the impacts of these events and to complement previous paleoecological and paleobotanical surveys. In spite of the geographical and geological complexity of North America, converging patterns can be observed when comparing the available genetic data for forest trees. Such patterns include the co-location of genetic discontinuities among species and their coincidence with mountain ranges (e. g., the Appalachians, the Rocky Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, or the Transverse Volcanic Belt) and with previously inferred glacial refugia. Using examples drawn from the available literature, we illustrate such shared features and present the contrasting phylogeographic patterns observed among the different regions of the continent. The various evolutionary consequences of historical events that can be deduced from these phylogeographic studies (e. g., past bottlenecks, founder effects, allopatric divergence, or introgressive hybridization) are additionally discussed. The present challenges and future research prospects that are likely to further advance this field are finally outlined.

AB Practitioners of classical biological control of invasive weeds are confronted with a dual expectation: to achieve successful control of plant invaders and to avoid damage to nontarget plants and adverse indirect effects. In this paper we discuss key issues that we consider to be crucial for a safe, efficient, and successful classical biological control project, and that have also caused some recent controversy. These include selection of effective control agents, host specificity of the biological control agents, implications of the genetic population structure of the target populations, and potential impact on native food webs. With regard to improving the success rate of biological control of plant invaders, we first emphasize the importance of a clear a priori definition of success and a more ecosystem-based approach to better document both negative effects of the invasive plant as well as potential positive and negative effects of introducing biological control agents. Secondly, pre-release impact assessment could be improved by better focusing on how to reach high densities of the control agents and by including tolerance to and compensation of herbivory. Thirdly, we advocate a reinforced effort to integrate and combine biological control in combination with existing or potential management options. Finally, we propose various ecological and evolutionary hypotheses in the framework of our topic to document that biological control programmes against plant invaders also offer a great opportunity to gain new insights into basic processes in ecology and evolution.

AB There has been much controversy regarding the timing of speciation events in birds, and regarding the relative roles of natural and sexual selection in promoting speciation. Here, we investigate these issues using winter wrens (Troglodytes troglodytes), an unusual example of a passerine with a Holarctic distribution. Geographical variation has led to speculation that the western North American form Troglodytes troglodytes pacificus might be a distinct biological species compared to those in eastern North America (e.g. Troglodytes troglodytes hiemalis) and Eurasia. We located the first known area in which both forms can be found, often inhabiting neighbouring territories. Each male wren in this area sings either western or eastern song, and the differences in song are as distinct in the contact zone as they are in allopatry. The two singing types differ distinctly in mitochondrial DNA sequences and amplified fragment length polymorpism profiles. These results indicate that the two forms are reproductively isolated to a high degree where they co-occur and are therefore separate species. DNA variation suggests that the initial split between the two species occurred before the Pleistocene, quite long ago for sister species in the boreal forest. Surprisingly, the two forms are similar in morphometric traits and habitat characteristics of territories. These findings suggest that sexual selection played a larger role than habitat divergence in generating reproductive isolation, and raise the possibility that there are other such morphologically cryptic species pairs in North America.

AB Black poplar (Populus nigra L.) is a keystone species for riparian ecosystems in Europe. We analysed the structure of genetic diversity of 17 populations from I I river valleys that are part of seven catchment systems (Danube, Ebro, Elbe, Po, Rhine, Rhone, and Usk) in Europe, in relation to geography and river management. In total, 1069 trees were genotyped using AFLP and microsatellite markers.
   The trees had an observed heterozygosity of 0.74 (range 0.59-0.82 across microsatellite loci). The majority (72.6-90.8%, depending on the marker system) of the genetic variation was present within populations. Most pairs of populations along a river were relatively similar (pairwise F-st, 0.042-0.135 based on AFLP, 0.002-0.037 based on microsatellites). Overall population differentiation among rivers was considerable (F-st among populations was 0.268 based on AFLR and 0.081 based on microsatellites). An analysis using the program Structure indicated that all populations recruited plants from several clusters. Geographically close populations tended to draw from the same Structure clusters, including populations from adjacent catchments. The Danube and Inn populations in Austria were genetically more similar to the Vltava population (Elbe catchment) in Czech Republic than the geographically more distant populations along the Tisa and Prut rivers of the Danube catchment in Ukraine. This indicates that gene flow and dispersal takes place across fairly large distances and between river catchments. Consistent with this result, a principal coordinate analysis of genetic distances among individual trees based on AFLP bands showed large overlap of populations, although the French and Spanish samples formed distinct clusters, and the samples from the Ticino (Italy) were at an intermediate position.
   The extent of clonal duplication was highest along regulated rivers, with e.g., 41% clonal duplication along the Rhine in The Netherlands (up to 32 trees for one genet). The Usk contained a man-made population (two genotypes along the entire river, one genet present as 70 trees out of 72 trees sampled). No clonal duplication was found along dynamic rivers, such as the Ebro (Spain), the Drome (France), and the Tisa and Prut (Ukraine).
   It is concluded that the restoration of the natural habitat and the re-creation of the natural dynamics of the floodplain, in combination with sufficiently sized and spaced natural populations as seed sources, are the most important measures for sufficient natural regeneration and conservation of this species in the future.

AB Most population models assume that individuals have equal opportunities for survival and reproduction, although many natural populations consist of individuals with different vital parameters that remain different over time. Individual heterogeneity in vital parameters, which may depend on age or stage, can alter many population characteristics compared with a homogeneous population, affecting both deterministic and stochastic properties of the population process. Demographic variance is an important parameter influenced by heterogeneity. However, whether heterogeneity leads to increased or decreased demographic variance has been an unresolved question, except for special cases. Here, we present a general stochastic matrix model for a heterogeneous population that allows us to examine effects of heterogeneity on population dynamics, even when the degree of heterogeneity depends on age. Using this model, we found that the demographic variance may increase, decrease, or remain unaltered compared with a homogeneous comparison model, depending on the vital parameter values and on how these are distributed among individuals at each time step. Furthermore, if the reproductive value is the same for all individuals, heterogeneity has no effect on the demographic variance. Thus, we provide a general theoretical framework for analyzing how individual heterogeneity caused by different biological mechanisms affects fluctuations of especially small populations.

AB Most organisms live in changing environments or do not use the same resources at different stages of their lives or in different seasons. As a result, density dependence will affect populations differently at different times. Such sequential density dependence generates markedly different population responses compared to the unrealistic assumption that all events occur simultaneously. Various field studies have also shown that the conditions that individuals experience during one period can influence success and per capita vital rates during the following period. These carry-over effects further complicate any general principles and increase the diversity of possible population dynamics. In this review, we describe how studies of sequential density dependence have diverged in directions that are both taxon-specific and have non-overlapping terminology, despite very similar underlying problems. By exploring and highlighting these similarities, we aim to improve communication between fields, clarify common misunderstandings, and provide a framework for improving conservation and management practices, including sustainable harvesting theory.

AB In this study, we used ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) and principal components analysis (PCA) of climate variables to define the climate niches and areas of potential colonization of six species of ticks in the Mediterranean region: Dermacentor marginatus Sulzer, Rhipicephalus bursa Canestrini & Fanzago, Rhipicephalus turanicus Pomerantsev, Matikashvili & Lototsky, Hyalomma marginatum Koch, Hyalomma excavatum Koch, and Boophilus annulatus (Say). ENFA generated distribution models that varied in accuracy from high to very high (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.87-0.97), with the lowest AUC obtained for B. annulatus. PCA provided an adequate separation of the climate niches of different species in the reduced space of the variables. Climate scenarios and factorial consensus analysis were used to evaluate the geographic impact of climate change (as turnover in habitat suitability) on the niches of the ticks and net variations in habitat availability. The scenario that was most compatible with estimates of future climate in the Mediterranean region (increase in temperature and decrease in rainfall) was predicted to produce a sharp increase in the extent of suitable habitat for R. bursa, R. turanicus, and H. marginatum. This scenario would result in a northward expansion of suitable habitat areas for these three species. The highest impact (highest species turnover) would be recorded at the margin of the current distribution range of the three species. A sensitivity analysis of the ecological response of the ticks to the climate change scenarios showed that the response is statistically different in different regions of the PCA-derived niche. These results outline the need to further investigate the potential of bioclimate models to obtain accurate estimations of tick species turnover under conditions of climate change over wide areas.

TI Nuclear and mitochondrial data reveal different evolutionary processes

AB Background: Cichlid fishes are notorious for their wealth of intra- and interspecific colour pattern diversity. In Lake Tanganyika, the endemic genus Tropheus represents the most impressive example for geographic variation in the pattern and hue of integument colouration, but the taxonomy of the over 100 mostly allopatric colour morphs remains to a large degree unresolved. Previous studies of mitochondrial DNA sequence data revealed polyphyly of the six nominally described species and complex phylogeographic patterns influenced by lake level fluctuations and population admixture, and suggested the parallel evolution of similar colour patterns in divergent evolutionary lineages. A gene tree of a rapidly radiating group may be subject to incomplete and stochastic lineage sorting, and to overcome this problem we used multi-locus, nuclear AFLP data in comparison with mtDNA sequences to study diversification, migration and introgression in Tropheus colour morphs in Lake Tanganyika.
   Results: Significant incongruence between phylogenetic reconstructions from mitochondrial and AFLP data suggested incomplete sorting of mitochondrial haplotypes as well as frequent introgression between differentiated lineages. In contrast to the mitochondrial phylogeny, the AFLP phenogram was largely congruent with species classifications, colour pattern similarities, and in many cases also with the current geographic distribution of populations, and did not produce evidence of convergent colour pattern evolution. Homoplasy in the AFLP data was used to identify populations that were strongly affected by introgression.
   Conclusion: Different evolutionary processes were distinguished by the combination of mitochondrial and AFLP data. Mitochondrial phylogeographic patterns retained signals of large-scale migration events triggered by historical, major lake level fluctuations, whereas AFLP data indicated genetic cohesion among local groups of populations resulting from secondary contact of adjacent populations in the course of the more frequently occurring, minor lake level fluctuations. There was no support for the parallel evolution of similar colour patterns in the AFLP data. Genetic signatures of introgression and hybridisation detected in several populations suggest that lake level fluctuations drove the stunning diversification of Tropheus morphs not only through population fragmentation, but also by promoting hybridisation between differentiated morphs in secondary contact.

AB Background and Aims Plants from gypsum habitats are classified as gypsophiles and gypsovags. The former include both narrow endemics limited to small gypsum areas and regionally dominant gypsophiles growing in gypsum areas of large regions, whereas gypsovags are plants that can grow both in gypsum and non-gypsum soils. Factors controlling the distribution of gypsum plants are still not fully understood.
   Methods To assess how the different types of gypsum plants deal with the stressful conditions of gypsum substrates, comparisons were made of the leaf chemical composition of four gypsovags, five regionally dominant gypsophiles and four narrow gypsum endemics growing in two massive gypsum areas of the Iberian Peninsula.
   Key Results The chemical composition of gypsovags was clearly different from regionally dominant gypsophiles, while the chemical composition of narrow-gypsophile endemics was more similar to the chemical composition of gypsovags than to that of regionally dominant gypsophiles. Regionally dominant gypsophiles showed higher concentrations of ash, Ca, S, N, Mg P and Na, whereas gypsovags and local gypsophile endemics displayed higher concentrations of C and greater C : N ratios.
   Conclusions Such differences suggest that the three groups of gypsum plants follow diverse ecological strategies. It is suggested that regionally dominant gypsophiles might fit the 'specialist' model, being species specifically adapted to gypsum, whereas both gypsovags and narrow-gypsophile endemics might fit the 'refuge' model, being stress-tolerant species that find refuge on gypsum soils from competition. The analysis of the leaf chemical composition could be a good predictor of the degree of plants specialization to gypsum soils.

TI Reticulate phylogeny of gastropod-shell-breeding cichlids from Lake
   Tanganyika - the result of repeated introgressive hybridization

AB Background: The tribe Lamprologini is the major substrate breeding lineage of Lake Tanganyika's cichlid species flock. Among several different life history strategies found in lamprologines, the adaptation to live and breed in empty gastropod shells is probably the most peculiar. Although shell-breeding arose several times in the evolutionary history of the lamprologines, all obligatory and most facultative shell-breeders belong to the so called "ossified group", a monophyletic lineage within the lamprologine cichlids. Since their distinctive life style enables these species to live and breed in closest vicinity, we hypothesized that these cichlids might be particularly prone to accidental hybridization, and that introgression might have affected the evolutionary history of this cichlid lineage.
   Results: Our analyses revealed discrepancies between phylogenetic hypotheses based on mitochondrial and nuclear (AFLP) data. While the nuclear phylogeny was congruent with morphological, behavioral and ecological characteristics, several species-usually highly specialized shell-breeders-were placed at contradicting positions in the mitochondrial phylogeny. The discordant phylogenies strongly suggest repeated incidents of introgressive hybridization between several distantly related shell-breeding species, which reticulated the phylogeny of this group of cichlids. Long interior branches and high bootstrap support for many interior nodes in the mitochondrial phylogeny argue against a major effect of ancient incomplete lineage sorting on the phylogenetic reconstruction. Moreover, we provide morphological and genetic (mtDNA and microsatellites) evidence for ongoing hybridization among distantly related shell- breeders. In these cases, the territorial males of the inferred paternal species are too large to enter the shells of their mate, such that they have to release their sperm over the entrance of the shell to fertilize the eggs. With sperm dispersal by water currents and wave action, trans-specific fertilization of clutches in neighboring shells seem inevitable, when post-zygotic isolation is incomplete.
   Conclusion: From the direct observation of hybrids we conclude that hybridization between distantly related gastropod-shell-breeding cichlids of Lake Tanganyika follows inevitably from their ecological specialization. Moreover, the observed incongruence between mtDNA and nuclear multilocus phylogeny suggests that repeated hybridization events among quite distantly related taxa affected the diversification of this group, and introduced reticulation into their phylogeny.

AB Traditional economic models of land-use change have focused on factors such as distance to population centers, available labor supply, population density, and patterns of existing infrastructure, such as roads. While such models can reproduce urban sprawl, they do not address such fundamental issues as the causes of initial human settlement locations, variation in the growth rates of different urban centers, and the ecological consequences of different economic drivers. A complementary approach, based on properties of the environment related to net primary productivity, predicts the temporal and spatial patterns of development and land-use change associated with three distinct phases of economic development agricultural, industrial, and information/communication. Initial land-use patterns, established in response to environmental constraints on agriculture, are selectively amplified based on the subsequent requirements for industrialization. These environmental constraints are later relaxed during the information/communication phase of development, which affects portions of the landscape that were little affected by the first two phases. This sequence of events produces a predictable change in the distribution of human population density and land-use intensity that impacts different components of biodiversity over time. The agricultural phase tends to eliminate those components of biodiversity that depend on high-productivity environments, while preserving those components that can survive on marginal lands. However, the transition from an industrial to an information-driven economy breaks the linkage between productivity and land-use intensity, and allows intensification of human impacts in areas that had been protected by the constraints imposed by agricultural and industrial economies. As a consequence, the remaining reservoirs of biodiversity on marginal lands are now being threatened as formerly remote rural areas are being developed for recreational and residential use, particularly in the western United States.

AB Recent evidence suggests that female ornaments in birds not only are genetic correlates of selection on males but may also have evolved by selection acting directly on females. However, most evidence comes from studies in captivity and it is therefore still debated whether male choice is important under natural conditions. The rock sparrow, Petronia petronia, is a monomorphic passerine in which both sexes show a yellow breast patch, although females have a smaller patch than males. Breast patch in females is positively correlated with body mass and fecundity (number of broods per year). We tested whether males preferentially mate with more ornamented females in this species. We examined male mate choice by reducing the size of the yellow breast patch of free-ranging females during the pair formation period in a colony in southeast Spain. We found that females with an experimentally reduced breast patch were courted less intensely and chased less frequently, than control females were. Furthermore, females with an experimentally reduced ornament were less likely to mate and, when mated, did so at a significantly later date than controls. These results are supported by correlational observations from another rock sparrow population, for which a larger data set was available, showing that pairs mated assortatively with respect to breast patch size. Altogether; these results therefore suggest that female ornamentation may be sexually selected in this species. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB 1. The leaf size-twig size spectrum is an important spectrum of variation between species, although the costs and benefits of larger vs smaller leaf size are poorly understood. This study quantified the dry mass costs of deploying leaf area in relation to leaf size, across 70 species from four sites contrasted on the basis of rainfall and soil nutrients in east-temperate Australia.
   2. Leaf mass fraction beyond 10 mm(2) of conductive cross-section (LMF10) varied threefold and was strongly positively correlated with leaf size, both across all species and within each habitat. This and other key correlations were significant both across species and as evolutionary divergences.
   3. An LMF10 advantage for larger-leaved species should translate into a proportional advantage in dry mass acquisition, yet species with small leaves persist and sustain populations. This raises the question as to what factors might counterbalance an LMF advantage associated with larger leaf size.
   4. Within some sites, specific leaf area (SLA) decreased with leaf size, which counterbalanced the LMF10 advantage. Within other sites, and across all sites, SLA did not decline with leaf size. In these comparisons other factors, such as avoidance of overheating, must counterbalance the LMF10 advantage to larger-leaved species.
   5. Wood density was negatively correlated with leaf size. However, the relationship was weaker within sites in the lower rainfall zone, and species in these sites had generally higher wood density. Sapwood cross-sectional area per unit leaf area (Huber value) varied approximately ninefold across all species, and was correlated with both leaf size and SLA across all species, but not within sites.

AB Personality traits are a major class of behavioral variation often observed within populations of animals. However, little is known of the integration between personality and an individual's underlying biology. To address this, the authors measured personality traits in squid (Euprymna tasmanica) in 2 contexts while also describing trait correlates with biological parameters. Four traits (shy avoidance-bold aggression, activity, bury persistence, and reactivity) were reliably measured; however, trait expression between contexts was not correlated and thus was context-specific. Trait variation was not a function of gender or of somatic or reproductive condition but was explained partially by a squid's sexual maturity and its size. Results are discussed in terms of the interplay between personality variation and resulting life history strategies in animals.

AB Changes in tree-line, mean July temperature (T-jul ) and mean annual precipitation (P-ann ) for the last 10 200 cal. yr BP are reconstructed on the basis of pollen and plant macrofossils preserved in lake sediments from two sites near the present-day tree-line in Troms, northern Norway. Quantitative climate reconstructions are performed using pollen-climate transfer functions based on WA-PLS regression. Early Holocene Betula pubescens forests were gradually replaced by Pinus sylvestris at Dalmutladdo (355 m a.s.l.) starting about 7000 cal. yr BP. The local presence of pine woodland at that time is supported by finds of stomata and plant macrofossils and by high pollen accumulation rates. Until about 4000 cal. yr BP the P. sylvestris tree-line was 250-300 m higher than today, suggesting T-jul about 2.0degreesC higher than at present. The later part of the Holocene has a cooler and moister climate and an increasing development of mires and fern-rich vegetation, as shown by increases of Sphagnum and fern spores and the re-establishment of B. pubescens woodland. The reconstructed T-jul from the two sites shows similar trends to previously published data, with T-jul 1-2degreesC warmer between 9500 cal. yr BP and 2000 cal. yr BP T-jul . Maximum T-jul values occur between 8500 and 4500 cal. yr BP, after which there is a gradual decrease in T-jul.

TI Cross-platform comparison and visualisation of gene expression data

SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS

AB Background: Rapid development of DNA microarray technology has resulted in different laboratories adopting numerous different protocols and technological platforms, which has severely impacted on the comparability of array data. Current cross-platform comparison of microarray gene expression data are usually based on cross-referencing the annotation of each gene transcript represented on the arrays, extracting a list of genes common to all arrays and comparing expression data of this gene subset. Unfortunately, filtering of genes to a subset represented across all arrays often excludes many thousands of genes, because different subsets of genes from the genome are represented on different arrays. We wish to describe the application of a powerful yet simple method for cross-platform comparison of gene expression data. Co-inertia analysis (CIA) is a multivariate method that identifies trends or co-relationships in multiple datasets which contain the same samples. CIA simultaneously finds ordinations (dimension reduction diagrams) from the datasets that are most similar. It does this by finding successive axes from the two datasets with maximum covariance. CIA can be applied to datasets where the number of variables (genes) far exceeds the number of samples (arrays) such is the case with microarray analyses.
   Results: We illustrate the power of CIA for cross-platform analysis of gene expression data by using it to identify the main common relationships in expression profiles on a panel of 60 tumour cell lines from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) which have been subjected to microarray studies using both Affymetrix and spotted cDNA array technology. The co-ordinates of the CIA projections of the cell lines from each dataset are graphed in a bi-plot and are connected by a line, the length of which indicates the divergence between the two datasets. Thus, CIA provides graphical representation of consensus and divergence between the gene expression profiles from different microarray platforms. Secondly, the genes that define the main trends in the analysis can be easily identified.
   Conclusions: CIA is a robust, efficient approach to coupling of gene expression datasets. CIA provides simple graphical representations of the results making it a particularly attractive method for the identification of relationships between large datasets.

AB Several explanations have been given for the decline in species richness with altitude. However, separating the influences of altitude, area, and isolation is difficult because of the conical shape of mountains. We used species lists of aquatic plants from > 300 lakes in a small geographical area to investigate the influence of altitude on species richness. Altitude and/or surface area were better predictors of species richness than any measure of water chemistry. The surface area and depth of individual lakes were not related to altitude, neither was the degree of isolation from other waterbodies. Although species range size increased with altitude, range sizes of all but the rarer species (in the data set) encompassed the lowest altitudes, indicating species loss rather than turnover and no influence of the Rapoport rescue effect. Nevertheless we found a decline in species richness with altitude, additive to the effect of area. Species were ascribed to attribute groups according to an a priori classification based on morphological and life-history traits. The number of attribute groups and number of species within each group increased with area, suggesting both increased diversity and coexistence within niches. With altitude, the number of attribute groups declined, but the number of species per group increased, consistent with a loss of richness and reduced competition. The species remaining at high altitudes were characterised by stress tolerant traits, associated with sites of low productivity.
   Our results suggest an absolute effect of altitude on species richness, irrespective of other influences and consistent with a decline in productivity.

AB 1. Patterns of leaf attributes were compared at regional and global scales in relation to the seasonal availability of water.
   2. Light-saturated assimilation rate (A(mass)), leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf density, thickness, life span, saturated water content, chlorophyll, nitrogen and phosphorus content were determined during the wet season for 21 tree species in four contrasting habitats in northern Australia. Rainfall in this area is extremely seasonal.
   3. A(mass) and foliar chlorophyll, N and P contents were positively correlated with each other, and were all negatively correlated with LMA, leaf thickness, density and life span.
   4. Deciduous species had smaller LMA and leaf life span, and larger foliar N and P contents than did evergreen species.
   5. The eight Myrtaceous species had smaller A(mass), foliar chlorophyll, N and P contents, and larger LMA, leaf thickness and leaf life span than did the non-Myrtaceous species.
   6. Leaves from the closed canopy dry monsoon forest had significantly larger A(mass), chlorophyll and P contents than did leaves from the three open canopy habitats (eucalypt open forest, mixed woodland and Melaleuca swamp). This reflected the relatively low proportions of evergreen and Myrtaceous species in the dry monsoon forest. There were also significant intraspecific differences among habitats.
   7. Leaf thickness, density and LMA were lower than predicted from globally derived relationships with temperature and precipitation. Tropical seasonally dry biomes are under-represented in such global analyses.

AB The study of the distribution of biomass by size provides an ataxonomic approach for analyzing the structure of the pelagic ecosystem. However, empirical data regarding planktonic size-structure in offshore areas are scarce. Here, we report the results of a study of the planktonic biomass size-distribution at several stations located within two regions (Sargasso Sea and New England Seamounts Area) of the Northwest Atlantic. The biomass size-spectra covered a body-size range from bacteria to mesozooplankton and a depth range from the surface to 400 m. It is shown that the slope of the normalized biomass size-spectrum (NBS-spectrum) varies depending on whether volume or carbon units are used. The transformation from volume to carbon units makes the slope of the NBS-spectrum approximately 0.15 units more negative. The distribution of normalized-biomass by size was linear (plotted on a log-log scale) at all stations. The slopes of the NBS-spectra (volume scale) ranged from -0.96 to -1.01. There were no significant differences among the slopes of the NBS-spectra within either of the two areas studied. In addition, no significant differences were detected between the stations in the Sargasso Sea and those located in the New England Seamounts area. Apart from a tendency towards a decrease in the intercept of the normalized-biomass axis of the size-spectra in deeper waters, the NBS-spectra were also very similar through depth. The slopes of the NBS-spectra in biovolume units are not significantly different from -1.0 (p < 0.01), and therefore are in agreement with Sheldon's Linear Biomass Hypothesis. By contrast, the slopes of the NBS-spectra in carbon units are significantly different (p < 0.01) from -1.0 (range = -1.09 to -1.17; all stations together = -1.14) and their numerical values are in close agreement with Platt and Denman's model and with the findings of Rodriguez and Mullin, 1986a) for the North Pacific Central Gyre. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the planktonic size-structure of offshore oligotrophic systems is a conservative property. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A highly diversified mix of fish species, cephalopods and crustaceans, together with several macro-epibenthic organisms, compose trawl catches in the Mediterranean Sea. Management of Mediterranean trawling needs a multispecies approach that considers the community and not the single species as the basic unit of the analysis. While many studies have correlated several environmental factors to the spatial organizations of demersal organisms, few have focused on the role of macro-epibenthic communities in structuring demersal assemblages. In this paper, the following hypotheses were tested: (1) there are discrete demersal assemblages in the central Mediterranean Sea; (2) the distribution and diversity of demersal communities does not change on small temporal scales (I year); (3) the demersal assemblages were segregated across both different epibenthic assemblages and depth gradients. Shallow stations were separated into coastal and middle-deep shelf assemblages while stations on the slope formed three main assemblages: slope edge, upper slope and middle slope assemblages. The demersal community did not show a substantial change at the small temporal scale. Sandy, sand-muddy and detritic epibenthic communities characterized coastal shelf assemblages, while epibenthic assemblage on muddy bottoms were dominant in the deeper areas of the shelf. A well-defined difference in macro-epibenthic faunal associations among stations on the slope (depth > 200 m) was not found. Depth appeared to affect diversity of the main taxa of demersal organisms in different ways. Teleostean diversity did not show any trend with depth, the number of cephalopod species increased on the shelf and decreased on the slope while crustacean and elasmobranch species richness increased significantly from the shelf to the middle slope. The strong correlation shown in this study between epifaunal benthic communities and demersal fish assemblages requires the formulation of an ecosystem-based management for the Mediterranean Sea trawl fisheries. The existence of such biological diversity certainly contributes to the Mediterranean ecosystem health and its conservation should become one of the main objective of demersal resources management in the future.

AB The scaling of metabolic rate with the size of algae has been discussed and researched at length. The observation that algae usually have exponents b in the equation R = a(.)W(-b) (where R is the specific growth rate, W is the organism [cell] biomass, and a and b are constants) equal to or higher than the value of -0.25 for many other organisms is generally related to resource-saturated (maximal) values of R. Recent work has shown that the exponent b for light-limited growth is more negative than -0.25. This was predicted from considerations of the package effect in photon absorption, as modulated by the volume-specific pigment content of the cells, and the photosynthetic unit size. Further work is needed to extrapolate these findings to fluctuating light environments. This minireview puts the recent work into a broader context and suggests how further work could quantify the roles of optical thickness and of spatial and temporal variations in the radiation field in determining metabolic rates.

AB Seagrass habitats exhibit high structural variability at local (<1 to 10s of in) and landscape (100 to 1000s of in) scales, which is closely linked with physical setting. In this study, we conducted 2 spring and 2 fall field surveys in 1991 and 1992 over a 25 km long portion of Core and Back Sounds, North Carolina, USA, to relate macrofaunal abundance to measures of seagrass landscape structure and associated ecological variables. Independent variables included seagrass bed structure (percent cover and total linear edge), local-scale ecological attributes (shoot density, shoot biomass, percent sediment organic matter) and elements of physical setting (water depth and energy regime as estimated by a relative wave exposure index [REI]). Seagrass beds were composed of eelgrass (Zostera marina: fall/spring-dominant), shoalgrass (Halodule wrightii: summer-dominant), some widgeongrass (Ruppia maritima) and minor amounts of macroalgae. Seagrass coverage ranged from highly patchy (13 % cover) dune-like beds to continuous (100 % cover) low-relief beds within 18 replicate 50 x 50 in plots. Twelve species (8 decapods and 4 fishes) made up 95 % or more of the catch, and densities of nearly all varied significantly between seasons and years. Multiple regression analysis indicated that relationships between faunal densities and environmental variables varied greatly between species and between collection periods. In addition, species-specific correlations between faunal density and environmental variables generally were not consistent among the 4 collection periods. REI and seagrass shoot biomass appeared to have the greatest influence on species' densities, with REI having more influence on densities in 1991 and shoot biomass having more influence on densities in 1992. Seagrass percent cover and total linear edge explained little of the variation in species' densities. Only blue crab Callinectes sapidus, density was (positively) correlated with seagrass percent cover in the spring of 1992. In principal components analyses, species groupings were inconsistent between collection periods, though grouping by relative abundance was evident in some collection periods. There was little separation between crustaceans and fishes in principal component space, but sites of high faunal abundance were distinct from sites of low faunal abundance. Sites with consistently high faunal abundance generally were found in western Core and Back Sounds, whereas sites with consistently low faunal abundance were found in eastern Core Sound, suggesting that processes operating at larger than landscape spatial scales (e.g. larval delivery by currents) may influence faunal community patterns in these seagrass landscapes. The influence of a variety of covarying factors on fauna operating over a range of spatial scales highlights fundamental differences in the relationship between landscape structure and animal abundance in seagrass versus terrestrial habitats.

AB A five-year removal experiment in which plant functional group diversity was manipulated found strong limitation of ecosystem functioning caused by the differing abilities of remaining functional groups to recruit into space left unoccupied by the plants removed. We manipulated functional group diversity and composition by removing all possible combinations of zero. one, or two plant functional groups (forbs, C-3 graminoids, and C-4 graminoids), as well as randomly chosen biomass at levels corresponding to the functional group removals, from a prairie grassland community. Although random biomass removal treatments showed no significant effect of removing biomass in general on ecosystem functions measured (P > 0.05), the loss of particular functional groups led to significant differences in above(P<0.001) and belowground (P<0.001) biomass, rooting-zone (P=0.001) and leached (P=0.01) nitrogen, nitrogen miniralization (P<0.001), and community drought resistance (P = 0.002). Many of these differences stemmed from the marked difference in the ways remaining functional groups responded to the experimental removals. Strong recruitment limitation of C-4 graminoids resulted in large areas of open ground, high nutrient leaching. and high community drought resistance in plots containing just this functional group. In contrast, rhizomatous C-3 graminoids quickly colonized space and used soil resources made available by the removal of other groups, leading to lower soil nitrate in plots containing C-3 graminoids. These effects of recruitment limitation on ecosystem functioning illustrate possible effects of diversity loss not captured by synthetic experiments in which diversity gradients are created by adding high densities of seeds to bare soil.

AB Deforestation and selective logging in the tropics may have serious consequences on genetic processes in tropical tree populations, affecting long-term survival of a given species as well as tropical forest communities. Because understanding the effects of human-induced changes on genetic processes is of utmost importance in formulating sound conservation and management plans for tropical forest communities, we developed microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for the tropical tree Carapa guianensis (Meliaceae) and assessed the polymorphism of SSRs in adult and sapling populations in a large contiguous forest and in selectively logged and fragmented forests. The number of alleles in polymorphic loci ranged between 4 and 28. No inbreeding was detected in saplings or adult cohorts, but the allelic richness was lower in the sapling cohort of the isolated fragment. Genetic distances, Nei's D and (delta mu)(2), and R-ST values among saplings were greater than among adult cohorts, suggesting restriction of gene flow due to deforestation and habitat fragmentation. These SSR loci may be used to address many related questions regarding the population and conservation genetics of tropical trees.

ID OUTBREAKS; ADELAIDE; SA
AB CLIMEX is used to analyse the potential distribution of the Queensland fruit fly in relation to long-term average meteorological data. Different hypotheses on the mechanisms limiting the distribution of this species are examined. The analyses indicate that different CLIMEX models discriminate between locations in different ways. In particular, the models describing the limiting effects of cold stress yield substantially different estimates of the areas that can support overwintering populations. With the threshold temperature model of cold stress, extreme low temperatures exclude flies from high-altitude areas, but fail to exclude them from areas known not to support overwintering populations. These areas can only be rendered unfavourable by using the degree-day model of cold stress, which prevents sufficient thermal accumulation above the developmental threshold to maintain basic metabolic processes for long periods. In contrast, 2 models describing different modes of heat stress accumulation provide similar results and are interchangeable. Our analyses also indicate the potential for agricultural practices, such as irrigation, to alter quite dramatically the suitability of an area for Queensland fruit fly, and impact upon its geographical distribution and the pattern of activity.

AB Soil chemical properties for a subtropical rain forest in the Nanjenshan Reserve, southern Taiwan, were examined to determine soil-landscape and soil-vegetation relationships. Soil sampling sites were separated into four groups based on landscape features and exposure to the prevailing northeasterly monsoon winds. Corresponding vegetation types were delimited along the first DCA axis. The forest showed a drastic change both in structure and floristic composition along the wind-stress gradient. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that both topographic variables and vegetation types were needed to explain the variation in soil data. Soil properties that differed significantly among landforms were pH: available N, CEC, exchangeable Al, K, Ca and Mg. Levels of pH, exchangeable Ca and Mg increased in a downslope direction, and exchangeable Al tended to be higher in the upper slope soils. These trends pointed to the importance of slope processes in redistribution of soil minerals. The main differences in soil properties attributed to the influence of the occupying vegetation were apparently aspect dependent. The contents of available N, exchangeable K, and CEC in the 0-40 cm depth of soils under windward low-stature (mostly sclerophyllous) forest were consistently lower compared to those under the leeward forest. For a given catena, however, soil variability associated with vegetation differences seemed to be confounded by the slope processes.

AB Fall and winter movements of and habitat use by cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarki were studied with radiotelemetry in low, mid, and high altitudes of a river system to evaluate the timing and extent of habitat shifts when fish moved from summer feeding areas to overwintering areas. The movements of 20 fish were monitored from August to November 1991, and 17 fish were monitored from October to December 1992. Cutthroat trout moved out of summer habitats in mid-September, and many made a two-stage shift in habitat use from summer to winter that was associated with anchor ice formation. When cutthroat trout were excluded from fall habitats by anchor ice, they moved to overwintering areas less likely to be influenced by frazil and anchor ice: deep pools with ice cover or areas where water temperatures were higher than the rest of the stream because of springs or upwelling warm groundwater. Cutthroat trout used deeper water and smaller diameter substrates in winter than in summer but used less cover during winter. Because of decreases in discharge and exclusion by anchor ice, cutthroat trout were forced into restricted suitable habitat, which resulted in large aggregations of fish. Cutthroat trout moved 0.0-7.6 km from summer to overwintering areas. They were stationary most of the time; when they did move, most movements exceeded 100 m. The number of movements made decreased from summer to winter.

AB 1. The identification of species, communities, or ecosystems that are likely to be strongly damaged by human activities (i.e. that are fragile) forms an essential part of nature conservation management. We review the meaning of ecosystem fragility, which we define as the inverse of ecosystem stability.
   2. Many definitions of fragility and stability have been proposed but all conclude that the concepts are too complex to be meaningfully defined, and therefore divide them into smaller entities. This variety of terms has not proved useful in nature conservation management.
   3. Fragility may be regarded as an inherent property of an ecosystem, i.e. an ecosystem has a certain fragility whether or not it is ever exposed to any disturbances. This fragility is impossible to quantify, leaving it as a mere metaphysical term. The only observable fragility is that displayed as a result of disturbances, natural as well as human-caused, operating in the ecosystem. Therefore, relating ecosystems to the disturbances that work there can provide useful assessments, an approach closely related to environmental impact assessment.
   4. Basically, fragility and stability of an ecosystem relate to degree of change in species abundance and composition, following disturbance. High rates of species turnover or population fluctuations characterize fragile ecosystems, and vice versa. The diversity of ecological processes related to these changes makes ecosystem fragility a central evaluation criterion in conservation management. Fragility is also closely related to many frequently used criteria in evaluation and assessment for conservation.
   5. We consider how the concept of ecosystem fragility can be applied in nature conservation, how to systematize its assessment, and how to locate especially fragile areas.

AB Changes in edaphic conditions and vegetation along snowmelt gradients are well known in many alpine areas, but very few studies have used multivariate techniques to document these changes at a microgeographic scale and to measure predictability of snowmelt patterns. This paper describes concordant changes in microenvironmental factors and plant species abundances among > 200 evenly spaced microsites in a large alpine snowbed in the Mosquito Range, Colorado. The snowmelt gradient was highly consistent: averaged over all microsites, the mean date of snowmelt varied by only 1 wk from 1989 to 1992, and relative date of snowmelt among microsites was highly predictable (R(2) > 90% among years). Soil in later melting microsites had reduced organic content, water content, nitrogen, phosphorous, and acidity. Total soil nitrogen and water content decreased through the growing season, while pH increased significantly. Species richness and total vegetation cover were significantly greater in early melting microsites, and soil disturbance by pocket gophers and erosion peaked in moderately late-melting areas. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that microgeographic changes in the plant community were associated with four environmental factors: snowmelt date, rock cover, soil disturbance, and soil organic content. Plant species that are common in the vegetation surrounding the snowbed tended to decrease in abundance in later melting snowbed sites. Other species attained peak abundance in the less productive late melting sites, and a few appeared to be associated with soil disturbance. Plant community differences between paired sampling units (quadrats) were determined more by differences in their snowmelt date than by their spatial separation, suggesting that plant species distributions along this alpine gradient are determined principally by ecological interactions and physiological tolerances, rather than by historical accident and limited dispersal.

AB Effects of biotic (shrimp) and abiotic (discharge) factors on the depositional environment were quantified in a montane stream in Puerto Rico. Electricity was used experimentally to exclude large (approximately >1 cm in length) biota without artificially increasing sedimentation as in cage enclosure/exclosure experiments in stream systems. Shrimp (>1 cm in length) were excluded from rock substrata by semicircular fences hooked up to battery-powered fence chargers which emitted continuous pulses of electricity. Unelectrified control substrata had natural high densities of atyid shrimp. Significantly greater masses of total sediment, fine and large organic particles, and algal biovolume occurred in shrimp exclusion treatments relative to controls. Shrimp exclusion treatments experienced slow and steady accumulation of sediments under base flow conditions and a large stepwise increase in sediment weight following a storm. No measurable sediment accrued in the presence of natural densities of shrimp under base flow conditions. Shrimp rapidly removed sediments that accrued during the storm (440-620 g.m(2) dry mass(-1)), decreasing sediment mass in control treatments to near prestorm levels (5-13 g.m(2) dry mass(-1)) within 30 h. Atyid shrimp can significantly affect the accumulation of organic and inorganic materials on rock substrata in stream pools between high-discharge events.

AB The metacommunity concept has the potential to integrate local and regional dynamics within a general community ecology framework. To this end, the concept must move beyond the discrete archetypes that have largely defined it (e.g. neutral vs. species sorting) and better incorporate local scale species interactions and coexistence mechanisms. Here, we present a fundamental reconception of the framework that explicitly links local coexistence theory to the spatial processes inherent to metacommunity theory, allowing for a continuous range of competitive community dynamics. These dynamics emerge from the three underlying processes that shape ecological communities: (1) density-independent responses to abiotic conditions, (2) density-dependent biotic interactions and (3) dispersal. Stochasticity is incorporated in the demographic realisation of each of these processes. We formalise this framework using a simulation model that explores a wide range of competitive metacommunity dynamics by varying the strength of the underlying processes. Using this model and framework, we show how existing theories, including the traditional metacommunity archetypes, are linked by this common set of processes. We then use the model to generate new hypotheses about how the three processes combine to interactively shape diversity, functioning and stability within metacommunities.

AB In focusing on how organisms' generalizable functional properties (traits) interact mechanistically with environments across spatial scales and levels of biological organization, trait-based approaches provide a powerful framework for attaining synthesis, generality and prediction. Trait-based research has considerably improved understanding of the assembly, structure and functioning of plant communities. Further advances in ecology may be achieved by exploring the trait-environment relationships of non-sessile, heterotrophic organisms such as terrestrial arthropods, which are geographically ubiquitous, ecologically diverse, and often important functional components of ecosystems. Trait-based studies and trait databases have recently been compiled for groups such as ants, bees, beetles, butterflies, spiders and many others; however, the explicit justification, conceptual framework, and primary-evidence base for the burgeoning field of 'terrestrial arthropod trait-based ecology' have not been well established. Consequently, there is some confusion over the scope and relevance of this field, as well as a tendency for studies to overlook important assumptions of the trait-based approach. Here we aim to provide a broad and accessible overview of the trait-based ecology of terrestrial arthropods. We first define and illustrate foundational concepts in trait-based ecology with respect to terrestrial arthropods, and justify the application of trait-based approaches to the study of their ecology. Next, we review studies in community ecology where trait-based approaches have been used to elucidate how assembly processes for terrestrial arthropod communities are influenced by niche filtering along environmental gradients (e.g. climatic, structural, and land-use gradients) and by abiotic and biotic disturbances (e.g. fire, floods, and biological invasions). We also review studies in ecosystem ecology where trait-based approaches have been used to investigate biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships: how the functional diversity of arthropod communities relates to a host of ecosystem functions and services that they mediate, such as decomposition, pollination and predation. We then suggest how future work can address fundamental assumptions and limitations by investigating trait functionality and the effects of intraspecific variation, assessing the potential for sampling methods to bias the traits and trait values observed, and enhancing the quality and consolidation of trait information in databases. A roadmap to guide observational trait-based studies is also presented. Lastly, we highlight new areas where trait-based studies on terrestrial arthropods are well positioned to advance ecological understanding and application. These include examining the roles of competitive, non-competitive and (multi-)trophic interactions in shaping coexistence, and macro-scaling trait-environment relationships to explain and predict patterns in biodiversity and ecosystem functions across space and time. We hope this review will spur and guide future applications of the trait-based framework to advance ecological insights from the most diverse eukaryotic organisms on Earth.

AB The cost of reproduction is a key parameter determining a species' life history strategy. Despite exhibiting some of the fastest offspring growth rates among mammals, the cost of reproduction in baleen whales is largely unknown since standard field metabolic techniques cannot be applied. We quantified the cost of reproduction for southern right whales Eubalaena australis over a 3 mo breeding season. We did this by determining the relationship between calf growth rate and maternal rate of loss in energy reserves, using repeated measurements of body volume obtained from unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetry. We recorded 1118 body volume estimates from 40 female and calf pairs over 40 to 89 d. Calves grew at a rate of 3.2 cm d(-1) (SD = 0.45) in body length and 0.081 m(3) d(-1) (SD = 0.011) in body volume, while females decreased in volume at a rate of 0.126 m(3) d(-1) (SD = 0.036). The average volume conversion efficiency from female to calf was 68% (SD = 16.91). Calf growth rate was positively related to the rate of loss in maternal body volume, suggesting that maternal volume loss is proportional to the energy investment into her calf. Maternal in vestment was determined by her body size and condition, with longer and more rotund females investing more volume into their calves compared to shorter and leaner females. Lactating females lost on average 25% of their initial body volume over the 3 mo breeding season. This study demonstrates the considerable energetic cost that females face during the lactation period, and highlights the importance of sufficient maternal energy reserves for reproduction in this capital breeding species.

AB Community ecology has broadened considerably with the recognition that it is not only at the species-level data where biological patterns and their determinants should be studied. Rather, also functional and phylogenetic data should be examined, as they may provide important information for both basic ecology and applied fields such as conservation and bioassessment. We thus explored the distance decay of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic community compositions along spatial and environmental gradients within a boreal lake metacommunity. We used distance-based methods (i.e., Mantel test, Mantel correlograms and db-RDA) to examine different facets (i.e., taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic) and components (i.e., total, turnover and nestedness-resultant) in relation to spatial and environmental variables. We found that the species compositions of lake benthic invertebrate communities varied mostly along environmental gradients, but were also weakly related to spatial distances between lakes. We also showed that functional and phylogenetic compositions were solely related to environmental variation across the lakes, but these relationships were generally weak. Our exploration of different facets and components of beta diversity added to the knowledge of lake invertebrate communities by adding functional and phylogenetic views, which has rarely been done in studies of aquatic metacommunities. Such information is also important in valuing lakes for conservation and bioassessment because it is not only at the species-level data where ecological patterns and underlying mechanisms should be explored.

AB Bears are iconic mammals with a complex evolutionary history. Natural bear hybrids and studies of few nuclear genes indicate that gene flow among bears may be more common than expected and not limited to polar and brown bears. Here we present a genome analysis of the bear family with representatives of all living species. Phylogenomic analyses of 869 mega base pairs divided into 18,621 genome fragments yielded a well-resolved coalescent species tree despite signals for extensive gene flow across species. However, genome analyses using different statistical methods show that gene flow is not limited to closely related species pairs. Strong ancestral gene flow between the Asiatic black bear and the ancestor to polar, brown and American black bear explains uncertainties in reconstructing the bear phylogeny. Gene flow across the bear clade may be mediated by intermediate species such as the geographically wide-spread brown bears leading to large amounts of phylogenetic conflict. Genome-scale analyses lead to a more complete understanding of complex evolutionary processes. Evidence for extensive inter-specific gene flow, found also in other animal species, necessitates shifting the attention from speciation processes achieving genome-wide reproductive isolation to the selective processes that maintain species divergence in the face of gene flow.

AB Environmental changes strongly impact the distribution of species and subsequently the composition of species assemblages. Although most community ecology studies represent temporal snap shots, long-term observations are rather rare. However, only such time series allow the identification of species composition shifts over several decades or even centuries. We analyzed changes in the species composition of a southeastern German butterfly and burnet moth community over nearly 2 centuries (1840-2013). We classified all species observed over this period according to their ecological tolerance, thereby assessing their degree of habitat specialisation. This classification was based on traits of the butterfly and burnet moth species and on their larval host plants. We collected data on temperature and precipitation for our study area over the same period. The number of species declined substantially from 1840 (117 species) to 2013 (71 species). The proportion of habitat specialists decreased, and most of these are currently endangered. In contrast, the proportion of habitat generalists increased. Species with restricted dispersal behavior and species in need of areas poor in soil nutrients had severe losses. Furthermore, our data indicated a decrease in species composition similarity between different decades over time. These data on species composition changes and the general trends of modifications may reflect effects from climate change and atmospheric nitrogen loads, as indicated by the ecological characteristics of host plant species and local changes in habitat configuration with increasing fragmentation. Our observation of major declines over time of currently threatened and protected species shows the importance of efficient conservation strategies.
   Cambios en las Comunidades de Mariposas a traves de Dos Siglos Los cambios ambientales impactan fuertemente la distribucion de las especies y en consecuencia a la composicion de los conjuntos de especies. Aunque la mayoria de los estudios de ecologia de comunidades representan panoramas temporales, las series de tiempo a largo plazo son bastante raras. Sin embargo, solo este tipo de informacion a largo plazo permite la identificacion de los cambios en la composicion de especies a traves de varias decadas o incluso siglos. Analizamos los cambios en la composicion de especies en las comunidades de una mariposa del sureste aleman y una polilla ziygena a lo largo de casi dos siglos (1840-2013). Clasificamos todas las especies observadas en este periodo de acuerdo a sus caracteristicas ecologicas, para asi evaluar su grado de especializacion de habitat. Esta clasificacion se baso en los caracteres de las especies de mariposa y de polilla o en las plantas hospederas de sus fases larvales. Para nuestro estudio colectamos datos del mismo periodo de tiempo sobre la temperatura y la precipitacion en nuestra area de estudio. El numero de especies declino sustancialmente de 1840 (117 especies) a 2013 (71 especies). La proporcion de especialistas de habitat disminuyo y la mayoria de estos se encuentran actualmente en peligro de extincion. En contraste, la proporcion de generalistas de habitat incremento. Las especies con un comportamiento de dispersion restringido y las especies que requieren de areas pobres en nutrientes del suelo tuvieron perdidas severas. Ademas de esto, nuestros datos indicaron una disminucion en la similitud de la composicion de especies entre decadas diferentes en el tiempo. Estos datos sobre los cambios en la composicion de especies y las tendencias generales de las modificaciones pueden reflejar los efectos del cambio climatico y las cargas de nitrogeno atmosferico, como fue indicado por las caracteristicas de las especies de plantas hospederas y los cambios locales en la configuracion de habitat con la fragmentacion creciente. Nuestra observacion de grandes declinaciones de especies amenazadas y protegidas a traves del tiempo muestra la importancia de las estrategias eficientes de conservacion.

AB Stability is an important property of ecological systems, many of which are experiencing increasing levels of anthropogenic environmental changes. However, how these environmental changes influence ecosystem stability remains poorly understood. We conducted an 8-year field experiment in a semi-arid natural grassland to explore the effects of two common environmental changes, precipitation and nitrogen enrichment, on the temporal stability of plant above-ground biomass. A split-plot design, with precipitation as the main plot factor and nitrogen as the subplot factor, was used. Temporal stability was related to potential explanatory abiotic and biotic variables using regressions and structural equation modelling. Increase in growing season precipitation enhanced plant species richness and promoted temporal stability of plant above-ground biomass. Nitrogen fertilization, however, reduced both plant species richness and temporal stability of plant above-ground biomass. Contrary to expectations, species richness was not an important driver of stability. Instead, community temporal stability was mainly driven by water and nitrogen availability that modulated the degree of species asynchrony and, to a lesser extent, by the stability of dominant plant species.Synthesis. Our results highlight the importance of limiting resources for regulating community biomass stability and suggest that the projected increase in growing season precipitation may potentially offset negative effects of increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition on species diversity and community stability in semi-arid grasslands.

AB AimPresence-only datasets represent an important source of information on species' distributions. Collections of presence-only data, however, are often spatially biased, particularly along roads and near urban populations. These biases can lead to inaccurate inferences and predicted distributions. We demonstrate a new approach of accounting for effort bias in presence-only data by explicitly incorporating sample biases in species distribution modelling.
   LocationAlberta, Canada.
   MethodsFirst, we used logistic regression to model sampling effort of recorded rare vascular plants, bryophytes and butterflies in Alberta. Second, we simulated presence/absence data for nine virtual' species based on three relative occurrence thresholds - common, rare and very rare - for each taxonomic group. We sampled these virtual species using our bias model to represent typical sampling effort characteristic of presence-only datasets. We then modelled the distributions of these virtual species using logistic regression and attempted to recover their original simulated distributions using a sample weighting term (prior weight) estimated as the inverse of probability of sampling. Bias-adjusted model estimates were compared to those obtained from random samples and biased samples without adjustment. We also compared prior-weight adjustment to bias-file and target-group background approaches in Maxent.
   ResultsSample weighting recovered regression coefficients and mapped predictions estimated from unbiased presence-only data and improved model predictive accuracy as evaluated by regression and correlation coefficients, sensitivity and specificity. Similar model improvements were achieved using the Maxent bias-file method, but results were inconsistent for the target-group background approach.
   Main conclusionsThese results suggest that sample weighting can be used to account for spatially biased presence-only datasets in species distribution modelling. The framework presented is potentially widely applicable due to availability of online biodiversity databases and the flexibility of the approach.

AB A primary focus of this short communication is to show how the operational definition of light use efficiency (LUE) influences the results and interpretation of the LUE model. Our study was motivated by the observation that multiple LUE definitions are reported in the literature. The temporal behavior of three operational definitions of LUE, based on (i) incident radiation, (ii) total absorbed radiation and (iii) radiation absorbed by photosynthetically active/green vegetation was examined for two contrasting crops (soybean and maize) having different physiologies, leaf structures and canopy architectures. Over the course of a growing season, the behavior of these three contrasting LUE definitions was strikingly dissimilar, and the degree of dissimilarity varied with contrasting crops (corn and soybean). This demonstrates that LUE model behavior would vary strongly with the LUE definition used, with resulting implications both for the estimated seasonal productivity, and for the interpretation of the underlying mechanism. Based on these findings, we recommend a standard definition of the LUE model based on radiation absorbed by green vegetation. We also discuss the practical and theoretical implications of using this simple conceptual model on a dynamic biological system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Human-bear conflicts cause annoyance, financial losses, injuries, and even death to people. In poorer parts of the world, conflicts with bears can affect local economies. Retaliation against bears may threaten the future of small, isolated populations. Our survey of the world's bear experts revealed that the problem is worsening in terms of severity of conflicts and their impact on bear conservation on all four continents inhabited by bears. However, the main drivers of conflict, and its manifestations, differ among bear species. We reviewed human-bear conflict management plans from which we identified 10 categories of mitigating interventions that together comprise a ubiquitous bear conflict management toolbox. Within this toolbox, the peer-reviewed literature indicates heavy reliance on education and physical barriers for conflict mitigation. In customizing these general approaches to local circumstances, it is important to be mindful of starkly varying geopolitical and social circumstances. There is a pressing need to improve transfer of knowledge from places with active empirical research on mitigation (especially North America), and adapting methodologies to other parts of the world. We saw little evidence of evaluation and adaptive management in the conflict plans. Failure to mitigate conflicts may reduce society's tolerance of bears and diminish conservation efforts.

AB Characterising a species' geographical extent is central to many conservation assessments, including those of the IUCN Red List of threatened species. The IUCN recommends that extent of occurrence (EOO) to be quantified by drawing a minimum convex polygon (MCP) around known or inferred presence localities. EOO calculated from verified specimens is commonly used in Red List assessments when other data are scarce, as is the case for many threatened plant species. Yet rarely do these estimates incorporate inferred localities from species distribution models (SDMs). A key impediment stems from uncertainty about how SDM predictions relate to EOO. Here we address this issue by comparing the EOOs estimated from specimen localities with EOOs derived from SDMs for plant species occurring in Costa Rica and Panama. We first analyse 20 plant species, with well-known and well-sampled distributions, and train SDMs to subsamples of the data and assess how well the SDM-derived MCPs predict both the MCPs of the subsamples and the MCPs of the complete dataset. We find that when sample sizes are small (5 or 10 samples) the SDM-derived MCPs are actually closer to the complete dataset than to the MCPs of the subsamples, both in terms of EOO and geographically. This occurs when using a probability threshold based on maximum geographical similarity between the SDM-derived MCP and the subsample MCP; other threshold methods performed less well. For the species with less well-known distributions, the SDM-derived EOOs correlate strongly with, but tend to be larger than, EOOs estimated by point data. This implies that a SDM-derived EOO may be more representative of the full EOO than that drawn around known localities. Our findings reveal situations in which SDMs provide useful information that complements the IUCN Red Listing process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Treeline shifting in tandem with climate change has widely been reported from various parts of the world. In Nepal, several impacts of climate change on the physical environment have been observed, but study on the biological impacts is lacking. This dendrochronological study was carried out at the treeline in the high mountain slope of Kalchuman Lake (3750-4003 m a.s.l.) area of Manaslu Conservation Area in the central Nepal Himalaya to explore the impact of climate change on the treeline dynamic. Two belt transect plots (size: 20 m wide, > 250 m long) were laid which included treeline as well as tree species limit. Ecological mapping of all individuals of dominant trees Abies spectabilis and Betula utilis was done and their tree cores were collected. Stand character and age distribution revealed an occurrence of more matured B. utilis (max. age 198 years) compared to A. spectabilis (max. age 160 years). A. spectabilis contained an overwhelmingly high population (89%) of younger plants (< 50 years) indicating its high recruitment rate. Population age structure along the elevation gradient revealed an upward shifting of A. spectabilis at the rate of 2.61 m year(-1) since AD 1850. The upper distribution limit of B. utilis was found to be stagnant in the past few decades. An increment in plant density as well as upward shifting in the studied treeline ecotones was observed. The temporal growth of A. spectabilis was correlated negatively with the monthly mean and minimum temperature of June to September of the current and previous year. The regeneration of A. spectabilis, on the other hand, was positively correlated with August precipitation and monthly maximum temperature of the month of the current year. The growth and regeneration of A. spectabilis was more sensitive to maximum and minimum temperature rather than average temperature. The growth of the B. utilis was mainly limited by moisture stress during the pre-monsoon season. As these two species presented species-specific responses to climate change with differential pattern in regeneration condition, much wider differences are anticipated in their population status as climate continues to change throughout the century.

AB The damaging effects of human activities on marine health suggest that a major shift is required in the way marine systems are used by individuals. Identifying how to engage society in this shift is an ongoing debate. This includes strengthening the positive connections between society and the sea. This study uses a survey (n=1047) to investigate UK public perceptions of subtidal species and marine health to assess whether it is possible to build more positive connections between society and the sea. Respondents showed considerable interest in traditionally charismatic species (puffins, seals and seahorses) although many respondents thought these species did not live in UK seas. Gender and experience of marine environments influenced public perceptions of species. Public perceptions of marine health showed issues such as litter to be considered as the greatest indicator of poor health. Ecological concepts of habitat integrity and biodiversity were also rated as important to marine health. Social values were found to influence public perceptions of marine health. The results show that perceptions are far from uniform across the population, and such diversity of perceptions is likely impact upon methods to catalyse societal engagement with marine conservation. These findings reinforce previous research on public perceptions of UK seas, and identify opportunities for building positive connections between society and the sea. Research priorities to further the debate of engaging society with the sea are identified. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We provide a synthesis of the literature describing biochemical interactions between microorganisms and insects by way of microbial volatile organic compound (MVOC) production. We evaluated the functionality and ecological context of MVOC signals, and explored important metabolic pathways involved in MVOC production. The cosmopolitan distribution of microorganisms creates a context for frequent, and frequently overlooked, insect responses to microbial emissions. There are numerous instances of MVOCs being closely associated with insect feeding behaviors, but some MVOCs are also powerful repellants. Emissions from microorganisms in situ may signal aspects of habitat suitability or potential exposure to entomopathogens. In some ecosystems, bacterial or fungal volatiles can also incite insect aggregations, or MVOCs can resemble sexual pheromones that elicit mating and oviposition behaviors from responding insects. A single microorganism or MVOC can have different effects on insect behaviors, especially across species, ontogenies, and habitats. There appears to be a multipartite basis for insect responses to MVOCs, and complex tritrophic interactions can result from the production of MVOCs. Many biochemical pathways for behaviorally active volatile production by microbial species are conserved across large taxonomic groupings of microorganisms. In addition, there is substantial functional redundancy in MVOCs: fungal tissues commonly produce polyketides and short-chain alcohols, whereas bacterial tissues tend to be more commonly associated with amines and pyrazines. We hypothesize that insect olfactory responses to emissions from microorganisms inhabiting their sensory environment are much more common than currently recognized, and that these signals represent evolutionarily reliable infochemicals. Insect chemoreception of microbial volatiles may contribute to the formation of neutral, beneficial, or even harmful symbioses and provide considerable insight into the evolution of insect behavioral responses to volatile compounds.

AB The development of isotopic baselines for comparison with paleodietary data is crucial, but often overlooked. We review the factors affecting the carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopic compositions of plants, with a special focus on the carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of twelve different species of cultivated plants (n = 91) and 139 wild plant species collected in northern Peru. The cultivated plants were collected from nineteen local markets. The mean delta C-13 value for maize (grain) was -11.8 +/- 60.4%(n = 27). Leguminous cultigens (beans, Andean lupin) were characterized by significantly lower delta N-15 values and significantly higher %N than non-leguminous cultigens. Wild plants from thirteen sites were collected in the Moche River Valley area between sea level and similar to 4,000 meters above sea level (masl). These sites were associated with mean annual precipitation ranging from 0 to 710 mm. Plants growing at low altitude sites receiving low amounts of precipitation were characterized by higher delta N-15 values than plants growing at higher altitudes and receiving higher amounts of precipitation, although this trend dissipated when altitude was >2,000 masl and MAP was >400 mm. For C-3 plants, foliar delta C-13 was positively correlated with altitude and precipitation. This suggests that the influence of altitude may overshadow the influence of water availability on foliar delta C-13 values at this scale.

   DIFFERENTIATION
AB When incompletely isolated taxa coexist in a patchy environment (e. g. mosaic hybrid zones, host-race complexes), patterns of variation may differ between selected traits/genes and neutral markers. While the genetic structure of selected traits/loci tends to coincide with habitat variables (producing Genetic-Environment Association or GEA), genetic differentiation at neutral loci unlinked to any selected locus rather depends on geographic connectivity at a large scale (e. g. Isolation-By-Distance or IBD), although these loci often display GEA at a small scale. This discrepancy has been repeatedly taken as evidence for parallel primary divergence driven by local adaptation. We argue that this interpretation needs to be addressed more thoroughly by considering the alternative hypothesis that speciation was initiated in allopatry and secondary introgression has subsequently erased the signal of past differentiation at neutral loci. We present a model of neutral introgression after secondary contact in a mosaic hybrid zone, which describes how GEAs dissipate with time and how neutral variation self-organizes according to the environmental and geographic structures. We show that although neutral loci can be affected by environmental selection, they are often more affected by history and connectivity: the neutral structure retains the initial geographic separation more than it correlates with the environment during the colonization and introgression phases, and then converges to a migration-drift balance, the most frequent outcome of which is GEA at a local scale but IBD at a large scale. This is the exact pattern usually attributed to parallel ecological speciation. Introgression is heterogeneous in space and depends on the landscape structure (e. g. it is faster in small patches, which are more impacted by immigration). Furthermore, there is no directionality in the association and it is possible to observe reversed GEAs between distant regions. We argue that the history of differentiation should ideally be reconstructed with selected loci or neutral loci linked to them, not neutral ones, and review some case studies for which the hypothesis of a long co-existence of co-adapted genetic backgrounds might have been refuted too hastily [Current Zoology 59 (1): 72-86, 2013].

AB 1. Understanding patterns of trait variation across environmental variability is necessary for development of ecological predictions. The leaf economic spectrum (LES) has demonstrated global trade-offs in leaf traits, but it is unclear whether such patterns are robust in local communities exposed to varying environments.
   2. We conducted separate greenhouse experiments to examine the effects of varying water-table depth and nitrogen availability on leaf-level trait values among a suite of co-occurring wetland species. We then assessed the effects of species-specific trait value responses on relationships predicted by LES and whether species responded similarly to variations in water-table depth and nitrogen availability.
   3. We found that both water-table depth and nitrogen availability had significant species by treatment interactions for specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen and photosynthetic rates, indicating species-specific responses to environmental variability. The responses of individual traits to different treatment levels were relatively consistent across species, but multivariate responses were more variable.
   4. We found that apart from significant relationships between specific leaf area and photosynthetic rate under some treatments, there was little support for the relationships predicted by the LES.
   5. These results suggest that, before trait-based ecology will be able to make progress towards using plant traits to predict responses of communities and ecosystems to changes in environmental drivers, considerable attention needs to be paid to the processes that control intraspecific trait variation.

   CITIZEN PARTICIPATION; ADAPTIVE COMANAGEMENT; POLICY-MAKING; FRAMEWORK;
   CONSENSUS; TRUST; PERFORMANCE
AB Key documents such as the European Water Framework Directive and the U. S. Clean Water Act state that public and stakeholder participation in water resource management is required. Participation aims to enhance resource management and involve individuals and groups in a democratic way. Evaluation of participatory programs and projects is necessary to assess whether these objectives are being achieved and to identify how participatory programs and projects can be improved. The different methods of evaluation can be classified into three groups: (i) process evaluation assesses the quality of participation process, for example, whether it is legitimate and promotes equal power between participants, (ii) intermediary outcome evaluation assesses the achievement of mainly nontangible outcomes, such as trust and communication, as well as short- to medium-term tangible outcomes, such as agreements and institutional change, and (iii) resource management outcome evaluation assesses the achievement of changes in resource management, such as water quality improvements. Process evaluation forms a major component of the literature but can rarely indicate whether a participation program improves water resource management. Resource management outcome evaluation is challenging because resource changes often emerge beyond the typical period covered by the evaluation and because changes cannot always be clearly related to participation activities. Intermediary outcome evaluation has been given less attention than process evaluation but can identify some real achievements and side benefits that emerge through participation. This review suggests that intermediary outcome evaluation should play a more important role in evaluating participation in water resource management.

AB The concept of beta-diversity, defined as dissimilarity among communities, has been widely used to investigate biodiversity patterns and community assembly rules. However, in ecosystems with high taxonomic beta-diversity, due to marked environmental gradients, the level of functional beta-diversity among communities is largely overlooked while it may reveal processes shaping community structure. Here, decomposing biodiversity indices into alpha (local) and gamma (regional) components, we estimated taxonomic and functional beta-diversity among tropical estuarine fish communities, through space and time. We found extremely low functional beta-diversity values among fish communities (<1.5%) despite high dissimilarity in species composition and species dominance. Additionally, in contrast to the high alpha and gamma taxonomic diversities, alpha and gamma functional diversities were very close to the minimal value. These patterns were caused by two dominant functional groups which maintained a similar functional structure over space and time, despite the strong dissimilarity in taxonomic structure along environmental gradients. Our findings suggest that taxonomic and functional beta-diversity deserve to be quantified simultaneously since these two facets can show contrasting patterns and the differences can in turn shed light on community assembly rules.

AB Mechanistic understanding of consumer-resource dynamics is critical to predicting the effects of global change on ecosystem structure, function and services. Such understanding is severely limited by mechanistic models inability to reproduce the dynamics of multiple populations interacting in the field. We surpass this limitation here by extending general consumer-resource network theory to the complex dynamics of a specific ecosystem comprised by the seasonal biomass and production patterns in a pelagic food web of a large, well-studied lake. We parameterised our allometric trophic network model of 24 guilds and 107 feeding relationships using the lakes food web structure, initial spring biomasses and body-masses. Adding activity respiration, the detrital loop, minimal abiotic forcing, prey resistance and several empirically observed rates substantially increased the model's fit to the observed seasonal dynamics and the size-abundance distribution. This process illuminates a promising approach towards improving food-web theory and dynamic models of specific habitats.

AB Aim To determine relative effects of habitat type, climate and spatial pattern on species richness and composition of native and alien plant assemblages in central European cities.
   Location Central Europe, Belgium and the Netherlands.
   Methods The diversity of native and alien flora was analysed in 32 cities. In each city, plant species were recorded in seven 1-ha plots that represented seven urban habitat types with specific disturbance regimes. Plants were classified into native species, archaeophytes (introduced before ad 1500) and neophytes (introduced later). Two sets of explanatory variables were obtained for each city: climatic data and all-scale spatial variables generated by analysis of principal coordinates of neighbour matrices. For each group of species, the effect of habitat type, climate and spatial variables on variation in species composition was determined by variation partitioning. Responses of individual plant species to climatic variables were tested using a set of binomial regression models. Effects of climatic variables on the proportion of alien species were determined by linear regression.
   Results In all cities, 562 native plant species, 188 archaeophytes and 386 neophytes were recorded. Proportions of alien species varied among urban habitats. The proportion of native species decreased with increasing range and mean annual temperature, and increased with increasing precipitation. In contrast, proportions of archaeophytes and neophytes increased with mean annual temperature. However, spatial pattern explained a larger proportion of variation in species composition of the urban flora than climate. Archaeophytes were more uniformly distributed across the studied cities than the native species and neophytes. Urban habitats rich in native species also tended to be rich in archaeophytes and neophytes.
   Main conclusions Species richness and composition of central European urban floras are significantly affected by urban habitat types, climate and spatial pattern. Native species, archaeophytes and neophytes differ in their response to these factors.

AB Global declines in shark populations have created uncertainty in the future status of many species and conservation efforts are urgently needed. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are used increasingly as conservation tools around the world, but how they benefit mobile and wide ranging species like sharks remains unclear. To evaluate the degree of protection MPAs may provide for sharks, we used an array of acoustic receivers to examine the movements and spatial use of two tropical coastal species within two MPAs in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia. Juvenile pigeye (Carcharhinus amboinensis) and adult spot-tail (Carcharhinus sorrah) sharks were fitted with acoustic transmitters from 2009 to 2010. Both species displayed long-term use of MPAs, with some individuals detected for longer than 600 days. The mean percentage of time C. amboinensis and C. sorrah spent inside MPAs was 22% and 32%, respectively. MPA use varied seasonally, with C. amboinensis spending a higher percentage of time inside MPAs in summer (mean = 28%) and C. sorrah spending a higher percentage of time inside MPAs in winter (mean = 40%). Although sharks used large areas inside MPAs, most individuals tended to use only half of the available protected space. In addition, all sharks made excursions from MPAs and individuals exited and re-entered at consistent locations along the MPA boundaries. These results demonstrate that MPAs have conservation benefits for shark populations by providing protection across different species and life stages, and tracking studies can be used to help tailor MPA design to maximize effectiveness.

AB On the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, the use of secondary-treated municipal wastewater in irrigation was introduced with the construction of the first wastewater treatment plants in the 1970s. In this study, the chemical properties and biological activity of 21 arable soils, irrigated for more than 20 years with secondary-treated wastewater, were tested in order to assess their quality. Soil quality was evaluated by measuring cation exchange capacity, pH, calcium carbonate equivalent, soil organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, water-soluble organic carbon, soil microbial biomass, soil basal respiration, and the activities of the enzymes dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase and alkaline phosphatase. No negative effects of the irrigation treatment were observed on the measured soil parameters. Indeed, soil water-soluble organic carbon, soil microbial biomass and beta-glucosidase and alkaline phosphatase activities increased under treated wastewater irrigation. Biological activity of soils irrigated with treated wastewater was affected mainly by soil organic matter content. Although the typical crop management of alfalfa, and other forage crops associated with treated wastewater irrigation, may have contributed to the increase of these parameters, the results suggest that irrigation with treated wastewater is a strategy with many benefits to agricultural land management.

AB Theoretical models addressing genome-wide patterns of divergence during speciation are needed to help us understand the evolutionary processes generating empirical patterns. Here, we examine a critical issue concerning speciation-with-gene flow: to what degree does physical linkage (r < 0.5) of new mutations to already diverged genes aid the build-up of genomic islands of differentiation? We used simulation and analytical approaches to partition the probability of establishment for a new divergently selected mutation when the mutation (i) is the first to arise in an undifferentiated genome (the direct effect of selection), (ii) arises unlinked to any selected loci (r = 0.5), but within a genome that has some already diverged genes (the effect of genome-wide reductions in gene flow for facilitating divergence, which we term 'genome hitchhiking'), and (iii) arises in physical linkage to a diverged locus (divergence hitchhiking). We find that the strength of selection acting directly on a new mutation is generally the most important predictor for establishment, with divergence and genomic hitchhiking having smaller effects. We outline the specific conditions under which divergence and genome hitchhiking can aid mutation establishment. The results generate predictions about genome divergence at different points in the speciation process and avenues for further work.

AB The important role of humans in the development of current ecosystems was recognized decades ago; however, the integration of history and ecology in order to inform conservation has been difficult. We identified four issues that hinder historical ecological research and considered possible solutions. First, differences in concepts and methods between the fields of ecology and history are thought to be large. However, most differences stem from miscommunication between ecologists and historians and are less substantial than is usually assumed. Cooperation can be achieved by focusing on the features ecology and history have in common and through understanding and acceptance of differing points of view. Second, historical ecological research is often hampered by differences in spatial and temporal scales between ecology and history. We argue that historical ecological research can only be conducted at extents for which sources in both disciplines have comparable resolutions. Researchers must begin by clearly defining the relevant scales for the given purpose. Third, periods for which quantitative historical sources are not easily accessible (before AD 1800) have been neglected in historical ecological research. Because data from periods before 1800 are as relevant to the current state of ecosystems as more recent data, we suggest that historical ecologists actively seek out data from before 1800 and apply analytic methods commonly used in ecology to these data. Fourth, humans are not usually considered an intrinsic ecological factor in current ecological research. In our view, human societies should be acknowledged as integral parts of ecosystems and societal processes should be recognized as driving forces of ecosystem change.

AB We studied the seasonal and inter-annual variation in carbon, water and energy fluxes over a Mediterranean grassland ecosystem in Portugal, dominated by annual species, using the eddy-covariance technique. The study period, from 2004 to 2008, was characterised by high intra- and inter-annual precipitation variation: the hydrological years 2004-2005 and 2007-2008 had precipitation below average ('dry' years) whereas the other two hydrological years had precipitation above average ('wet' years).
   The variation in energy partitioning into sensible heat (H) and latent heat (lambda E) fluxes was associated with changes in soil water content, coinciding with plant emergence and senescence. The ecosystem was lambda E-dominated in those periods with soil water content above 15%, and became H-dominated when soil water content fell below 15%.
   Annually integrated net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) was highly sensitive to drought, varying from a carbon sink in 'wet' years (e.g., 2005-2006, -190 g C m(-2) y(-1)), to a carbon source in 'dry' years (e.g., 2004-2005, +49 g C m(-2) y(-1)). There was a negative correlation between annually integrated NEE and annual precipitation (r(2) =0.78). However, timing of precipitation influenced NEE, with individual rain events in the dry season resulting in large pulses of ecosystem respiration (R-eco). Low precipitation at the peak of the growing season, as in the spring of 2007, decreased carbon sequestration. The best descriptor for inter-annual variation in NEE was leaf area duration (LAD), which explained 96% of the variance.
   Average radiation-use efficiency (RUE) was 1.59 g MJ(-1) and inherent water-use efficiency (IWUE) was 24.6 g C hPa kg(-1) H2O. RUE and IWUE had similar trends in inter-annual variation, reflecting differences in productivity and timing of precipitation.
   Our study showed that carbon and energy fluxes in this Mediterranean environment depended strongly upon water availability. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB One of the common assumptions in the study of the evolution of parental care is that trade-offs exist between parental investment and other fitness-related traits. In general, this body of work follows the traditional definition that parental investment (in the current offspring) decreases that individual's ability to invest in future reproduction (Trivers 1972). However, examination of the empirical evidence shows that assuming a trade-off between parental and mating effort is not always appropriate. This overemphasis on a trade-off between mating and parental effort has arisen in part because of an oversimplification of female reproductive strategies, a failure to consider interactions between the sexes, and a tendency to consider behaviours as unifunctional, thereby ignoring the more complex relationship between mating and parental effort in many species. Here, we first examine the empirical evidence for trade-offs between mating and parental effort in males and females to ask when trade-offs occur and what pattern they take. By highlighting a number of exemplar species, we then explore how the presence or absence of trade-offs relates to mate choice and sexual selection in both sexes. Finally, we highlight the importance of considering individual variation, which has been particularly overlooked in examinations of female investment, and how preferences in one sex may influence the existence and our interpretation of apparent trade-offs in the other sex.

AB Parks, remnants of natural habitats and other green areas are important for preserving biodiversity in urban areas. Here, we investigate the relative importance of habitat type and connectivity for butterfly species richness in the city of Malmo, Sweden. Further, we compare species richness and composition in the urban habitats with that in the surrounding agricultural landscape using previously published data. Both butterfly species richness and density increased with decreasing connectivity, measured as the proportion of urban green areas within I km, and were higher in ruderal sites than in traditional and semi-natural parks. Species richness was only slightly lower in the urban habitats than in semi-natural grassland remnants in the agricultural landscape surrounding the city and there was only a small difference in (between site) diversity between urban and semi-natural landscapes. This study highlights the importance of "townscape" composition for species richness in urban habitats but also, demonstrates clearly that urban habitats, especially those characterized by an early-successional stage, can be of relatively high conservation value in regions dominated by intensive human land use.

AB Abiotic disturbance plays an important role in determining assemblage structure and maintaining species richness in many ecosystems. Disturbances events are complex, often affecting multiple environmental parameters simultaneously and causing selective removal of biomass. For this reason, observational studies often fail to elucidate the primary mechanism by which disturbance modifies assembly structure. This is particularly true of microbial systems where reduction in biomass or removal of competitive dominants is not visually obvious.
   Fire is a major disturbance in pinaceous forests, which are characterized by ectomycorrhizal fungal root associations. To determine the specific mechanisms through which this disturbance affects ectomycorrhizal communities, we experimentally simulated the effects of fire by growing seedlings in field soil exposed to factorial combinations of soil heating and ash addition. Ectomycorrhizal colonists in each of the treatments were then identified from seedling roots using DNA sequences.
   Both soil heating and ash addition caused changes to the soil chemical environment and altered the fungal assemblages found on seedling roots. The effect on the ectomycorrhizal assembly was most pronounced from soil heating, which caused an overall simplification and increasing dominance by a few taxa with ruderal life-history strategies.
   We also conducted a follow-up experiment to see whether selective mortality of ectomycorrhizal spores might contribute to these patterns. Heat exposure had strong negative effects on all species tested. However, spore heat tolerance was highest for the species that showed the greatest increase in abundance on seedlings grown in heated soils.
   Synthesis. Fire alters below-ground communities through changes in soil chemistry and mortality of resident organisms. Our results show that soil heating and selective mortality are key mechanisms determining post-fire assemblage structure of ectomycorrhizal fungi. These disturbances favour competitively inferior species and may help maintain diversity of ectomycorrhizal assemblages at the landscape scale.

AB Phylogenies of closely related animal species are often inferred using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene sequences. The accuracy of mtDNA gene trees is compromised through hybridization that leads to introgression of mitochondrial genomes. Using DNA sequences from 6 single-copy nuclear genes and 2 regions of the mitochondrial genome, we investigated the temporal and geographic signature of mitochondrial and nuclear introgression in the Etheostoma spectabile darter clade. Phylogenetic analyses of the nuclear genes result in the monophyly of the E. spectabile clade; however, with respect to sampled specimens of 5 species (Etheostoma fragi, Etheostoma uniporum, Etheostoma pulchellum, Etheostoma burri, and E. spectabile), the mitochondrial phylogeny is inconsistent with E. spectabile clade monophyly. Etheostoma uniporum and E. fragi are both fixed for heterospecific mitochondrial genomes. Limited nuclear introgression is restricted to E. uniporum. Our analyses show that the pattern of introgression is consistently asymmetric, with movement of heterospecific mitochondrial haplotypes and nuclear alleles into E. spectabile clade species; introgressive hybridization spans broad temporal scales; and introgression is restricted to species and populations in the Ozarks. The introgressed mitochondrial genome observed in E. fragi has an obscure phylogenetic placement among darters, an ancient age, and is possibly a mitochondrial fossil from an Etheostoma species that has subsequently gone extinct. These results indicate that introgression, both ancient and more contemporaneous, characterizes the history of diversification in the E. spectabile species clade and may be relatively common among clades comprising the species-rich North American freshwater fauna.

AB Divergent selection pressures among populations can result not only in significant differentiation in morphology, physiology and behaviour, but also in how these traits are related to each other, thereby driving the processes of local adaptation and speciation. In the Australian zebra finch, we investigated whether domesticated stock, bred in captivity over tens of generations, differ in their response to a life-history manipulation, compared to birds taken directly from the wild. In a 'common aviary' experiment, we thereto experimentally manipulated the environmental conditions experienced by nestlings early in life by means of a brood size manipulation, and subsequently assessed its short- and long-term consequences on growth, ornamentation, immune function and reproduction. As expected, we found that early environmental conditions had a marked effect on both short- and long-term morphological and life-history traits in all birds. However, although there were pronounced differences between wild and domesticated birds with respect to the absolute expression of many of these traits, which are indicative of the different selection pressures wild and domesticated birds were exposed to in the recent past, manipulated rearing conditions affected morphology and ornamentation of wild and domesticated finches in a very similar way. This suggests that despite significant differentiation between wild and domesticated birds, selection has not altered the relationships among traits. Thus, life-history strategies and investment trade-offs may be relatively stable and not easily altered by selection. This is a reassuring finding in the light of the widespread use of domesticated birds in studies of life-history evolution and sexual selection, and suggests that adaptive explanations may be legitimate when referring to captive bird studies.

AB Mangrove ecosystems are considered vulnerable to climate change as coastal development limits the ecosystem services and adaptations important to their survival. Although they appear rather simple in terms of species diversity, their ecology is complex due to interacting geophysical forces of tides, surface runoff, river and groundwater discharge, waves, and constituents of sediment, nutrients and saltwater. These interactions limit developing a comprehensive framework for science-based sustainable management practices. A suite of models have been developed independently by various academic and government institutions worldwide to understand the dynamics of mangrove ecosystems and to provide ecological forecasting capabilities under different management scenarios and natural disturbance regimes. The models have progressed from statistical tables representing growth and yield to more sophisticated models describing various system components and processes. Among these models are three individual-based models (IBMs) (FORMAN, KIWI, and MANGRO). A comparison of models' designs reveal differences in the details of process description, particularly, regarding neighbor competition among trees. Each model has thus its specific range of applications. Whereas FORMAN and KIWI are most suitable to address mangrove forest dynamics of stands, MANGRO focuses on landscape dynamics on larger spatial scale. A comparison of the models and a comparison of the models with empirical knowledge further reveal the general needs for further field and validation studies to advance our ecological understanding and management of mangrove wetlands.

AB Although plant adaptation to serpentine soils has been studied for several decades, the mechanisms of plant adaptation to edaphic extremes are still poorly understood. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are common root symbionts that can increase the plant hosts' establishment and growth in stressful environments. However, little is known about the role plant-AMF interactions play in plant adaptation to serpentine. As a first step towards understanding this role, we examined the AMF assemblages associated with field populations of serpentine and non-serpentine ecotypes of California native plant Collinsia sparsiflora. We sampled roots of C. sparsiflora from three serpentine and three non-serpentine sites in close proximity (110 m to 1.94 km between sites) and analysed the small subunit ribosomal DNA gene amplified from root DNA extracts using AMF-specific primers. A total of 1952 clones from 24 root samples (four from each site) were sequenced. We used sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis to determine operational taxonomic units (OTU) resulting in 19 OTUs representing taxa from six AMF genera, including one serpentine-specific OTU. We used Bray-Curtis similarity, multidimensional scaling and analysis of similarity to compare root sample AMF assemblages. These analyses clearly showed that plant ecotypes associated with distinct AMF assemblages; an Acaulospora OTU-dominated serpentine, and a Glomus OTU-dominated non-serpentine assemblages. Species diversity and evenness were significantly higher in serpentine assemblages. Finally, RELATE analysis showed a relationship between ecotype AMF assemblages and soil nutrients. This study reveals a strong relationship between AMF associates and plant adaptation to edaphic extremes.

AB Resource partitioning has been suggested as an important mechanism of invasion resistance. The relative importance of resource partitioning for invasion resistance, however, may depend on how species abundance is distributed in the plant community. This study had two objectives. First, we quantified the degree to which one resource, nitrogen (N), is partitioned by time, depth and chemical form among coexisting species from different functional groups by injecting N-15 into soils around the study species three times during the growing season, at two soil depths and as two chemical forms. A watering treatment also was applied to evaluate the impact of soil water content on N partitioning. Second, we examined the degree to which native functional groups contributed to invasion resistance by seeding a non-native annual grass into plots where bunchgrasses, perennial forbs or annual forbs had been removed. Bunchgrasses and forbs differed in timing, depth and chemical form of N capture, and these patterns of N partitioning were not affected by soil water content. However, when we incorporated abundance (biomass) with these relative measures of N capture to determine N sequestration by the community there was no evidence suggesting that functional groups partitioned different soil N pools. Instead, dominant bunchgrasses acquired the most N from all soil N pools. Consistent with these findings we also found that bunchgrasses were the only functional group that inhibited annual grass establishment. At natural levels of species abundance, N partitioning may facilitate coexistence but may not necessarily contribute to N sequestration and invasion resistance by the plant community. This suggests that a general mechanism of invasion resistance may not be expected across systems. Instead, the key mechanism of invasion resistance within a system may depend on trait variation among coexisting species and on how species abundance is distributed in the system.

AB The relationship between outbreak characteristics of the spruce budworm and the combination of climate, forest composition, and spatial location was examined in eastern Canada by the method of constrained ordination. Approximately 54% of the spatial variability in outbreak pattern, as described by a matrix of four outbreak characteristics, was explained by the spatial pattern of the climate (a matrix of six variables), forest composition (a matrix of seven variables), and spatial location (a matrix of two variables). The relationships between outbreak variables and climate variables were highlighted, and future outbreak characteristics of the spruce budworm were projected using simulations of a global circulation model for the period 2081-2100 where CO2 concentrations reach a maximum of approximately 550 ppm. Future outbreaks are predicted to be an average of approximately 6 years longer with an average of 15% greater defoliation. The methodology is described and the potential effects of climate change on landscape-scale outbreaks of the insect are discussed.

AB 1. Roads provide suitable conditions for the establishment and growth of exotic species. Most roads are bordered by drainage ditches forming a network of linear wetlands. Drainage ditches may serve as habitats and corridors facilitating the spread of aquatic invaders into the intersected ecosystems. The common reed Phragmites australis is one of these aquatic invaders frequently found in marshes and drainage ditches along roads. We hypothesized that highways have acted as corridors for the dispersal of the common reed and have contributed to the invasion of North American wetlands by this species.
   2. We mapped the spatial distribution of the common reed along the highway network of the province of Quebec, Canada, where a large-scale invasion of this plant species has been reported since the 1960s. We also identified the genotype of common reed colonies using molecular tools and the main characteristics that favour the presence of the common reed in road ditches.
   3. Approximately 67% of the 1359 1-km highway sections surveyed during summer 2003 in Quebec had at least one common reed colony. End to end, common reed colonies totalled 324 km, i.e. 24% of the 1359 km surveyed.
   4. Common reed colonies located along the highways were largely (99%) dominated by the exotic (Eurasian) genotype (haplotype M).
   5. The common reed was more abundant along highways located in warm regions, with a sum of growing degree-days (> 5 degrees C, 12-month period) >= 1885, along highways built before the 1970s and in agricultural regions dominated by corn and soybean crops. Common reed colonies were larger when located along highways that were wide, built before the 1970s or in warm regions. This was particularly apparent if the roadside was bordered by a wetland. On the other hand, common reed colonies were more likely to be narrow when located near a woodland.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Several disturbances (de-icing salts, ditch digging and agricultural nitrogen input) favour the development of large common reed colonies along roads, some of them expanding out of roadsides, particularly in wetlands. Reducing disturbances, leaving (or planting) a narrow (a few metres) hedge of trees or shrubs along highways or planting salt-resistant shrubs in roadside ditches could be efficient ways to slow the expansion of common reed or to confine the species to roadsides.

AB Global warming leads to shifts in vegetation types in given temperate environments. The fastest species movement is due to the globalized supply and use of exotic plants in gardening and urban landscaping. These standard practices circumvent dispersal limitations and biological and environmental stresses; they have three major global impacts: (i) the enhancement of biological invasions, (ii) the elevation of volatile organic compound emissions and the resulting increase in photochemical smog formation, and (iii) the enhancement Of CO2 fixation and water use by gardened plants. These global effects, none of which are currently considered in global-change scenarios, are increasingly amplified with further warming and urbanization. We urge for quantitative assessment of the global effects of gardening and urban landscaping.

AB Review articles are important sources of information and often the only source of evidence used by decision makers in conservation and environmental management to assess effectiveness and impact of interventions and other actions. Recent developments in the field of medicine and public health have established 'systematic review' guidelines to minimise bias and explicitly document methodology, allowing replication and updating in light of further advances. The aim of this article was to assess the methodological and reporting rigour of reviews from the disciplines of conservation, ecology and environmental management (referred to as "ecological reviews"). This was achieved by comparing them to medical systematic reviews, using 27 detailed criteria well established in medicine. When compared with medical systematic reviews, ecological reviews were more likely to be prone to bias, lacking details in the methods used to search for studies, and were less likely to assess the relevance of studies, quality of the original experiments and to quantitatively synthesise the evidence. overall, ecological reviews show lower quality and greater variation in reporting style and review methods. To address this, reviewers could use a systematic review approach and journals could provide more explicit guidelines for the preparation and production of review articles. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Questions: Do ordination patterns differ when based on vegetation samples recorded in plots of different size? If so, how large is the effect of plot size relative to the effects of data set heterogeneity and of using presence/absence or cover-abundance data? Can we combine plots of different size in a single ordination?
   Methods: Two homogeneous and two heterogeneous data sets were sampled in Czech forests and grasslands. Cover-abundances of plant species were recorded in series of five or six nested quadrats of increasing size (forest 49-961 m(2); grassland 1-49 m(2)). Separate ordinations were computed for plots of each size for each data set, using either species presences/absences or cover-abundances recorded on an ordinal scale. Ordination patterns were compared with Procrustean analysis. Also, ordinations of data sets jointly containing plots of different size were calculated; effects of plot size were evaluated using a Monte Carlo test in constrained ordination.
   Results: The results were consistent between forest and grassland data sets. In homogeneous data sets, the effect of presence/absence vs. cover-abundance was similar to, or larger than, the effect of plot size; for presence/absence data the differences between ordinations of differently sized plots were smaller than for cover-abundance data. In heterogeneous data sets, the effect of plot size was larger than the effect of presence-absence vs. cover-abundance. The plots of smaller size (<= 100 m(2) in forests. <= 4 m(2) in grasslands) yielded the most deviating ordination patterns. Joint ordinations of differently sized plots mostly did not yield patterns that would be artifacts of different plot size, except for plots from the homogeneous data sets that differed in size by a factor of four or higher.
   Conclusions: Variation in plot size does influence ordination patterns. Smaller plots tend to produce less stable ordination patterns, especially in data sets with low beta-diversity and species cover-abundances. Data sets containing samples from plots of different sizes can be used for ordination if they represent vegetation with large beta-diversity. However, if data sets are homogeneous, i.e. with low beta-diversity, the differences in plot sizes should not be very large, in order to avoid the danger of plot size differences distorting the real vegetation differentiation in ordination patterns.

AB We present a first assessment of the potential impacts of anthropogenic climate change on the endemic flora of Namibia, and on its vegetation structure and function, for a projected climate in similar to 2050 and similar to 2080. We used both niche-based models (NBM) to evaluate the sensitivity of 159 endemic species to climate change (of an original 1020 plant species modeled) and a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) to assess the impacts of climate change on vegetation structure and ecosystem functioning.
   Endemic species modeled by NBM are moderately sensitive to projected climate change. Fewer than 5% are predicted to experience complete range loss by 2080, although more than 47% of the species are expected to be vulnerable (range reduction > 30%) by 2080 if they are assumed unable to migrate. Disaggregation of results by life-form showed distinct patterns. Endemic species of perennial herb, geophyte and tree life-formsare predicted to be negatively impacted in Namibia, whereas annual herb and succulent endemic species remain relatively stable by 2050 and 2080. Endemic annual herb species are even predicted to extend their range north-eastward into the tree and shrub savanna with migration, and tolerance of novel substrates. The current protected area network is predicted to meet its mandate by protecting most of the current endemicity in Namibia into the future. Vegetation simulated by DGVM is projected to experience a reduction in cover, net primary productivity and leaf area index throughout much of the country by 2050, with important implications for the faunal component of Namibia's ecosystems, and the agricultural sector. The plant functional type (PFT) composition of the major biomes may be substantially affected by climate change and rising atmospheric CO2- currently widespread deciduous broad leaved trees and C-4 PFTs decline, with the C-4 PFT particularly negatively affected by rising atmospheric CO2 impacts by similar to 2080 and deciduous broad leaved trees more likely directly impacted by drying and warming. The C-3 PFT may increase in prominence in the northwestern quadrant of the country by similar to 2080 as CO2 concentrations increase. These results suggest that substantial changes in species diversity, vegetation structure and ecosystem functioning can be expected in Namibia with anticipated climate change, although endemic plant richness may persist in the topographically diverse central escarpment region.

AB Background: The view that gene flow between related animal species is rare and evolutionarily unimportant largely antedates sensitive molecular techniques. Here we use DNA sequencing to investigate a pair of morphologically and ecologically divergent, non-sibling butterfly species, Heliconius cydno and H. melpomene (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae), whose distributions overlap in Central and Northwestern South America.
   Results: In these taxa, we sequenced 30-45 haplotypes per locus of a mitochondrial region containing the genes for cytochrome oxidase subunits I and II (CoI/CoII), and intron-spanning fragments of three unlinked nuclear loci: triose-phosphate isomerase (Tpi), mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (Mpi) and cubitus interruptus (Ci) genes. A fifth gene, dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) produced sequence data likely to be from different duplicate loci in some of the taxa, and so was excluded. Mitochondrial and Tpi genealogies are consistent with reciprocal monophyly, whereas sympatric populations of the species in Panama share identical or similar Mpi and Ci haplotypes, giving rise to genealogical polyphyly at the species level despite evidence for rapid sequence divergence at these genes between geographic races of H. melpomene.
   Conclusion: Recent transfer of Mpi haplotypes between species is strongly supported, but there is no evidence for introgression at the other three loci. Our results demonstrate that the boundaries between animal species can remain selectively porous to gene flow long after speciation, and that introgression, even between non-sibling species, can be an important factor in animal evolution. Interspecific gene flow is demonstrated here for the first time in Heliconius and may provide a route for the transfer of switch-gene adaptations for Mullerian mimicry. The results also forcefully demonstrate how reliance on a single locus may give an erroneous picture of the overall genealogical history of speciation and gene flow.

AB This paper describes the creation of a cDNA microarray for annual sunflowers and its use to elucidate patterns of gene expression in Helianthus annuus, Helianthus petiolaris, and the homoploid hybrid species Helianthus deserticola. The array comprises 3743 ESTs (expressed sequence tags) representing approximately 2897 unique genes. It has an average clone/EST identity rate of 91%, is applicable across species boundaries within the annual sunflowers, and shows patterns of gene expression that are highly reproducible according to real-time RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) results. Overall, 12.8% of genes on the array showed statistically significant differential expression across the three species. Helianthus deserticola displayed transgressive, or extreme, expression for 58 genes, with roughly equal numbers exhibiting up- or down-regulation relative to both parental species. Transport-related proteins were strongly over-represented among the transgressively expressed genes, which makes functional sense given the extreme desert floor habitat of H. deserticola. The potential adaptive value of differential gene expression was evaluated for five genes in two populations of early generation (BC2) hybrids between the parental species grown in the H. deserticola habitat. One gene (a G protein-coupled receptor) had a significant association with fitness and maps close to a QTL controlling traits that may be adaptive in the desert habitat.

AB How rapidly newly assimilated carbon (C) is invested into recalcitrant structures of forests, and how closely C pools and fluxes are tied to photosynthesis, is largely unknown.
   A crane and a purpose-built free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) system permitted us to label the canopy of a mature deciduous forest with C-13-depleted CO2 for 4 yr and continuously trace the flow of recent C through the forest without disturbance. Potted C-4 grasses in the canopy ('isometers') served as a reference for the C-isotope input signal.
   After four growing seasons, leaves were completely labelled, while newly formed wood (tree rings) still contained 9% old C. Distinct labels were found in fine roots (38%) and sporocarps of mycorrhizal fungi (62%). Soil particles attached to fine roots contained 9% new C, whereas no measurable signal was detected in bulk soil. Soil-air CO2 consisted of 35% new C, indicating that considerable amounts of assimilates were rapidly returned back to the atmosphere.
   These data illustrate a relatively slow dilution of old mobile C pools in trees, but a pronounced allocation of very recent assimilates to C pools of short residence times.

AB Using data collected in the Arabian Sea and on the Nova Scotian Shelf we examined the relationships between temperature, phytoplankton taxonomic composition (indexed by pigment composition) and the size structure (indexed by chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficient at 676 nm), Chlorophyll-a biomass and the light-saturated photosynthesis parameter p(m)(B). Our results show that changes in phytoplankton community structure for the Scotian Shelf closely follow changes in temperature. In the Arabian Sea the relationship between phytoplankton community structure and temperature was less striking and fluctuations in phytoplankton pigment composition were strongly related to Chlorophyll-a biomass. The light-saturated photosynthesis parameter p(m)(B) was correlated with temperature for the Scotian Shelf. When we compared data collected on the Scotian Shelf with the temperature-dependent function of Eppley (1972. Fishery Bulletin 70, 1063-1085), the model fitted the data remarkably well. For the Arabian Sea data, however, only a weak temperature dependence in p(m)(B) was observed, which may be a result of a strong negative correlation between ambient nitrate concentration and temperature. Our results also show that for both the Scotian Shelf and the Arabian Sea, diatom-dominated waters had similarly low p(m)(B) values even though the temperatures of the two systems were markedly different. The absorptive characteristics of phytoplankton on the Scotian Shelf were well correlated with p(m)(B), thus providing another potential predictor of p(m)(B) that may, in the future, be routinely accessible by remote sensing. The contrasting relationships among community structure, temperature, and primary production observed in the two study regions suggest that primary production algorithms incorporating such information could be developed and applied on a domain-specific basis. These algorithms should be centred on knowledge of the relationships between physical forcing, community structure and phytoplankton photophysiology. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Questions: This paper examines the long-term change in the herbaceous layer of semi-arid vegetation since grazing ceased. We asked whether (1) there were differences in the temporal trends of abundance among growth forms of plants; (2) season of rainfall affected the growth form response; (3) the presence of an invasive species influenced the abundance and species richness of native plants relative to non-invaded plots. and (4) abundance of native plants and/or species richness was related to the time it took for an invasive species to invade a plot.
   Location: Alice Springs. Central Australia.
   Methods: Long-term changes in the semi-arid vegetation of Central Australia were measured over 28 years (1976-2004) to partition the effects of rainfall and ail invasive perennial grass. The relative abundance (biomass) of all species was assessed 25 times in each of 24 plots (8 m x 1 m) across two sites that traversed floodplains and adjacent foot slopes. Photo-points. starting in 1972, were also used to provide a broader overview of a landscape that had been intensively grazed by cattle and rabbits prior to the 1970s. Species' abundance data were amalgamated into growth forms to examine their relationship with environmental variation in space and time. Environmental variables included season and amount of rainfall, fire history, soil variability and the colonization of the plots by the exotic perennial grass Cenchrus ciliaris (Buffel grass).
   Results: Constrained ordination showed that season of rainfall and landscape variables relating to soil depth strongly influenced vegetation composition when Cenchrus was used as a covariate. When Cenchrus was included in constrained ordination, it was strongly related to the decline of all native growth forms over time. Univariate comparisons of non-invaded vs impacted plots over time revealed unequivocal evidence that Cenchrus had caused the decline of all native growth form groups and species richness. They also revealed a contrasting response of native plants to season of rainfall, with a strong response of native grasses to summer rainfall and forbs to winter rainfall. In the presence of Cenchrus these responses were strongly attenuated.
   Discussion: Pronounced changes in the composition of vegetation were interpreted as a response to removal of grazing pressure, fluctuations in rainfall and, most importantly, invasion of an exotic grass. Declines in herbaceous species abundance and richness in the presence of Cenchrus appear to be directly related to competition for resources. Indirect effects may also be causing the declines of some woody species from changed fire regimes as a result of increased fuel loads. We predict that Cenchrus will begin to alter landscape level processes as a result of the direct and indirect effects of Cenchrus on the demography of native plants when there is a switch from resource limited (rainfall) establishment of native plants to seed limited recruitment.

AB Defensive mechanisms, including noxious or toxic substances, are favored by predation-driven natural selection. The acquisition of noxious/toxic substances can be either endogenous, in which the substances are produced by the organism, or exogenous, in which the substances are produced by another organism and are sequestered. Evidence indicates that the defensive skin alkaloids of Neotropical poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) have an exogenous source: a diet of ants and other small alkaloid-containing arthropods, which we term the diet-toxicity hypothesis. A critical prediction of the diet-toxicity hypothesis is that independent origins of dietary specialization will be found to be correlated with independent origins of skin alkaloids. We tested this prediction in an integrated framework using comparative methods with new and published data on feeding ecology and chemical defense for 15 species of dendrobatids in five genera. We found a significant correlation between alkaloid profiles and degree of dietary specialization. This reveals a recurring association of dietary specialization and alkaloid sequestration in dendrobatids, which suggests parallel evolutionary trends in the origins of defensive mechanisms.

   INVERTEBRATE RESPONSES
AB Ecological risks associated with the release of transgenic crops include nontarget effects of the crop and the escape of transgenes into wild populations. Nontarget effects can be of two sorts: (a) unintended negative effects on species that do not reduce yield and (b) greater persistence of the crop in feral populations. Conventional agricultural methods, such as herbicide and pesticide application, have large and well-documented nontarget effects. To the extent that transgenes have more specific target effects, transgenic crops may have fewer nontarget effects. The escape of transgenes into wild populations, via hybridization and introgression, could lead to increased weediness or to the invasion of new habitats by the wild population. In addition, native species with which the wild plant interacts (including herbivores, pathogens, and other plant species in the community) could be negatively affected by "transgenic-wild" plants. Conventional crop alleles have facilitated the evolution of increased weediness in several wild populations. Thus, some transgenes that allow plants to tolerate biotic and abiotic stress (e.g., insect resistance, drought tolerance) could have similar effects.

AB Greater prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus) were once found throughout the tallgrass prairie of midwestern North America but over the last century these prairies have been lost or fragmented by human land use. As a consequence, many current populations of prairie-chickens have become isolated and small. This fragmentation of populations is expected to lead to reductions in genetic variation as a result of random genetic drift and a decrease in gene flow. As expected, we found that genetic variation at both microsatellite DNA and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers was reduced in smaller populations, particularly in Wisconsin. There was relatively little range-wide geographical structure (F-ST) when we examined mtDNA haplotypes but there was a significant positive relationship between genetic (F-ST) and geographical distance (isolation by distance). In contrast, microsatellite DNA loci revealed significant geographical structure (F-ST) and a weak effect of isolation by distance throughout the range. These patterns were much stronger when populations with reduced levels of genetic variability (Wisconsin) were removed from the analyses. This suggests that the effects of genetic drift were stronger than gene flow at microsatellite loci, whereas these forces were in range-wide equilibrium at mtDNA markers. These differences between the two molecular markers may be explained by a larger effective population size (N-e) for mtDNA, which is expected in species such as prairie-chickens that have female-biased dispersal and high levels of polygyny. Our results suggest that historic populations of prairie-chickens were once interconnected by gene flow but current populations are now isolated. Thus, maintaining gene flow may be important for the long-term persistence of prairie-chicken populations.

AB Female ornamentation has long been overlooked because of the greater prevalence of elaborate displays in males. However, the circumstances under which females would benefit from honestly signalling their quality are limited. Females are not expected to invest in ornamentation unless the fitness benefits of the ornament exceed those derived from investing the resources directly into offspring. It has been proposed that when females gain direct benefits from mating, females may instead be selected for ornamentation that deceives males about their reproductive state. In the empidid dance flies, males frequently provide nuptial gifts and it is usually only the female that is ornamented. Female traits in empidids, such as abdominal sacs and enlarged pinnate leg scales, have been proposed to 'deceive' males into matings by disguising egg maturity. We quantified sexual selection in the dance fly Rhamphomyia tarsata and found escalating, quadratic selection on pinnate scales and that pinnate scales honestly reflect female fecundity. Mated females had a larger total number and more mature eggs than unmated females, highlighting a potential benefit rather than a cost of male mate choice. We also show correlational selection on female pinnate scales and fecundity. Correlational selection, equivalent investment patterns or increased nutrition from nuptial gifts may all maintain honesty in female ornamentation.

AB The evolution of sexual dimorphism may occur when natural and sexual selection result in different optimum trait values for males and females. Perhaps the most prominent examples of sexual dimorphism occur in sexually selected traits, for which males usually display exaggerated trait levels, while females may show reduced expression of the trait. In some species, females also exhibit secondary sexual traits that may either be a consequence of a correlated response to sexual selection on males or direct sexual selection for female secondary sexual traits. In this experiment, we simultaneously measure the intersex genetic correlations and the relative strength of sexual selection on males and females for a set of cuticular hydrocarbons in Drosophila serrata. There was significant directional sexual selection on both male and female cuticular hydrocarbons: the strength of sexual selection did not differ among the sexes but males and females preferred different cuticular hydrocarbons. In contrast with many previous studies of sexual dimorphism, intersex genetic correlations were low. The evolution of sexual dimorphism in D. serrata appears to have been achieved by sex-limited expression of traits controlled by genes on the X chromosome and is likely to be in its final stages.

AB Interest in relationships between behaviour and development has been spurred by research on related topics, including phenotypic plasticity, parental effects, extragenetic inheritance, individual differences and trait syndromes. Here, I consider several emerging areas of research in the interface between behaviour and development, with a focus on behavioural processes that are likely to affect the development and maintenance of interindividual variation in a wide array of morphological, physiological and behavioural traits. Using a norm of reaction approach, I introduce and illustrate the complexities of phenotypic development. Next, I consider the implications of environmental selection and niche construction for phenotypic development, and consider why these behavioural processes are likely to encourage the development and maintenance of repeatable, stable individual differences and trait syndromes. Parental effects involving behaviour also affect the development of a wide array of phenotypic traits; differential allocation is a currently underappreciated type of parental effect, by which males can affect the development of their offspring via nongenetic means, even if those males have no contact with their young. Behavioural parental effects also contribute to extragenetic inheritance, and recent studies suggest that this phenomenon may be more widespread than previously suspected. The effects of behavioural processes on phenotypic development have interesting implications for problems in related disciplines (e.g. ecology, evolution and conservation biology), providing additional impetus for future research on the effects of behavioural mechanisms on the development of behavioural and other traits.

AB Plant species richness influences primary productivity via mechanisms that (1) favour species with particular traits (selection effect) and (2) promote niche differentiation between species (complementarity). Influences of species evenness, plant density and other properties of plant communities on productivity are poorly defined, but may depend on whether selection or complementarity prevails in species mixtures. We predicted that selection effects are insensitive to species evenness but increase with plant density, and that the converse is true for complementarity. To test predictions, we grew three species of annuals in monocultures and in three-species mixtures in which evenness of established plants was varied at each of three plant densities in a cultivated field in Texas, USA. Above-ground biomass was smaller in mixtures than expected from monocultures because of negative 'complementarity' and a negative selection effect. Neither selection nor complementarity varied with species evenness, but selection effects increased at the greatest plant density as predicted.

AB The study of the relative roles of local and regional processes in determining the scaling of species diversity is a very active field in current ecology. The importance of species turnover and the species-range-size frequency distributions in determining how local and regional species diversity are linked has been recognised by recent approaches. Here we present a model, based on a system of fully nested sampling quadrats, to analyse species diversity at several scales. Using a recursive procedure that incorporates increasingly smaller scales and a multiplicative formula for relating local and regional diversity, the model allows the simultaneous depiction of alpha, beta and gamma diversity in a single "species-scale plot". Species diversity is defined as the number of ranges that are intersected by sampling quadrats of various sizes. The size, shape and location of individual species ranges determine diversity at any scale, but the average point diversity, measured at hypothetical zero-area localities, is determined solely by the size of individual ranges, regardless of their shape and location. The model predicts that if the species-area relationship is a power function, then beta diversity must be scale invariant if measured at constant scale increments. Applying the model to the mammal fauna of four Mexican regions with contrasting environmental conditions, we found that: 1) the species-range-size frequency distribution at the scale of the Mexican regions differs from the log-normal pattern reported for the national and continental scales. 2) Beta diversity is not scale-invariant within each region, implying that the species-area relationship (SAR) does not follow a power function. 3) There is geographic variation in beta diversity. 4) The scaling of diversity is directly linked to patterns of species turnover rate, and ultimately determined by patterns in the geographic distribution of species. The model shows that regional species diversity and the average distribution range of species are the two basic data necessary to predict patterns in the scaling of species diversity.

AB Entomologists have expressed concern that prescribed burning is incompatible with the conservation of insect species richness on small prairie sites. To address this issue, I examined the response and recovery of insect populations after fire within small, isolated tallgrass prairie remnants in northern Illinois, northwestern Indiana, and southeastern Wisconsin. I conducted this research over seven seasons, focused on responses at the species level, distinguished between remnant-dependent and remnant-independent species, and included multiple fire events and sites. I used sweep nets, light traps, sticky traps, and visual searches to gauge population responses and to track negatively affected populations to recovery. Most species (93%) responded consistently to prescribed fires. Postfire responses ranged from positive (26%) to negative (40%) for 151 species representing 33 families and seven orders. Three attributes-remnant-dependence, upland inhabitance, and nonvagility-were significant predictors of negative postfire response. Among negatively affected populations, 68% recovered within 1 year; all 163 populations tracked to recovery did so in 2 years or less. My results support the judicious use of rotational cool-season burning within small, isolated grassland sites.

AB We studied regional variation in growth-limiting factors and responses to climatic variability in subalpine forests by analyzing growth patterns for 28 tree-ring growth chronologies from subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) stands in the Cascade and Olympic Mountains (Washington and Oregon, U.S.A.). Factor analysis identified four distinct time series of common growth patterns; the dominant growth pattern at any site varied with annual precipitation and temperature (elevation). Throughout much of the region, growth is negatively correlated with winter precipitation and spring snowpack depth, indicating that growth is limited primarily by short growing seasons. On the driest and warmest sites, growth is negatively correlated with previous summer temperature, suggesting that low summer soil moisture limits growth. Growth patterns in two regions were sensitive to climatic variability associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, apparently responding to low-frequency variation in spring snowpack and summer soil moisture (one negatively, one positively). This regional-scale analysis shows that subalpine fir growth in the Cascades and Olympics is limited by different climatic factors in different subregional climates. Climate-growth relationships are similar to those for a co-occurring species, mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana (Bong.) Carriere), suggesting broad biogeographic patterns of response to climatic variability and change by subalpine forest ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest.

AB Two pressing questions for forestry and conservation biology are whether periodic logging in forest ecosystems significantly changes biodiversity and whether the changes can be mitigated through appropriate harvest methods. Such questions of timber resource management, however, are rarely applied to nonpest insect species, particularly in temperate forest systems. We studied the effects of timber harvest on species richness, abundance, and community composition of forest Lepidoptera (moths). Moths were sampled in 16 forest stands occurring in two watersheds (managed and wilderness) in southeastern Ohio during summer 2000. Stands were chosen from one of four management categories: clear-cut, selectively logged, unlogged, and wilderness. Specifically, we tested the following predictions: (1) shifts in moth community composition would be affected by postharvest changes in stand structure and floristic composition, (2) variation in species richness would be determined by the magnitude of the logging disturbance, and (3) unlogged stands within managed landscapes would contain different species assemblages compared to wilderness stands.
   Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed significant compositional differences among moth communities sampled from forest stands differing in harvest regime. Variation among moth communities was mainly attributable to postharvest changes in stand floristic composition rather than stand structure. Postdisturbance shifts in moth community composition were related to the magnitude of displacement of a given forest stand to earlier successional stages. We also found that both species richness of the overall moth community and several feeding guilds were significantly lower in clear-cut stands, but species richness did not differ between selectively logged and unlogged stands. Thus, selective logging appears to be a better strategy for timber harvest when concern is for maintaining species richness of Lepidoptera within stands. Finally, although no differences were detected in overall species richness or abundance of moths sampled from stands in managed or wilderness watersheds, the CCA suggested that the surrounding landscape influenced the variation in community composition within and among forest stands. Therefore, we suggest that the long-term maintenance of lepidopteran species diversity and community composition within temperate deciduous forests managed for timber tray ultimately depend on successful regeneration of harvested stands to precut floristic composition as well as the preservation of larger areas of unlogged forests.

AB Acclimation to periodic high-light stress was studied in tree seedlings from a neotropical forest. Seedlings of several pioneer and late-succession species were cultivated under simulated tree-fall gap conditions; they were placed under frames covered with shade cloth with apertures of different widths that permitted defined periods of daily leaf exposure to direct sunlight. During direct sun exposure, all plants exhibited a marked reversible decline in potential photosystem II (PSII) efficiency, determined by means of the ratio of variable to maximum Chl a fluorescence (F-v/F-m). The decline in F-v/F-m under full sunlight was much stronger in late-succession than in pioneer species. For each gap size, all species exhibited a similar degree of de-epoxidation of violaxanthin in direct sunlight and similar pool sizes of xanthophyll cycle pigments. Pool sizes increased with increasing gap size. Pioneer plants possessed high levels of beta -carotene that also increased with gap size, whereas alpha -carotene decreased. In contrast to late-succession plants, pioneer plants were capable of adjusting their Chl a/b ratio to a high value in wide gaps. The content of extractable UV-B-absorbing compounds was highest in the plants acclimated to large gaps and did not depend on the successional status of the plants. The results demonstrate a better performance of pioneer species under high-light conditions as compared with late-succession plants, manifested by reduced photoinhibition of PSII in pioneer species. This was not related to increased pool size and turnover of xanthophyll cycle pigments, nor to higher contents of UV-B-absorbing substances. High beta -carotene levels and increased Chl a/b ratios, i.e. reduced size of the Chl a and b binding antennae, may contribute to photoprotection in pioneer species.

AB Commercial plantations in South Africa have been established mainly in grasslands adjacent to native forest which occur as small, scattered patches, restricted to valleys and scarps by regular fires in the adjacent fire-prone grasslands. Understorey vegetation was sampled in plantation stands of different age of Pinus patula, and old stands of P. elliottii, P. taeda and Eucalyptus saligna, growing on the forest margin. The study was done in two areas in Northern Province, South Africa (23 degrees S to 25 degrees S, and 30 degrees E to 31 degrees E): Woodbush-De Hoek along the Eastern Escarpment, and Entabeni on Soutpansberg mountains. The area receives 1200 to 1900 mm rain per annum, mainly during summer. Two hypotheses were tested: understorey colonisation by native plant species is strongly influenced by the overhead plantation species; and abundance and diversity of indigenous woody and herbaceous species increase with increasing stand age. A total of 170 species were recorded on 62 plots of 78.5 m(2) each, and included all major growth forms present in the surrounding forest, except epiphytes. Trees were represented by 62 species, but only 18% of these occurred in more than 10% of the plots. Seventy-two percent of the 95 tree, shrub and climber species are animal-dispersed but only 22% of the animal-dispersed species occur in more than 10% of the plots. Mean clean bole length of the plantation stand gave the best regression coefficients with species richness, stem density, mean DBH and mean height of the woody regeneration, all of which increased with stand age. There was no clear pattern in understorey species composition among the different plantation species. Site factors such as substrate (geology) and temperature (altitude and radiation index) had a strong correlation with species composition and density of understorey vegetation. The results do demonstrate a useful successional process which could be used to achieve specific management objectives at relatively low costs. Potential applications of this succession process are manipulation of tree stands (commercial plantations or invader plants) to restore native forest biodiversity, control of understorey weeds in commercial plantations, and growing of useful crops under tree canopies.

AB We have investigated the theoretical consequences of character evolution for the population dynamics of a host-parasitoid interaction, assuming a monophagous parasitoid. In the purely ecological model it is assumed that hosts can escape parasitism by being in absolute refuges. A striking property of this model is a threshold effect in control of the host by the parasitoid, when host density dependence is weak. The approximate criteria for the parasitoid to regulate the host to low densities are (1) that the parasitoid's maximum population growth rate should exceed the host's and (2) that the maximum growth rate of the host in the refuge should be less than unity. We then use this ecological framework as a basis for a model which considers evolutionary changes in quantitative characters influencing the size of the absolute refuge. For each species, an increase in its refuge-determining character comes at a cost to maximum population growth rate. We show that refuge evolution can substantially alter the population dynamics of the purely ecological model, resulting in a number of emergent and sometimes counter-intuitive properties. In general, when the host has a high carrying capacity, systems are polarized either with low or minor refuge and 'top-down' control of the host by the parasitoid or with a refuge and 'bottom-up' control of the host by a combination of its own density dependence and the parasitoid. A particularly tantalizing result is that co-evolutionary dynamics can modify ecologically unstable systems into ones which are either stable or quasi-stable (with bouts of unstable dynamics, punctuating long-term periods of quasi-stable behaviour). We present five quantitative criteria which must all be met for the parasitoid to be the agent responsible for control of the host at a co-evolutionary equilibrium. The apparent stringency of this full set of requirements supports the empirically-based suggestion that monophagous parasitoid-driven systems should be less common in nature than those driven by multiple forms of density dependence. Further, we apply our theory to the question of whether exploiters may 'harvest' their victims at maximum sustainable yields and to the evolutionary stability of biological control. Finally, we present a series of testable predictions of our theory and methods useful for testing them.

AB Measurements of net ecosystem CO2 exchange by eddy correlation, incident photosynthetically active photon flux density (PPFD), soil temperature, air temperature, and air humidity were made in a black spruce (Picea mariana) boreal woodland near Schefferville, Quebec, Canada, from June through August 1990. Nighttime respiration was between 0.5 and 1.5 kg C ha(-1) h(-1), increasing with temperature. Net uptake of carbon during the day peaked at 3 kg C ha(-1) h(-1), and the daily net uptake over the experiment was 12 kg C ha(-1) day(-1). Photosynthesis dropped substantially at leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit (VPD) greater than 7 mb, presumably as a result of stomatal closure. The response of ecosystem photosynthesis to incident PPFD was markedly non-linear, with an abrupt saturation at 600 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). This sharp saturation reflected the geometry of the spruce canopy (isolated conical crowns), the frequently overcast conditions, and an increase in VPD coincident with high radiation. The ecosystem light-use efficiency increased markedly during overcast periods as a result of a more even distribution of light across the forest surface. A mechanistic model of forest photosynthesis, parameterized with observations of leaf density and nitrogen content from a nearby stand, provided accurate predictions of forest photosynthesis. The observations and model results indicated that ecosystem carbon balance at the site is highly sensitive to temperature, and relatively insensitive to cloudiness.
