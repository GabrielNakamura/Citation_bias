AB We identified, enumerated, and interpreted the diatom assemblages preserved in the surface sediments of 59 lakes located between Whitehorse in the Yukon and Tuktoyaktuk in the Northwest Territories (Canada). The lakes are distributed along a latitudinal gradient that includes several ecoclimatic zones. It also spans large gradients in limnological variables. Thus, the study lakes are ideal for environmental calibration of modern diatom assemblages. Canonical correspondence analysis, with forward selection and Monte Carlo permutation tests, showed that maximum lake depth and summer surface-water temperature were the two environmental variables that accounted for most of the variance in the diatom data. The concentrations of sodium and calcium were also important explanatory variables. Using weighted-averaging regression and calibration techniques, we developed a predictive statistical model to infer lake surface-water temperature, and we evaluated the feasibility of using diatoms as paleoclimate proxies. This model may be used to derive paleotemperature inferences from fossil diatom assemblages at appropriate sites in the western Canadian Arctic.

AB Background: Wild bees are important pollinators that have declined in diversity and abundance during the last decades. Habitat destruction and fragmentation associated with urbanization are reported as part of the main causes of this decline. Urbanization involves dramatic changes of the landscape, increasing the proportion of impervious surface while decreasing that of green areas. Few studies have investigated the effects of urbanization on bee communities. We assessed changes in the abundance, species richness, and composition of wild bee community along an urbanization gradient.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Over two years and on a monthly basis, bees were sampled with colored pan traps and insect nets at 24 sites located along an urbanization gradient. Landscape structure within three different radii was measured at each study site. We captured 291 wild bee species. The abundance of wild bees was negatively correlated with the proportion of impervious surface, while species richness reached a maximum at an intermediate (50%) proportion of impervious surface. The structure of the community changed along the urbanization gradient with more parasitic species in sites with an intermediate proportion of impervious surface. There were also greater numbers of cavity-nesting species and long-tongued species in sites with intermediate or higher proportion of impervious surface. However, urbanization had no effect on the occurrence of species depending on their social behavior or body size.
   Conclusions/Significance: We found nearly a third of the wild bee fauna known from France in our study sites. Indeed, urban areas supported a diverse bee community, but sites with an intermediate level of urbanization were the most speciose ones, including greater proportion of parasitic species. The presence of a diverse array of bee species even in the most urbanized area makes these pollinators worthy of being a flagship group to raise the awareness of urban citizens about biodiversity.

AB During the latter half of the last century, evidence of reproductive competition between males and male selection by females led to the development of a stereotypical view of sex differences that characterized males as competitive and aggressive, and females as passive and choosy, which is currently being revised. Here, we compare social competition and its consequences for selection in males and females and argue that similar selection processes operate in both sexes and that contrasts between the sexes are quantitative rather than qualitative. We suggest that classifications of selection based on distinction between the form of competition or the components of fitness that are involved introduce unnecessary complexities and that the most useful approach in understanding the evolution and distribution of differences and similarities between the sexes is to compare the operation of selection in males and females in different reproductive systems.

AB There is little consensus about how natural (e.g. productivity, disturbance) and anthropogenic (e.g. invasive species, habitat destruction) ecological drivers influence biodiversity. Here, we show that when sampling is standardised by area (species density) or individuals (rarefied species richness), the measured effect sizes depend critically on the spatial grain and extent of sampling, as well as the size of the species pool. This compromises comparisons of effects sizes within studies using standard statistics, as well as among studies using meta-analysis. To derive an unambiguous effect size, we advocate that comparisons need to be made on a scale-independent metric, such as Hurlbert's Probability of Interspecific Encounter. Analyses of this metric can be used to disentangle the relative influence of changes in the absolute and relative abundances of individuals, as well as their intraspecific aggregations, in driving differences in biodiversity among communities. This and related approaches are necessary to achieve generality in understanding how biodiversity responds to ecological drivers and will necessitate a change in the way many ecologists collect and analyse their data.

AB P>Stability in ecosystem function is an important but poorly understood phenomenon. Anthropogenic perturbations alter communities, but how they change stability and the strength of stabilizing mechanisms is not clear. We examined temporal stability (invariability) in aboveground productivity in replicated 18-year time series of experimentally perturbed grassland plant communities. We found that disturbed annual-dominated communities were more stable than undisturbed perennial communities, coincident with increases in the stabilizing effect of mean-variance scaling. We also found that nitrogen-fertilized communities maintained stability despite losses in species richness, probably because of increased compensatory dynamics and increased dominance by particularly stable dominant species. Among our communities, slight variation in diversity was not the strongest mechanism driving differences in stability. Instead, our study suggests that decreases in individual species variabilities and increases in the relative abundance of stable dominant species may help maintain stability in the functioning of ecosystems confronted with eutrophication, disturbance, and other global changes.

AB P>Second-generation Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) have recently been developed that explicitly represent the ecological dynamics of disturbance, vertical competition for light, and succession. Here, we introduce a modified second-generation DGVM and examine how the representation of demographic processes operating at two-dimensional spatial scales not represented by these models can influence predicted community structure, and responses of ecosystems to climate change.
   The key demographic processes we investigated were seed advection, seed mixing, sapling survival, competitive exclusion and plant mortality. We varied these parameters in the context of a simulated Amazon rainforest ecosystem containing seven plant functional types (PFTs) that varied along a trade-off surface between growth and the risk of starvation induced mortality.
   Varying the five unconstrained parameters generated community structures ranging from monocultures to equal co-dominance of the seven PFTs. When exposed to a climate change scenario, the competing impacts of CO2 fertilization and increasing plant mortality caused ecosystem biomass to diverge substantially between simulations, with mid-21st century biomass predictions ranging from 1.5 to 27.0 kg C m-2.
   Filtering the results using contemporary observation ranges of biomass, leaf area index (LAI), gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP) did not substantially constrain the potential outcomes. We conclude that demographic processes represent a large source of uncertainty in DGVM predictions.

AB Differences in predation intensity experienced by organisms can lead to divergent natural selection, driving evolutionary change. Western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) exhibit larger caudal regions and higher burst-swimming capabilities when coexisting with higher densities of predatory fish. It is hypothesized that a trade-off between steady (constant-speed cruising; important for acquiring resources) and unsteady (rapid bursts and turns; important for escaping predators) locomotion, combined with divergent selection on locomotor performance (favouring steady swimming in high-competition scenarios of low-predation environments, but unsteady swimming in high-predation localities) has caused such phenotypic divergence. Here, I found that morphological differences had a strong genetic basis, and low-predation fish required less hydromechanical power during steady swimming, leading to increased endurance. I further found individual-level support for cause-and-effect relationships between morphology, swimming kinematics and endurance. Results indicate that mosquitofish populations inhabiting low-predation environments have evolved increased steady-swimming abilities via stiffer bodies, larger anterior body/head regions, smaller caudal regions and greater three-dimensional streamlining.

AB Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) is a broadly distributed European conifer tree whose history has been intensively studied by means of fossil records to infer the location of full-glacial refugia and the main routes of postglacial colonization. Here we use recently compiled fossil pollen data as a template to examine how past demographic events have influenced the species' modern genetic diversity. Variation was assessed in the mitochondrial nad1 gene containing two minisatellite regions. Among the 369 populations (4876 trees) assayed, 28 mitochondrial variants were identified. The patterns of population subdivision superimposed on interpolated fossil pollen distributions indicate that survival in separate refugia and postglacial colonization has led to significant structuring of genetic variation in the southern range of the species. The populations in the northern range, on the other hand, showed a shallow genetic structure consistent with the fossil pollen data, suggesting that the vast northern range was colonized from a single refugium. Although the genetic diversity decreased away from the putative refugia, there were large differences between different colonization routes. In the Alps, the diversity decreased over short distances, probably as a result of population bottlenecks caused by the presence of competing tree species. In northern Europe, the diversity was maintained across large areas, corroborating fossil pollen data in suggesting that colonization took place at high population densities. The genetic diversity increased north of the Carpathians, probably as a result of admixture of expanding populations from two separate refugia.

AB Different components of biodiversity may vary independently of each other along environmental gradients giving insights into the mechanisms that regulate species coexistence. In particular, the functional diversity (FD) or the presence of rare or endemic species in natural assemblages do not necessarily increase with species diversity. We studied if different components of plant species diversity (species richness, Simpson diversity, evenness) varied similarly to FD (measured as a generalization of the Simpson index) and rarity along grazing intensity and climatic gradients. Plots under different sheep grazing regimes (high and low intensity, abandonment) were surveyed in five locations along a climatic gradient in north-eastern Spain, from semi-arid lowland to moist upland locations. Variation in species diversity, functional diversity and rarity followed different patterns. Species diversity was lowest in water-stressed environments (arid locations and southern aspects) and increased with grazing more makedly in humid locations. The FD was comparable between the most species-poor and species-rich locations and decreased with grazing in the moistest location, i.e. where species diversity markedly increased. The FD did not show a strong correlation with species richness nor with the Simpson index and less specious communities could show the highest functional diversity. The rarest species in the region were more frequently found in the abandoned areas, which held the lowest species diversity. Consequently, the mechanisms that enhance the diversity of species do not necessarily support a functional differentiation among those species or the maintenance of rare species in a region. We hypothesize that the degree of dependence of functional diversity on species diversity might be mostly related to the amplitude of the species' traits pool and on how species partition the niche space available.

AB The DNA of prey present in animal scats may provide a valuable source of information for dietary studies. We conducted a captive feeding trial to test whether prey DNA could be reliably detected in scat samples from Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus). Two sea lions were fed a diet of fish (five species) and squid (one species), and DNA was extracted from the soft component of collected scats. Most of the DNA obtained came from the predator, but prey DNA could be amplified using prey-specific primers. The four prey species fed in consistent daily proportions throughout the trial were detected in more than 90% of the scat DNA extractions. Squid and sockeye salmon, which were fed as a relatively small percentage of the daily diet, were detected as reliably as the more abundant diet items. Prey detection was erratic in scats collected when the daily diet was fed in two meals that differed in prey composition, suggesting that prey DNA is passed in meal specific pulses. Prey items that were removed from the diet following one day of feeding were only detected in scats collected within 48 h of ingestion. Proportions of fish DNA present in eight scat samples (evaluated through the screening of clone libraries) were roughly proportional to the mass of prey items consumed, raising the possibility that DNA quantification methods could provide semi-quantitative diet composition data. This study should be of broad interest to researchers studying diet since it highlights an approach that can accurately identify prey species and is not dependent on prey hard parts surviving digestion.

AB Unprecedented declines of marine fish have revealed our inability to predict the susceptibility of populations to collapse and their capacity for subsequent recovery. Lack of knowledge about the behaviour and ecology of exploited species has hindered our understanding of how exploitation influences the resistance of marine fish to catastrophic decline and their resilience thereafter. Based on available data, particularly on the Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, we argue that the breeding behaviour of marine fish is considerably more complex than was believed previously. Mate competition, mate choice and other components of mating systems can affect population growth rate deleteriously during and after periods of intense exploitation. There is a pressing need to incorporate knowledge of mating systems in population assessments, to undertake field research on spatial and temporal scales of reproduction, and to initiate laboratory manipulation experiments to test hypotheses about marine fish mating systems, Allee effects and correlates of individual reproductive success.

AB Root hairs are presumably important in the acquisition of immobile soil resources such as phosphorus. The density and length of root hairs vary substantially within and between species, and are highly regulated by soil phosphorus availability, which suggests that at high nutrient availability, root hairs may have a neutral or negative impact on fitness. We used a root-hairless mutant of the small herbaceous dicot Arabidopsis thaliana to assess the effect of root hairs on plant competition under contrasting phosphorus regimes. Wildtype plants were grown with hairless plants in a replacement series design at high (60 mum phosphate in soil solution) and low (1 mum phosphate in soil solution) phosphorus availability. At high phosphorus availability, wildtype and mutant plants were equal in growth, phosphorus acquisition, fecundity and relative crowding coefficient (RCC). At low phosphorus availability, hairless plants accumulated less biomass and phosphorus, and produced less seed when planted with wildtype plants. Wildtype plants were unaffected by the presence of hairless plants in mixed genotype plantings. Wildtype plants had RCC values greater than one while hairless plants had RCC values less than one. We conclude that root hairs increase the competitiveness of plants under low phosphorus availability but do not reduce growth or competitiveness under high phosphorus availability.

Patch samples were subjected to multivariate analyses to determine: (i) relationships among seven indices describing community structure (structure parameters); (ii) relationships among seven environmental variables; (iii) the relationship between community structure and environmental characteristics of patches. Faunal data showed that indices measuring the distribution of individuals among taxa (evenness, dominance) and richness are prominent in describing the structure of macroinvertebrate communities of mesohabitats. The analysis of environmental data demonstrated a major differentiating ability of current velocity and strong inter-relations among in-stream hydraulic-dependent parameters in structuring the mesohabitat environment. The co-structure (= relationship) between community organization and environmental variables indicated that substrate may be a primary determinant of community structure. Current velocity and water depth emerged as secondary factors. Trends in community structure were closely related to the spatial variability of mesohabitats. Species richness increased with habitat heterogeneity. Total abundance increased with trophic potentialities of patches. Equitability and diversity seemed to increase with patch stability.

AB Ecology is often said to lack general theories sufficiently predictive for applications. Here, we examine the concept of a periodic table of niches and feasibility of niche classification schemes from functional trait and performance data. Niche differences and their influence on ecological patterns and processes could be revealed effectively by first performing data reduction/ordination analyses separately on matrices of trait and performance data compiled according to logical associations with five basic niche dimensions', or aspects: habitat, life history, trophic, defence and metabolic. Resultant patterns then are integrated to produce interpretable niche gradients, ordinations and classifications. Degree of scheme periodicity would depend on degrees of niche conservatism and convergence causing species clustering across multiple niche dimensions. We analysed a sample data set containing trait and performance data to contrast two approaches for producing niche schemes: species ordination within niche gradient space, and niche categorisation according to trait-value thresholds. Creation of niche schemes useful for advancing ecological knowledge and its applications will depend on research that produces functional trait and performance datasets directly related to niche dimensions along with criteria for data standardisation and quality. As larger databases are compiled, opportunities will emerge to explore new methods for data reduction, ordination and classification.

AB Identifying the factors that influence the outcome of host-microbial interactions is critical to protecting biodiversity, minimizing agricultural losses and improving human health. A few genes that determine symbiosis or resistance to infectious disease have been identified in model species, but a comprehensive examination of how a host genotype influences the structure of its microbial community is lacking. Here we report the results of a field experiment with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to identify the fungi and bacteria that colonize its leaves and the host loci that influence the microbe numbers. The composition of this community differs among accessions of A. thaliana. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggest that plant loci responsible for defense and cell wall integrity affect variation in this community. Furthermore, species richness in the bacterial community is shaped by host genetic variation, notably at loci that also influence the reproduction of viruses, trichome branching and morphogenesis.

AB There is a growing interest in identifying ecological factors that influence adaptive genetic diversity patterns in both model and nonmodel species. The emergence of large genomic and environmental data sets, as well as the increasing sophistication of population genetics methods, provides an opportunity to characterize these patterns in relation to the environment. Landscape genetics has emerged as a flexible analytical framework that connects patterns of adaptive genetic variation to environmental heterogeneity in a spatially explicit context. Recent growth in this field has led to the development of numerous spatial statistical methods, prompting a discussion of the current benefits and limitations of these approaches. Here we provide a review of the design of landscape genetics studies, the different statistical tools, some important case studies, and perspectives on how future advances in this field are likely to shed light on important processes in evolution and ecology.

AB Researchers from a number of disciplines have long sought the ability to estimate the functional attributes of plant canopies, such as photosynthetic capacity, using remotely sensed data. To date, however, this goal has not been fully realized. In this study, fresh-leaf reflectance spectroscopy (lambda=450-2500 nm) and a partial least-squares regression (PLSR) analysis were used to estimate key determinants of photosynthetic capacity-namely the maximum rates of RuBP carboxylation (V-cmax) and regeneration (J(max))-measured with standard gas exchange techniques on leaves of trembling aspen and eastern cottonwood trees. The trees were grown across an array of glasshouse temperature regimes. The PLSR models yielded accurate and precise estimates of V-cmax and J(max) within and across species and glasshouse temperatures. These predictions were developed using unique contributions from different spectral regions. Most of the wavelengths selected were correlated with known absorption features related to leaf water content, nitrogen concentration, internal structure, and/or photosynthetic enzymes. In a field application of our PLSR models, spectral reflectance data effectively captured the short-term temperature sensitivities of V-cmax and J(max) in aspen foliage. These findings highlight a promising strategy for developing remote sensing methods to characterize dynamic, environmentally sensitive aspects of canopy photosynthetic metabolism at broad scales.

AB Background The palm family occurs in all tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. Palms are of high ecological and economical importance, and display complex spatial patterns of species distributions and diversity.
   Scope This review summarizes empirical evidence for factors that determine palm species distributions, community composition and species richness such as the abiotic environment (climate, soil chemistry, hydrology and topography), the biotic environment (vegetation structure and species interactions) and dispersal. The importance of contemporary vs. historical impacts of these factors and the scale at which they function is discussed. Finally a hierarchical scale framework is developed to guide predictor selection for future studies.
   Conclusions Determinants of palm distributions, composition and richness vary with spatial scale. For species distributions, climate appears to be important at landscape and broader scales, soil, topography and vegetation at landscape and local scales, hydrology at local scales, and dispersal at all scales. For community composition, soil appears important at regional and finer scales, hydrology, topography and vegetation at landscape and local scales, and dispersal again at all scales. For species richness, climate and dispersal appear to be important at continental to global scales, soil at landscape and broader scales, and topography at landscape and finer scales. Some scale-predictor combinations have not been studied or deserve further attention, e. g. climate on regional to finer scales, and hydrology and topography on landscape and broader scales. The importance of biotic interactions - apart from general vegetation structure effects - for the geographic ecology of palms is generally underexplored. Future studies should target scale-predictor combinations and geographic domains not studied yet. To avoid biased inference, one should ideally include at least all predictors previously found important at the spatial scale of investigation.

AB This paper provides a critique of the cost-benefit analysis tool for ecosystem services policy evaluation. We argue that when applied to public ecosystem services, the theoretical assumptions that underlie economic valuation and cost-benefit analysis fail to fully acknowledge the multiple dimensions of human well-being, the plural forms of value articulation, the complex nature of ecosystems, the distributional biases of markets and the fairness implications of spatio-temporal framing. The current monistic utilitarian approach to ecosystem services policy evaluation should therefore be replaced by a pluralist framework composed of a heterogeneous set of value-articulating instruments that are appropriate to the specific context within which decision-making takes place. It is argued that within this pluralist framework cost-benefit analysis may remain an appropriate tool to examine the contingent trade-offs of local policies that have limited impacts on ecosystems and their services.

AB Aim Differentiation of sites or communities is often measured by partitioning regional or gamma diversity into additive or multiplicative alpha and beta components. The beta component and the ratio of within-group to total diversity (alpha/gamma) are then used to infer the compositional differentiation or similarity of the sites. There is debate about the appropriate measures and partitioning formulas for this purpose. We test the main partitioning methods, using empirical and simulated data, to see if some of these methods lead to false conclusions, and we show how to resolve the problems that we uncover.
   Location South America, Ecuador, Orellana province, Rio Shiripuno.
   Methods We construct sets of real and simulated tropical butterfly communities that can be unambiguously ranked according to their degree of differentiation. We then test whether beta and similarity measures from the different partitioning approaches rank these datasets correctly.
   Results The ratio of within-group diversity to total diversity does not reflect compositional similarity, when the Gini-Simpson index or Shannon entropy are used to measure diversity. Additive beta diversity based on the Gini-Simpson index does not reflect the degree of differentiation between N sites or communities.
   Main conclusions The ratio of within-group to total diversity (alpha/gamma) should not be used to measure the compositional similarity of groups, if diversity is equated with Shannon entropy or the Gini-Simpson index. Conversion of these measures to effective number of species solves these problems. Additive Gini-Simpson beta diversity does not directly reflect the differentiation of N samples or communities. However, when properly transformed onto the unit interval so as to remove the dependence on alpha and N, additive and multiplicative beta measures yield identical normalized measures of relative similarity and differentiation.

AB Climate is often singled out as the primary range limiting factor at large scales, while other environmental factors, notably soil, are thought to predominate at smaller scales. However, the postglacial migrational lag hypothesis controversially suggests that many species are strongly dispersal-limited and still expanding from their ice age refugia. We investigated the importance of postglacial migrational lag, climate, and soil as range determinants for 47 widespread forest plant species across nemoral Europe (47.0-60.0 degrees N, west of 24.0 degrees E) using regression modeling, information-theoretic model selection, multi-model inference, and variation partitioning. Migrational lag was represented by a measure of accessibility to recolonization from ice age refugia.
   Twelve species were largely ubiquitous and not analyzed further. For the remaining species, there was strong support for climate, soil, and accessibility to postglacial recolonization. Accessibility accounted for a small to moderate amount of variation, but its model-averaged regression coefficient was stronger than those for climate or soil for 11 species and the second or third strongest coefficient for an additional 10 species. The resulting odds ratios were greater than one for 33 out of 35 species, i.e. adjusted for climate and soil, prevalence for the far majority of the 35 non-ubiquitous species increased with increasing accessibility. There were no differences among growth forms in the importance of accessibility. In contrast, compared to non-boreal species, accessibility had little importance for species with wide boreal distributions, as expected from their more widespread, northern glacial distributions.
   In conclusion, even the ranges of many widespread forest plant species are probably still moderately to strongly limited by postglacial migrational lag. Therefore, although species ranges are also strongly influenced by climate, we cannot expect most forest plant species to closely track the expected 21st century climatic changes.

AB As the competition for the finite water resources on earth increases due to growth in population and affluence, agriculture is faced with intensifying pressure to improve the efficiency of water used for food production. The causes for the relatively low water use efficiency in agriculture are numerous and complex, including environmental, biological, engineering, management, social, and economic facets. The complexity of the problem, with its myriads of local variations, requires a comprehensive conceptual framework of the underlying physical and biological processes as the basis to analyze the existing situation and quantify the efficiencies, and to plan and execute improvements. This paper proposes such a framework, based on the simple fact that the overall efficiency of any process consisting of a chain of sequential step is the product of the efficiency (i.e., output/input ratio) of its individual component steps. In most cases of water use, a number of process chains, both branching and merging, are involved. Means to integrate the diverging and converging chains are developed and presented as equations. Upscaling from fields to regions and beyond are discussed. This chain of efficiencies approach is general and can be applied to any process composed of chains of sequential steps. Here the framework is used to analyze the systems of irrigated and dryland crop production, and animal production on rangeland. Range of plausible efficiencies of each step is presented as tables, with values separately for the poor and for the good situation of circumstances, management and technology. Causes of the differences in efficiency of each step, going from water delivery to soil water extraction, transpiration, photosynthesis, and conversion to crop biomass and yield, and to animal product are briefly discussed. Sample calculations are made to demonstrate how modest differences in the efficiencies of the component steps are manifested as large to huge differences in the overall efficiency. Based on an equation quantifying the impact of changes in efficiency of component steps on the overall efficiency, it is concluded that generally, it is more effective to made modest improvements in several or more steps than to concentrate efforts to improve one or two steps. Hence, improvement efforts should be systematic and not overly concentrated on one or two components. The potential use of the same equation as the point of departure to optimize the allocation of economic resource among the component steps to maximize the improvement in the overall water use efficiency is elaborated on. The chain of efficiencies framework provides the means to examine the current levels of efficiency along the pathways of agricultural water use, to analyze where inefficiencies lie by comparing with the range of known efficiency values in the tables presented, to assess the potential improvements that may be achieved in various parts and their impact on the overall efficiency, and to aid in the optimal allocation of resources for improvements.

AB Cryptic structure of species complexes confounds an accurate accounting of biological diversity in natural systems. Also, cryptic sibling species often become specialized to different ecological conditions, for instance, with host specialization by cryptic parasite species. The fungus Microbotryum violaceum causes anther smut disease in plants of Caryophyllaceae, and the degree of specialization and gene flow between strains on different hosts have been controversial in the literature. We conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses on M. violaceum from 23 host species and different geographic origins using three single-copy nuclear genes (beta-tub, gamma-tub, and Ef1 alpha). Congruence between the phylogenies identified several lineages that evolved independently for a long time. The lineages had overlapping geographic ranges but were highly specialized on different hosts. These results thus suggest that M. violaceum is a complex of highly specialized sibling species. Two incongruencies between the individual gene phylogenies and one intragene recombination event were detected at basal nodes, suggesting ancient introgression events or speciation events via hybridizations. However, incongruencies and recombination were not detected among terminal branches, indicating that the potentials for cross-infection and experimental hybridization are often not sufficient to suggest that introgressions would likely persist in nature.

AB The recent dramatic decline in farmland biodiversity is often attributed to agricultural intensification and structural changes in the agricultural landscape. One suggested farm practice seen to benefit biodiversity and reverse declines is organic farming. Because organic farming is viewed as a more sustainable form of agriculture it is currently subsidized by European agri-environment schemes. However, the efficiency of agri-environment schemes to preserve biodiversity has recently been questioned, partly because their uptake has been highest in extensively farmed more heterogeneous landscapes.
   We investigated the effect of farming practice on butterfly species richness and abundance along cereal field headlands and margins on 12 matched pairs of organic and conventional farms in contrasting landscapes (homogeneous and heterogeneous landscape diversity).
   Both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity significantly increased butterfly species richness and abundance. There was also a significant interaction between farming practice and landscape heterogeneity, because organic farming only significantly increased butterfly species richness and abundance in homogeneous rather than heterogeneous landscapes.
   An analysis of the distribution of organic farming in Sweden in relation to productivity of the arable land (yield of spring barley, kg ha(-1)) indicated that the distribution of organic farms was skewed towards extensively farmed agricultural areas.
   Synthesis and applications. The species richness and abundance of butterflies can be enhanced by actions aimed at both promoting organic farming and increasing landscape heterogeneity. However, the beneficial effect of organic farming was only evident in intensively farmed homogeneous landscapes. Currently, the majority of organic arable land in Sweden is located in heterogeneous landscapes where changing the type of farming practice adds little to the existing biodiversity. We therefore propose that the interaction between landscape heterogeneity and farming practice must be considered when promoting farmland biodiversity, for example in Europe by developing context-based agri-environment schemes to increase the amount of organic farming in intensively farmed landscapes. We also propose that in homogeneous agricultural landscapes, organic farming could be used as a more efficient tool to restore landscape heterogeneity if the creation of semi-natural landscape elements was mandatory in the regulations associated with organic agri-environment schemes.

AB The extensive phenotypic polymorphism in the European whitefish has triggered evolutionary research in order to disentangle mechanisms underlying diversification. To illuminate the ecological distinctiveness in polymorphic whitefish, and evaluate taxonomic designations, we studied nine Norwegian lakes in three watercourses, which each harboured pairs of divergent whitefish morphs. We compared the morphology and life history of these morphs, documented the extent of genetic differentiation between them, and contrasted the niche use of sympatric morphs along both the habitat and resource axes. In all cases, sympatric morphs differed in the number of gill rakers, a highly heritable trait related to trophic utilization. Individual growth rate, age and size at maturity, diet and habitat use also differed between morphs within lakes, but were remarkably similar across lakes within the same morph. Microsatellite analyses confirmed for all but one pair that sympatric morphs were significantly genetically different, and that similar morphs from different lakes likely have a polyphyletic origin. These results are most compatible with the process of parallel evolution through recurrent postglacial divergence into pelagic and benthic niches in each of these lakes. We propose that sparsely and densely rakered whitefish sympatric pairs may be a likely case of ecological speciation, mediated in oligotrophic lakes with few trophic competitors.

AB Most ecological hypotheses about species coexistence hinge on species differences, but quantifying trait differences across species in diverse communities is often unfeasible. We examined the variation of demographic traits using a global tropical forest data set covering 4500 species in 10 large-scale tree inventories. With a hierarchical Bayesian approach, we quantified the distribution of mortality and growth rates of all tree species at each site. This allowed us to test the prediction that demographic differences facilitate species richness, as suggested by the theory that a tradeoff between high growth and high survival allows species to coexist. Contrary to the prediction, the most diverse forests had the least demographic variation. Although demographic differences may foster coexistence, they do not explain any of the 16-fold variation in tree species richness observed across the tropics.

AB Population dynamics result from the interplay of density-independent and density-dependent processes. Understanding this interplay is important, especially for being able to predict near-term population trajectories for management. In recent years, the study of model systems-experimental, observational and theoretical-has shed considerable light on the way that the both density-dependent and -independent aspects of the environment affect population dynamics via impacting on the organism's life history and therefore demography. These model-based approaches suggest that (i) individuals in different states differ in their demographic performance, (ii) these differences generate structure that can fluctuate independently of current total population size and so can influence the dynamics in important ways, (iii) individuals are strongly affected by both current and past environments, even when the past environments may be in previous generations and (iv) dynamics are typically complex and transient due to environmental noise perturbing complex population structures. For understanding population dynamics of any given system, we suggest that 'the devil is in the detail'. Experimental dissection of empirical systems is providing important insights into the details of the drivers of demographic responses and therefore dynamics and should also stimulate theory that incorporates relevant biological mechanism.

AB Increasing demands on and and semiarid ecosystems, which comprise one-third of Earth's terrestrial environment, create an urgent need to understand their biodiversity, function, and mechanisms of change. Sagebrush (Artemisia) steppe, the largest semiarid vegetation type in North America, is endangered because of losses to agriculture, excessive grazing, and invasive species. Establishment in 1950 of what is now designated as the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (southeastern Idaho, USA) created the largest existing reserve of this extensive vegetation type. We used cover, density, and frequency data for vascular plants sampled on 79 permanent plots nine times during 45 years to (1) assess long-term changes in abundance and distribution of major species and life forms, (2) assess changes in species richness and plot similarity, and (3) test the hypotheses that plant cover and stability of cover are positively associated with species richness and that invasibility is inversely related to native plant cover and richness.
   From 1933 through 1957 the area was subject to severe drought, with annual precipitation exceeding the long-term mean only four times. Cover of shrubs plus perennial grasses was 18% in 1950, and the vegetation was heavily dominated by sagebrush. Perennial grass cover was only 0.5%. With elevated precipitation after 1957, shrub cover increased to 25% by 1965, and by 1975 cover of perennial grasses had increased 13-fold. Subsequent fluctuations in cover did not track precipitation closely. Cover and density of major species were often out of phase, and correlation analyses indicated lags of 2-5 yr in responses of species or functional groups to precipitation. Aggregate species richness of the area has not changed appreciably, but richness of shrubs, perennial grasses, and forbs per plot steadily increased from 1950 to 1995. Vegetative heterogeneity also increased, with mean similarity among plots declining from 72% to 40%. Plots having higher species richness tended to maintain higher levels of cover and to vary less in cover relative to their mean level, indicating links between species richness and function. Abundance of normative species was negatively correlated with cover, but not with richness of native species. Thus, adequate cover of native species can render these semiarid communities more resistant to invasion. Maintaining richness and cover of native species should be a high management priority for these ecosystems.

AB Succession is one of the most studied processes in ecology and succession theory provides strong predictability. However, few attempts have been made to influence the course of succession thereby testing the hypothesis that passing through one stage is essential before entering the next one. At each stage of succession ecosystem processes may be affected by the diversity of species present, but there is little empirical evidence showing that plant species diversity may affect succession. On ex-arable land, a major constraint of vegetation succession is the dominance of perennial early-successional (arable weed) species. Our aim was to change the initial vegetation succession by the direct sowing of later-successional plant species. The hypothesis was tested that a diverse plant species mixture would be more successful in weed suppression than species-poor mixtures. In order to provide a robust test including a wide range of environmental conditions and plant species, experiments were carried out at five sites across Europe. At each site, an identical experiment was set up, albeit that the plant species composition of the sown mixtures differed from site to site. Results of the 2-year study showed that diverse plant species mixtures were more effective at reducing the number of natural colonisers (mainly weeds from the seed bank) than the average low-diversity treatment. However, the effect of the low-diversity treatment depended on the composition of the species mixture. Thus, the effect of enhanced species diversity strongly depended on the species composition of the low-diversity treatments used for comparison. The effects of high-diversity plant species mixtures on weed suppression differed between sites. Low-productivity sites gave the weakest response to the diversity treatments. These differences among sites did not change the general pattern. The present results have implications for understanding biological invasions. It has been hypothesised that alien species are more likely to invade species-poor communities than communities with high diversity. However, our results show that the identity of the local species matters. This may explain, at least partly, controversial results of studies on the relation between local diversity and the probability of being invaded by aliens.

AB Wildlife management in modern environments has to contend with an inheritance of faunal and landscape changes caused by humans which affect the relationships between predatory and prey species. In both game management for harvesting, and in species preservation, this leads to difficult decisions about whether and how to manage predation.
   Predator control by humans is as old as livestock husbandry. The deliberate, often organized, destruction of many mammalian predator species has been a feature of human development in Europe - and later in countries to which Europeans spread - for centuries. Destruction to the point of extinction was practised for a number of reasons (self-protection, protection of domestic stock, protection of wild game, fur, adventure, sport) which were rarely distinguished. Reduction of predator numbers specifically to allow an increased harvest of some game species was mainly a nineteenth century development, while the adoption of predator control to benefit endangered species for their own sake belongs to recent decades.
   We review scientific literature relevant to predator control in game management and in conservation. Understanding of the role of predation in prey population dynamics has changed considerably during the last 20 years, and predation is now credited with a much more powerful role than in the past. Increasingly it becomes possible not merely to understand what predator control achieves, but to predict when it might be valuable in management, and what strategy will best achieve the aims.
   Examples of conservation problems involving predation illustrate the complexity of decisionmaking in management. Because of habitat loss, habitat degradation, altered predator communities, or altered predator-prey ratios, predation losses often have increased significance in modern environments.
   Novel approaches potentially offer non-lethal ways to manage mammalian predators. However, most are still in an exploratory phase and there have been no unqualified successes. The best tested approach, excluding predators from small areas by fencing, is discussed.
   In Britain, predator control to benefit small game populations and allow harvesting has been practised for nearly 200 years, and has undoubtedly played a role in shaping the present-day fauna. Although earlier gamekeeping severely reduced the geographical range of several mammalian (and avian) predator species, nowadays predator control is subject to legal restrictions based on species' conservation status and humaneness. However, illegal persecution of species protected by law remains a persistent and significant conservation problem. The predator species legitimately targeted are successful, common and increasing in the modem environment, while wild populations of gamebirds and many other ground-nesting birds are declining seriously in most areas.

AB Increasing global food demand, low grain reserves and climate change threaten the stability of food systems on national to global scales(1-5). Policies to increase yields, irrigation and tolerance of crops to drought have been proposed as stability-enhancing solutions(1,6,7). Here we evaluate a complementary possibility-that greater diversity of crops at the national level may increase the year-to-year stability of the total national harvest of all crops combined. We test this crop diversity-stability hypothesis using 5 decades of data on annual yields of 176 crop species in 91 nations. We find that greater effective diversity of crops at the national level is associated with increased temporal stability of total national harvest. Crop diversity has stabilizing effects that are similar in magnitude to the observed destabilizing effects of variability in precipitation. This greater stability reflects markedly lower frequencies of years with sharp harvest losses. Diversity effects remained robust after statistically controlling for irrigation, fertilization, precipitation, temperature and other variables, and are consistent with the variance-scaling characteristics of individual crops required by theory(8,9) for diversity to lead to stability. Ensuring stable food supplies is a challenge that will probably require multiple solutions. Our results suggest that increasing national effective crop diversity may be an additional way to address this challenge.

ID FALLACY
AB In this article we address a number of important issues that arise in the analysis of nonindependent data. Such data are common in studies in which predictors vary within "units" (e.g., within-subjects, within-classrooms). Most researchers analyze categorical within-unit predictors with repeated-measures ANOVAs, but continuous within-unit predictors with linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs). We show that both types of predictor variables can be analyzed within the LMEM framework. We discuss designs with multiple sources of nonindependence, for example, studies in which the same subjects rate the same set of items or in which students nested in classrooms provide multiple answers. We provide clear guidelines about the types of random effects that should be included in the analysis of such designs. We also present a number of corrective steps that researchers can take when convergence fails in LMEM models with too many parameters. We end with a brief discussion on the trade-off between power and generalizability in designs with "within-unit" predictors.
   Translational Abstract
   Researchers and practitioners sometimes want to analyze data that are "nonindependent." Data are said to be nonindependent when the study is designed such that certain data points can be expected to be on average more similar to each other than other data points. This is usually the case when each subject provides multiple data points (so-called within-subject designs), when subjects belonging to higher-order units influence each other (e.g., students clustered in classrooms, employees clustered in teams), or when subjects react to or evaluate the same set of items (e.g., pictures, words, sentences, products, art works, target individuals). In the present article, we propose that all types of nonindependent data can be analyzed with the same statistical technique called "linear mixed-effects models." Compared to standard statistical tests belonging to the family of "General Linear Models" (e.g., ANOVA, regression), linear mixed-effects models have a "complex error term," i.e., the data analyst has to explicitly include all possible reasons for why the predictions of the statistical model may be wrong (these possible reasons are called "random effects"). It is not always obvious how to identify all possible sources of error. In this article, we provide clear guidelines on the type of random effects that researchers and practitioners should include when estimating linear mixed-effects models. Failure to include the appropriate random effects leads to an unacceptable false positive rate (or "type I error rate"), i.e., a high proportion of statistically significant results for effects that do not exist in reality.

TI Spatial scale affects the relative role of stochasticity versus

AB Background: The relative importance of stochasticity versus determinism in soil bacterial communities is unclear, as are the possible influences that alter the balance between these. Here, we investigated the influence of spatial scale on the relative role of stochasticity and determinism in agricultural monocultures consisting only of wheat, thereby minimizing the influence of differences in plant species cover and in cultivation/disturbance regime, extending across a wide range of soils and climates of the North China Plain (NCP). We sampled 243 sites across 1092 km and sequenced the 16S rRNA bacterial gene using MiSeq. We hypothesized that determinism would play a relatively stronger role at the broadest scales, due to the strong influence of climate and soil differences in selecting many distinct OTUs of bacteria adapted to the different environments. In order to test the more general applicability of the hypothesis, we also compared with a natural ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau.
   Results: Our results revealed that the relative importance of stochasticity vs. determinism did vary with spatial scale, in the direction predicted. On the North China Plain, stochasticity played a dominant role from 150 to 900 km (separation between pairs of sites) and determinism dominated at more than 900 km (broad scale). On the Tibetan Plateau, determinism played a dominant role from 130 to 1200 km and stochasticity dominated at less than 130 km. Among the identifiable deterministic factors, soil pH showed the strongest influence on soil bacterial community structure and diversity across the North China Plain. Together, 23.9% of variation in soil microbial community composition could be explained, with environmental factors accounting for 19.7% and spatial parameters 4.1%.
   Conclusions: Our findings revealed that (1) stochastic processes are relatively more important on the North China Plain, while deterministic processes are more important on the Tibetan Plateau; (2) soil pH was the major factor in shaping soil bacterial community structure of the North China Plain; and (3) most variation in soil microbial community composition could not be explained with existing environmental and spatial factors. Further studies are needed to dissect the influence of stochastic factors (e.g., mutations or extinctions) on soil microbial community distribution, which might make it easier to predictably manipulate the microbial community to produce better yield and soil sustainability outcomes.

AB Over the past few decades, there has been a rapid proliferation of statistical methods that infer evolutionary and ecological processes from data on species distributions. These methods have led to considerable new insights, but they often fail to account for the effects of historical biogeography on present-day species distributions. Because the geography of speciation can lead to patterns of spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the distributions of species within a clade, this can result in misleading inferences about the importance of deterministic processes in generating spatial patterns of biodiversity. In this opinion article, we discuss ways in which patterns of species distributions driven by historical biogeography are often interpreted as evidence of particular evolutionary or ecological processes. We focus on three areas that are especially prone to such misinterpretations: community phylogenetics, environmental niche modelling, and analyses of beta diversity (compositional turnover of biodiversity).

AB How many dimensions (trait-axes) are required to predict whether two species interact? This unanswered question originated with the idea of ecological niches, and yet bears relevance today for understanding what determines network structure. Here, we analyse a set of 200 ecological networks, including food webs, antagonistic and mutualistic networks, and find that the number of dimensions needed to completely explain all interactions is small (<10), with model selection favouring less than five. Using 18 high-quality webs including several species traits, we identify which traits contribute the most to explaining network structure. We show that accounting for a few traits dramatically improves our understanding of the structure of ecological networks. Matching traits for resources and consumers, for example, fruit size and bill gape, are the most successful combinations. These results link ecologically important species attributes to large-scale community structure.

AB Urbanization will place significant pressures on biodiversity across the world. However, there are large uncertainties in the amount and location of future urbanization, particularly urban land expansion. Here, we present a global analysis of urban extent circa 2000 and probabilistic forecasts of urban expansion for 2030 near protected areas and in biodiversity hotspots. We estimate that the amount of urban land within 50 km of all protected area boundaries will increase from 450 000 km(2) circa 2000 to 1440 000 +/- 65 000 km(2) in 2030. Our analysis shows that protected areas around the world will experience significant increases in urban land within 50 km of their boundaries. China will experience the largest increase in urban land near protected areas with 304 000 +/- 33 000 km(2) of new urban land to be developed within 50 km of protected area boundaries. The largest urban expansion in biodiversity hotspots, over 100 000 +/- 25 000 km(2), is forecasted to occur in South America. Uncertainties in the forecasts of the amount and location of urban land expansion reflect uncertainties in their underlying drivers including urban population and economic growth. The forecasts point to the need to reconcile urban development and biodiversity conservation strategies.

AB What is the observed relationship between plant species diversity and spatial environmental heterogeneity? Does the relationship scale predictably with sample plot size? What are the relative contributions to diversity patterns of variables linked to productivity or available energy compared to those corresponding to spatial heterogeneity?
   Observational and experimental studies that quantified relationships between plant species richness and within-sample spatial environmental heterogeneity were reviewed. Effect size in experimental studies was quantified as the standardized mean difference between control (homogeneous) and heterogeneous treatments. For observational studies, effect sizes in individual studies were examined graphically across a gradient of plot size (focal scale). Relative contributions of variables representing spatial heterogeneity were compared to those representing available energy using a response ratio.
   Forty-one observational and 11 experimental studies quantified plant species diversity and spatial environmental heterogeneity. Observational studies reported positive species diversity-spatial heterogeneity correlations at all points across a plot size gradient from similar to 1.0 x 10(-1) to similar to 1.0 x 10(11) m(2), although many studies reported spatial heterogeneity variables with no significant relationships to species diversity. The cross-study effect size in experimental studies was not significantly different from zero. Available energy variables explained consistently more of the variance in species richness than spatial heterogeneity variables, especially at the smallest and largest plot sizes.
   Species diversity was not related to spatial heterogeneity in a way predictable by plot size. Positive heterogeneity-diversity relationships were common, confirming the importance of niche differentiation in species diversity patterns, but future studies examining a range of spatial scales in the same system are required to determine the role of dispersal and available energy in these patterns.

AB In the Rio de la Plata grasslands (RPG) biogeographical region of South America, agricultural activities have undergone important changes during the last 15-18 years because of technological improvements and new national and international market conditions. We characterized changes in the landscape structure between 1985-1989 and 2002-2004 for eight pilot areas distributed across the main regional environmental gradients. These areas incorporated approximately 35% of the 7.5 x 10(5) km&# 178 of the system. Our approach involved the generation of land-use and land cover maps, the analysis of landscape metrics, and the computation of annual transition probabilities between land cover types. All of the information was summarized in 3383 cells of 8 x 8 km. The area covered by grassland decreased from 67.4 to 61.4% between the study periods. This decrease was associated with an increase in the area of annual crops, mainly soybean, sunflower, wheat, and maize. In some subunits of the RPG, i.e., Flat Inland Pampa, the grassland-to-cropland transition probability was high (p(G ->)C = 3.7 x 10(-2)), whereas in others, i.e., Flooding Pampa, this transition probability was low (p(G ->)C = 6.7 x 10(-3)). Our description of the magnitude, direction, and spatial distribution of land-use and land cover changes provides a basis from which to develop spatially explicit scenarios of land cover change.

AB Conifers are characterized by a large genome size and a rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium, most often within gene limits. Genome scans based on noncoding markers are less likely to detect molecular adaptation linked to genes in these species. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) scan focused on expressed genes in detecting local adaptation in a conifer species. Samples were collected from six natural populations of white spruce (Picea glauca) moderately differentiated for several quantitative characters. A total of 534 SNPs representing 345 expressed genes were analysed. Genes potentially under natural selection were identified by estimating the differentiation in SNP frequencies among populations (F-ST) and identifying outliers, and by estimating local differentiation using a Bayesian approach. Both average expected heterozygosity and population differentiation estimates (H-E = 0.270 and F-ST = 0.006) were comparable to those obtained with other genetic markers. Of all genes, 5.5% were identified as outliers with F-ST at the 95% confidence level, while 14% were identified as candidates for local adaptation with the Bayesian method. There was some overlap between the two gene sets. More than half of the candidate genes for local adaptation were specific to the warmest population, about 20% to the most arid population, and 15% to the coldest and most humid higher altitude population. These adaptive trends were consistent with the genes' putative functions and the divergence in quantitative traits noted among the populations. The results suggest that an approach separating the locus and population effects is useful to identify genes potentially under selection. These candidates are worth exploring in more details at the physiological and ecological levels.

AB Large discrepancies have been found in dates of evolutionary events obtained using the molecular clock. Twofold differences have been reported between the dates estimated from molecular data and those from the fossil record; furthermore, different molecular methods can give dates that differ 20-fold. New software attempts to incorporate appropriate allowances for this uncertainty into the calculation of the accuracy of date estimates. Here, we propose that these innovations represent welcome progress towards obtaining reliable dates from the molecular clock, but warn that they are currently unproven, given that the causes and pattern of the discrepancies are the subject of ongoing research. This research implies that many previous studies, even some of those using recently developed methods, might have placed too much confidence in their date estimates, and their conclusions might need to be revised.

AB Many efforts are underway to produce broad-scale forest attribute maps by modelling forest class and structure variables collected in forest inventories as functions of satellite-based and biophysical information. Typically, variants of classification and regression trees implemented in Rulequest's (c) See5 and Cubist (for binary and continuous responses, respectively) are the tools of choice in many of these applications. These tools are widely used in large remote sensing applications, but are not easily interpretable, do not have ties with survey estimation methods, and use proprietary unpublished algorithms. Consequently, three alternative modelling techniques were compared for mapping presence and basal area of 13 species located in the mountain ranges of Utah, USA. The modelling techniques compared included the widely used See5/Cubist, generalized additive models (GAMs), and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB). Model performance was evaluated using independent test data sets. Evaluation criteria for mapping species presence included specificity, sensitivity, Kappa, and area under the curve (AUC). Evaluation criteria for the continuous basal area variables included correlation and relative mean squared error. For predicting species presence (setting thresholds to maximize Kappa), SGB had higher values for the majority of the species for specificity and Kappa, while GAMs had higher values for the majority of the species for sensitivity. In evaluating resultant AUC values, GAM and/or SGB models had significantly better results than the See5 models where significant differences could be detected between models. For nine out of 13 species, basal area prediction results for all modelling techniques were poor (correlations less than 0.5 and relative mean squared errors greater than 0.8), but SGB provided the most stable predictions in these instances. SGB and Cubist performed equally well for modelling basal area for three species with moderate prediction success, while all three modelling tools produced comparably good predictions (correlation of 0.68 and relative mean squared error of 0.56) for one species.

AB Most large mammalian carnivores are in global decline, largely due to their involvement in livestock depredation. Research that advances our understanding of predator-livestock interactions is crucial to conflict mitigation and carnivore conservation. Here we investigated the influence of environmental and socio-ecological factors on livestock depredation by carnivores in pastoral villages adjacent to the Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya during a 14-month period. We attempted to identify factors associated with temporal and spatial variation in depredation rates, incorporating data on a closely monitored spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) population known to be involved in depredation events. Spotted hyenas, leopards (Panthera pardus) and lions (Panthera leo) were responsible for 53%, 32%, and 15% of attacks on livestock, respectively. Monthly depredation frequency was correlated positively with rainfall and negatively with natural prey abundance. Radio-telemetry revealed that hyenas defending a group territory within the Reserve spent more time outside the Reserve during months when hyena attacks on livestock were most frequent. Results of logistic regression models, which indicated spotted hyenas were most likely to attack large villages, were supported by behavioral observations of hyenas near villages. Leopards however, selected villages that were spatially isolated from other villages. Hyenas were more likely to attack livestock enclosures constructed of local bush material than those of more sturdy "pole" timber, but use of pole material more than doubled the probability of leopard attack. Selection of fence type should therefore depend on the size and relative isolation of villages. overall, improved fences, more watch dogs, and high levels of human activity were not associated with lower livestock losses to predators.

AB Often resource selection functions (RSFs) are developed by comparing resource attributes of used sites to unused or available ones. We present alternative approaches to the analysis of resource selection based on the utilization distribution (UD). Our objectives are to describe the rationale for estimation of RSFs based on UDs, offer advice about computing UDs and RSFs, and illustrate their use in resource selection studies. We discuss the 3 main factors that should be considered when using kernel UD-based estimates of space use: selection of bandwidth values, sample size versus precision of estimates, and UD shape and complexity. We present 3 case studies that demonstrate use of UDs in resource selection modeling. The first example demonstrates the general case of RSF estimation that uses multiple regression adjusted for spatial autocorrelation to relate LID estimates (i.e., the probability density function) to resource attributes. A second example, involving Poisson regression with an offset term, is presented as an alternative for modeling the relative frequency, or probability of use, within defined habitat units. This procedure uses the relative frequency of locations within a habitat unit as a surrogate of the UD and requires relatively fewer user-defined options in the modeling of resource selection. Last, we illustrate how the UD can also be used to enhance univariate resource selection analyses, such as compositional analysis, in cases where animals use their range nonrandomly. The UD helps overcome several common shortcomings of some other analytical techniques by treating the animal as the primary sampling unit, summarizing use in a continuous and probabilistic manner, and relying on the pattern of animal space use rather than using individual sampling points. However, several drawbacks are apparent when using the LID in resource selection analyses. Choice of UD estimator is important and sensitive to sample size and user-defined options, such as bandwidth and software selection. Extensions to these procedures could consider behavioral-based approaches and alternative techniques to estimate the LID directly.

AB The nature of male mating preferences, and how they differ from female mating preferences in species with conventional sex roles, has received little attention in sexual selection studies. We estimated the form and strength of sexual selection as a consequence of male and female mating preferences in a laboratory-based population of Drosophila serrata. The differences between sexual selection on male and female signal traits (cuticular hydrocarbons [CHCs]) were evaluated within a formal framework of linear and nonlinear selection gradients. Females tended to exert linear sexual selection on male CHCs, whereas males preferred intermediate female CHC phenotypes leading to convex (stabilizing) selection gradients. Possible mechanisms determining the nonlinear nature of sexual selection on female CHCs are proposed.

AB Despite increasing evidence that current exploitation rates can contribute to shifts in life-history traits and the collapse of marine fish stocks, few empirical studies have investigated the likely evolutionary impacts. Here, we used DNA recovered from a temporal series of archived North Sea cod (Gadus morhua) otoliths, to investigate genetic diversity within the Flamborough Head population between 1954 and 1998, during which time the population underwent two successive declines.
   Microsatellite data indicated a significant reduction in genetic diversity between 1954 and 1970 (total number of alleles: 1954, 46; 1960, 42; 1970, 37), and a subsequent recovery between 1970 and 1998 (total number of alleles: 1970, 37; 1981, 42; 1998, 45). Furthermore, estimates of genetic differentiation (F-ST and R-ST) showed a significant divergence between 1998 and earlier samples.
   Data are consistent with a period of prolonged genetic drift, accompanied by a replacement of the Flamborough Head population through an increased effective migration rate that occurred during a period of high exploitation and appreciable demographic and phenotypic change. Other studies indicate that diversity at neutral microsatellite loci may be correlated with variability at selected genes, thus compromising a population's subsequent recovery and adaptive potential. Such effects are especially pertinent to North Sea cod, which are threatened by continuing exploitation and rising sea temperatures.

AB Aim To explore the biogeographic patterns of exotic species in order to discriminate between hypotheses postulated to produce several biogeographic phenomena: the latitudinal gradient in species richness, the latitudinal gradient in species geographical range size (Rapoport's rule), species geographical range boundaries and patterns of invasion in the tropics.
   Location Data were taken from North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and oceanic islands.
   Methods The latitudinal extents of the geographical range of exotic species were recorded to the nearest 1 degrees of latitude from several published sources. Species richness was tabulated by recording the number of naturalized species present within 5 degrees bands of latitude. Rapoport's rule was calculated by averaging the latitudinal extent of all exotic species present within 5 degrees bands. The low-latitude boundaries of species' native and naturalized ranges were compared with the nearest 1 degrees of latitude. These comparisons on continents were contrasted with those on islands.
   Results Within the tropics, few exotic species have become naturalized and those that are have established large geographical ranges. Outside of the tropics, exotic species of birds, mammals, fishes and plants demonstrate qualitatively similar latitudinal gradients in richness and geographical range size. They show the same patterns as native species, where richness is negatively correlated and range size positively correlated with latitude. Further, the geographical ranges of naturalized species on continents rarely extend to latitudes lower than those in their native ranges. On islands (where biotic pressure is reduced) exotic species are more frequently naturalized at latitudes lower than those in their native ranges.
   Main conclusions Hypotheses for the latitudinal gradient in species richness and geographical range size that are based on past glaciation events or differential rates of speciation between regions may not be necessary to explain these gradients, as exotic species are recent colonists and their patterns of distribution cannot have been directly affected by past glaciation events or differential rates of speciation between regions. Further, the low-latitude boundary of species geographical ranges may be set by tolerance for biotic pressure.

AB Higher aridity and more extreme rainfall events in drylands are predicted due to climate change. Yet, it is unclear how changing precipitation regimes may affect nitrogen (N) cycling, especially in areas with extremely high aridity. Here we investigate soil N isotopic values (delta N-15) along a 3,200 km aridity gradient and reveal a hump-shaped relationship between soil delta N-15 and aridity index (AI) with a threshold at AI = 0.32. Variations of foliar delta N-15, the abundance of nitrification and denitrification genes, and metabolic quotient along the gradient provide further evidence for the existence of this threshold. Data support the hypothesis that the increase of gaseous N loss is higher than the increase of net plant N accumulation with increasing AI below AI = 0.32, while the opposite is favoured above this threshold. Our results highlight the importance of N-cycling microbes in extremely dry areas and suggest different controlling factors of N-cycling on either side of the threshold.

AB 1. Evidence is growing that leaf litter generally decomposes faster than expected in its environment of origin, owing to specialization of litter and topsoil decomposer communities to break down litter encountered most often. Nevertheless, this home-field advantage (HFA) in decomposition is inconsistently supported by experimental data and fails to account for situations where contrasting qualities of litter coexist within the same litter matrix.
   2. In contrast to the HFA hypothesis, which expects a positive interaction between every litter species produced locally and the local decomposer communities irrespective of litter species quality, we define here an alternative substrate quality-matrix quality interaction (SMI) hypothesis that expects a continuum from positive to negative interaction between specific litters (substrates) and decomposer communities as specific litters and the ecosystemlitter layer (i.e. the matrix, which drives local decomposer community composition) become increasingly dissimilar in quality.
   3. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a reciprocal transplant decomposition experiment of eight leaf, six fine-stem and nine fine-root litter species from three neighbouring ecosystems of the subarctic biome: dry forest, riparian forest and forest-surrounded pond; and characterized the quality (represented by lignin content and an integrated measure of carbon/nutrient economics) of each litter species and each ecosystem litter layer.
   4. We found substantial overall effects of SMI on decomposition rates of leaf (20% explained variance), stem (14%) and root (15%) litters, although this effect was lower than the single effects of litter quality and microclimate (remaining explained variance). Despite being partly inconsistent across litter species, likely due to the complexity of litter quality-decomposer community relationships, the SMI hypothesis appeared more broadly applicable than the HFA hypothesis.
   5. Synthesis. We demonstrate here that plant traits, likely via their control on litter and topsoil decomposer community composition, have indirect effects on litter breakdown rates, not only at the interface between ecosystems but also within ecosystems, with likely implications for many other ecosystems world-wide. These results suggest functional variation in decomposer communities between ecosystems with respect to their efficiency to degrade litters with contrasting qualities, such as different lignolytic and detoxification activities but also contrasting efficiencies to degrade non-recalcitrant tissues.

AB Assessment of the microbial diversity residing in arthropod vectors of medical importance is crucial for monitoring endemic infections, for surveillance of newly emerging zoonotic pathogens, and for unraveling the associated bacteria within its host. The tick Ixodes ricinus is recognized as the primary European vector of disease-causing bacteria in humans. Despite I. ricinus being of great public health relevance, its microbial communities remain largely unexplored to date. Here we evaluate the pathogen-load and the microbiome in single adult I. ricinus by using 454- and Illumina-based metagenomic approaches. Genomic DNA-derived sequences were taxonomically profiled using a computational approach based on the BWA algorithm, allowing for the identification of known tick-borne pathogens at the strain level and the putative tick core microbiome. Additionally, we assessed and compared the bacterial taxonomic profile in nymphal and adult I. ricinus pools collected from two distinct geographic regions in Northern Italy by means of V6-16S rRNA amplicon pyrosequencing and community based ecological analysis. A total of 108 genera belonging to representatives of all bacterial phyla were detected and a rapid qualitative assessment for pathogenic bacteria, such as Borrelia, Rickettsia and Candidatus Neoehrlichia, and for other bacteria with mutualistic relationship or undetermined function, such as Wolbachia and Rickettsiella, was possible. Interestingly, the ecological analysis revealed that the bacterial community structure differed between the examined geographic regions and tick life stages. This finding suggests that the environmental context (abiotic and biotic factors) and host-selection behaviors affect their microbiome. Our data provide the most complete picture to date of the bacterial communities present within I. ricinus under natural conditions by using high-throughput sequencing technologies. This study further demonstrates a novel detection strategy for the microbiomes of arthropod vectors in the context of epidemiological and ecological studies.

AB Soil microbes play key roles in ecosystems, yet the impact of their diversity on plant communities is still poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the diversity of belowground plant-associated soil fungi promotes plant productivity and plant coexistence. Using additive partitioning of biodiversity effects developed in plant biodiversity studies, we demonstrate that this positive relationship can be driven by complementarity effects among soil fungi in one soil type and by a selection effect resulting from the fungal species that stimulated plant productivity the most in another soil type. Selection and complementarity effects among fungal species contributed to improving plant productivity up to 82% and 85%, respectively, above the average of the respective fungal species monocultures depending on the soil in which they were grown. These results also indicate that belowground diversity may act as insurance for maintaining plant productivity under differing environmental conditions.

AB Interpretations of current diversity patterns based on the contraction/expansion model forced by climatic oscillations during the last two million years are commonplace in phylogeographic literature. Of the wealth of scientific studies accumulated during the past two decades in Europe, the ones we understand best are those mostly from higher latitudes, probably because patterns were simplified to a great extent by major losses of diversity during glacial periods. In Southern European regions (or in general, in those places where ice effects were less severe) the situation is quite different and to some extent opposite. These regions are referred to as refugia because they are known to contain more genetic diversity than elsewhere. This is not only due to preservation of genotypes that went extinct in other places, however, but also to the intensity and accumulation of a number of processes in a patchy landscape across a varied topography. A lack of general phylogeographic patterns in these regions is one consequence. Speaking of a single refugium to refer to each of the peninsulas, however, is an oversimplification. Even speaking of multiple unconnected refugia does not adequately reflect the complexity of the processes that shaped the current genetic and specific diversity.

AB In contrast to the large amount of ecological information supporting the role of natural selection as a main cause of population divergence and speciation, an understanding of the genomic basis underlying those processes is in its infancy. In this paper, we review the main findings of a long-term research programme that we have been conducting on the ecological genomics of sympatric forms of whitefish (Coregonus spp.) engaged in the process of speciation. We present this system as an example of how applying a combination of approaches under the conceptual framework of the theory of adaptive radiation has yielded substantial insight into evolutionary processes in a non-model species. We also discuss how the joint use of recent biotechnological developments will provide a powerful means to address issues raised by observations made to date. Namely, we present data illustrating the potential offered by combining next generation sequencing technologies with other genomic approaches to reveal the genomic bases of adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation. Given increasing access to these new genomic tools, we argue that non-model species studied in their ecological context such as whitefish will play an increasingly important role in generalizing knowledge of speciation.

AB Global environmental changes may be altering the ecology of tropical forests. Long-term monitoring plots have provided much of the evidence for large-scale, directional changes in tropical forests, but the results have been controversial. Here we review evidence from six complementary approaches to understanding possible changes: plant physiology experiments, long-term monitoring plots, ecosystem flux techniques, atmospheric measurements, Earth observations, and global-scale vegetation models. Evidence from four of these approaches suggests that large-scale, directional changes are occurring in the ecology of tropical forests, with the other two approaches providing inconclusive results. Collectively, the evidence indicates that both gross and net primary productivity has likely increased over recent decades, as have tree growth, recruitment, and mortality rates, and forest biomass. These results suggest a profound reorganization of tropical forest ecosystems. We evaluate the most likely drivers of the suite of changes, and suggest increasing resource availability, potentially from rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, is the most likely cause.

AB The annual life cycle of many birds includes breeding, moult and migration. All these processes are time and energy consuming and the extent of investment in any one may compromise the others. The output from breeding is of course the ultimate goal for all birds, while the investment in moult and migration should be selected so that lifetime fitness is maximized. In particular, long-distance migrants breeding at high latitudes face severe time pressures, which is a probable reason why natural selection has evolved efficient behaviours, physiological and morphological adaptations allowing the maximum possible migration speed. Optimal migration theory commonly assumes time minimization as an overall strategy, but the minimization of energy cost and predation risk may also be involved. Based on these assumptions, it is possible to derive adaptive behaviours such as when and at which fuel load a stopover site should be abandoned. I review some core components of optimal migration theory together with some key predictions. A review of accumulated empirical tests of the departure rule indicates that time minimization is an important component of the overall migration strategy, and hence gives support to the assumption about time-selected migration. I also briefly discuss how the optimal policy may be implemented by the bird by applying a set of simple rules. The time constraints on migrants increase with increasing body size. Some consequences of this are discussed.

AB We present an analytical model that unifies two of the most influential theories in community ecology, namely, island biogeography and niche theory. Our model captures the main elements of both theories by incorporating the combined effects of area, isolation, stochastic colonization and extinction processes, habitat heterogeneity, and niche partitioning in a unified, demographically based framework. While classical niche theory predicts a positive relationship between species richness and habitat heterogeneity, our unified model demonstrates that area limitation and dispersal limitation ( the main elements of island biogeography) may create unimodal and even negative relationships between species richness and habitat heterogeneity. We attribute this finding to the fact that increasing heterogeneity increases the potential number of species that may exist in a given area ( as predicted by niche theory) but simultaneously reduces the amount of suitable area available for each species and, thus, increases the likelihood of stochastic extinction. Area limitation, dispersal limitation, and low reproduction rates intensify the latter effect by increasing the likelihood of stochastic extinction. These analytical results demonstrate that the integration of island biogeography and niche theory provides new insights about the mechanisms that regulate the diversity of ecological communities and generates unexpected predictions that could not be attained from any single theory.

AB Studies linking the functional diversity of a biota to ecosystem functioning typically employ a priori classifications of species into hypothetically complementary groups. However, multiple alternate classifications exist in which the number of functional groups, the number of species per functional group, and the grouping of species differ from the a priori scheme. Without assessing the relative precision, or ability of an a priori scheme to accurately predict ecosystem functioning relative to its many alternatives, the validity and utility of analyses based on a single a priori classification scheme remains unclear. We examine the precision of a priori classifications used in 10 experimental grassland systems in Europe and the United States that have found evidence for a significant role of functional plant diversity in governing ecosystem function. The predictive precision of the a priori classifications employed in these studies was seldom significantly higher than the precision of random classifications. Post-hoc classification schemes that performed well in predicting ecosystem function resembled each other more with regard to species composition than average classifications, but there was still considerable variability in the manner in which these classification schemes grouped species. These results suggest that we need a more nuanced understanding of how the diversity of functional traits of species in an assemblage affects ecosystem functioning.

AB Two major international initiatives - the Convention on Biological Diversity's target to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010, and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment - raise the profile of ecological data on the changing state of nature and its implications for human well-being. This paper is intended to provide a broad overview of current knowledge of these issues. Information on changes in the status of species, size of populations, and extent and condition of habitats is patchy, with little data available for many of the taxa, regions and habitats of greatest importance to the delivery of ecosystem services. However, what we do know strongly suggests that, while exceptions exist, the changes currently underway are for the most part negative, anthropogenic in origin, ominously large and accelerating. The impacts of these changes on human society are idiosyncratic and patchily understood, but for the most part also appear to be negative and substantial. Forecasting future changes is limited by our poor understanding of the cascading impacts of change within communities, of threshold effects, of interactions between the drivers of change, and of linkages between the state of nature and human well-being. In assessing future science needs, we not only see a strong role for ecological data and theory, but also believe that much closer collaboration with social and earth system scientists is essential if ecology is to have a strong bearing on policy makers.

AB The silicified bipartite cell walls of diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) are produced in intracellular compartments by precipitation from supersaturated Si(OH)(4) and are then externalized. Fossil evidence of silicification is for marine, probably neritic, centric diatoms from approx. 120 Mya. Regardless of the initial selective significance of silicification, and of other current roles of silicification, the increased density resulting from silicification increases the sinking rate of cells; this can be partly or wholly offset by regulation of the protoplast solute content. Acclimatory and regulatory changes in silicification (relatively slow), and intracellular solute composition (relatively rapid), and intracellular solute composition (relatively rapid) of marine diatoms alter cell density over periods of hours to days. Density changes via changes in resource supply and, probably, parasitism, would move cells into optimal resource supply conditions, and remove parasitized, infective cells from surface populations of uninfected cells. Regulation of sinking rate could have been the first function of external or internal silica if the earliest silicified diatoms were planktonic.

AB Several studies pointed out soil properties as the prime determinant of cerrado (the Brazilian savanna) physiognomies, and a gradient from "campo cerrado" (a shrub savanna) to "cerradao" (a tall woodland) has been correlated with a soil fertility gradient. Based on this hypothesis, we investigated soil-vegetation relationships in the Pe-de-Gigante Reserve (Sao Paulo State, Southeastern Brazil). We randomly distributed 10 quadrats (10 x 10 m) on each of the following physiognomies: "campo cerrado", "cerrado sensu stricto", "cerradao", and seasonal semideciduous forest, previously defined by the analysis of satellite images (LANDSAT-5). We sampled the woody individuals with stem diameter > 3 cm at soil level, identifying their species. In each quadrat, we collected soil samples at the depths of 0-5, 5-25, 40-60, and 80-100 cm, and determined pH, K, Ca, Mg, P, Al, H + Al, base saturation, aluminium saturation, cation exchange capacity, and percentage of sand, clay and loam. Obtained data were submitted to a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and to a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA). Our results showed a clear distinction between semideciduous forest and the cerrado physiognomies, based in soil parameters. The former was related to higher concentrations of cations and clay in the soil, while the latter was related to higher concentrations of exchangeable aluminium in the soil surface. The three cerrado physiognomies - "campo cerrado", "cerrado sensu stricto", and "cerradao" - could not be distinguished considering plant density and the analysed soil features.

AB 1 Freshwater habitats in cultivated and densely populated lowland regions of Europe have experienced profound changes during the last 100 years. We take advantage of the long interest in aquatic plants in Denmark to compare the submerged flora in lakes and streams in 1896 and 1996.
   2 Most of the lakes which contained a diverse submerged vegetation 100 years ago now have the high phytoplankton biomasses and summer transparencies below 2.0 m characteristic of eutrophication. The majority of 17 lakes included in both old and recent studies have lost all or most of their submerged species. Species richness for those lakes that were vegetated did not, however, differ significantly between old and recent studies.
   3 Species richness declined markedly in the 13 streams included in both studies. Over all sites, there was also a significant decline of species richness per locality. Potamogeton species declined from 16 to 9, despite an 8-fold increase in the number of sites surveyed.
   4 Similar compositions and rank-abundances of Potamogeton species in lakes and streams studied 100 years ago reflect suitable growth conditions and mutual exchange of propagules. Today, low habitat diversity and frequent disturbance in streams and low recruitment from lakes favours only robust, fast-growing species capable of regrowth following weed cutting and dredging.
   5 A positive interspecific relationship observed in the contemporary stream vegetation between mean local abundance and number of occupied sites was probably promoted by redistribution of plants as a result of disturbance and efficient dispersal in the interconnected stream network.
   6 The freshwater macrophyte flora in north-west Europe presently includes a high proportion of rare species which are threatened by extinction. Both species typical for oligotrophic conditions (e.g. P. filiformis and P. polygonifolius) and another group of large, slow-growing species (e.g. P. alpinus, P. lucens, P. praelongus and P. zosterifolius), were once common but are now infrequent, while other transient species have remained rare (e.g. P, acutifolius, P. colouratus, P. densus and P. rutilus). The presence of many species that barely survive in small and distant populations will make re-assembly of submerged aquatic communities difficult.

AB Bird community response to both landscape-scale and local (forest types) changes in forest cover was studied in three boreal mixed-wood forest landscapes modified by different types of disturbances: (1) a pre-industrial landscape where human settlement, agriculture, and logging activities date back to the early 1930s, (2) an industrial timber managed forest, and (3) a forest dominated by natural disturbances. Birds were sampled at 459 sampling stations distributed among the three landscapes. Local habitat and landscape characteristics of the context surrounding each sampling station (500-m and 1-km radius) were also computed. Bird communities were influenced by landscape-scale changes in forest cover. The higher proportion of early-successional habitats in both human-disturbed landscapes resulted in significantly higher abundance of early-successional bird species and generalists. The mean number of mature forest bird species was significantly lower in the industrial and pre-industrial landscapes than in the natural landscape. Landscape-scale conversion of mature forests from mixed-wood to deciduous cover in human-disturbed landscapes was the main cause of changes in mature forest bird communities. In these landscapes, the abundance of species associated with mixed and coniferous forest cover was lower, whereas species that preferred a deciduous cover were more abundant. Variation in bird community composition determined by the landscape context was as important as local habitat conditions, suggesting that predictions on the regional impact of forest management on songbirds with models solely based on local scale factors could be misleading. Patterns of bird species composition were related to several landscape composition variables (proportions of forest types), but not to configuration variables (e.g., interior habitat, amount of edge). Overall, our results indicated that the large-scale conversion of the southern portion of the boreal forest from a mined to a deciduous cover may be one of the most important threats to the integrity of bird communities in these forest mosaics. Negative effects of changes in bird communities could be attenuated if current forestry practices are modified toward maintaining forest types (deciduous, mixed-wood, and coniferous) at levels similar to those observed under natural disturbances.

AB We develop statistical methods appropriate for the analysis of spatially structured population data. The methods are used to study the structure and dynamics of a four-species annual plant guild recorded in 1,000 permanent squares over a 10-yr period. We parameterize models that predict population density from one year to the next. In agreement with theoretical expectation all the models have locally stable equilibria, and overcompensation is rare. We demonstrate that interspecific interactions are extremely weak, relative to intraspecific ones, and that the spatial arrangement of species and individuals within them is critical to the observed dynamics. The impact of spatial density-dependent population growth on observed densities was calculated. In 52% of the cases population size would have been increased by at least a factor of 1.5 had there been no interactions between individuals, and in 9% of these it would have increased by a factor of four or more. This effect is shown to be largely a result of intraspecific interactions. We discuss possible explanations for the weakness of interspecific interactions.

AB Neonicotinoid insecticides have become the fastest growing class of insecticides over the past few decades. The insecticidal activity of neonicotinoids is attributed to their agonist action on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Because of the special selective action on nAChRs in central nervous system of insects, and versatility in application methods, neonicotinoids are used to protect crops and pets from insect attacks globally. Although neonicotinoids are considered low toxicity to mammals and humans in comparison with traditional insecticides, more and more studies show exposure to neonicotinoids pose potential risk to mammals and even humans. In recent years, neonicotinoids and their metabolites have been successfully detected in various human biological samples. Meanwhile, many studies have focused on the health effects of neonicotinoids on humans. Our aims here are to review studies on human neonicotinoid exposure levels, health effect, evaluation of potential toxicity and to suggest possible directions for future research.

AB Decline of ecosystem services has triggered numerous studies aiming at developing more sustainable agricultural management practices. Some agricultural practices may improve soil properties by expanding plant biodiversity. However, sustainable management of agroecosystems should be performed from a functional plant trait perspective. Advances in functional ecology, especially plant functional trait effects on ecosystem processes and services, provide pivotal knowledge for ecological intensification of agriculture; this approach acknowledges that a crop field is an agroecosystem whose ecological processes influence soil properties. We highlight the links between plant functional traits and soil properties in relation to four major ecosystem processes involved in vital ecosystem services: food production, crop protection, climate change mitigation, and soil and water conservation, aiming towards ecological intensification of sustainable agricultural and soil management.

AB Recent studies have provided an unprecedented view of the microbial communities colonizing captive mice; yet the host and environmental factors that shape the rodent gut microbiota in their natural habitat remain largely unexplored. Here, we present results from a 2-year 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing-based survey of wild wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) in two nearby woodlands. Similar to other mammals, wild mice were colonized by 10 bacterial phyla and dominated by the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Within the Firmicutes, the Lactobacillus genus was most abundant. Putative bacterial pathogens were widespread and often abundant members of the wild mouse gut microbiota. Among a suite of extrinsic (environmental) and intrinsic (host-related) factors examined, seasonal changes dominated in driving qualitative and quantitative differences in the gut microbiota. In both years examined, we observed a strong seasonal shift in gut microbial community structure, potentially due to the transition from an insect-to a seed-based diet. This involved decreased levels of Lactobacillus, and increased levels of Alistipes (Bacteroidetes phylum) and Helicobacter. We also detected more subtle but statistically significant associations between the gut microbiota and biogeography, sex, reproductive status and co-colonization with enteric nematodes. These results suggest that environmental factors have a major role in shaping temporal variations in microbial community structure within natural populations.

AB Developmental stressors often have long-term fitness consequences, but linking offspring traits to fitness prospects has remained a challenge. Telomere length predicts mortality in adult birds, and may provide a link between developmental conditions and fitness prospects. Here, we examine the effects of manipulated brood size on growth, telomere dynamics and post-fledging survival in free-living jackdaws. Nestlings in enlarged broods achieved lower mass and lost 21% more telomere repeats relative to nestlings in reduced broods, showing that developmental stress accelerates telomere shortening. Adult telomere length was positively correlated with their telomere length as nestling (r = 0.83). Thus, an advantage of long telomeres in nestlings is carried through to adulthood. Nestling telomere shortening predicted post-fledging survival and recruitment independent of manipulation and fledgling mass. This effect was strong, with a threefold difference in recruitment probability over the telomere shortening range. By contrast, absolute telomere length was neither affected by brood size manipulation nor related to survival. We conclude that telomere loss, but not absolute telomere length, links developmental conditions to subsequent survival and suggest that telomere shortening may provide a key to unravelling the physiological causes of developmental effects on fitness.

AB Vegetation change is expected with global climate change, potentially altering ecosystem function and climate feedbacks. However, causes of plant mortality, which are central to vegetation change, are understudied, and physiological mechanisms remain unclear, particularly the roles of carbon metabolism and xylem function. We report analysis of foliar nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) and associated physiology from a previous experiment where earlier drought-induced mortality of Pinus edulis at elevated temperatures was associated with greater cumulative respiration. Here, we predicted faster NSC decline for warmed trees than for ambient-temperature trees. Foliar NSC in droughted trees declined by 30% through mortality and was lower than in watered controls. NSC decline resulted primarily from decreased sugar concentrations. Starch initially declined, and then increased above pre-drought concentrations before mortality. Although temperature did not affect NSC and sugar, starch concentrations ceased declining and increased earlier with higher temperatures. Reduced foliar NSC during lethal drought indicates a carbon metabolism role in mortality mechanism. Although carbohydrates were not completely exhausted at mortality, temperature differences in starch accumulation timing suggest that carbon metabolism changes are associated with time to death. Drought mortality appears to be related to temperature-dependent carbon dynamics concurrent with increasing hydraulic stress in P.edulis and potentially other similar species.

AB The processes and mechanisms of community assembly and its relationships to community functioning are central issues in ecology. Both deterministic and stochastic factors play important roles in shaping community composition and structure, but the connection between community assembly and ecosystem functioning remains elusive, especially in microbial communities. Here, we used microbial electrolysis cell reactors as a model system to examine the roles of stochastic assembly in determining microbial community structure and functions. Under identical environmental conditions with the same source community, ecological drift (i.e., initial stochastic colonization) and subsequent biotic interactions created dramatically different communities with little overlap among 14 identical reactors, indicating that stochastic assembly played dominant roles in determining microbial community structure. Neutral community modeling analysis revealed that deterministic factors also played significant roles in shaping microbial community structure in these reactors. Most importantly, the newly formed communities differed substantially in community functions (e.g., H-2 production), which showed strong linkages to community structure. This study is the first to demonstrate that stochastic assembly plays a dominant role in determining not only community structure but also ecosystem functions. Elucidating the links among community assembly, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning is critical to understanding ecosystem functioning, biodiversity preservation, and ecosystem management.
   IMPORTANCE Microorganisms are the most diverse group of life known on earth. Although it is well documented that microbial natural biodiversity is extremely high, it is not clear why such high diversity is generated and maintained. Numerous studies have established the roles of niche-based deterministic factors (e.g., pH, temperature, and salt) in shaping microbial biodiversity, the importance of stochastic processes in generating microbial biodiversity is rarely appreciated. Moreover, while microorganisms mediate many ecosystem processes, the relationship between microbial diversity and ecosystem functioning remains largely elusive. Using a well-controlled laboratory system, this study provides empirical support for the dominant role of stochastic assembly in creating variations of microbial diversity and the first explicit evidence for the critical role of community assembly in influencing ecosystem functioning. The results presented in this study represent important contributions to the understanding of the mechanisms, especially stochastic processes, involved in shaping microbial biodiversity.

AB Biodiversity is increasingly subjected to human-induced changes of the environment. To persist, populations continually have to adapt to these often stressful changes including pollution and climate change. Genetic erosion in small populations, owing to fragmentation of natural habitats, is expected to obstruct such adaptive responses: (i) genetic drift will cause a decrease in the level of adaptive genetic variation, thereby limiting evolutionary responses; (ii) inbreeding and the concomitant inbreeding depression will reduce individual fitness and, consequently, the tolerance of populations to environmental stress. Importantly, inbreeding generally increases the sensitivity of a population to stress, thereby increasing the amount of inbreeding depression. As adaptation to stress is most often accompanied by increased mortality (cost of selection), the increase in the cost of inbreeding under stress is expected to severely hamper evolutionary adaptive processes. Inbreeding thus plays a pivotal role in this process and is expected to limit the probability of genetically eroded populations to successfully adapt to stressful environmental conditions. Consequently, the dynamics of small fragmented populations may differ considerably from large nonfragmented populations. The resilience of fragmented populations to changing and deteriorating environments is expected to be greatly decreased. Alleviating inbreeding depression, therefore, is crucial to ensure population persistence.

AB Anthropogenic CO2 is accumulating in the atmosphere and trapping reflected infrared radiation, resulting in warming of both terrestrial and ocean ecosystems. At the same time, the dissolution of CO2 into seawater is increasing surface ocean acidity, a process known as ocean acidification. Effects of ocean acidification on marine primary producers have been documented to be stimulative, inhibitive, or neutral. Elevated CO2 and reduced pH levels can interact with solar radiation, which fluctuates over different time scales from limiting to saturating or even stressful levels, to bring about synergistic, antagonistic, or balanced effects on marine primary producers at different depths or under changing weather conditions. However, shoaling of the upper mixed layer (enhanced stratification) due to ocean warming and freshening (rain, ice melting) can lead to additional photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and ultraviolet (UV) exposure, which can have both benefits and costs to photosynthetic organisms. Elevated CO2 concentrations under low or moderate levels of PAR have been shown to enhance photosynthesis or growth of both phytoplankton and macroalgae; excessive levels of PAR, however, can lead to additional inhibition of photosynthesis or growth under elevated CO2, and addition of UV radiation (280 to 400 nm) can increase or down-regulate such inhibition, since solar UV-B (280 to 315 nm) radiation often harms algal cells, while UV-A (315 to 400 nm) at moderate levels stimulates photosynthetic carbon fixation in both phytoplankton and macroalgae. In view of warming effects, increased temperatures have been shown to enhance photorepair of UV-damaged molecules, though it simultaneously enhances respiratory carbon loss. The net effects of ocean acidification on marine primary producers are therefore largely dependent on the photobiological conditions (light limitation, light or UV stress), as well as interactions with rising temperature and other variables such as altered nutrient availability. Hence, feedbacks between changing carbonate chemistry and solar radiation across the entire spectrum present complications to interpret and understand ocean acidification effects based on single-factor experiments.

AB A growing body of empirical evidence suggests that the temporal stability of communities typically increases with diversity. The counterview to this is that dominant species, rather than diversity itself, might regulate temporal stability. However, empirical studies that have explicitly examined the relative importance of diversity and dominant species in maintaining community stability have yielded few clear-cut patterns. Here, using a long-term data set, we examined the relative importance of changes in diversity components and dominance hierarchy following the removal of a dominant C4 grass, Bouteloua gracilis, in stabilizing plant communities. We also examined the relationships between the variables of diversity and dominance hierarchy and the statistical components of temporal stability. We found a significant negative relationship between temporal stability and species richness, number of rare species, and relative abundance of rare species, whereas a significant positive relationship existed between temporal stability and relative abundance of the dominant species. Variances and covariances summed over all species significantly increased with increasing species richness, whereas they significantly decreased with increasing relative abundance of dominant species. We showed that temporal stability in a shortgrass steppe plant community was controlled by dominant species rather than by diversity itself. The generality of diversity-stability relationships might be restricted by the dynamics of dominant species, especially when they have characteristics that contribute to stability in highly stochastic systems. A clear implication is that dominance hierarchies and their changes might be among the most important ecological components to consider in managing communities to maintain ecosystem functioning.

AB In cities with intense low-frequency traffic noise, birds have been observed to sing louder and at a higher pitch. Several studies argue that higher song pitch is an adaptation to reduce masking from noise, and it has even been suggested that the song divergence between urban and nonurban songs might lead to reproductive isolation. Here we present models of signal transmission to compare the benefits of raised song amplitude and song pitch in terms of sound transmission. We chose two bird species that sing with higher pitch in urban areas, the great tit (Parus major) and the blackbird (Turdus merula). For both species, we calculated communication distances in response to different levels of urban noise and in their natural forest habitats. We found that an increase in vocal pitch increased communication distance only marginally. In contrast, vocal amplitude adjustments had a strong and significantly larger effect. Our results indicate that frequency changes of urban songs are not very effective in mitigating masking from traffic noise. Increased song pitch might not be an adaptation to reduce signal masking but a physiological side effect of singing at high amplitudes or an epiphenomenon of urbanization that is not related to signal transmission.

AB We explored impacts of climate change on the geographic distribution of European beech by applying state of the art statistical and process-based models, and assessed possible climate change impacts on both adaptive capacity in the centre of its distribution and adaptive responses of functional traits at the leading and trailing edge of the current distribution. The species area models agree that beech has the potential to expand its northern edge and loose habitat at the southern edge of its distribution in a future climate. The change in local population size in the centre of the distribution of beech has a small effect on the genetic diversity of beech, which is projected to maintain its current population size or to increase in population size. Thus, an adaptive response of functional traits of small populations at the leading and trailing edges of the distribution is possible based on genetic diversity available in the local population, even within a period of 2-3 generations.
   We conclude that the adaptive responses of key functional traits should not be ignored in climate change impact assessment on beech. Adaptation to the local environment may lead to genetic and phenotypic structured populations over the species area already in few generations, depending on the forest management system applied. We recommend taking local differentiation into account in a future generation of process-based species area models. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The distribution and composition of aquatic insect communities in streams at a local scale are considered to be primarily determined by environmental factors and interactive relationships within the system. Here, we evaluated the effects of forest fragmentation and forest cover changes on habitat characteristics of streamlets (igarapes) in Amazonian forests and on the aquatic insect communities found there. We also developed a habitat integrity index (HII) based on Petersen's protocol (1992) to evaluate physical integrity of these streamlets and to determine its efficiency to interpret the environmental impacts on this system. We studied 20 small streams at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP INPA/SI) study areas, Central Amazonia, 80 km north of Manaus, Amazonas State, Brazil. The vegetation cover was estimated by using LANDSAT images and classified in the following categories: exposed soil, pastures, secondary forests (capoeiras), and primary forests. Stream habitat features were evaluated by using a HII based on visual assessment of local characteristics. Aquatic insects were sampled in four major stream substrates: litter deposited in pools or backwaters, litter retained in riffles, sand, and marginal banks. Stream habitat characteristics were significantly correlated to land use and riparian forest condition. Overall aquatic insect richness and Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) richness were significantly lower in pasture streams, and their taxonomic composition differed significantly from streams in forested areas. However, these metrics were not significantly correlated to the stream HII. Taxonomic composition of bank insect assemblages changed significantly between streams with low and high values of HII. There was no significant relationship between the proportion of primary forest cover and the faunal metrics. Only drastic changes in the vegetal cover seem to induce significant changes in the aquatic insect community. Matrix habitat heterogeneity, distance to forest fragments, the presence of areas of secondary forest, and the intrinsic capacity to disperse in many of the insect groups may have contributed to attenuate the effects of habitat disturbance on aquatic insect assemblages in streamlets.

AB The global decline of coral reefs(1,2) highlights the need to understand the mechanisms that regulate community structure and sustain biodiversity in these systems. The neutral theory, which assumes that individuals are demographically identical regardless of species, seeks to explain ubiquitous features of community structure and biodiversity patterns(3-5). Here we present a test of neutral-theory predictions with the use of an extensive species-level data set of Indo-Pacific coral communities. We show that coral assemblages differ markedly from neutral-model predictions for patterns of community similarity and the relative abundance of species. Within local communities, neutral models do not fit relative abundance distributions as well as the classical log-normal distribution. Relative abundances of species across local communities also differ markedly from neutral-theory predictions: coral communities exhibit community similarity values that are far more variable, and lower on average, than the neutral theory can produce. Empirical community similarities deviate from the neutral model in a direction opposite to that predicted in previous critiques of the neutral theory(6-9). Instead, our results support spatio-temporal environmental stochasticity as a major driver of diversity patterns on coral reefs(10,11).

ID ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT; BEHAVIOR
AB The zoo scientific community was among the first to focus attention on captivity-induced stereotypic behaviors, their causes, and methods of eradication. Environmental enrichment has emerged recently as the main husbandry tool for tackling this problem. An increasing number of research publications have attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of enrichment in reducing stereotypic behavior and to develop further concepts to explain how effective enrichment works. A review and meta-analysis of this literature indicates that enrichment is a successful technique for reducing stereotypic behavior in zoo animals. Enrichment was associated with significant reduction in stereotypy performance about 53% of the time. Published enrichment and stereotypy research is lacking for most zoo species, with most studies on large, charismatic, and often endangered species, but it is unclear whether stereotypies are more prevalent in these species. In addition, problems with scientific methods and data presentation, quantitatively detailed in this work, severely limit the conclusions drawn from zoo research. Further understanding of what kinds or enrichment works and what doesn't will require greater attention to experimental design, sample size, statistical analysis, and better descriptions of enrichment properties and the form of stereotypy. We recommend that future studies focus on increasing sample size (e.g., through multi-institutional studies), appropriate repeated measures design (e.g., with multiple baseline and experimental phases), providing full statistical information about the behavioral changes observed (including standard error), and ultimately the development of a predictive science for enrichment, stereotypies, and wellbeing.

AB Speciation in animals is almost always envisioned as the split of an existing lineage into an ancestral and a derived species. An alternative speciation route is homoploid hybrid speciation(1) in which two ancestral taxa give rise to a third, derived, species by hybridization without a change in chromosome number. Although theoretically possible it has been regarded as rare(1) and hence of little importance in animals. On the basis of molecular and chromosomal evidence, hybridization is the best explanation for the origin of a handful of extant diploid bisexual animal taxa(2-6). Here we report the first case in which hybridization between two host-specific animals (tephritid fruitflies) is clearly associated with the shift to a new resource. Such a hybrid host shift presents an ecologically robust scenario for animal hybrid speciation because it offers a potential mechanism for reproductive isolation through differential adaptation to a new ecological niche(7). The necessary conditions for this mechanism of speciation(7) are common in parasitic animals, which represent much of animal diversity(8). The frequency of homoploid hybrid speciation in animals may therefore be higher than previously assumed.

AB A process-based crop growth model is developed to predict regional crop yield, water consumption and water use efficiency (WUE) using remotely sensed data for a portion of Hebei province (88 779 km(2)), most of which is located on the North China Plain (NCP). Model inputs consist of Geographic Information System (GIS) maps of land use, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), soil texture, crop canopy leaf area index (LAI) which is retrieved from the 10-day maximum composite National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data, and daily interpolated meteorological variables. The model is run at 92 367 30" x 30". resolution grids at an hourly time-step for energy balance and daily time-step for crop growth simulation. Simulated winter wheat and summer maize yields in 1992 and 1993 are compared with both the point samples and the county-level census data. For the 108 counties, the root mean square error (relative deviation) is 1124 kg ha(-1) (23%) for winter wheat and 1359 kg ha(-1) (33%) for summer maize, respectively. Spatial patterns of simulated crop yield and water use efficiency are strongly influenced by irrigated/rainfed conditions. The modelled grain yield for irrigated winter wheat ranges from 3900 to 7200 kg ha(-1), which is significantly larger than when only rainfed, 100-2600 kg ha(-1). The modelled grain yield for irrigated maize ranges from 5800 to 8600 kg ha(-1), which is significantly larger than when only rainfed, 1400-4800 kg ha(-1). This suggests that the potential exists to increase yield in this region, if sufficient irrigation water is supplied. However, given the over allocation of limited surface water, an increase in irrigation is unlikely, and increasing importance will be placed on maximizing regional WUE over the NCP. The water consumption (defined here as modelled evapotranspiration (ET)) for winter wheat ranges from 330 to 500 and 70 to 280 mm for irrigated and rainfed conditions, respectively. The modelled ET for irrigated maize ranges from 350 to 520, and 140 to 350 mm for rainfed conditions. The simulated WUE ranges from 12.25 to 15.75 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) for irrigated winter wheat and from 0.5 to 8.25 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) in rainfed areas. The simulated WUE ranges from 11 to 19.25 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) for irrigated maize and from 5 to 11 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) in rainfed areas. These, together with the results of simulated crop yields, are comparable with previous studies in the NCP, other parts of China, and internationally, indicating the potential to apply this model to other agricultural regions. This study implicates a new view for regional agricultural and water resources management by assessing regional crop yield, water consumption and WUE consistently based on modelling biophysical processes with the aid of remote sensing.

AB We investigated the distribution of genetic variation within and between seven subpopulations in a riparian population of Silene tatarica in northern Finland by using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. A Bayesian approach-based clustering program indicated that the marker data contained not only one panmictic population, but consisted of seven clusters, and that each original sample site seems to consist of a distinct subpopulation. A coalescent-based simulation approach shows recurrent gene flow between subpopulations. Relative high F (ST) values indicated a clear subpopulation differentiation. However, amova analysis and UPGMA-dendrogram did not suggest any hierarchical regional structuring among the subpopulations. There was no correlation between geographical and genetic distances among the subpopulations, nor any correlation between the subpopulation census size and amount of genetic variation. Estimates of gene flow suggested a low level of gene flow between the subpopulations, and the assignment tests proposed a few long-distance bidirectional dispersal events between the subpopulations. No apparent difference was found in within-subpopulation genetic diversity among upper, middle and lower regions along the river. Relative high amounts of linkage disequilibrium at subpopulation level indicated recent population bottlenecks or admixture, and at metapopulation levels a high subpopulation turnover rate. The overall pattern of genetic variation within and between subpopulations also suggested a 'classical' metapopulation structure of the species suggested by the ecological surveys.

AB 1. We examined data on soft-sediment macrobenthos (organisms retained on a 1-mm, sieve) from a transect of c. 1960 km along the Norwegian continental shelf (56-71degreesN), covering a range of water depths (65-434 m) and varying sediment properties.
   2. A total of 809 species was recorded from 101 sites. Of these, 36% were restricted to one or two sites, and 29% were represented by one or two individuals. No species spanned the entire transect. Polychaetes were the dominant taxonomic group, followed by crustaceans, molluscs and echinoderms.
   3. Alpha diversity (sample species richness) was highly variable (35-148 species) but showed no evidence of a relationship to latitude or other environmental variables.
   4. Beta diversity was measured as Whittaker's beta(W), the number of shared species, complementarity (biotic distinctness) and Bray-Curtis similarity, and there was no evidence of a latitudinal trend on the shelf. Beta diversity increased with the level of environmental variability, and was highest in the southern-central area, followed by the most northern area. Change in environmental variables had a stronger effect on beta diversity than spatial distance between sites.
   5. Gamma diversity was computed by pooling samples over large areas. There was no convincing evidence of a latitudinal cline in gamma diversity, but gamma diversity increased with the level of environmental heterogeneity. Mean alpha diversity and gamma diversity were not significantly correlated. Whereas mean complementarity and mean Bray-Curtis similarity were related to gamma diversity, beta(w) was not.

AB Environmental policies increasingly focus on the enhancement of ecological functions across large geographical areas and thus call for biomonitoring tools that assess these functions at large spatial scales. A potential answer to this call would be to use general biological traits of organisms that indicate ecological functions, as such traits will be comparable among communities even across biogeographic regions that differ in their taxonomic composition. Here, we used benthic invertebrates and European running waters as example to illustrate how multiple biological traits could provide a measure for the large-scale biomonitoring of the functional composition of communities. Our measure considered the relative abundance of 63 categories of 11 biological traits (such as size, reproductive and dispersal potential, food and feeding habits) that indicate various ecological functions. Comparing this measure for 10 most natural French reference regions with 37 other most natural regions/stream types scattered across Europe demonstrated an extremely high spatial and temporal stability of the functional composition of natural invertebrate communities at the European scale. Thus, our functional measure corresponds to a fundamental standard for a large-scale biomonitoring tool, which is the stable and reliable indication of the natural reference state across ecoregions that differ more or less in their taxonomic composition. Applying our functional measure to regulated stream sites below dams (in England, Finland and Spain) and to streams receiving sewage inputs (in Wales, Poland and Sardinia) demonstrated highly significant (p < 10(-6)) differences in the functional composition between the human-impacted and the natural reference communities. In addition, some of the trait categories responded in a consistently contrasting way to each of the two types (regulation, sewage) of human impact. Consequently, our measure for the functional composition of invertebrate communities provides a first unified European baseline for future stream and river management: it was stable in the most natural but otherwise very different running water types across Europe, it safely indicated human impact, and it could potentially discriminate specific types of human disturbances. As all living organisms have multiple biological traits, our approach could serve to generate, for other types of communities and ecosystems, a set of large-scale biomonitoring tools that use similar and perhaps even comparable measures for the functional community composition.

AB Engaging local stakeholders is a central feature of many biodiversity conservation and natural resource management projects globally. Current literature on engagement predominantly focuses on individual case studies or specific geographical contexts, making general conclusions regarding the effect of these efforts on conservation outcomes difficult. We reviewed evidence from the peer-reviewed and grey literatures related to the role of stakeholder engagement (both externally-driven and self-organized engagement) in biodiversity conservation at the local scale using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. We critically appraised and extracted data using mixed methods for case studies (n = 82) and meta-analyses (n = 31) published from 2011 to 2015. We conducted an inductive thematic analysis on background literature references published from 2000 to 2016 (n = 283). The quantitative analysis assessed multiple variables, and yielded no significant results, but suggested a possible relationship between success in producing attitudinal change towards conservation and four engagement factors. Our qualitative analysis identified six dimensions of engagement processes that are critical for successful outcomes when a project is externally-driven, and suggests that understanding of governance and social-cultural context plays an important role in all types of stakeholder engagement efforts. Finally, we reflect on the effectiveness of relying primarily on evidence available from published literature to understand links between conservation and stakeholder engagement, in particular with regard to self-organized engagement.

AB Crowdsourcing is traditionally defined as obtaining data or information by enlisting the services of a (potentially large) number of people. However, due to recent innovations, this definition can now be expanded to include and/or from a range of public sensors, typically connected via the Internet.' A large and increasing amount of data is now being obtained from a huge variety of non-traditional sources-from smart phone sensors to amateur weather stations to canvassing members of the public. Some disciplines (e.g. astrophysics, ecology) are already utilizing crowdsourcing techniques (e.g. citizen science initiatives, web 2.0 technology, low-cost sensors), and while its value within the climate and atmospheric science disciplines is still relatively unexplored, it is beginning to show promise. However, important questions remain; this paper introduces and explores the wide-range of current and prospective methods to crowdsource atmospheric data, investigates the quality of such data and examines its potential applications in the context of weather, climate and society. It is clear that crowdsourcing is already a valuable tool for engaging the public, and if appropriate validation and quality control procedures are adopted and implemented, it has much potential to provide a valuable source of high temporal and spatial resolution, real-time data, especially in regions where few observations currently exist, thereby adding value to science, technology and society.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key component of terrestrial ecosystems because it links the hydrological, energy, and carbon cycles. Several satellite-based ET models have been developed for extrapolating local observations to regional and global scales, but recent studies have shown large model uncertainties in ET simulations. In this study, we compared eight ET models, including five empirical and three process-based models, with the objective of providing a reference for choosing and improving methods. The results showed that the eight models explained between 61 and 80% of the variability in ET at 23 eddy covariance towers in China and adjacent regions. The mean annual ET for all of China varied from 535 to 852 mm yr(-1) among the models. The interannual variability of yearly ET varied significantly between models during 1982-2009 because of different model structures and the dominant environmental factors employed. Our evaluation results showed that the parameters of the empirical methods may have different combination because the environmental factors of ET are not independent. Although the three process-based models showed high model performance across the validation Sites, there were substantial differences among them in the temporal and spatial patterns of ET, the dominant environment factors and the energy partitioning schemes. The disagreement among current ET models highlights the need for further improvements and validation, which can be achieved by investigating model structures and examining the ET component estimates and the critical model parameters.

AB There is high uncertainty surrounding the magnitude of current and future biodiversity loss that is occurring due to human disturbances. Here, we present a global meta-analysis of experimental and observational studies that report 327 measures of change in species richness between disturbed and undisturbed habitats across both terrestrial and aquatic biomes. On average, human-mediated disturbances lead to an 18.3% decline in species richness. Declines in species richness were highest for endotherms (33.2%), followed by producers (25.1%), and ectotherms (10.5%). Land-use change and species invasions had the largest impact on species richness resulting in a 24.8% and 23.7% decline, respectively, followed by habitat loss (14%), nutrient addition (8.2%), and increases in temperature (3.6%). Across all disturbances, declines in species richness were greater for terrestrial biomes (22.4%) than aquatic biomes (5.9%). In the tropics, habitat loss and land-use change had the largest impact on species richness, whereas in the boreal forest and Northern temperate forests, species invasions had the largest impact on species richness. Along with revealing trends in changes in species richness for different disturbances, biomes, and taxa, our results also identify critical knowledge gaps for predicting the effects of human disturbance on Earth's biomes.

ID MEDICAL MARIJUANA; DEPRESSION
AB Background: The authorized and unauthorized use of cannabis for therapeutic purposes (CTP) has increased dramatically in recent years, and physicians have called for further research to better clarify the parameters of effective and appropriate use. We report findings from a large cross-sectional study of the use of CTP in Canada and compare use across medical conditions and across authorized and unauthorized users.
   Methods: We examined cannabis use history, medical conditions and symptoms, patterns of current use of CTP, modes of access and perceived effectiveness among 628 self-selected Canadians consumers of CTP. Participants were recruited from medical cannabis dispensaries and from organizations that assist users of CTP.
   Results: Patients reported using cannabis to treat multiple symptoms, with sleep, pain, and anxiety being the most common. Cannabis was perceived to provide effective symptoms relief across medical conditions. Patterns of use were also consistent across medical conditions. Notable differences were observed with regard to modes of access.
   Conclusion: Across medical conditions respondents reported using cannabis to effectively address diverse symptoms. Results indicate a substantial disconnect between the therapeutic use of cannabis and research on the risks and benefits of such use; particularly with regard to the anxiolytic and sedative use of cannabis. Authorized and unauthorized users exhibited few meaningful differences with regard to medical conditions and patterns of use, but faced substantial differences regarding access.

AB Bacterial and fungal communities associated with plant roots are central to the host health, survival and growth. However, a robust understanding of the root-microbiome and the factors that drive host associated microbial community structure have remained elusive, especially in mature perennial plants from natural settings. Here, we investigated relationships of bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere and root endosphere of the riparian tree species Populus deltoides, and the influence of soil parameters, environmental properties (host phenotype and aboveground environmental settings), host plant genotype (Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers), season (Spring vs. Fall) and geographic setting (at scales from regional watersheds to local riparian zones) on microbial community structure. Each of the trees sampled displayed unique aspects to its associated community structure with high numbers of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) specific to an individual trees (bacteria >90%, fungi >60%). Over the diverse conditions surveyed only a small number of OTUs were common to all samples within rhizosphere (35 bacterial and 4 fungal) and endosphere (1 bacterial and 1 fungal) microbiomes. As expected, Proteobacteria and Ascomycota were dominant in root communities (>50%) while other higher-level phylogenetic groups (Chytridiomycota, Acidobacteria) displayed greatly reduced abundance in endosphere compared to the rhizosphere. Variance partitioning partially explained differences in microbiome composition between all sampled roots on the basis of seasonal and soil properties (4% to 23%). While most variation remains unattributed, we observed significant differences in the microbiota between watersheds (Tennessee vs. North Carolina) and seasons (Spring vs. Fall). SSR markers clearly delineated two host populations associated with the samples taken in TN vs. NC, but overall host genotypic distances did not have a significant effect on corresponding communities that could be separated from other measured effects.

AB Ecosystem services research has been focused on the ways that humans directly benefit from goods and services, and economic valuation techniques have been used to measure those benefits. We argue that, although it is appropriate in some cases, this focus on direct use and economic quantification is often limiting and can detract from environmental research and effective management, in part by crowding out other understandings of human-environment relationships. Instead, we make the case that the systematic consideration of multiple metaphors of such relationships in assessing social-ecological systems will foster better understanding of the many ways in which humans relate to, care for, and value ecosystems. Where it is possible, we encourage a deliberative approach to ecosystem management whereby ecosystem researchers actively engage conservationists and local resource users to make explicit, through open deliberation, the types of metaphors salient to their conservation problem.

AB We present a model of diverse phytoplankton and zooplankton populations embedded in a global ocean circulation model. Physiological and ecological traits of the organisms are constrained by relationships with cell size. The model qualitatively reproduces global distributions of nutrients, biomass, and primary productivity, and captures the power-law relationship between cell size and numerical density, which has realistic slopes of between -1.3 and -0.8. We use the model to explore the global structure of marine ecosystems, highlighting the importance of both nutrient and grazer controls. The model suggests that zooplankton : phytoplankton (Z : P) biomass ratios may vary from an order of 0.1 in the oligotrophic gyres to an order of 10 in upwelling and high-latitude regions. Global estimates of the strength of bottom-up and top-down controls within plankton size classes suggest that these large-scale gradients in Z : P ratios are driven by a shift from strong bottom-up, nutrient limitation in the oligotrophic gyres to the dominance of top-down, grazing controls in more productive regions.

AB Predators are increasingly recognized as key elements in food webs because of their ability to link the fluxes of nutrients and energy between spatially separated food chains. However, in the context of food web connectivity, predator populations have been mainly treated as homogeneous units, despite compelling evidence of individual specialization in resource use. It is conceivable that individuals of a predatory species use different resources associated with spatially separated food chains, thereby decoupling cross-habitat linkages. We tested whether intrapopulation differences in habitat use in the generalist freshwater predator Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) led to long-term niche partitioning and affected the degree of ecological habitat coupling. We evaluated trophic niche variability at successively larger timescales by analyzing gut contents and stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in liver and muscle, tissues that provide successively longer integration of trophic activity. We found that the use of distinct habitats in perch led to intrapopulation niche partitioning between pelagic and littoral subpopulations, consistent through the various timescales. Pelagic fish showed a narrower niche, lower individual specialization, and more stable trophic behavior than littoral fish, as could be expected from inhabiting a relatively less diverse environment. This result indicated that substantial niche reduction could occur in a generalist predator at the subpopulation level, consistent with the use of a habitat that provides fewer chances of individual specialization. We showed that intrapopulation niche partitioning limits the ability of individual predators to link spatially separated food chains. In addition, we suggest a quantitative, standardized approach based on stable isotopes to measure the degree of habitat coupling mediated by a top predator.

AB A prominent interspecific pattern of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is Rensch's rule, according to which male body size is more variable or evolutionarily divergent than female body size. Assuming equal growth rates of males and females, SSD would be entirely mediated, and Rensch's rule proximately caused, by sexual differences in development times, or sexual bimaturism (SBM), with the larger sex developing for a proportionately longer time. Only a subset of the seven arthropod groups investigated in this study exhibits Rensch's rule. Furthermore, we found only a weak positive relationship between SSD and SBM overall, suggesting that growth rate differences between the sexes are more important than development time differences in proximately mediating SSD in a wide but by no means comprehensive range of arthropod taxa. Except when protandry is of selective advantage ( as in many butterflies, Hymenoptera, and spiders), male development time was equal to ( in water striders and beetles) or even longer than ( in drosophilid and sepsid flies) that of females. Because all taxa show female-biased SSD, this implies faster growth of females in general, a pattern markedly different from that of primates and birds (analyzed here for comparison). We discuss three potential explanations for this pattern based on life-history trade-offs and sexual selection.

AB Aim We present an analysis of grid-based species-richness data for European plants, mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles, designed to test the proposition of Hawkins et al. (2003a) that the single best factor describing richness variation switches from the water regime to the energy regime in the mid-latitudes and that the 'breakpoint' is related to the physiological character of the taxa. We go on to develop subregional models showing the extent to which regional model fits vary as a function of the extent of the study system, and compare the relative performance of 'water', 'energy' and 'water-energy' models of richness for southern, northern and pan-European models.
   Location Western Europe.
   Methods We use atlas data comprising species range data for 187 species of mammals, 445 species of breeding birds, 58 amphibians, 91 reptiles and 2362 plant species, inserted into a c. 50 x 50 km grid cell system. We used 11 modelled climate variables, averaged for the period 1961-90. Statistical analyses were carried out using generalized additive models (GAMs), with splines simplified to a maximum of four degrees of freedom, and we tested for spatial autocorrelation using Moran's I values obtained at 10 different distance intervals. We selected favoured models on the grounds of deviance explained combined with a simple parsimony criterion, such that we selected either: (1) the best two-variable energy, water or water-energy model, or (2) a four-variable water-energy model, where the latter improved on the best two-variable model by a minimum of 5% deviance explained.
   Results Threshold energy values, at which richness shows a transition from an increasing to a decreasing function of annual solar radiation, were identified for all taxa apart from reptiles. We found conditional support for the switch from dominance of water variables (southern models) to energy variables (northern models). Our favoured models switched between 'water' and 'energy' for mammals, and between 'energy' and 'water-energy' for birds, depending on whether we used data of pan-European extent, southern or northern subsets. Deviance explained in our favoured models varied from 15% (birds, southern Europe) to 72% (amphibians, northern Europe), i.e. ranging from very poor to good fits with the data. Comparison with previous work indicates that our models are generally consistent with (if sometimes weaker than) previous findings.
   Main Conclusions Our models are incomplete representations of factors influencing macro-scale richness patterns across Europe, taking no explicit account of, for example, topographic variation, human influences or long-term climatic variation. However, with the exception of birds, for which only the northern model attains over one-third deviance explained, the models show that climate can account for meaningful proportions of the deviance. We find general support for considering water and energy regimes together in modelling species richness, and for the proposition that water is more limiting in southern Europe and energy in the north. Our analyses demonstrate the sensitivity of model outcomes to the geographical location and extent of the study system, illustrating that simple curve-fitting exercises like these, particularly if based on regions with the complex history and geography characteristic of Europe, are unlikely to provide the basis for global, predictive models. However, such exercises may be of value in detecting which aspects of water and energy regimes may be of most importance in refining independently generated global models for regional application.

AB Field experiments were carried out during three successive years to study through a dynamic approach the competition for soil N and its interaction with N-2 fixation, leaf expansion and crop growth in pea-barley intercrops. The intensity of competition for soil N varied between experiments according to soil N supply and plant densities. This study demonstrates the key role of competition for soil N which occurs early in the crop cycle and greatly influences the subsequent growth and final performance of both species. Relative yield values for grain yield and N accumulation increased with the intensity of competition for soil N. Barley competed strongly for soil N in the intercrop. Its competitive ability increased steadily during the vegetative phase and remained constant after the beginning of pea flowering. The period of strong competition for soil N (500-800 degree-days after sowing) also corresponded to the period of rapid growth in leaf area for both species and therefore an increasing N demand. For each species, the leaf area per plant at the beginning of pea flowering was well correlated with crop nitrogen status. Barley may meet its N needs more easily in intercrops (IC) and has greater leaf area per plant than in sole crops (SC). Barley having a greater soil N supply results in an even higher crop N status and greater competitive ability relative to pea in intercrop. Competition by barley for soil N increased the proportion of pea N derived from fixation. The nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) values of pea were close to 1 whatever the soil N availability in contrast to barley. However N-2 fixation started later than soil N uptake of pea and barley and was low when barley was very competitive for soil N. Due to the time necessary for the progressive development and activity of nodules, N-2 fixation could not completely satisfy N demand at the beginning of the crop cycle. The amount of N-2 fixed per plant in intercrops was not only a response to soil N availability but was largely determined by pea growth and was greatly affected when barley was too competitive.

AB Risk analysis for biological invasions is similar to other types of natural and human hazards. For example, risk analysis for chemical spills requires the evaluation of basic information on where a spill occurs; exposure level and toxicity of the chemical agent; knowledge of the physical processes involved in its rate and direction of spread; and potential impacts to the environment, economy, and human health relative to containment costs. Unlike typical chemical spills, biological invasions can have long lag times from introduction and establishment to successful invasion, they reproduce, and they can spread rapidly by physical and biological processes. We use a risk analysis framework to suggest a general strategy for risk analysis for invasive species and invaded habitats. It requires: (1) problem formation (scoping the problem, defining assessment endpoints); (2) analysis (information on species traits, matching species traits to suitable habitats, estimating exposure, surveys of current distribution and abundance); (3) risk characterization (understanding of data completeness, estimates of the "potential" distribution and abundance; estimates of the potential rate of spread; and probable risks, impacts, and costs); and (4) risk management (containment potential, costs, and opportunity costs; legal mandates and social considerations and information science and technology needs).

AB Predation by generalist predators is difficult to study in the field because of the complex effects of positive and negative interactions within and between predator species and guilds. Predation can be monitored by molecular means, through identification of prey DNA within predators. However, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of prey DNA from predators cannot discriminate between primary and secondary predation (hyperpredation), in which one predator feeds on another that has recently eaten the target prey. Here we quantify, for the first time, the potential error caused by detection of prey DNA following secondary predation, using an aphid-spider-carabid model. First, the aphid Sitobion avenae was fed to the spider Tenuiphantes tenuis and the carabid Pterostichus melanarius, and the postconsumption detection periods, for prey DNA within predators, were calculated. Aphids were then fed to spiders and the spiders to carabids. Aphid DNA was detected in the predators using primers that amplified 245- and 110-bp fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene. Fragment size and predator sex had no significant effect on detection periods. Secondary predation could be detected for up to 8 h, when carabids fed on spiders immediately after the latter had consumed aphids. Beetles tested positive up to 4 h after eating spiders that had digested their aphid prey for 4 h. Clearly, the extreme sensitivity of PCR makes detection of secondary predation more likely, and the only reliable answer in future may be to use PCR to identify, in parallel, instances of intraguild predation.

AB Alpine and arctic ecosystems may be particularly vulnerable to climate change. We know little about alpine plant community responses to the predicted abiotic changes, or to possible changes in the biotic environment caused by climate change. Four years of experimental warming and nutrient addition altered dominance hierarchies, community structure, and diversity of an alpine biodiversity hotspot in south Norway. The previously dominant dwarf shrub Dryas octopetala was replaced by graminoids and forbs under nutrient addition and warming with nutrients. Community diversity declined due to decreased bryophyte and lichen richness and abundances, and dwarf shrub abundances. In controls and in plots with only warming, where Dryas maintained dominance, the relationships between changes in Dryas cover and changes in community parameters were negative, suggesting that Dryas controls community processes. Under nutrient addition, bryophyte and lichen diversity decreased with decreasing Dryas cover, probably due to increased competition from graminoids and forbs. The shift in dominance hierarchies changed community structure and dynamics through increased biomass, vegetation height, and competition for light. Community diversity dropped primarily because changes in the abiotic environment modified biotic interactions, highlighting that species interaction must be considered in climate change experiments and in models predicting climate change effects.

AB DNA-based techniques are providing valuable new approaches to tracking predator-prey interactions. The gut contents of invertebrate predators can be analysed using species-specific primers to amplify prey DNA to confirm trophic links. The problem is that each predator needs to be analysed with primers for the tens of potential prey available at a field site, even though the mean number of species detected in each gut may be as few as one or two. Conducting all these PCRs (polymerase chain reactions) is a lengthy process, and effectively precludes the analysis of the hundreds of predators that might be required for a meaningful ecological study. We report a rapid, more sensitive and practical approach. Multiplex PCRs, incorporating fluorescent markers, were found to be effective at amplifying degraded DNA from predators' guts and could amplify mitochondrial DNA fragments from 10+ species simultaneously without 'drop outs'. The combined PCR products were then separated by size on polyacrylamide gels on an ABI377 sequencer. New primers to detect the remains of aphids, earthworms, weevils and molluscs in the guts of carabid predators were developed and characterized. The multiplex-sequencer approach was then applied to field-caught beetles, some of which contained DNA from as many as four different prey at once. The main prey detected in the beetles proved to be earthworms and molluscs, although aphids and weevils were also consumed. The potential of this system for use in food-web research is discussed.

AB Despite recent modelling approaches integrating the effects of niche-based processes and dispersal-based processes on local plant species composition, their relative importance is still not clear. We test whether the predictability of local species composition from environmental conditions is influenced by dispersal traits. We analyzed a large database with co-occurrence data, using ordination techniques (DCA and CCA) to identify the major environmental determinants of species composition. The percentage of explained variance in occurrence was quantified for individual species with CCA. Effects of life-history traits on the predictability of occurrence patterns were tested by means of regression analysis, using a generalized linear models approach. The results reveal close correlations between species composition and environmental conditions, implying that the predictability of the set of species that might occur in a given environmental setting ("habitat species pool") is high. The habitat species pool, however, reflects the potential species composition, and not the actual local situation. At the level of individual species, a large proportion (>90%) of the variation in occurrence remained unexplained. Predictability of species occurrence patterns was increased by a greater capacity for long-distance dispersal, greater adult longevity and the capacity to build a persistent seed bank. The results indicate that the predictability of species composition from environmental conditions is reduced by a few orders of magnitude by dispersal limitation and that poor dispersers are underrepresented.

AB The extent and diversity of sexual dichromatism in birds is thought to be due to the intensity of current sexual selection on the plumage ornamentation of males and females. This view leads to an expectation of concordance between ecological conditions and sexual dichromatism. Yet, because expression of dichromatism is the result of not only current selection, but also historical patterns of development, function, and selection, the concordance between ecology and current sexual dichromatism is not straightforward. Recent studies have revealed a number of trends in the evolution of avian sexual ornamentation that seem contrary to what is expected if current sexual selection is the primary force shaping dichromatism. For example, change in sexual dichromatism is often the result of evolutionary changes in female rather than male ornamentation. Moreover, sexual dichromatism is often an ancestral rather than a derived state; current expression of dichromatism is frequently the result of selection for lesser ornamentation in one sex and not for ornament elaboration. Loss and gain of sexual ornamentation sometimes precedes changes in preference for sexual ornamentation, and sexual ornaments can have high evolutionary lability despite their developmental and functional complexity. These findings emphasize that phylogenetic reconstructions must play a central role in attempts to understand the function and evolution of sexual dichromatism. With a historical perspective, one can test the relative importance of direct selection, indirect selection, and drift in relation to changes of sexual dichromatism. If sexual selection is invoked, the mechanisms of sexual selection can be explored by examining the concordance between the elaboration of ornamentation and the preferences for ornamentation across species and by tracing phylogenetic trajectories of sexual ornaments. Finally, placing physiological, genetic, and developmental mechanisms of sexual ornamentation into such a phylogenetic framework will enable greater inference about the past evolution and current function of sexual dichromatism in birds.

AB Variation within a species may be structured both geographically and by genetic background. We review the effects of such structuring on neutral variants, using a framework based on the coalescent process. Short-term effects of sex differences and age structure can be averaged out using fast timescale approximations, allowing a simple general treatment of effective population size and migration. We consider the effects of geographic structure on variation within and between local populations, first in general terms, and then for specific migration models. We discuss the close parallels between geographic structure and stable types of genetic structure caused by selection, including balancing selection and background selection. The effects of departures from stability, such as selective sweeps and population bottlenecks, are also described. Methods for distinguishing population history from the effects of ongoing gene flow are discussed. We relate the theoretical results to observed patterns of variation in natural populations.

AB Nest-site selection behavior is a maternal effect that contributes to offspring survival and variation in offspring phenotypes that are subject to natural selection. We investigated nest-site selection and its consequences in the snapping turtle, Chelydra serpentina, in northwestern Illinois. We evaluated nest-site selection at both the microhabitat and habitat patch levels. Turtles selected nest sites with shorter vegetation, more open sand. and fewer cacti than random locations. These microhabitat characteristics described sandy patches where both nest density and success were higher compared to grassy patches in 1999. We subsequently investigated nest-site selection within two discrete subdivisions of the study area that varied in the degree of human disturbance to determine if nesting behavior, nest success, or nest temperatures were affected. The tendency to nest in sandy patches was much stronger at the natural site due to habitat modifications at the residential site that have blurred the distinction between sandy and grassy patches. Additionally, the residential site had a high density of nests within 5 m of houses and a fence (both areas with disturbed habitat similar to sandy patches), compared to the overall density. Thus, nest success associated with sandy patches may be compromised at the residential site; an ecological trap may result in lower nest success in areas with preferred microhabitat characteristics. Despite a similar basis for nest-site selection in terms of microhabitat characteristics at both sites. nest temperatures were correlated with microhabitat characteristics used to select nest sites only at the natural site. Nest temperatures at the residential site were instead correlated only with the percentage overstory vegetation cover and therefore averaged 2degreesC lower than at the natural site, a temperature difference that influenced offspring sex. The higher percentage overstory vegetation cover at the residential site was due to human alterations of the habitat, and may serve to extend the ecological trap biasing the sex ratio of this population. This study illustrates the importance of (1) nest-site selection as a substantive maternal effect, (2) understanding habitat use during crucial life-history events, and (3) the potential for human disturbance to modify offspring phenotypes and negatively impact nest success despite adaptive nesting behavior.

AB Twenty-seven individual tree growth models are reviewed. The models take into account the same main physiological processes involved in carbon metabolism (photosynthate production, respiration, reserve dynamics, allocation of assimilates and growth) and share common rationales that are discussed. It is shown that the spatial resolution and representation of tree architecture used mainly depend on model objectives. Beyond common rationales, the models reviewed exhibit very different treatments of each process involved in carbon metabolism. The treatments of all these processes are presented and discussed in terms of formulation simplicity, ability to account for response to environment, and explanatory or predictive capacities. Representation of photosynthetic carbon gain ranges from merely empirical relationships that provide annual photosynthate production, to mechanistic models of instantaneous leaf photosynthesis that explicitly account for the effects of the major environmental variables. Respiration is often described empirically as the sum of two functional components (maintenance and growth). Maintenance demand is described by using temperature-dependent coefficients, while growth efficiency is described by using temperature-independent conversion coefficients. Carbohydrate reserve pools are generally represented as black boxes and their dynamics is rarely addressed. Storage and reserve mobilisation are often treated as passive phenomena, and reserve pools are assumed to behave like buffers that absorb the residual, excessive carbohydrate on a daily or seasonal basis. Various approaches to modelling carbon allocation have been applied, such as the use of empirical partitioning coefficients, balanced growth considerations and optimality principles, resistance mass-flow models, or the source-sink approach. The outputs of carbon-based models of individual tree growth are reviewed, and their implications for forestry and ecology are discussed. Three critical issues for these models to date are identified: (i) the representation of carbon allocation and of the effects of architecture on tree growth is Achilles' heel of most of tree growth models; (ii) reserve dynamics is always poorly accounted for; (iii) the representation of below ground processes and tree nutrient economy is lacking in most of the models reviewed. Addressing these critical issues could greatly enhance the reliability and predictive capacity of individual tree growth models in the near future.

DT Article

   learning; Disease classification
AB Deep learning is quickly becoming the standard technique for image classification. The main problem facing the automatic identification of plant diseases using this strategy is the lack of image databases capable of representing the wide variety of conditions and symptom characteristics found in practice. Data augmentation techniques decrease the impact of this problem, but those cannot reproduce most of the practical diversity. This paper explores the use of individual lesions and spots for the task, rather than considering the entire leaf. Since each region has its own characteristics, the variability of the data is increased without the need for additional images. This also allows the identification of multiple diseases affecting the same leaf. On the other hand, suitable symptom segmentation still needs to be done manually, preventing full automation. The accuracies obtained using this approach were, in average, 12% higher than those achieved using the original images. Additionally, no crop had accuracies below 75%, even when as many as 10 diseases were considered. Although the database does not cover the entire range of practical possibilities, these results indicate that, as long as enough data is available, deep learning techniques are effective for plant disease detection and recognition.

AB The use of citizen science for scientific discovery relies on the acceptance of this method by the scientific community. Using the Web of Science and Scopus as the source of peer reviewed articles, an analysis of all published articles on "citizen science" confirmed its growth, and found that significant research on methodology and validation techniques preceded the rapid rise of the publications on research outcomes based on citizen science methods. Of considerable interest is the growing number of studies relying on the re-use of collected datasets from past citizen science research projects, which used data from either individual or multiple citizen science projects for new discoveries, such as for climate change research. The extent to which citizen science has been used in scientific discovery demonstrates its importance as a research approach. This broad analysis of peer reviewed papers on citizen science, that included not only citizen science projects, but the theory and methods developed to underpin the research, highlights the breadth and depth of the citizen science approach and encourages cross-fertilization between the different disciplines.

AB Uncertainties in global climate models (GCMs) and emission scenarios affect assessments of the impact of global warming as well as the communication of scientific results. Here, we developed a probabilistic technique to deal with the uncertainties and to simulate the impact of global warming on rice production and water use in China, against a global mean temperature (GMT) increase scale relative to 1961-1990 values. From 20 climate scenarios output from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Data Distribution Centre, we used Monte Carlo analysis to develop the most likely climate-change scenarios for representative stations and derived the CERES-Rice model of [Alocilja, E.C., Ritchie, R.T., 1988. Rice simulation and its use in multicriteria optimization, IBSNAT Research Report Series 01] to simulate rice production under baseline and future climate scenarios. Adaptation options such as automatic application of irrigation and fertilization were considered, although cultivars were assumed constant over the baseline and future. After assessing representative stations across China, we projected changes in rice yield, growing period, evapotranspiration, and irrigation-water use for GMT changes of 1, 2, and 3 degrees C in a probabilistic way. Without consideration of CO2-fertilization effects, our results indicate that the growing period would shorten with 100% probability; yield would decrease with a probability of 90%, 100%, and 100% for GMT change of 1, 2, and 3 degrees C, respectively. The median values of yield decrease ranged from 6.1% to 18.6%,13.5% to 31.9%, and 23.6% to 40.2% for GMT changes of 1, 2, and 3 degrees C, respectively. According to the median values of the projected changes, evapotranspiration and irrigation water use would decrease in most of the investigated stations. If CO2-fertilization effects were included, the rice growing period would also be reduced with 100% probability; across the stations the median values of yield changes ranged from -10.1% to 3.3%, -16.1% to 2.5%, and -19.3% to 0.18% for GMT changes of 1, 2, and 3 degrees C, respectively. Evapotranspiration and irrigation water use would decrease more and with higher probability in comparison with the simulations without consideration of CO2-fertilization effects. Our study presents a process-based probabilistic assessment of rice production and water use at different GMT increases, which is important for identifying which climate-change level is dangerous for food security.

AB As French populations of the aphid Sitobion avenae exhibit a range of reproductive modes, this species provides a good opportunity for studying the evolution of breeding system variation. The present analysis combined ecological and genetic investigations into the spatial distribution of variation in reproductive mode. Reproductive mode was characterized in 277 lineages of S. avenae from France, and these aphids were scored for five microsatellite loci. The analyses revealed strong geographical partitioning of breeding systems, with obligate asexuals mostly restricted to the south of France, while lineages producing sexual forms were more common in the north. Contrary to what might be anticipated for organisms with frequent parthenogenesis, there was substantial genic and genotypic diversity, even in the obligately asexual lineages. More than 120 different genotypes were detected among the 277 aphid lineages, with an average of 5.9 alleles per locus (range four to 16) and heterozygosity of 56.7%. As with previous studies of allozyme variation in aphids, most loci showed heterozygote deficits, and disequilibrium was common among allelic variants at different loci, even after removal of replicate copies of genotypes that might have been derived through clonal reproduction. Our results suggest that selection is important in structuring reproductive systems and genetic variation in French S. avenae. Canonical correspondence analysis was employed to examine the associations between genotypic and phenotypic variables, enabling the identification of alleles correlated with life-history traits.

AB Fragments of habitat are often viewed as islands and are managed as such; however, habitat fragmentation includes a wide range of spatial patterns of environments that may occur on many spatial scales, Fragments exist in a complex landscape mosaic, and dynamics within a fragment are affected by external factors that vary as the mosaic structure changes, The simple analogy of fragments to islands, therefore, is unsatisfactory, Understanding how birds respond to these complexities of fragmentation requires mechanistic studies focused on habitat selection and movement behaviour. Conservation efforts must be based on viewing fragmentation as a range of conditions that occurs in a landscape mosaic, and management should be directed toward the mosaics rather than focusing solely on reserves,

AB Although the relationship between species diversity and biomass productivity has been extensively studied in grasslands, the impact of tree species diversity on forest productivity, as well as the main drivers of this relationship, are still under discussion. It is widely accepted that the magnitude of the relationship between tree diversity and forest stand productivity is context specific and depends on environmental conditions, but the underlying mechanisms of this relationship are still not fully understood. Competition reduction and facilitation have been identified as key mechanisms driving the diversity-productivity relationship. However, contrasting results have been reported with respect to the extent to which competition reduction and facilitation determine the diversity-productivity relationship. They appear to depend on regional climate, soil fertility, functional diversity of the tree species involved, and developmental stage of the forest. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge and to suggest a conceptual framework to explain the various processes leading to higher productivity of species-rich forests compared with average yields of their respective monocultures. This framework provides three pathways for possible development of the diversity-productivity relationship under a changing climate.

AB Surface water from 38 streams nationwide was assessed using 14 target-organic methods (719 compounds). Designed-bioactive anthropogenic contaminants (biocides, pharmaceuticals) comprised 57% of 406 organics detected at least once. The 10 most-frequently detected anthropogenicorganics included eight pesticides (desulfinylfipronil, AMPA, chlorpyrifos, dieldrin, metolachlor, atrazine, CIAT, glyphosate) and two pharmaceuticals (caffeine, metformin) with detection frequencies ranging 66-84% of.all sites. Detected contaminant concentrations varied from less than 1 ng L-1 to greater than 10 mu g L-1, with 77 and 278 having median detected concentrations greater than 100 mu g L-1 and 10 mu g L-1, respectively. Cumulative detections and concentrations ranged 4-161 compounds (median 70) and 8.5-102 847 mu g L-1, respectively, and correlated significantly with wastewater discharge, watershed development, and toxic release inventory metrics. Log10 concentrations of widely monitored HHCB, triclosan, and carbamazepine explained 71-82% of the variability in the total number of compounds detected (linear regression; p-values: < 0.001-0.012), providing a statistical inference tool for unmonitored contaminants. Due to multiple modes of action, high bioactivity, biorecalcitrance, and direct environment application (pesticides), designed-bioactive organics (median 41 per site at fig L-1 cumulative concentrations) in developed watersheds present aquatic health concerns, given their acknowledged potential for sublethal "effects to sensitive species and lifecycle stages at low ng L-1.

AB Deciphering genetic structure and inferring connectivity in marine species have been challenging due to weak genetic differentiation and limited resolution offered by traditional genotypic methods. The main goal of this study was to assess how a population genomics framework could help delineate the genetic structure of the American lobster (Homarus americanus) throughout much of the species' range and increase the assignment success of individuals to their location of origin. We genotyped 10156 filtered SNPs using RAD sequencing to delineate genetic structure and perform population assignment for 586 American lobsters collected in 17 locations distributed across a large portion of the species' natural distribution range. Our results revealed the existence of a hierarchical genetic structure, first separating lobsters from the northern and southern part of the range (F-CT=0.0011; P-value=0.0002) and then revealing a total of 11 genetically distinguishable populations (mean F-ST=0.00185; CI: 0.0007-0.0021, P-value<0.0002), providing strong evidence for weak, albeit fine-scale population structuring within each region. A resampling procedure showed that assignment success was highest with a subset of 3000 SNPs having the highest F-ST. Applying Anderson's (Molecular Ecology Resources, 2010, 10, 701) method to avoid high-grading bias', 94.2% and 80.8% of individuals were correctly assigned to their region and location of origin, respectively. Lastly, we showed that assignment success was positively associated with sample size. These results demonstrate that using a large number of SNPs improves fine-scale population structure delineation and population assignment success in a context of weak genetic structure. We discuss the implications of these findings for the conservation and management of highly connected marine species, particularly regarding the geographic scale of demographic independence.

AB Detrimental host-pathogen interactions are a normal phenomenon in aquaculture animal production, and have been counteracted by prophylactic use of antibiotics. Especially, the youngest life stages of cultivated aquatic animals are susceptible to pathogen invasion, resulting in disease and mortality. To establish a more sustainable aquatic food production, there is a need for new microbial management strategies that focus on 'join them' and not the traditional 'beat them' approaches. We argue that ecological theory could serve as a foundation for developing sustainable microbial management methods that prevent pathogenic disease in larviculture. Management of the water microbiota in aquaculture systems according to ecological selection principles has been shown to decrease opportunistic pathogen pressure and to result in an improved performance of the cultured animals. We hypothesize that manipulation of the biodiversity of the gut microbiota can increase the host's resistance against pathogenic invasion and infection. However, substantial barriers need to be overcome before active management of the intestinal microbiota can effectively be applied in larviculture.

AB Anticipatory parental effects (APE's) occur when parents adjust the phenotype of their offspring to match the local environment, so as to increase the fitness of both parents and offspring. APE's, as in the evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity more generally, are predicated on the idea that the parental environment is a reliable predictor of the offspring environment. Most studies on APE's fail to explicitly consider environmental predictability so risk searching for APE's under circumstances where they are unlikely to occur. This failure is perhaps one of the major reasons for mixed evidence for APE's in a recent meta-analysis. Here, we highlight some often-overlooked assumptions in studies of APE's and provide a framework for identifying and testing APE's. Our review highlights the importance of measuring environmental predictability, outlines the minimal requirements for experimental designs, explains the important differences between relative and absolute measures of offspring fitness, and highlights some potential issues in assigning components of offspring fitness to parental fitness. Our recommendations should result in more targeted and effective tests of APE's.

AB We present a new software package (hzar) that provides functions for fitting molecular genetic and morphological data from hybrid zones to classic equilibrium cline models using the Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The software applies likelihood functions appropriate for different types of data, including diploid and haploid genetic markers and quantitative morphological traits. The modular design allows flexibility in fitting cline models of varying complexity. To facilitate hypothesis testing, an autofit function is included that allows automated model selection from a set of nested cline models. Cline parameter values, such as cline centre and cline width, are estimated and may be compared statistically across clines. The package is written in the R language and is available through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN; ). Here, we describe hzar and demonstrate its use with a sample data set from a well-studied hybrid zone in western Panama between white-collared (Manacus candei) and golden-collared manakins (M.vitellinus). Comparisons of our results with previously published results for this hybrid zone validate the hzar software. We extend analysis of this hybrid zone by fitting additional models to molecular data where appropriate.

AB Despite its central place in animal ecology no general mechanistic movement model with an emergent home-range pattern has yet been proposed. Random walk models, which are commonly used to model animal movement, show diffusion instead of a bounded home range and therefore require special modifications. Current approaches for mechanistic modeling of home ranges apply only to a limited set of taxa, namely territorial animals and/or central place foragers. In this paper we present a more general mechanistic movement model based on a biased correlated random walk, which shows the potential for home-range behavior. The model is based on an animal tracking a dynamic resource landscape, using a biologically plausible two-part memory system, i.e. a reference- and a working-memory. Our results show that by adding these memory processes the random walker produces home-range behavior as it gains experience, which also leads to more efficient resource use. Interestingly, home-range patterns, which we assessed based on home-range overlap and increase in area covered with time, require the combined action of both memory components to emerge. Our model has the potential to predict home-range size and can be used for comparative analysis of the mechanisms shaping home-range patterns.

AB Measurements of the net CO2 flux between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere using the eddy covariance technique have the potential to underpin our interpretation of regional CO2 source-sink patterns, CO2 flux responses to forcings, and predictions of the future terrestrial C balance. Information contained in FLUXNET eddy covariance data has multiple uses for the development and application of global carbon models, including evaluation/validation, calibration, process parameterization, and data assimilation. This paper reviews examples of these uses, compares global estimates of the dynamics of the global carbon cycle, and suggests ways of improving the utility of such data for global carbon modelling.
   Net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) predicted by different terrestrial biosphere models compares favourably with FLUXNET observations at diurnal and seasonal timescales. However, complete model validation, particularly over the full annual cycle, requires information on the balance between assimilation and decomposition processes, information not readily available for most FLUXNET sites. Site history, when known, can greatly help constrain the model-data comparison.
   Flux measurements made over four vegetation types were used to calibrate the land-surface scheme of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies global climate model, significantly improving simulated climate and demonstrating the utility of diurnal FLUXNET data for climate modelling. Land-surface temperatures in many regions cool due to higher canopy conductances and latent heat fluxes, and the spatial distribution of CO2 uptake provides a significant additional constraint on the realism of simulated surface fluxes.
   FLUXNET data are used to calibrate a global production efficiency model (PEM). This model is forced by satellite-measured absorbed radiation and suggests that global net primary production (NPP) increased 6.2% over 1982-1999. Good agreement is found between global trends in NPP estimated by the PEM and a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM), and between the DGVM and estimates of global NEE derived from a global inversion of atmospheric CO2 measurements. Combining the PEM, DGVM, and inversion results suggests that CO2 fertilization is playing a major role in current increases in NPP, with lesser impacts from increasing N deposition and growing season length. Both the PEM and the inversion identify the Amazon basin as a key region for the current net terrestrial CO2 uptake (i.e. 33% of global NEE), as well as its interannual variability. The inversion's global NEE estimate of -1.2 Pg [C] yr(-1) for 1982-1995 is compatible with the PEM- and DGVM-predicted trends in NPP. There is, thus, a convergence in understanding derived from process-based models, remote-sensing-based observations, and inversion of atmospheric data.
   Future advances in field measurement techniques, including eddy covariance (particularly concerning the problem of night-time fluxes in dense canopies and of advection or flow distortion over complex terrain), will result in improved constraints on land-atmosphere CO2 fluxes and the rigorous attribution of mechanisms to the current terrestrial net CO2 uptake and its spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Global ecosystem models play a fundamental role in linking information derived from FLUXNET measurements to atmospheric CO2 variability.
   A number of recommendations concerning FLUXNET data are made, including a request for more comprehensive site data (particularly historical information), more measurements in undisturbed ecosystems, and the systematic provision of error estimates. The greatest value of current FLUXNET data for global carbon cycle modelling is in evaluating process representations, rather than in providing an unbiased estimate of net CO2 exchange.

AB Effect of invasion by Impatiens glandulifera (Balsaminaceae) on the community characteristics and species composition of invaded riparian communities was studied at six rivers in the Czech Republic. Two approaches were used: space for time substitution approach, i.e., comparing invaded and uninvaded sites under the same habitat conditions, and removal of the invader from experimental plots. Differences in the number of species, Shannon diversity index H' and evennes J were compared between invaded and uninvaded plots. Uninvaded plots of the comparative study harboured by 0.23 more species per 16 m(2), and had higher value of H' and J, calculated with species covers as importance values; however only the difference in J was marginally significant (p = 0.04). Other effects were not significant, indicating that once I. glandulifera is removed, communities recover without any consequences for species diversity. Multivariate analysis did not reveal any effect of invasion on the species composition in terms of species presence but their cover hierarchies changed after the invasion, as I. glandulifera became dominant at the expense of tall native nitrophilous dominants. It is concluded that I. glandulifera exerts negligible effect on the characteristics of invaded riparian communities, hence it does not represent threat to the plant diversity of invaded areas. This makes it very different from other Central European invasive aliens of a similar performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Optimal investment into life-history traits depends on the environmental conditions that organisms are likely to experience during their life. Evolutionary theory tells us that optimal investment in reproduction versus maintenance is likely to shape the pattern of age-associated decline in performance, also known as aging. The currency that is traded against different vital functions is, however, still debated. Here, we took advantage of a phenotypic manipulation of individual quality in early life to explore (1) long-term consequences on life-history trajectories, and (2) the possible physiological mechanism underlying the life-history adjustments. We manipulated phenotypic quality of a cohort of captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) by assigning breeding pairs to either an enlarged or a reduced brood. Nestlings raised in enlarged broods were in poorer condition than nestlings raised in reduced broods. Interestingly, the effect of environmental conditions experienced during early life extended to the age at first reproduction. Birds from enlarged broods delayed reproduction. Birds that delayed reproduction produced less offspring but lived longer, although neither fecundity nor longevity were directly affected by the experimental brood size. Using the framework of the life-table response experiment modeling, we also explored the effect of early environmental condition on population growth rate and aging. Birds raised in reduced broods tended to have a higher population growth rate, and a steeper decrease of reproductive value with age than birds reared in enlarged broods. Metabolic resources necessary to fight off the damaging effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) could be the mechanism underlying the observed results, as (1) birds that engaged in a higher number of breeding events had a weaker red blood cell resistance to oxidative stress, (2) red blood cell resistance to oxidative stress predicted short-term mortality (but not longevity), and (3) was related with a parabolic function to age. Overall, these results highlight that early condition can have long-term effects on life-history trajectories by affecting key life-history traits such as age at first reproduction, and suggest that the trade-off between reproduction and self-maintenance might be mediated by the cumulative deleterious effect of ROS.

AB R. H. Whittaker's idea that plant diversity can be divided into a hierarchy of spatial components from alpha at the within-habitat scale through beta for the turnover of species between habitats to gamma along regional gradients implies the underlying existence of alpha, beta, and gamma niches. We explore the hypothesis that the evolution of a, (3, and gamma niches is also hierarchical, with traits that define the a niche being labile, while those defining a and 7 niches are conservative. At the a level we find support for the hypothesis in the lack of close significant phylogenetic relationship between meadow species that have similar a niches. In a second test, a niche overlap based on a variety of traits is compared between congeners and noncongeners in several communities; here, too, there is no evidence of a correlation between a niche and phylogeny. To test whether beta and gamma niches evolve conservatively, we reconstructed the evolution of relevant traits on evolutionary trees for 14 different clades. Tests against null models revealed a number of instances, including some in island radiations, in which habitat (beta niche) and elevational maximum (an aspect of the gamma niche) showed evolutionary conservatism.

AB Global circulation models predict an increase of summer monsoon precipitation in High Asia as a consequence of global warming. The shortness of available meteorological records requires the reconstruction of past climate variability. However, high-resolution climate proxy records from the Tibetan plateau are scarce and of limited spatial representativeness. Here we present first evidence of increased summer monsoon intensity from the Tibetan plateau based on reconstructions of late summer ( August and September) temperature and rainfall from a network of 22 maximum latewood density (MLD) chronologies of high-elevation conifer sites. After 1980, a decrease in MLD points to an increase of Indian summer monsoon activity ( in southern Tibet unprecedented during the past 350 years.

AB Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forests of northern Sweden are often considered to be N limited. This limitation may have been exacerbated by the elimination of wildfire as a natural disturbance factor in these boreal forests. Phenolic inhibition of N mineralization and nitrification (due to litter and exudates of ericaceous shrubs) has been proposed as a mechanism for N limitation of these forests, but this hypothesis remains largely untested. N mineralization rates, nitrification rates, and sorption of free phenolic compounds were assessed along a fire-induced chronosequence in northern Sweden. A total of 34 forest stands varying in age since the last fire were identified and characterized. Overstorey and understorey vegetative composition and depth of humus were analysed in replicated plots at all 34 sites. Eight of the forest stands aged 3-352 years since the last fire were selected for intensive investigation in which ten replicate ionic resin capsules (used to assess net N mineralization and nitrification) and non-ionic carbonaceous resin capsules (used to assess free phenolic compounds) were installed at the interface of humus and mineral soil. A highly significant correlation was observed between site age and net sorption of inorganic N to resin capsules. Net accumulation of NH4+ and NO3- on resin capsules followed a linear decrease (R-2=0.61, P<0.01) with time perhaps as a result of increased N immobilization with successional C loading. NO3- sorption to resin capsules followed a logarithmic decrease (R-2=0.80, P<0.01) that may be related to a logarithmic increase in dwarf shrub cover and decreased soil charcoal sorption potential along this chronosequence. A replicated field study was conducted at one of the late successional field sites to assess the influence of charcoal and an added labile N source on N turnover. Three rates of charcoal (0, 100, and 1,000 g M-2) and two rates of glycine (0 and 50 g N as glycine M-2) were applied in a factorial design to microplots in a randomized complete block pattern. Net ammonification (as assessed by NH4+ sorption to resins) was readily increased by the addition of a labile N source, but this increase in NH4+ did not stimulate nitrification. Nitrification was stimulated slightly by the addition of charcoal resulting in similar levels of resin-sorbed NO3- as those found in early successional sites. Resin-sorbed polyphenol concentrations were decreased with charcoal amendments, but were actually increased with N amendments (likely due to decomposition of polyphenols). Net N mineralization appears to be limited by rapid NH4+ immobilization whereas nitrification is limited by the lack of an appropriate environment or by the presence of inhibitory compounds in late successional forests of northern Sweden.

AB Natural climatic treelines are relatively discrete boundaries in the landscape established at a certain elevation within an otherwise continuous gradient of environmental change. By studying tree rings along elevational transects at and below the upper treeline in the European Alps, we (1) determine whether radial stem growth declines abruptly or gradually, and (2) test climatic influences on trees near treeline by investigating transects for climatically different historical periods. While tree height decreases gradually toward the treeline, there is no such general trend for radial tree growth. We found rather abrupt changes which imply threshold effects of temperature which moved upslope in a wave-like manner as temperatures increased over the past 150 yr. Currently radial tree growth at treeline in the Alps is the same magnitude as at several hundred meters below current treeline. Over short intervals, tree-ring width is more dependent on interannual climatic variability than on altitudinal distance to treeline, We conclude that (1) the elevational response of toe-rings includes a threshold component (a minimal seasonal temperature) and that (2) radial growth is more strongly correlated with year to year variation in climate than with treeline elevation as such. Our data indicate that the current treeline position reflects influences of past climates and nor the current climate.

AB A central challenge in microbial ecology is to understand the underlying mechanisms driving community assembly, particularly in the continuum of species sorting and dispersal limitation. However, little is known about the relative importance of species sorting and dispersal limitation in shaping marine microbial communities; especially, how they are related to organism types/traits and water depth. Here, we used variation partitioning and null model analysis to compare mechanisms driving bacterial and protist metacommunity dynamics at the basin scale in the East China Sea, based on MiSeq paired-end sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and 18S rDNA, respectively, in surface, deep chlorophyll maximum and bottom layers. Our analyses indicated that protist communities were governed more strongly by species sorting relative to dispersal limitation than were bacterial communities; this pattern was consistent across the three-depth layers, albeit to different degrees. Furthermore, we detected that bacteria exhibited wider habitat niche breadths than protists, whereas, passive dispersal abilities were not appreciably different between them. Our findings support the 'size-plasticity' hypothesis: smaller organisms (bacteria) are less environment filtered than larger organisms (protists), as smaller organisms are more likely to be plastic in metabolic abilities and have greater environmental tolerance.

Here, we explore how masting is affected by plant resource budgets, fruit maturation success, and hormonal coordination of cues including weather and resources. There is little empirical support for the commonly stated hypothesis that plants store carbohydrates over several years to expend in a high-seed year. Plants can switch carbohydrates away from growth in high-seed years, and seed crops are more probably limited by nitrogen or phosphorus. Resources are clearly involved in the proximate mechanisms driving masting, but resource budget (RB) models cannot create masting in the absence of selection because some underlying selective benefit is required to set the level of a full' seed crop at greater than the annual resource increment. Economies of scale (EOSs) provide the ultimate factor selecting for masting, but EOSs probably always interact with resources, which modify the relationship between weather cues and reproduction. Thus, RB and EOS models are not alternative explanations for masting - both are required. Experiments manipulating processes that affect mast seeding will help clarify the physiological mechanisms that underlie mast seeding.

AB 1. Anthropogenic global change compromises forest resilience, with profound impacts to ecosystem functions and services. This synthesis paper reflects on the current understanding of forest resilience and potential tipping points under environmental change and explores challenges to assessing responses using experiments, observations and models.
   2. Forests are changing over a wide range of spatio-temporal scales, but it is often unclear whether these changes reduce resilience or represent a tipping point. Tipping points may arise from interactions across scales, as processes such as climate change, land-use change, invasive species or deforestation gradually erode resilience and increase vulnerability to extreme events. Studies covering interactions across different spatio-temporal scales are needed to further our understanding.
   3. Combinations of experiments, observations and process-based models could improve our ability to project forest resilience and tipping points under global change. We discuss uncertainties in changing CO2 concentration and quantifying tree mortality as examples.
   4. Synthesis. As forests change at various scales, it is increasingly important to understand whether and how such changes lead to reduced resilience and potential tipping points. Understanding the mechanisms underlying forest resilience and tipping points would help in assessing risks to ecosystems and presents opportunities for ecosystem restoration and sustainable forest management.

AB Low resolution satellite imagery has been extensively used for crop monitoring and yield forecasting for over 30 years and plays an important role in a growing number of operational systems. The combination of their high temporal frequency with their extended geographical coverage generally associated with low costs per area unit makes these images a convenient choice at both national and regional scales. Several qualitative and quantitative approaches can be clearly distinguished, going from the use of low resolution satellite imagery as the main predictor of final crop yield to complex crop growth models where remote sensing-derived indicators play different roles, depending on the nature of the model and on the availability of data measured on the ground. Vegetation performance anomaly detection with low resolution images continues to be a fundamental component of early warning and drought monitoring systems at the regional scale. For applications at more detailed scales, the limitations created by the mixed nature of low resolution pixels are being progressively reduced by the higher resolution offered by new sensors, while the continuity of existing systems remains crucial for ensuring the availability of long time series as needed by the majority of the yield prediction methods used today.

AB Even though large extents of boreal peatlands are still in a pristine condition, especially in North America, extensive areas have been affected by natural or anthropogenic disturbances that change some of the systems from being sinks to sources of carbon dioxide and shift the methane production/consumption patterns through alterations of both above- and below-ground communities and functions. In order to fully assess the role of peatlands on global C balance, now and in the future, it is imperative that we deepen our understanding of the relative contributions of various groups of microorganisms to organic matter transformations. Here, we review the drivers structuring fungal, bacterial and archaeal communities in natural peatlands and the response of these microbial communities to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, including fire, drainage, nutrient deposition, peat mining and climate change. The microbial diversity in peatlands is characterized by organisms that have developed physiological and metabolic adaptations to cope with the constraining conditions found in these ecosystems, such as low oxygen availability, cold temperature, acidity and oligotrophy. Furthermore, these unique organisms sometimes appear to be organized as repeat mosaics responding to vegetation, physicochemical and hydrological characteristics more than to geographical distance, in other words, similar to the much valued biodiversity aspects of the peatland vegetation itself and associated higher organisms. The response of microbial communities to disturbances is far from fully understood. In particular, whilst many studies have identified changes in microbial community composition or on microbially driven processes following a given disturbance, it remains unclear how the two components, diversity and function, relate with each other. Future challenges involve designing studies that will test whether ecological theories like species sorting, stress physiology, temporal niche or functional redundancy can be used to understand what regulates microbial populations and activity in peatlands, and studies that will allow us to predict more accurately how peatlands respond to global change or anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Microbial biofilms assemble from cells that attach to a surface, where they develop into matrix-enclosed communities. Mechanistic insights into community assembly are crucial to better understand the functioning of natural biofilms, which drive key ecosystem processes in numerous aquatic habitats. We studied the role of the suspended microbial community as the source of the biofilm community in three streams using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism and 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the 16S rRNA gene (as a measure for the active and the bulk community, respectively). Diversity was consistently lower in the biofilm communities than in the suspended stream water communities. We propose that the higher diversity in the suspended communities is supported by continuous inflow from various sources within the catchment. Community composition clearly differed between biofilms and suspended communities, whereas biofilm communities were similar in all three streams. This suggests that biofilm assembly did not simply reflect differences in the source communities, but that certain microbial groups from the source community proliferate in the biofilm. We compared the biofilm communities with random samples of the respective community suspended in the stream water. This analysis confirmed that stochastic dispersal from the source community was unlikely to shape the observed community composition of the biofilms, in support of species sorting as a major biofilm assembly mechanism. Bulk and active populations generated comparable patterns of community composition in the biofilms and the suspended communities, which suggests similar assembly controls on these populations.

AB Background: The different hypotheses proposed to explain positive species richness-productivity relationships, i.e. selection effect and complementarity effect, imply that plant functional characteristics are at the core of a mechanistic understanding of biodiversity effects.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We used two community-wide measures of plant functional composition, (1) community-weighted means of trait values (CWM) and (2) functional trait diversity based on Rao's quadratic diversity (FDQ) to predict biomass production and measures of biodiversity effects in experimental grasslands (Jena Experiment) with different species richness (2, 4, 8, 16 and 60) and different functional group number and composition (1 to 4; legumes, grasses, small herbs, tall herbs) four years after establishment. Functional trait composition had a larger predictive power for community biomass and measures of biodiversitity effects (40-82% of explained variation) than species richness per se (<1-13% of explained variation). CWM explained a larger amount of variation in community biomass (80%) and net biodiversity effects (70%) than FDQ (36 and 38% of explained variation respectively). FDQ explained similar proportions of variation in complementarity effects (24%, positive relationship) and selection effects (28%, negative relationship) as CWM (27% of explained variation for both complementarity and selection effects), but for all response variables the combination of CWM and FDQ led to significant model improvement compared to a separate consideration of different components of functional trait composition. Effects of FDQ were mainly attributable to diversity in nutrient acquisition and life-history strategies. The large spectrum of traits contributing to positive effects of CWM on biomass production and net biodiversity effects indicated that effects of dominant species were associated with different trait combinations.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that the identification of relevant traits and the relative impacts of functional identity of dominant species and functional diversity are essential for a mechanistic understanding of the role of plant diversity for ecosystem processes such as aboveground biomass production.

AB Biological invasions are a global phenomenon that threatens biodiversity, and few, if any, ecosystems are free from alien species. The outcome of human-mediated introductions is affected by the invasiveness of species and invasibility of ecosystems, but research has primarily focused on defining, characterizing and identifying invasive species; ecosystem invasibility has received much less attention. A prerequisite for characterizing invasibility is the ability to compare levels of invasion across ecosystems. In this paper, we aim to identify the best way to quantify the level of invasion by nonnative animals and plants by reviewing the advantages and disadvantages of different metrics. We explore how interpretation and choice of these measures can depend on the objective of a study or management intervention. Based on our review, we recommend two invasion indices and illustrate their use by applying them to two case studies. Relative alien species richness and relative alien species abundance indicate the contribution that alien species make to a community. They are easy to measure, can be applied to various taxa, are independent of scale and are comparable across regions and ecosystems, and historical data are often available. The relationship between relative alien richness and abundance can indicate the presence of dominant alien species and the trajectory of invasion over time, and can highlight ecosystems and sites that are heavily invaded or especially susceptible to invasion. Splitting species into functional groups and examining invasion patterns of transformer species may be particularly instructive for gauging effects of alien invasion on ecosystem structure and function. Establishing standard, transparent ways to define and quantify invasion level will facilitate meaningful comparisons among studies, ecosystem types and regions. It is essential for progress in ecology and will help guide ecosystem restoration and management.

AB The Russian treeline is a dynamic ecotone typified by steep gradients in summer temperature and regionally variable gradients in albedo and heat flux. The location of the treeline is largely controlled by summer temperatures and growing season length. Temperatures have responded strongly to twentieth-century global warming and will display a magnified response to future warming. Dendroecological studies indicate enhanced conifer recruitment during the twentieth century. However, conifers have not yet recolonized many areas where trees were present during the Medieval Warm period (ca AD 800-1300) or the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM; ca 10 000-3000 years ago). Reconstruction of tree distributions during the HTM suggests that the future position of the treeline due to global warming may approximate its former Holocene maximum position. An increased dominance of evergreen tree species in the northern Siberian forests may be an important difference between past and future conditions. Based on the slow rates of treeline expansion observed during the twentieth century, the presence of steep climatic gradients associated with the current Arctic coastline and the prevalence of organic soils, it is possible that rates of treeline expansion will be regionally variable and transient forest communities with species abundances different from today's may develop.

AB We studied the genetic population structure and phylogeography of the montane caddisfly Drusus discolor across its entire range in central and southern Europe. The species is restricted to mountain regions and exhibits an insular distribution across the major mountain ranges. Mitochondrial sequence data (COI) of 254 individuals from the entire species range is analysed to reveal population genetic structure. The data show little molecular variation within populations and regions, but distinct genetic differentiation between mountain ranges. Most populations are significantly differentiated based on F-ST and exact tests of population differentiation and most haplotypes are unique to a single mountain range. Phylogenetic analyses reveal deep divergence between geographically isolated lineages. Combined, these results suggest that past fragmentation is the prominent process structuring the populations across Europe. We use tests of selective neutrality and mismatch distributions, to study the demographic population history of regions with haplotype overlap. The high level of genetic differentiation between mountain ranges and estimates of demographic history provide evidence for the existence of multiple glacial refugia, including several in central Europe. The study shows that these aquatic organisms reacted differently to Pleistocene cooling than many terrestrial species. They persisted in numerous refugia over multiple glacial cycles, allowing many local endemic clades to form.

AB Because of the contingency and complexity of its subject matter, community ecology has few general laws. Laws and models in community ecology are highly contingent, and their domain is usually very local. This fact does not mean that community ecology is a weak science; in fact, it is the locus of exciting advances, with growing mechanistic understanding of causes, patterns, and processes. Further, traditional community ecological research, often local, experimental, and reductionist, is crucial in understanding and responding to many environmental problems, including those posed by global changes. For both scientific and societal reasons, it is not time to abandon community ecology.

AB Regional conservation planning can often make more effective use of sparse biological data by linking these data to remotely mapped environmental variables through statistical modelling. While modelling distributions of individual species is the best known and most widely used approach to such modelling, there are many situations in which more information can be extracted from available data by supplementing, or replacing, species-level modelling with modelling of communities or assemblages. This paper provides an overview of approaches to community-level modelling employed in a series of major land-use planning processes in the northeast New South Wales region of Australia, and evaluates how well communities and assemblages derived using these techniques function as surrogates in regional conservation planning. We also outline three new directions that may enhance the effectiveness of community-level modelling by: ( 1) more closely integrating modelling with traditional ecological mapping ( e. g. vegetation mapping); ( 2) more tightly linking numerical classification and spatial modelling through application of canonical classification techniques; and ( 3) enhancing the applicability of modelling to data-poor regions through employment of a new technique for modelling spatial pattern in compositional dissimilarity.

AB Climatic mapping, which predicts the potential distribution of organisms in new areas and under future climates based on their responses to climate in their home range, has recently been criticised for ignoring dispersal and interactions between species, such as competition, predation and parasitism. In order to determine whether these criticisms are justified, the different procedures employed in climatic mapping were reviewed, with examples taken from studies of the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata), Karnal bunt of wheat (Tilletia indica) and the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata). All these studies stressed the key role played by non-climatic factors in determining distribution but it was shown that these factors, e.g., the availability of food and synchrony with the host plant, together with the difficulties of downscaling and upscaling data, were different to those highlighted in the criticisms. The extent to which laboratory studies on Drosophila populations, on which the criticisms are based, can be extrapolated to general predictions of species distributions was also explored. The Drosophila experiments were found to illustrate the importance of climate but could not accurately determine potential species distributions because only adult and not breeding population densities were estimated. The experimental design overestimated species interactions and ignored other factors, such as the availability of food. It was concluded that while there are limitations, climatic mapping procedures continue to play a vital role in determining what G.E. Hutchinson defined as the "fundamental niche" in studies of potential distribution. This applies especially for pest species, where natural dispersal is generally less important than transport by man, and species interactions are limited by the impoverished species diversity in agroecosystems. Due to the lack of data, climatic mapping is often the only approach which can be adopted. Nevertheless, to ensure that non-climatic factors are not neglected in such studies, a standard framework should be employed. Such frameworks have already been developed for pest risk analyses and are suitable for general use in studies of potential distribution because, in order to justify the phytosanitary regulation of international trade, they must also consider the potential for pests to invade new areas and the impacts of such invasions.

AB 1. Data from Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (EMS) transect counts were used to investigate the decline in synchrony of population fluctuations with increasing distance between sample units, and to evaluate the relative effects of local and regional scale processes on population fluctuations.
   2. Each BMS transect is divided into sections and numbers (densities) of butterflies are recorded separately in each section. Local scale analyses examined population fluctuations on different sections within a single transect. Regional scale analyses examined fluctuations on different transects.
   3. At the local scale population dynamics were found to be more closely synchronized between very close population units (sections) than more distant ones. There was considerable variation between data sets but on average this correlation declined relatively quickly over 1-2 km.
   4. At the regional scale, where local environmental heterogeneity was averaged out (sections were lumped together within transect sites), the decline in synchrony with increasing distance (up to 200 km) was very small compared with local scale decrease, and populations remain partially synchronized throughout the range studied due to regionally correlated weather patterns.
   5. Butterfly dispersal had a significant effect on synchrony at a local scale (several km): the dynamics of populations of relatively mobile species remained correlated over relatively long distances. At the regional level, however, mobility was not a significant factor, implying that widespread environmental stochasticity is of over-riding importance at this scale.
   6. Although mobility and distance are significant factors in determining population synchrony/asynchrony, the low r(2) values attributable to them indicate that these factors are actually contributing relatively little to the overall dynamics. Butterfly species show local variation in population dynamics, nested within broad scale synchrony which is presumably generated by the climate. Heterogeneity in population dynamics, in local environments, potentially aids metapopulation persistence by buffering the effects of high levels of temporal environmental stochasticity.

AB 1 The bryophyte and vascular flora were described for a range of forested and open peatlands in the mid-boreal Clay Belt region of Canada, and in the subarctic region of the Labrador Trough, Quebec. The floristic patterns and their relationships to methane (CH4) emission, hydrology and water chemistry were analysed with classification (TWINSPAN), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA).
   2 Despite differences in vegetation physiognomy, chemistry, and geology, water chemistry (pH, Ca, Mg, K-corr) and hydrology explain most of the species distribution in both peatland regions. In the Clay Belt, bryophytes respond primarily to water table position, and secondarily to water chemistry; the reverse is true for the vascular flora. The bryophyte and vascular ordinations are more similar to each other in the Labrador Trough than in boreal sites.
   3 Although CH4 emissions are lower in subarctic than in boreal sites, mean CH4 flux is strongly correlated with mean water table position (r(2) = 0.73) in both regions, but is not correlated with water chemistry. The highest CH4 emissions (seasonal mean greater than or equal to 100 mg m(-2) day(-1)) occur in raised bog and patterned poor fen pools where the peat mat is degrading.
   4 The relationships among CH4 flux, mean water table position, and species distribution are similar in both boreal and subarctic regions. Bryophytes are generally better predictors of CH4 flux than vascular plants, except for certain species in flooded sites (e.g. Carer spp.). Bryophytes are also better indicators of the long-term average position of the water table, reflecting relative zones of methane production and oxidation over the season. In the vascular plant analyses, shrub cover indicates dry conditions and low CH4 flux in the sharply differentiated string-flark-pool topography of the subarctic fens, but is less predictive of CH4 emission in the drier hummock-hollow microtopography at boreal sites where shrubs and trees are more pervasive. Overall herbaceous or sedge cover is not indicative of CH4 flux in either region.

AB A large number of previous studies have investigated the possibility of estimating absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) from spectral reflectance of plant canopies. An important factor not considered in these studies is the case of horizontally heterogeneous plant stands where the ground cover is usually less than 100%. We investigated the relationship between spectral indices and fraction of absorbed PAR in horizontally heterogeneous vegetation canopies with the aid of a three-dimensional radiative transfer model. Canopy reflection at optical wavelengths and PAR absorption was simulated using this model. The errors incurred in using a ID model for calculating the radiation regime of spatially heterogeneous canopies are shown to be significant. Our analysis indicates that the leaf area index of a canopy is less of an instructive parameter than ground cover and clump leaf area index for these canopies. The relationship between normalized difference vegetation index and fraction of absorbed PAR is found to be almost linear and independent of spatial heterogeneity. However, this relationship is sensitive to the reflectance of the soil or background.

AB Understanding the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has been a core ecological research topic over the past decades. Although a key hypothesis is that the diversity of functional traits determines ecosystem functioning, we do not know how much trait diversity is needed to maintain multiple ecosystem functions simultaneously (multifunctionality). Here, we uncovered a scaling relationship between the abundance distribution of two key plant functional traits (specific leaf area, maximum plant height) and multifunctionality in 124 dryland plant communities spread over all continents except Antarctica. For each trait, we found a strong empirical relationship between the skewness and the kurtosis of the trait distributions that cannot be explained by chance. This relationship predicted a strikingly high trait diversity within dryland plant communities, which was associated with a local maximization of multifunctionality. Skewness and kurtosis had a much stronger impact on multifunctionality than other important multifunctionality drivers such as species richness and aridity. The scaling relationship identified here quantifies how much trait diversity is required to maximize multifunctionality locally. Trait distributions can be used to predict the functional consequences of biodiversity loss in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Reduced fertility typically occurs among women in their late 30s, but increasing evidence indicates that advanced paternal age is associated with changes in reproduction as well. Numerous studies have investigated age-based declines in semen traits, but the impact of paternal age on semen parameter values remains inconclusive. Using data from 90 studies (93,839 subjects), we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the effect of male age on seven ejaculate traits (semen volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count, morphology, total motility, progressive motility and DNA fragmentation). Age-associated declines in semen volume, percentage motility, progressive motility, normal morphology and unfragmented cells were statistically significant and results generally seemed to be robust against confounding factors. Unexpectedly, sperm concentration did not decline with increasing male age, even though we found that sperm concentration declined overtime. Our findings indicate that male age needs more recognition as a potential contributor to the negative pregnancy outcomes and reduced offspring health associated with delayed first reproduction. We suggest that greater focus on collection of DNA fragmentation and progressive motility in a clinical setting may lead to better patient outcomes during fertility treatments of aging couples.

AB The ecosystem services concept is used to make explicit the diverse benefits ecosystems provide to people, with the goal of improving assessment and, ultimately, decision-making. Alongside material benefits such as natural resources (e.g., clean water, timber), this concept includes-through the 'cultural' category of ecosystem services-diverse non-material benefits that people obtain through interactions with ecosystems (e.g., spiritual inspiration, cultural identity, recreation). Despite the longstanding focus of ecosystem services research on measurement, most cultural ecosystem services have defined measurement and inclusion alongside other more 'material' services. This gap in measurement of cultural ecosystem services is a product of several perceived problems, some of which are not real problems and some of which can be mitigated or even solved without undue difficulty. Because of the fractured nature of the literature, these problems continue to plague the discussion of cultural services. In this paper we discuss several such problems, which although they have been addressed singly, have not been brought together in a single discussion. There is a need for a single, accessible treatment of the importance and feasibility of integrating cultural ecosystem services alongside others.

AB Community assembly involves two antagonistic processes that select functional traits in opposite directions. Environmental filtering tends to increase the functional similarity of species within communities leading to trait convergence, whereas competition tends to limit the functional similarity of species within communities leading to trait divergence. Here, we introduce a new hierarchical Bayesian model that incorporates intraspecific trait variation into a predictive framework to unify classic coexistence theory and evolutionary biology with recent trait-based approaches. Model predictions exhibited a significant positive correlation (r = 0.66) with observed relative abundances along a 10 degrees C gradient in mean annual temperature. The model predicted the correct dominant species in half of the plots, and accurately reproduced species' temperature optimums. The framework is generalizable to any ecosystem as it can accommodate any species pool, any set of functional traits and multiple environmental gradients, and it eliminates some of the criticisms associated with recent trait-based community assembly models.

AB Species distribution modelling (SDM) is a widely used tool and has many applications in ecology and conservation biology. Spatial autocorrelation (SAC), a pattern in which observations are related to one another by their geographic distance, is common in georeferenced ecological data. SAC in the residuals of SDMs violates the independent errors assumption required to justify the use of statistical models in modelling species distributions. The autologistic modelling approach accounts for SAC by including an additional term (the autocovariate) representing the similarity between the value of the response variable at a location and neighbouring locations. However, autologistic models have been found to introduce bias in the estimation of parameters describing the influence of explanatory variables on habitat occupancy. To address this problem we developed an extension to the autologistic approach by calculating the autocovariate on SAC in residuals (the RAC approach). Performance of the new approach was tested on simulated data with a known spatial structure and on strongly autocorrelated mangrove species distribution data collected in northern Australia. The RAC approach was implemented as generalized linear models (GLMs) and boosted regression tree (BRT) models. We found that the BRT models with only environmental explanatory variables can account for some SAC, but applying the standard autologistic or RAC approaches further reduced SAC in model residuals and substantially improved model predictive performance. The RAC approach showed stronger inferential performance than the standard autologistic approach, as parameter estimates were more accurate and statistically significant variables were accurately identified. The new RAC approach presented here has the potential to account for spatial autocorrelation while maintaining strong predictive and inferential performance, and can be implemented across a range of modelling approaches.

AB P>Biological invasions are a global and increasing threat to the function and diversity of ecosystems. Allee effects (positive density dependence) have been shown to play an important role in the establishment and spread of non-native species. Although Allee effects can be considered a bane in conservation efforts, they can be a benefit in attempts to manage non-native species. Many biological invaders are subject to some form of an Allee effect, whether due to a need to locate mates, cooperatively feed or reproduce or avoid becoming a meal, yet attempts to highlight the specific exploitation of Allee effects in biological invasions are surprisingly unprecedented. In this review, we highlight current strategies that effectively exploit an Allee effect, and propose novel means by which Allee effects can be manipulated to the detriment of biological invaders. We also illustrate how the concept of Allee effects can be integral in risk assessments and in the prioritization of resources allocated to manage non-native species, as some species beset by strong Allee effects could be less successful as invaders. We describe how tactics that strengthen an existing Allee effect or create new ones could be used to manage biological invasions more effectively.

   HYBRIDIZATION; DELIMITATION; SYSTEMATICS; DEFINITION
AB New insights in the speciation process and the nature of "species" that accumulated in the past decade demand adjustments of the species concept. The standing of some of the most broadly accepted or most innovative species concepts in the light of the growing evidence that reproductive barriers are semipermeable to gene flow, that species can differentiate despite ongoing interbreeding, that a single species can originate polyphyletically by parallel evolution, and that uniparental organisms are organised in units that resemble species of biparental organisms is discussed. As a synthesis of ideas in existing concepts and the new insights, a generalization of the genic concept is proposed that defines species as groups of individuals that are reciprocally characterized by features that would have negative fitness effects in other groups and that cannot be regularly exchanged between groups upon contact. The benefits of this differential fitness species concept are that it classifies groups that keep differentiated and keep on differentiating despite interbreeding as species, that it is not restricted to specific mutations or mechanisms causing speciation, and that it can be applied to the whole spectrum of organisms from uni- to biparentals.

AB 1. Alpine plant species are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Therefore, estimating the adaptive potential of alpine species is of vital importance for determining their future viability. In alpine plants, adaptive potential depends on (i) altitudinal genetic differentiation among populations, combined with gene flow along an altitudinal gradient; (ii) phenotypic plasticity for the traits under selection and (iii) co-gradient variation between genetic and environmental influences on these traits.
   2. The adaptive potential of Festuca eskia Ramond (Poaceae), a perennial alpine grass common in the Pyrenean Mountains, was examined in this study. A reciprocal transplant experiment involving 180 individuals along three altitudinal gradients (from 1500 to 2500 m) was established, and survival, functional and reproductive traits were recorded. In addition, four neutral sequence-tagged site and simple sequence repeat molecular markers were chosen to estimate gene flow among populations.
   3. Genetic differentiation attributable to selection was detected in all traits between populations along the altitudinal gradient despite the existence of restricted gene flow. For traits directly related to fitness, local altitudinal adaptation was clearly evident. The patterns of local adaptation suggested that selection patterns differed along an altitudinal gradient. Selection for reproductive output was predominant at low altitudes, whereas differential survivorship was observed at higher altitudes.
   4. Genetic differentiation with increasing altitude resulted in reduced plant stature and reproductive output but increased specific leaf area (SLA). This increased SLA at higher altitude is interpreted as a resource acquisition strategy.
   5. Phenotypic plasticity was seen in all traits at the population level. Evidence of co-gradient variation between genetic differentiation and plastic response was found for all traits except SLA, suggesting that adaptive phenotypic plasticity operates in F. eskia.
   6. Synthesis. Local adaptation occurs in F. eskia. It involves different adaptive traits according to the altitude. Such differentiation occurs at a small scale along altitudinal gradients despite the existence of gene flow and phenotypic plasticity. The coexistence of genetic differentiation, gene flow and phenotypic plasticity along altitudinal gradients provides an adaptive potential for F. eskia to successfully adapt to climate change.

AB The last glacial maximum (20 000-18 000 years ago) dramatically affected extant distributions of virtually all northern European biota. Locations of refugia and postglacial recolonization pathways were examined in Fucus serratus (Heterokontophyta; Fucaceae) using a highly variable intergenic spacer developed from the complete mitochondrial genome of Fucus vesiculosus. Over 1500 samples from the entire range of F. serratus were analysed using fluorescent single strand conformation polymorphism. A total of 28 mtDNA haplotypes was identified and sequenced. Three refugia were recognized based on high haplotype diversities and the presence of endemic haplotypes: southwest Ireland, the northern Brittany-Hurd Deep area of the English Channel, and the northwest Iberian Peninsula. The Irish refugium was the source for a recolonization sweep involving a single haplotype via northern Scotland and throughout Scandinavia, whereas recolonization from the Brittany-Hurd Deep refugium was more limited, probably because of unsuitable soft-bottom habitat in the Bay of Biscay and along the Belgian and Dutch coasts. The Iberian populations reflect a remnant refugium at the present-day southern boundary of the species range. A generalized skyline plot suggested exponential population expansion beginning in the mid-Pleistocene with maximal growth during the Eems interglacial 128 000 - 67 000 years ago, implying that the last glacial maximum mainly shaped population distributions rather than demography.

AB Natural areas are becoming increasingly fragmented and embedded in an urban matrix. Natural and semi-natural areas at the urban/wildland interface are threatened by a variety of 'edge effects', and are especially vulnerable to invasion by introduced plants, with suburban gardens acting as significant sources of alien propagules. Urban/wildland interfaces also provide access for humans, leading to various types of disturbance. Alien plant invasions are one of the biggest threats facing remaining natural areas on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. The area provides an ideal opportunity to study the dynamics of invasions at the urban/wildland interface, since the largest natural area, the Table Mountain National Park (TMNP), is surrounded by the city of Cape Town. We explored invasion patterns in Newlands Forest (a small section of the TMNP) and detailed the roles of habitat features and distance from putative source populations in three main habitat types: natural Afromontane forest, riverine woodland habitats, and plantations of exotic pines (Pinus radiata and P. pinaster). We also examined the role of disturbance in driving invasions in two of these habitat types (Afromontane forest and pine plantations). We hypothesized that alien richness and alien stem density would decrease with distance from the urban/wildland interface, and that alien richness and alien stem density would increase with increasing levels of human disturbance.
   Distance from putative source populations and levels of anthropogenic disturbance influenced alien richness in Newlands Forest but not alien stem density. Alien richness decreased significantly with distance from presumed sources in the pine habitat, and increased significantly with disturbance in the forest habitat. Percentage overstorey cover and soil pH were important environmental variables associated with alien plant species. A socio-economic approach is discussed as being the most effective approach to the management and prevention of alien plant species in Newlands Forest. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although the effects of nutrient enrichment on consumer - resource dynamics are relatively well studied in ecosystems based on living plants, little is known about the manner in which enrichment influences the dynamics and productivity of consumers and resources in detritus-based ecosystems. Because nutrients can stimulate loss of carbon at the base of detrital food webs, effects on higher consumers may be fundamentally different than what is expected for living-plant-based food webs in which nutrients typically increase basal carbon. We experimentally enriched a detritus-based headwater stream for two years to examine the effects of nutrient-induced changes at the base of the food web on higher metazoan ( predominantly invertebrate) consumers. Our paired-catchment design was aimed at quantifying organic matter and invertebrate dynamics in the enriched stream and an adjacent reference stream for two years prior to enrichment and two years during enrichment. Enrichment had a strong negative effect on standing crop of leaf litter, but no apparent effect on that of. ne benthic organic matter. Despite large nutrient-induced reductions in the quantity of leaf litter, invertebrate secondary production during the enrichment was the highest ever reported for headwater streams at this Long Term Ecological Research site and was 1.2-3.3 times higher than predicted based on 15 years of data from these streams. Abundance, biomass, and secondary production of invertebrate consumers increased significantly in response to enrichment, and the response was greater among taxa with larval life spans <= 1 yr than among those with larval life spans > 1 yr. Production of invertebrate predators closely tracked the increased production of their prey. The response of invertebrates was largely habitat-specific with little effect of enrichment on food webs inhabiting bedrock outcrops. Our results demonstrate that positive nutrient-induced changes to food quality likely override negative changes to food quantity for consumers during the initial years of enrichment of detritus-based stream ecosystems. Longer-term enrichment may impact consumers through eventual reductions in the quantity of detritus.

AB circle Tree rings are widely used long-term proxy data which, if combined with long-term instrumental climate records, can provide excellent information on global climate variability. This research aimed to determine whether interannual climate-growth responses in Alpine treeline forests are stationary over time.
   circle We used tree-ring width chronologies of Larix decidua (European larch) from 17 sites and monthly temperatures and precipitation data for the period 1800-1999. Climate-growth relationships were assessed with correlation and response functions, and their stationarity and consistency over time were measured using moving correlation.
   circle Tree-ring chronologies showed similar interannual variations over the last two centuries, suggesting that the same climatic factors synchronously limited growth at most sites. The most sensitive variables showed significant transient responses varying within the time period, indicating a possible deviation from the uniformitarian principle applied to dendroclimatology.
   circle If these findings are confirmed in future studies on other species and in other regions, we suggest that time-dependent variables should be taken into account to avoid overestimation of treeline advance, future forest carbon storage in temperature-limited environments and inaccurate reconstruction of past climate variability.

AB Mycorthizae play a critical role in nutrient capture from soils. Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) and ectomycorrhizae (EM) are the most important mycorrhizae in agricultural and natural ecosystems. AM and EM fungi use inorganic NH4+ and NO3-, and most EM fungi are capable of using organic nitrogen. The heavier stable isotope N-15 is discriminated against during biogeochemical and biochemical processes. Differences in N-15 (atom%) or delta(15)N (parts per thousand) provide nitrogen movement information in an experimental system. A range of 20 to 50% of one-way N-transfer has been observed from legumes to nonlegumes.
   Mycorrhizal fungal mycelia can extend from one plant's roots to another plant's roots to form common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs). Individual species, genera, even families of plants can be interconnected by CMNs. They are capable of facilitating nutrient uptake and flux. Nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus and other elements may then move via either AM or EM networks from plant to plant.
   Both N-15 labeling and N-15 natural abundance techniques have been employed to trace N movement between plants interconnected by AM or EM networks. Fine mesh (25similar to45 mum) has been used to separate root systems and allow only hyphal penetration and linkages but no root contact between plants. In many studies, nitrogen from N-2-fixing mycorrhizal plants transferred to non-N-2-fixing mycorrhizal plants (one-way N-transfer). In a few studies, N is also transferred from non-N-2-fixing mycorrhizal plants to N-2-fixing mycorrhizal plants (two-way N-transfer). There is controversy about whether N-transfer is direct through CMNs, or indirect through the soil. The lack of convincing data underlines the need for creative, careful experimental manipulations. Nitrogen is crucial to productivity in most terrestrial ecosystems, and there are potential benefits of management in soil-plant systems to enhance N-transfer. Thus, two-way N-transfer warrants further investigation with many species and under field conditions.

AB Linear- and unimodal-based inference models for mean summer temperatures (partial least squares, weighted averaging, and weighted averaging partial least squares models) were applied to a high-resolution pollen and cladoceran stratigraphy from Gerzensee, Switzerland. The time-window of investigation included the Allerod, the Younger Dryas, and the Preboreal. Characteristic major and minor oscillations in the oxygen-isotope stratigraphy, such as the Gerzensee oscillation, the onset and end of the Younger Dryas stadial, and the Preboreal oscillation, were identified by isotope analysis of bulk-sediment carbonates of the same core and were used as independent indicators for hemispheric or global scale climatic change. In general, the pollen-inferred mean summer temperature reconstruction using all three inference models follows the oxygen-sotope curve more closely than the cladoceran curve. The cladoceran-inferred reconstruction suggests generally warmer summers than the pollen-based reconstructions, which may be an effect of terrestrial vegetation not being in equilibrium with climate due to migrational lags during the Late Glacial and early Holocene. Allerod summer temperatures range between 11 and 12 degrees C based on pollen, whereas the cladoceran-inferred temperatures lie between 11 and 13 degrees C. Pollen and cladocera-inferred reconstructions both suggest a drop to 9-10 degrees C at the beginning of the Younger Dryas. Although the Allerod-Younger Dryas transition lasted 150-160 years in the oxygen-isotope stratigraphy, the pollen-inferred cooling took 180-190 years and the cladoceran-inferred cooling lasted 250-260 years. The pollen-inferred summer temperature rise to 11.5-12 degrees C at the transition from the Younger Dryas to the Preboreal preceded the oxygen-isotope signal by several decades, whereas the cladoceran-inferred warming lagged. Major discrepancies between the pollen- and cladoceran-inference models are observed for the Preboreal, where the cladoceran-inference model suggests mean summer temperatures of up to 14-15 degrees C. Both pollen- and cladoceran-inferred reconstructions suggest a cooling that may be related to the Gerzensee oscillation, but there is no evidence for a cooling synchronous with the Preboreal oscillation as recorded in the oxygen-isotope record. For the Gerzensee oscillation the inferred cooling was ca. 1 and 0.5 degrees C based on pollen and cladocera, respectively, which lies well within the inherent prediction errors of the inference models.

AB 1. Diversity effects on canopy structure and the use of space and light were investigated in experimental grassland communities of one, two, four, eight or 32 species and of one, two or three functional groups (grasses, legumes and non-leguminous forbs) in north-western Switzerland.
   2. Plant species and functional group richness improved the establishment of grassland assemblages and increased mean vegetation cover from 64% in monocultures to 100% in 32-species mixtures.
   3. Above-ground biomass and leaf area index increased linearly with the logarithm of plant species number in all 3 years of the experiment. The most species-rich communities produced 143% more biomass than the mean of all monocultures and 25% more biomass than the most productive monoculture in the third year of the experiment.
   4. Plant light absorbance per unit ground area increased by 44% with diversity (32-species mixtures compared with monocultures) for two reasons. (i) The lack of species complementarity in terms of success of seedling establishment and plant size in vegetation with low species diversity increased the gap area in the canopy, and consequently more light reached bare ground. (ii) Diverse ecosystems absorbed more light within their closed canopies (+20%) than did less diverse ecosystems, because of better three-dimensional space filling and greater biomass density due to complementarity in plant architecture, particularly between grasses and dicots.
   5, The overall canopy height was increased by 46% and the centre of gravity of the canopy was raised by up to 10 cm over the range of experimental diversity treatments from one to 32 species.
   6, These results cannot be explained solely by a higher likelihood of the inclusion of more productive dominant species in the more diverse communities (sampling effect), which suggests that biomass production may be determined by the most productive species present in a community. For all important canopy characteristics of multispecies communities, we show that with increasing diversity mixtures perform better than the best monoculture. This is a strong indication that part of the positive effect of diversity on biomass production is driven by complementary resource use.

AB 1. River networks are hierarchical dendritic habitats embedded within the terrestrial landscape, with varying connectivity between sites depending on their positions along the network. This physical organisation influences the dispersal of organisms, which ultimately affects metacommunity dynamics and biodiversity patterns.
   2. We provide a conceptual synthesis of the role of river networks in structuring metacommunities in relation to dispersal processes in riverine ecosystems. We explore where the river network best explains observed metacommunity structure compared to other measurements of physical connectivity. We mostly focus on invertebrates, but also consider other taxonomic groups, including microbes, fishes, plants, and amphibians.
   3. Synthesising studies that compared multiple spatial distance metrics, we found that the importance of the river network itself in explaining metacommunity patterns depended on a variety of factors, including dispersal mode (aquatic versus aerial versus terrestrial) and landscape type (arid versus mesic), as well as location- specific factors, such as network connectivity, land use, topographic heterogeneity, and biotic interactions. The river network appears to be less important for strong aerial dispersers and insects in arid systems than for other groups and biomes, but there is considerable variability. Borrowing from other literature, particularly landscape genetics, we developed a conceptual model that predicts that the explanatory power of the river network peaks in mesic systems for obligate aquatic dispersers.
   4. We propose directions of future avenues of research, including the use of manipulative field and laboratory experiments that test metacommunity theory in river networks. While field and laboratory experiments have their own benefits and drawbacks (e.g. reality, control, cost), both are powerful approaches for understanding the mechanisms structuring metacommunities, by teasing apart dispersal and niche-related factors.
   5. Finally, improving our knowledge of dispersal in river networks will benefit from expanding the breadth of cost-distance modelling to better infer dispersal from observational data; an improved understanding of life-history strategies rather than relying on independent traits; exploring individual-level variation in dispersal through detailed genetic studies; detailed studies on fine-scale environmental (e.g. daily hydrology) and organismal spatiotemporal variability; and synthesising comparative, experimental, and theoretical work. Expanding in these areas will help to push the current state of the science from a largely pattern-detection mode into a new phase of more mechanistically driven research.

AB Recent concern over global pollinator declines has led to considerable research on the effects of pesticides on bees(1-5). Although pesticides are typically not encountered at lethal levels in the field, there is growing evidence indicating that exposure to field-realistic levels can have sublethal effects on bees, affecting their foraging behaviour(1,6,7), homing ability(8,9) and reproductive success(2,5). Bees are essential for the pollination of a wide variety of crops and the majority of wild flowering plants(10-12), but until now research on pesticide effects has been limited to direct effects on bees themselves and not on the pollination services they provide. Here we show the first evidence to our knowledge that pesticide exposure can reduce the pollination services bumblebees deliver to apples, a crop of global economic importance. Bumblebee colonies exposed to a neonicotinoid pesticide provided lower visitation rates to apple trees and collected pollen less often. Most importantly, these pesticide-exposed colonies produced apples containing fewer seeds, demonstrating a reduced delivery of pollination services. Our results also indicate that reduced pollination service delivery is not due to pesticide-induced changes in individual bee behaviour, but most likely due to effects at the colony level. These findings show that pesticide exposure can impair the ability of bees to provide pollination services, with important implications for both the sustained delivery of stable crop yields and the functioning of natural ecosystems.

AB Water saving under drought stress is assured by stomatal closure driven by active (ABA-mediated) and/or passive (hydraulic-mediated) mechanisms. There is currently no comprehensive model nor any general consensus about the actual contribution and relative importance of each of the above factors in modulating stomatal closure in planta. In the present study, we assessed the contribution of passive (hydraulic) vs active (ABA mediated) mechanisms of stomatal closure in V. vinifera plants facing drought stress. Leaf gas exchange decreased progressively to zero during drought, and embolism-induced loss of hydraulic conductance in petioles peaked to similar to 50% in correspondence with strong daily limitation of stomatal conductance. Foliar ABA significantly increased only after complete stomatal closure had already occurred. Rewatering plants after complete stomatal closure and after foliar ABA reached maximum values did not induced stomatal re-opening, despite embolism recovery and water potential rise. Our data suggest that in grapevine stomatal conductance is primarily regulated by passive hydraulic mechanisms. Foliar ABA apparently limits leaf gas exchange over long-term, also preventing recovery of stomatal aperture upon rewatering, suggesting the occurrence of a mechanism of long-term down-regulation of transpiration to favor embolism repair and preserve water under conditions of fluctuating water availability and repeated drought events.

AB Urban landscape planners are increasingly becoming aware of the value of ecosystem services to the quality of life of city residents. However, the ecosystem service framework has not yet been integrated in spatial planning in a systematic way. In this paper, we assess how the ecosystem service framework is organized and implemented in the current urban green planning structure of the city of Berlin. Based on an analysis of strategic planning documents and expert interviews with local stakeholders, this work explores to what degree the ecosystem service framework is integrated in the planning system and identifies major challenges in urban green governance. As an output of the analysis of planning documents, it is identified that only very recently developed informal strategies explicitly relate to the ecosystem service framework although stakeholders are aware of the term. Identified main challenges in Berlin's urban green governance include (a) increasing development pressure from population growth and financial constraints on the municipal budget, (b) loss of expertise and (c) low awareness of green benefits among different actors through insufficient communication. The concept of ecosystem services, however, may provide a useful argument to promote the conservation of existing urban green spaces and to communicate the benefits that urban nature provides for citizens to all levels of green space governance.

AB AimSpecies often remain undetected at sites where they are present. However, the impact of imperfect detection on species distribution models (SDMs) is not fully appreciated. In this paper we evaluate the influence of imperfect detection on the calibration and discrimination capacity of SDMs. We compare the performance of three types of SDMs: (1) a technique based on presence-absence data, (2) a technique based on presence-background data, and (3) a technique based on detection/non-detection data that accounts for imperfect detection.
   InnovationWe use simulations to evaluate the impacts of imperfect detection in SDMs. This allows us to assess model performance with respect to the true objective of the models: the estimation of species distributions. We study a range of scenarios of occupancy and detection based on ecologically plausible environmental relationships and identify the circumstances in which imperfect detection affects model calibration and discrimination. We show that imperfect detection can substantially reduce the inferential and predictive accuracy of presence-absence and presence-background methods that do not account for detectability. While calibration is always affected, the influence on discrimination depends on the relationship of detectability and environmental variables.
   Main conclusionsThe performance of a model should be assessed with respect to its objectives. Comparative studies that intend to assess the performance of an SDM by evaluating its ability to predict detections rather than presences fail to reveal the benefits of accounting for detectability. Disregarding imperfect detection can have severe consequences for SDM performance, and hence for the estimation of species distributions. To date, this issue has been largely ignored in the SDM literature. Simultaneously modelling occupancy and detection does not necessarily require a greater sampling effort, but rather that data are collected so that they are informative about detectability. We recommend that consideration of imperfect detection become standard practice for species distribution modelling.

AB Interdisciplinary and multi-stakeholder research is increasingly being promoted and implemented to enhance understanding of global environment change, identify holistic policy solutions, and assist implementation. These research activities are social processes aiming to enhance the exchange and translation of knowledge. Emphasis on the design and management of knowledge exchange is increasing, but learning about how to do this better is hampered by lack of conceptual development and appropriate methods to evaluate complex and multifaceted knowledge exchange processes. This paper therefore develops principles for the evaluation of knowledge exchange in interdisciplinary, multi-stakeholder environmental change research. The paper is based on an analysis of 135 peer-reviewed evaluations of knowledge exchange from diverse disciplines. The results indicate strong relationships between the field of study (e.g. health care, environmental management), the way knowledge and knowledge exchange were conceptualised and implemented, the approach used for the evaluation, and the outcomes being evaluated. A typology of seven knowledge exchange evaluations is presented to guide discussions about the underlying assumptions of different approaches to knowledge exchange and its evaluation. Five principles for knowledge exchange evaluation are also identified: (i) design for multiple end users; (ii) be explicit about why a particular approach to knowledge exchange is expected to deliver its outcomes; (iii) evaluate diverse outcomes; (iv) use evaluations as part of the process of delivering knowledge exchange; and (v) use mixed methods to evaluate knowledge exchange. We conclude that a catch-all approach to evaluation is neither appropriate nor desirable. Instead, approaches that focus on understanding the underlying processes of knowledge exchange, assess the relative contribution of other factors in shaping outcomes in addition to knowledge exchange, and that involve multiple stakeholders in implementing evaluations, will be the most appropriate for evaluating knowledge exchange in interdisciplinary global environmental change research.

AB Recent declines in biodiversity have given new urgency to questions about the relationship between land-use change, biodiversity and ecosystem processes. Despite the existence of a large body of research on the effects of land use on species richness, it is unclear whether the effects of land use on species richness are principally direct or indirect, mediated by concomitant changes in ecosystem processes. Therefore, we compared the direct effects of land use (fertilization, mowing and grazing) on species richness with indirect ones (mediated via grassland productivity) for grasslands in central Europe. We measured the richness and above-ground biomass in 150 grassland plots in 3 regions of Germany (the so-called Biodiversity Exploratories). We used univariate and structural equation models to examine direct and indirect land-use effects. The direct effects of mowing (-0.37, effect size) and grazing (0.04) intensity on species richness were stronger compared with the indirect effects of mowing (-0.04) and grazing (-0.01). However, the strong negative effect of fertilization (-0.23) on species richness was mainly indirect, mediated by increased productivity compared with the weak direct negative effect (-0.07). Differences between regions in land-use effects showed five times weaker negative effects of mowing (-0.13) in the region with organic soils (Schorfheide-Chorin), strong overall negative effects of grazing (-0.29) for the region with organic soils opposed to a similar strong positive effect (0.30) in the Hainich-Dun region, whereas the Schwabische Alb region displayed a five times weaker positive effect (0.06) only. Further, fertilization effects on species richness were positive (0.03) for the region with organic soils compared to up to 25 times stronger negative effects in the other two regions. Synthesis. Our results clearly show the importance of studying both direct and indirect effects of land-use intensity. They demonstrate the indirect nature, via productivity, of the negative effect of fertilization intensity on plant species richness in the real-world context of management-induced gradients of intensity of fertilization, mowing and grazing. Finally, they highlight that careful consideration of regional environments is necessary before attempting to generalize land-use effects on species diversity.

AB Deterministic niche-based processes have been proposed to explain species relative abundance within communities but lead to different predictions: habitat filtering (HF) predicts dominant species to exhibit similar traits while niche differentiation (ND) requires that species have dissimilar traits to coexist. Using a multiple trait-based approach, we evaluated the relative roles of HF and ND in determining species abundances in productive grasslands. Four dimensions of the functional niche of 12 co-occurring grass species were identified using 28 plant functional traits. Using this description of the species niche, we investigated patterns of functional similarity and dissimilarity and linked them to abundance in randomly assembled six-species communities subjected to fertilization/disturbance treatments. Our results suggest that HF and ND jointly determined species abundance by acting on contrasting niche dimensions. The effect of HF decreased relative to ND with increasing disturbance and decreasing fertilization. Dominant species exhibited similar traits in communities whereas dissimilarity favored the coexistence of rare species with dominants by decreasing inter-specific competition. This stabilizing effect on diversity was suggested by a negative relationship between species over-yielding and relative abundance. We discuss the importance of considering independent dimensions of functional niche to better understand species abundance and coexistence within communities.

AB Soil microbes regulate the transfer of carbon (C) from ecosystems to the atmosphere and in doing so influence feedbacks between terrestrial ecosystems and global climate change. Fire is one element of global change that may influence soil microbial communities and, in turn, their contribution to the C dynamics of ecosystems. In order to improve our understanding of how fire influences belowground communities, we conducted a meta-analysis of 42 published microbial responses to fire. We hypothesized that microbial biomass as a whole, and fungal biomass specifically, would be altered following fires. Across all studies, fire reduced microbial abundance by an average of 33.2% and fungal abundance by an average of 47.6%. However, microbial responses to fire differed significantly among biomes and fire types. For example, microbial biomass declined following fires in boreal and temperate forests but not following grasslands fires. In addition, wildfires lead to a greater reduction in microbial biomass than prescribed burns. These differences are likely attributable to differences in fire severity among biomes and fire types. Changes in microbial abundance were significantly correlated with changes in soil CO2 emissions. Altogether, these results suggest that fires may significantly decrease microbial abundance, with corresponding consequences for soil CO2 emissions.

AB Natural ecosystems perform fundamental life-support services upon which human civilization depends. However, many people believe that nature provides these services for free and therefore, they are of little or no value. While we do not pay for them, we pay significantly for their loss in terms of wastewater treatment facilities, moratoriums on greenhouse gases, increased illnesses, reduced soil fertility and losses in those images of nature that contribute to our basic happiness. Little is understood about the well-being benefits of the natural environment and its ecosystem services. The interwoven relationship of ecosystems and human well-being is insufficiently acknowledged in the wider philosophical, social, and economic well-being literature. In this article, we discuss an approach to examine human well-being and the interactions of its four primary elements-basic human needs, economic needs, environmental needs, and subjective well-being-and ecosystem services.

AB The small size of the billions of migrating songbirds commuting between temperate breeding sites and the tropics has long prevented the study of the largest part of their annual cycle outside the breeding grounds. Using light-level loggers (geolocators), we recorded the entire annual migratory cycle of the red-backed shrike Lanius collurio, a trans-equatorial Eurasian-African passerine migrant. We tested differences between autumn and spring migration for nine individuals. Duration of migration between breeding and winter sites was significantly longer in autumn (average 96 days) when compared with spring (63 days). This difference was explained by much longer staging periods during autumn (71 days) than spring (9 days). Between staging periods, the birds travelled faster during autumn (356 km d(-1)) than during spring (233 km d(-1)). All birds made a protracted stop (53 days) in Sahelian sub-Sahara on southbound migration. The birds performed a distinct loop migration (22 000 km) where spring distance, including a detour across the Arabian Peninsula, exceeded the autumn distance by 22 per cent. Geographical scatter between routes was particularly narrow in spring, with navigational convergence towards the crossing point from Africa to the Arabian Peninsula. Temporal variation between individuals was relatively constant, while different individuals tended to be consistently early or late at different departure/arrival occasions during the annual cycle. These results demonstrate the existence of fundamentally different spatio-temporal migration strategies used by the birds during autumn and spring migration, and that songbirds may rely on distinct staging areas for completion of their annual cycle, suggesting more sophisticated endogenous control mechanisms than merely clockand-compass guidance among terrestrial solitary migrants. After a century with metal-ringing, year-round tracking of long-distance migratory songbirds promises further insights into bird migration.

AB This review reports on the effects of human activities on animal acoustic signals published in the literature from 1970 to 2009. Almost 5% of the studies on variation in animal communication tested or hypothesised on human impacts, and showed that habitat fragmentation, direct human disturbance, introduced diseases, urbanization, hunting, chemical and noise pollution may challenge animal acoustic behaviour. Although acoustic adaptations to anthropogenic habitats have been documented, human impacts have most often generated neutral variation or potential maladaptive responses. Negative impacts have been postulated in the sexual signals of fishes, amphibians, birds, and mammals; these are concerning as any maladaptive alteration of sexual behaviour may have direct bearings on breeding success and ultimately population growth rate. Acoustic communication also facilitates other vital behaviours influenced by human-driven perturbations. Bat and cetacean echolocation, for instance, is disrupted by noise pollution, whereas bird and mammal alarming is also affected by introduced diseases and hunting. Mammal social signals are sensitive to noise pollution and hunting, and birds selecting habitats by means of acoustic cues are especially vulnerable to habitat loss. Anthropogenic intervention in these cases may have a negative impact on individual survival, recruitment and group cohesion, limiting rescue-effects and triggering Alice effects. Published evidence shows that acoustic variation may be used as an early-warning indicator of perturbations even when not directly affecting individual fitness. Acoustic signalling can be studied in a broad range of ecosystems, can be recorded, analyzed, synthesised and played back with relative ease and limited economic budget, and is sensitive to many types of impacts, thus can have great conservation significance.

AB Aim Many studies have forecasted the possible impact of climate change on plant distributions using models based on ecological niche theory, but most of them have ignored dispersal-limitations, assuming dispersal to be either unlimited or null. Depending on the rate of climatic change, the landscape fragmentation and the dispersal capabilities of individual species, these assumptions are likely to prove inaccurate, leading to under-or overestimation of future species distributions and yielding large uncertainty between these two extremes. As a result, the concepts of 'potentially suitable' and 'potentially colonizable' habitat are expected to differ significantly. To quantify to what extent these two concepts can differ, we developed MIGCLIM, a model simulating plant dispersal under climate change and landscape fragmentation scenarios. MIGCLIM implements various parameters, such as dispersal distance, increase in reproductive potential over time, landscape fragmentation or long-distance dispersal.
   Location Western Swiss Alps.
   Methods Using our MIGCLIM model, several simulations were run for two virtual species by varying dispersal distance and other parameters. Each simulation covered the 100-year period 2001-2100 and three different IPCC-based temperature warming scenarios were considered.
   Results of dispersal-limited projections were compared with unlimited and no-dispersal projections. Results Our simulations indicate that: (1) using realistic parameter values, the future potential distributions generated using MIGCLIM can differ significantly (up to more than 95% difference in colonized surface) from those that ignore dispersal; (2) this divergence increases under more extreme climate warming scenarios and over longer time periods; and (3) the uncertainty associated with the warming scenario can be as large as the one related to dispersal parameters.
   Main conclusions Accounting for dispersal, even roughly, can importantly reduce uncertainty in projections of species distribution under climate change scenarios.

AB A large number of sexual selection studies have focused on examining the morphological and behavioural factors involved in male combat and female choice, such as whether large males achieve higher reproductive success compared with smaller males. However, until recently, the mechanistic reasons why such cues are linked to male dominance or female choice have been elusive. An emerging body of work shows that physiological and whole-organism performance capacities are important in individual reproductive success. Males with high performance or other physiological capacities (e.g. endurance, biting) often enjoy an advantage over males with poorer performance capacities during male-male contests. In contrast, few studies have examined links between performance and female choice. Here, we highlight recent key literature integrating sexual selection, performance and physiology. We also point to areas where a more rigorous investigation of underlying physiological processes may yield insights into sexual selection. In particular, we note that current progress in several important areas may be hampered by an inadequate physiological understanding of condition. We suggest a conceptual approach that may shed light on the physiological factors underlying condition, and we point out several other potentially important avenues for future research.

ID GENE FLOW; DISTRIBUTIONS; EVOLUTION; LIMITS
AB Biologists have long been fascinated by species' borders, and with good reason. Understanding the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of species' borders may prove to be the key that unlocks new understanding across a wide range of biological phenomena. After all, geographic range limits are a point of entry into understanding the ecological niche and threshold responses to environmental change. Elucidating patterns of gene flow to, and returning from, peripheral populations can provide important insights into the nature of adaptation, speciation and coevolution. Species' borders form natural laboratories for the study of the spatial structure of species interactions. Comparative studies from the center to the margin of species' ranges allow us to explore species' demographic responses along gradients of increasing environmental stress. Range dynamics further permit investigation into invasion dynamics and represent bellwethers for a changing climate. This set of papers explores ecological and evolutionary dynamics of species' borders from diverse empirical and theoretical perspectives.

   PREDATION
AB For most fish species, strong environmental constraints imposed by living in an aquatic medium have produced converging streamlined body forms without prehensile appendices. This similarity in body shapes highlights a common predation constraint: a predatory fish must have a jaw large enough to swallow its prey. Fish diets may then reflect local prey availability and predator-prey size ratios. Based on this size-based opportunistic predation process, the multispecies individual-based model OSMOSE (Object-oriented Simulator of Marine ecOSystem Exploitation) is used to investigate to what extent the size distribution of fish communities can contribute to better our understanding of the functioning of marine food webs and the ecosystem effects of fishing. Strong similarity in shape is found between simulated size spectra and those described in empirical studies. The existence of a curvature towards small size classes is discussed in the light of the size-based predation hypothesis, which implies that smaller fish may undergo higher predation mortality. Applying linear and quadratic regressions to the simulated size spectra allows the detection of variations in fishing pressure and the proposal of different ways to quantify them. In particular, it is shown that the slope of the size spectrum decreases quasilinearly with fishing mortality and that the curvature could help to detect ecosystem overexploitation.

AB A growing body of empirical and theoretical work supports the plausibility of sympatric speciation(1-3), but there remain few examples in which all the essential components of the process are well understood. The African indigobirds Vidua spp. are host-specific brood parasites. Indigobird nestlings are reared along with host young, and mimic the mouth markings of their respective hosts(4-6). As adults, male indigobirds mimic host song(4-7), whereas females use these songs to choose both their mates and the nests they parasitize(8). These behavioural mechanisms promote the cohesion of indigobird populations associated with a given host species, and provide a mechanism for reproductive isolation after a new host is colonized. Here we show that all indigobird species are similar genetically, but are significantly differentiated in both mitochondrial haplotype and nuclear allele frequencies. These data support a model of recent sympatric speciation. In contrast to the cuckoo Cuculus canorus, in which only female lineages are faithful to specific hosts(9,10), host switches have led to speciation in indigobirds because both males and females imprint on their hosts(8,11).

AB Aim The aim of our study was to reveal relationships between richness patterns of native vs. alien plant species and spatial heterogeneity across varying landscape patterns at a regional scale.
   Location The study was carried out in the administrative district of Dessau (Germany), covering around 4000 km(2) .
   Methods Data on plant distribution of the German vascular flora available in grid cells covering 5' longitude and 3' latitude (c . 32 km(2) ) were divided into three status groups: native plants, archaeophytes (pre 1500 AD aliens) and neophytes (post 1500 AD aliens). Land use and abiotic data layers were intersected with 125 grid cells comprising the selected area. Using novel landscape ecological methods, we calculated 38 indices of landscape composition and configuration for each grid cell. Principal components analysis (PCA) with a set of 29 selected, low correlated landscape indices was followed by multiple linear regression analysis.
   Results PCA reduced 29 indices to eight principal components (PCs) that explained 80% cumulative variance. Multiple linear regression analysis was highly significant and explained 41% to 60% variance in plant species distribution (adjusted R-2 ) with three significant PCs (tested for spatial autocorrelation) expressing moderate to high disturbance levels and high spatial heterogeneity. Comparing the significance of the PCs for the species groups, native plant species richness is most strongly associated with riverine ecosystems, followed by urban ecosystems, and then small-scale rural ecosystems. Archaeophyte and neophyte richness are most strongly associated with urban ecosystems, followed by small-scale rural ecosystems and riverine ecosystems for archaeophytes, and riverine ecosystems and small-scale rural ecosystems for neophytes.
   Main conclusions Our overall results suggest that species richness of native and alien plants increases with moderate levels of natural and/or anthropogenic disturbances, coupled with high levels of habitat and structural heterogeneity in urban, riverine, and small-scale rural ecosystems. Despite differences in the order of relevance of PCs for the three plant groups, we conclude that at the regional scale species richness patterns of native plants as well as alien plants are promoted by similar factors.

AB Remote sensing of net primary production (NPP) is a critical tool for assessing spatial and temporal patterns of carbon exchange between the atmosphere and biosphere. However, satellite estimates suffer from a lack of large-scale field data needed for validation, as well as the need to parameterize plant light-use efficiencies (LUEs). In this study, we estimated cropland NPP with the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach (CASA), a biogeochemical model driven by satellite observations, and then compared these results with field estimates based on harvest data from United States Department of Agriculture National Agriculture Statistics Service (NASS) county statistics. Observed interannual variations in NPP over a 17-year period were well modelled by CASA, with exceptions mainly due to occasional difficulties in estimating NPP from harvest yields. The role of environmental stressors in agriculture was investigated by running CASA with and without temperature and moisture down-regulators, which are used in the model to simulate climate impacts on plant LUE. In most cases, correlations with NASS data were highest with modelled stresses, while the opposite was true for irrigated and temperature resistant crops. Analysis of the spatial variability in computed LUE revealed significantly higher values for corn than for other crops, suggesting a simple parameterization of LUE for future studies based on the fraction of area with corn. Absolute values of LUE were much lower than those reported in field trials, due to uncommonly high yields in most field trials, as well as overestimates of absorbed radiation in CASA attributed to bias from temporal compositing of satellite data. Total NPP for US croplands, excluding Alaska and Hawaii, was estimated as 0.62 Pg C year(-1) , representing similar to20% of total US NPP, and exhibited a positive trend of 3.7 Tg C year(-2) . These results have several implications for large-scale carbon cycle research that are discussed, and are especially relevant for studies of the role of agriculture in the global carbon balance.

   ENRICHMENT
AB By means of meta-analyses we determined how 70 traits related to plant anatomy, morphology, chemistry, physiology, growth and reproduction are affected by daily light integral (DLI; mol photons m(-2) d(-1)). A large database including 500 experiments with 760 plant species enabled us to determine generalized dose-response curves. Many traits increase with DLI in a saturating fashion. Some showed a more than 10-fold increase over the DLI range of 1-50 mol m(-2) d(-1), such as the number of seeds produced per plant and the actual rate of photosynthesis. Strong decreases with DLI (up to three-fold) were observed for leaf area ratio and leaf payback time. Plasticity differences among species groups were generally small compared with the overall responses to DLI. However, for a number of traits, including photosynthetic capacity and realized growth, we found woody and shade-tolerant species to have lower plasticity. We further conclude that the direction and degree of trait changes adheres with responses to plant density and to vertical light gradients within plant canopies. This synthesis provides a strong quantitative basis for understanding plant acclimation to light, from molecular to whole plant responses, but also identifies the variables that currently form weak spots in our knowledge, such as respiration and reproductive characteristics.

AB It is well established that resource quantity and elemental stoichiometry play major roles in shaping below and aboveground plant biodiversity, but their importance for shaping microbial diversity in soil remains unclear. Here, we used statistical modeling on a regional database covering 179 locations and six ecosystem types across Scotland to evaluate the roles of total carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availabilities and ratios, together with land use, climate and biotic and abiotic factors, in determining regional scale patterns of soil bacterial diversity. We found that bacterial diversity and composition were primarily driven by variation in soil resource stoichiometry (total C:N:P ratios), itself linked to different land uses, and secondarily driven by other important biodiversity drivers such as climate, soil spatial heterogeneity, soil pH, root influence (plant-soil microbe interactions) and microbial biomass (soil microbe-microbe interactions). In aggregate, these findings provide evidence that nutrient stoichiometry is a strong predictor of bacterial diversity and composition at a regional scale.

AB Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most important cereal grains in the world today and serves as a staple food source for more than half of the world's population. Research into when, where, and how rice was brought into cultivation and eventually domesticated, along with its development into a staple food source, is thus essential. These questions have been a point of nearly continuous research in both archaeology and genetics, and new information has continually come to light as theory, data acquisition, and analytical techniques have advanced over time. Here, we review the broad history of our scientific understanding of the rice domestication process from both an archaeological and genetic perspective and examine in detail the information that has come to light in both of these fields in the last 10 y. Current findings from genetics and archaeology are consistent with the domestication of O. sativa japonica in the Yangtze River valley of southern China. Interestingly, although it appears rice was cultivated in the area by as early 8000 BP, the key domestication trait of nonshattering was not fixed for another 1,000 y or perhaps longer. Rice was also cultivated in India as early as 5000 BP, but the domesticated indica subspecies currently appears to be a product of the introgression of favorable alleles from japonica. These findings are reshaping our understanding of rice domestication and also have implications for understanding the complex evolutionary process of plant domestication.

AB The boreal zone and its ecosystems provide numerous provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services. Because of its resources and its hydroelectric potential, Canada's boreal zone is important to the country's resource-based economy. The region presently occupied by Canada's boreal zone has experienced dramatic changes during the past 3 million years as the climate cooled and repeated glaciations affected both the biota and the landscape. For about the past 7000 years, climate, fire, insects, diseases, and their interactions have been the most important natural drivers of boreal ecosystem dynamics, including rejuvenation, biogeochemical cycling, maintenance of productivity, and landscape variability. Layered upon natural drivers are changes increasingly caused by people and development and those related to human-caused climate change. Effects of these agents vary spatially and temporally, and, as global population increases, the demands and impacts on ecosystems will likely increase. Understanding how humans directly affect terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in Canada's boreal zone and how these effects and actions interact with natural disturbance agents is a prerequisite for informed and adaptive decisions about management of natural resources, while maintaining the economy and environment upon which humans depend. This paper reports on the genesis and present condition of the boreal zone and its ecosystems and sets the context for a detailed scientific investigation in subsequent papers published in this journal on several key aspects: carbon in boreal forests; climate change consequences, adaptation, and mitigation; nutrient and elemental cycling; protected areas; status, impacts, and risks of non-native species; factors affecting sustainable timber harvest levels; terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity; and water and wetland resources.

AB Feed-efficient animals have lower production costs and reduced environmental impact. Given that rumen microbial fermentation plays a pivotal role in host nutrition, the premise that rumen microbiota may contribute to host feed efficiency is gaining momentum. Since diet is a major factor in determining rumen community structure and fermentation patterns, we investigated the effect of divergence in phenotypic residual feed intake (RFI) on ruminal community structure of beef cattle across two contrasting diets. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) were performed to profile the rumen bacterial population and to quantify the ruminal populations of Entodinium spp., protozoa, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Ruminococcus albus, Prevotella brevis, the genus Prevotella, and fungi in 14 low (efficient)- and 14 high (inefficient)-RFI animals offered a low-energy, high-forage diet, followed by a high-energy, low-forage diet. Canonical correspondence and Spearman correlation analyses were used to investigate associations between physiological variables and rumen microbial structure and specific microbial populations, respectively. The effect of RFI on bacterial profiles was influenced by diet, with the association between RFI group and PCR-DGGE profiles stronger for the higher forage diet. qPCR showed that Prevotella abundance was higher (P < 0.0001) in inefficient animals. A higher (P < 0.0001) abundance of Entodinium and Prevotella spp. and a lower (P < 0.0001) abundance of Fibrobacter succinogenes were observed when animals were offered the low-forage diet. Thus, differences in the ruminal microflora may contribute to host feed efficiency, although this effect may also be modulated by the diet offered.

AB Background and Aims Specific leaf area (SLA), a key element of the 'worldwide leaf economics spectrum', is the preferred 'soft' plant trait for assessing soil fertility. SLA is a function of leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and leaf thickness (LT). The first, LDMC, defines leaf construction costs and can be used instead of SLA. However, LT identifies shade at its lowest extreme and succulence at its highest, and is not related to soil fertility. Why then is SLA more frequently used as a predictor of soil fertility than LDMC?
   Methods SLA, LDMC and LT were measured and leaf density (LD) estimated for almost 2000 species, and the capacity of LD to predict LDMC was examined, as was the relative contribution of LDMC and LT to the expression of SLA. Subsequently, the relationships between SLA, LDMC and LT with respect to soil fertility and shade were described.
   Key Results Although LD is strongly related to LDMC, and LDMC and LT each contribute equally to the expression of SLA, the exact relationships differ between ecological groupings. LDMC predicts leaf nitrogen content and soil fertility but, because LT primarily varies with light intensity, SLA increases in response to both increased shade and increased fertility.
   Conclusions Gradients of soil fertility are frequently also gradients of biomass accumulation with reduced irradiance lower in the canopy. Therefore, SLA, which includes both fertility and shade components, may often discriminate better between communities or treatments than LDMC. However, LDMC should always be the preferred trait for assessing gradients of soil fertility uncoupled from shade. Nevertheless, because leaves multitask, individual leaf traits do not necessarily exhibit exact functional equivalence between species. In consequence, rather than using a single stand-alone predictor, multivariate analyses using several leaf traits is recommended.

AB The question of how genetic variation translates into organismal diversity has puzzled biologists for decades. Despite recent advances in evolutionary and developmental genetics, the mechanisms that underlie adaptation, diversification and evolutionary innovation remain largely unknown. The exceptionally diverse species flocks of cichlid fishes are textbook examples of adaptive radiation and explosive speciation and emerge as powerful model systems to study the genetic basis of animal diversification. East Africa's hundreds of endemic cichlid species are akin to a natural mutagenesis screen and differ greatly not only in ecologically relevant (hence naturally selected) characters such as mouth morphology and body shape, but also in sexually selected traits such as coloration. One of the most fascinating aspects of cichlid evolution is the frequent occurrence of evolutionary parallelisms, which has led to the question whether selection alone is sufficient to produce these parallel morphologies, or whether a developmental or genetic bias has influenced the direction of diversification. Here, I review fitness-relevant traits that could be responsible for the cichlids' evolutionary success and assess whether these were shaped by sexual or natural selection. I then focus on the interaction and the relative importance of sexual vs. natural selection in cichlid evolution. Finally, I discuss what is currently known about the genes underlying the morphogenesis of adaptively relevant traits and highlight the importance of the forthcoming cichlid genomes in the quest of the genetic basis of diversification in this group.

AB Climate change has already altered global patterns of biodiversity by modifying the geographic distributions of species. Forecasts based on bioclimatic envelop modeling of distributions of species suggests greater impacts can be expected in the future, but such projections are contingent on assumptions regarding future climate and migration rates of species. Here, we present a first assessment of the potential impact of climate change on a global biodiversity hotspot in southwestern Western Australia. Across three representative scenarios of future climate change, we simulated migration of 100 Banksia (Proteaceae) species at a rate of 5 km decade(-1) and compared projected impacts with those under the commonly applied, but acknowledged as inadequate, assumptions of 'full-' and 'no-migration.' Across all climate x migration scenarios, 66% of species were projected to decline, whereas only 6% were projected to expand or remain stable. Between 5% and 25% of species were projected to suffer range losses of 100% by 2080, depending mainly on climate scenario. Species losses were driven primarily by changes in current precipitation regimes, with the greatest losses of species projected to occur in a transition zone between wet coastal areas and interior arid regions and which is projected to become more arid in the future. Because the ranges of most species tended to collapse in all climate scenarios, we found that climate change impacts to flora of southwestern Western Australia may be large, even under optimistic assumptions regarding migration abilities. Taken together, our results suggest that the future of biodiversity in southwestern Western Australia may lie largely in the degree to which this hotspot experiences increased drought and in the ability of species to tolerate such decreases in precipitation. More broadly, our study is among a growing number of theoretical studies suggesting the impacts of future climate change on global biodiversity may be considerable.

AB 1. Identifying the habitat features that influence habitat selection and enhance fitness is critical for effective management. Ecological theory predicts that habitat choices should be adaptive, such that fitness is enhanced in preferred habitats. However, studies often report mismatches between habitat preferences and fitness consequences across a wide variety of taxa based on a single spatial scale and/or a single fitness component.
   2. We examined whether habitat preferences of a declining shrub steppe songbird, the Brewer's sparrow Spizella breweri, were adaptive when multiple reproductive fitness components and spatial scales (landscape, territory and nest patch) were considered.
   3. We found that birds settled earlier and in higher densities, together suggesting preference, in landscapes with greater shrub cover and height. Yet nest success was not higher in these landscapes; nest success was primarily determined by nest predation rates. Thus landscape preferences did not match nest predation risk. Instead, nestling mass and the number of nesting attempts per pair increased in preferred landscapes, raising the possibility that landscapes were chosen on the basis of food availability rather than safe nest sites.
   4. At smaller spatial scales (territory and nest patch), birds preferred different habitat features (i.e. density of potential nest shrubs) that reduced nest predation risk and allowed greater season-long reproductive success.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Habitat preferences reflect the integration of multiple environmental factors across multiple spatial scales, and individuals may have more than one option for optimizing fitness via habitat selection strategies. Assessments of habitat quality for management prescriptions should ideally include analysis of diverse fitness consequences across multiple ecologically relevant spatial scales.

AB Seasonal food habits and activity patterns were examined for grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in west-central Alberta, Canada, to better understand habitat requirements in a threatened population. Food habits were based on an analysis of 665 feces collected from 18 grizzly bears between April and October 2001-2003. Trends in the use of foods were comparable to those of other central Rocky Mountain populations, with minor differences likely reflecting regional habitat and forage availability. Five activities (bedding, sweet vetch digging, insect feeding, frugivory, and ungulate kills) were identified for each of 1,032 field-visited global positioning system radiotelemetry locations from 9 female grizzly bears. We predicted the probability of each activity during relevant periods by time of day (crepuscular, diurnal, and nocturnal) and habitat. Selection ratios were used to assess which habitat and time periods were selected. Activity patterns changed considerably over a 24-h period, with foraging activities occurring mostly during diurnal and crepuscular periods and bedding at night. Habitats were important predictors of activity. Forested areas were selected for bedding areas, whereas digging, insect-foraging, and frugivory activities were associated with herbaceous, recently disturbed forest and open-canopy forests. We suggest that researchers consider behavior and time of day in analyses of habitat selection to improve explanations of habitat use and mechanisms of selection.

AB Ecological transition zones, where organismal phenotypes result from a delicate balance between selection and migration, highlight the interplay of local adaptation and gene flow. Here, I study the response of an entire species assemblage to natural selection across a common ecotone. Three lizard species, distributed along a dramatic environmental gradient in substrate color, display convergent adaptation of blanched coloration on the gypsum dunes of White Sands National Monument. I investigate the role of gene flow in modulating phenotypic response to selection by quantifying color variation and genetic variation across the ecotone. I find species differences in degree of background matching and in genetic connectivity of populations across the ecotone. Differences among species in phenotypic response to selection scale precisely to levels of genetic isolation. Species with higher levels of gene flow across the ecotone exhibit less dramatic responses to selection. Results also reveal a strong signal of ecologically mediated divergence for White Sands lizards. For all species, phenotypic variation is better explained by habitat similarity than genetic similarity. Convergent evolution of blanched coloration at White Sands clearly reflects the action of strong divergent selection; however, adaptive response appears to be modulated by gene flow and demographic history and can be predicted by divergence-with-gene-flow models.

AB The concentration of nitrogen in foliage has been related to rates of net photosynthesis across a wide range of plant species and functional groups and thus represents a simple and biologically meaningful link between terrestrial cycles of carbon and nitrogen. Although foliar N is used by ecosystem models to predict rates of leaf-level photosynthesis, it has rarely been examined as a direct scalar to stand-level carbon gain. Establishment of such relationships would greatly simplify the nature of forest C and N linkages, enhancing our ability to derive estimates of forest productivity at landscape to regional scales. Here, we report on a highly predictive relationship between whole-canopy nitrogen concentration and aboveground forest productivity in diverse forested stands of varying age and species composition across the 360 000-ha White Mountain National Forest, New Hampshire, USA. We also demonstrate that hyperspectral remote sensing can be used to estimate foliar N concentration, and hence forest production across a large number of contiguous images. Together these data suggest that canopy-level N concentration is an important correlate of productivity in these forested systems, and that imaging spectrometry of canopy N can provide direct estimates of forest productivity across large landscapes.

AB We present likelihood-based methods for assigning the individuals in a sample to source populations, on the basis of their genotypes at co-dominant marker loci. The source populations are assumed to be at Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium, but the allelic composition of these source populations and even the number of source populations represented in the sample are treated as uncertain. The parameter of interest is the partition of the set of sampled individuals, induced by the assignment of individuals to source populations. We present a maximum likelihood method, and then a more powerful Bayesian approach for estimating this sample partition. In general, it will not be feasible to evaluate the evidence supporting each possible partition of the sample. Furthermore, when the number of individuals in the sample is large, it may not even be feasible to evaluate the evidence supporting, individually, each of the most plausible partitions because there may be many individuals which are difficult to assign. To overcome these problems, we use low-dimensional marginals (the 'co-assignment probabilities') of the posterior distribution of the sample partition as measures of 'similarity', and then apply a hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify clusters of individuals whose assignment together is well supported by the posterior distribution, A binary tree provides a visual representation of how well the posterior distribution supports each cluster in the hierarchy. These methods are applicable to other problems where the parameter of interest is a partition of a set. Because the co-assignment probabilities are independent of the arbitrary labelling of source populations, we avoid the label-switching problem of previous Bayesian methods.

AB Variation at five microsatellite DNA loci scored in approximate to 1300 individuals provided evidence of genetic structure among 14 cod (Gadus morhua) populations spanning the range of the species in the northwest (NW) Atlantic. Using DA and Ds, measures of genetic distance, as well as F-ST and R-ST measures of population structure, differences are revealed among populations at continental shelf scales (NE Newfoundland Shelf, Grand Banks, Flemish Cap, Scotian Shelf, Georges Bank) where regions are separated by submarine saddles, channels and trenches. However, we also provide evidence of genetic structure at spawning-bank scales consistent with variation in oceanographic features and in the spatiotemporal distribution of spawning, each of which may represent barriers to gene flow among geographically contiguous populations inhabiting a highly advective environment. The differences described are consistent with postdispersal spawning fidelity to natal areas,a behaviour that may be facilitated by topographically induced gyre-like circulations that can act as retention mechanisms. Significant degrees of substructure among neighbouring and contiguous cod populations may be most easily explained by the associated oceanographic features and processes that conceivably form the template for the evolution of the structure. We suggest that bathymetric and hydrodynamic structure represents a rational starting point for developing hypotheses to examine the processes that lead to the genetic structuring of marine fish species.

AB Uptake by soils is a relatively small flux in the global budget of atmospheric methane, but CH4 consumption rates in soils could be susceptible to changes in land use and climate. Global estimates of the soil sink for atmospheric CH4 are usually made by multiplying averages of small chamber measurements for various ecosystem types (or other strata) by estimates of the area covered by each stratum. Process-level models driven by gridded databases can also be used to make global flux estimates, to evaluate potential effects of changes in climate and land use, and to identify weaknesses in both data and mechanistic understanding. Methane uptake by soils is an appropriate process to model globally because the probable controls are simple relative to many other microbially mediated soil processes of trace gas production and consumption. Field experience suggests that diffusion of atmospheric CH4 into the soil is the primary factor limiting rates of CH4 oxidation in many soils. We have applied a modified version of Fick's first law based on theoretical computations for diffusivity in aggregated media, together with a soil water balance model run on a 1 degrees global grid, to make independent estimates of CH4 uptake by soils worldwide. Uptake rates were assumed to be zero in very dry desert soils that are mostly devoid of microbial activity, in frozen soils, and in wetlands that are usually CH4 sources. Our mechanistically based model supports a reference case for global net consumption of CH4 in soils of 17-23 Tg yr(-1), which is near the middle of previously reported ranges; and is close to our own mean estimate from extrapolation of flux means across ecosystem strata (21 Tg CH4 yr(-1)). A new inference of our modeling approach is that over 40% of the soil sink for CH4 occurs in warm and relatively dry ecosystems, such as semi-arid steppe, tropical savanna, tropical seasonal forest, and chaparral. This model prediction results from a favorable climate regime, high porosity in coarse-to-medium textured soils, and low moisture content that permits rapid gaseous diffusion in these semi arid and seasonally dry tropical ecosystems. Very few data on CH4 fluxes exist from these areas that can be used to compare with model predictions. Because of this paucity of data where uptake rates may be relatively high, and because humans have altered these landscapes extensively, our results suggest that more study is needed in seasonally dry ecosystems in order to understand the impacts of land-use change on soil sinks for methane.

AB Life history traits (mean and maximum body length of females, number of embryos per brood = brood size, embryo diameter, number of broods per female, lifespan of females) for 302 populations of aquatic gammaridean amphipods, representing 214 species in 16 superfamilies, were reviewed. The variation of these traits, of lifetime potential fecundity (i.e. the number of embryos produced per female lifespan) and of reproductive potential (i.e. the number of embryos produced per female per year), with temperature (latitude), depth, salinity and superfamily, was investigated by various univariate and multivariate methods. Gammaridean amphipods comprise semelparous and iteroparous populations and species, with semiannual, annual, biannual or perennial life cycles. However, most gammarideans studied so far are iteroparous annuals. Body length explains most of the variation in brood size and embryo diameter. The reproductive potential may be increased by increasing body size for a constant breeding frequency, by increasing brood size at the expense of smaller embryos, by increasing breeding frequency for a constant lifespan at the expense of smaller individual broods and/or embryos, and by increasing longevity for a constant breeding frequency and brood size. Combinations of these different options constitute the life history patterns of gammarideans, which vary across superfamilies, latitude and depth, and cannot simply be explained by variations in body length. High latitude species were generally characterized by biannual or perennial life histories, large body size, delayed maturity, and single or few broods with many, relatively large embryos; converse sets of traits characterized low latitude species. Deep-living species had relatively smaller broods and embryos than their shallow-living relatives, yet did not produce more broods. However, different superfamilies dominated in different habitats. The importance of natural selection relative to phylogenetic (historical) and physiological constraints in the forging of these patterns is discussed.

AB Neonicotinoid use has increased rapidly in recent years, with a global shift toward insecticide applications as seed coatings rather than aerial spraying. While the use of seed coatings can lessen the amount of overspray and drift, the near universal and prophylactic use of neonicotinoid seed coatings on major agricultural crops has led to widespread detections in the environment (pollen, soil, water, honey). Pollinators and aquatic insects appear to be especially susceptible to the effects of neonicotinoids with current research suggesting that chronic sublethal effects are more prevalent than acute toxicity. Meanwhile, evidence of clear and consistent yield benefits from the use of neonicotinoids remains elusive for most crops. Future decisions on neonicotinoid use will benefit from weighing crop yield benefits versus environmental impacts to nontarget organisms and considering whether there are more environmentally benign alternatives.

AB Statistically underpowered studies can result in experimental failure even when all other experimental considerations have been addressed impeccably. In fMRI the combination of a large number of dependent variables, a relatively small number of observations (subjects), and a need to correct for multiple comparisons can decrease statistical power dramatically. This problem has been clearly addressed yet remains controversial-especially in regards to the expected effect sizes in fMRI, and especially for between-subjects effects such as group comparisons and brain-behavior correlations. We aimed to clarify the power problem by considering and contrasting two simulated scenarios of such possible brain-behavior correlations: weak diffuse effects and strong localized effects. Sampling from these scenarios shows that, particularly in the weak diffuse scenario, common sample sizes (n = 20-30) display extremely low statistical power, poorly represent the actual effects in the full sample, and show large variation on subsequent replications. Empirical data from the Human Connectome Project resembles the weak diffuse scenario much more than the localized strong scenario, which underscores the extent of the power problem for many studies. Possible solutions to the power problem include increasing the sample size, using less stringent thresholds, or focusing on a region-of-interest. However, these approaches are not always feasible and some have major drawbacks. The most prominent solutions that may help address the power problem include model-based (multivariate) prediction methods and meta-analyses with related synthesis-oriented approaches.

AB Several global gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) remote sensing products exist, mainly provided by machine-learning (e.g. MPI-BGC) and semi-empirical (e.g. MODIS) approaches. Process-based approaches have the advantage of representing the atmosphere-vegetation-soil system and associated fluxes as an organic integration, but their sophistication results in a lack of high spatiotemporal resolution continuous products. Targeting this gap, we reported a new set of global 8-day composite 1-km resolution GPP and ET products from 2000 to 2015, using a simplified process-based model, the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS). BESS couples atmosphere and canopy radiative transfer, photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, and uses MODIS atmosphere and land data and other satellite data sources as inputs. We evaluated BESS products against FLUXNET observations at site scale (total of 113 sites, 742 site years), and against MPI-BGC products at global scale. At site scale, BESS 8-day Products agreed with FLUXNET observations with R-2 = 0.67 and RMSE = 2.58 gCm(-2) d(-1) for GPP, and R-2 = 0.62 and RMSE = 0.78 mm d(-1) for ET, respectively, and they captured a majority of seasonal variability, about half of spatial variability, and a minority of interannual variability in FLUXNET observations. At global scale, BESS mean annual sum GPP and ET maps agreed with MPI-BGC products with R-2 = 0.93 and RMSE = 229 gC m(-2) y(-1) for GPP, and R-2 = 0.90 and RMSE = 118 mm y(-1) for ET, respectively. Over the period of 2001-2011, BESS quantified the mean global GPP and ET as 122 +/- 25 PgC y(-1) and 65 x 10(3) +/- 11 x 10(3) km(3) y(-1), respectively, with a significant ascending GPP trend by 0.27 PgC y(-2) (p < 0.05), similar to MPI-BGC products as well. Overall, BESS GPP and ET estimates were comparable with FLUXNET observations and MPI-BGC products. The process-based BESS can serve as a set of independent GPP and ET products from official MODIS GPP and ET products. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for all life, on Earth and it acts as a major control on biological productivity in the modem ocean. Accurate reconstructions of the evolution of life over the course of the last four billion years therefore demand a better understanding of nitrogen bioavailability and speciation through time. The biogeochemical nitrogen cycle has evidently been closely tied to the redox state of the ocean and atmosphere. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the Earth's surface has passed in a non-linear fashion from an anoxic state in the Hadean to an oxic state in the later Phanerozoic. It is therefore likely that the nitrogen cycle has changed markedly over time, with potentially severe implications for the productivity and evolution of the biosphere. Here we compile nitrogen isotope data from the literature and review our current understanding of the evolution of the nitrogen cycle, with particular emphasis on the Precambrian. Combined with recent work on redox conditions, trace metal availability, sulfur and iron cycling on the early Earth, we then use the nitrogen isotope record as a platform to test existing and new hypotheses about biogeochemical pathways that may have controlled nitrogen availability through time. Among other things, we conclude that (a) abiotic nitrogen sources were likely insufficient to sustain a large biosphere, thus favoring an early origin of biological N-2 fixation, (b) evidence of nitrate in the Neoarchean and Paleoproterozoic confirm current views of increasing surface oxygen levels at,those times, (c) abundant ferrous iron and sulfide in the mid-Precambrian ocean may have affected the speciation and size of the fixed nitrogen reservoir, and (d) nitrate availability alone was not a major driver of eukaryotic evolution.

AB Agricultural intensification can involve the simplification of agroecosystems to crop monocultures while the practices of crop rotation, intercropping and companion planting maintain some crop diversity over time and space. It is generally postulated that reduced diversity can have an impact on ecosystem function. Here we determine whether decreased aboveground crop diversity affects belowground microbial biodiversity by conducting a meta-analysis of studies comparing monocultures and crop rotations. We based taxonomic richness and diversity indices on both molecular and biochemical fingerprinting methods. Soils under a higher diversity of crops in rotation produced higher microbial richness (+15.11%, n = 26) and diversity (+3.36%, n = 43) scores. This effect was significantly influenced by the proxy and methodology used where pyrosequencing produced higher richness scores compared to fingerprinting methods. Longer study trials produced larger increases in microbial richness, although the opposite was true for microbial diversity. The addition of legumes to rotation had no consistent effects on microbial diversity or richness. Whether the overall rotation-effect on microbial diversity promotes ecosystem functioning in terms of nutrient cycling and resilience to stress remains unclear. Future studies that incorporate next-generation sequencing techniques will help to elucidate complex microbial community structures and specific functional niches in agroecosystems.

AB The increased availability of spatial data and methodological developments in species distribution modelling has lead to concurrent advances in phylogeography, broadening the scope of questions studied, as well as providing unprecedented insights. Given the species-specific nature of the information provided by ecological niche models (ENMs), whether it is on the environmental tolerances of species or their estimated distribution, today or in the past, it is perhaps not surprising that ENMs have rapidly become a common tool in phylogeographic analysis. Such information is essential to phylogeographic tests that provide important biological insights. Here, we provide an overview of the different applications of ENMs in phylogeographic studies, detailing specific studies and highlighting general limitations and challenges with each application. Given that the full potential of integrating ENMs into phylogeographic cannot be realized unless the ENMs themselves are carefully applied, we provide a summary of best practices with using ENMs. Lastly, we describe some recent advances in how quantitative information from ENMs can be integrated into genetic analyses, illustrating their potential use (and key concerns with such implementations), as well as promising areas for future development.

AB 1. Herbivore regulation is one of the services provided by plant diversity in terrestrial ecosystems. It has been suggested that tree diversity decreases insect herbivory in forests, but recent studies have reported opposite patterns, indicating that tree diversity can trigger associational resistance or susceptibility. The mechanisms underlying the tree diversity-resistance relationship thus remain a matter of debate.
   2. We assessed insect herbivory on pedunculate oak saplings (Quercus robur) in a large-scale experiment in which we manipulated tree diversity and identity by mixing oaks, birch and pine species.
   3. Tree diversity at the plot scale had no effect on damage due to leaf chewers, but abundance of leaf miners decreased with increasing tree diversity. The magnitude of this associational resistance increased with host dilution, consistent with the 'resource concentration hypothesis'.
   4. At a smaller scale, we estimated tree apparency as the difference in total height between focal oak saplings and their nearest neighbouring trees. Levels of oak infestation with leaf miners decreased significantly with decreasing tree apparency. As the probability of having taller neighbours increased with tree diversity, notably due to the increase in the proportion of faster growing nonhost trees, such as birches and pines, tree apparency may be seen as a 'hidden', sampling effect of tree diversity.
   5. Synthesis. These findings suggest that greater host dilution and lower tree apparency contribute to associational resistance in young trees. They also highlight the importance of taking plant size into account as a covariate, to avoid misleading interpretations about the biodiversity-resistance relationship.

AB Although an African origin of the modern human species is generally accepted, the evolutionary processes involved in the speciation, geographical spread, and eventual extinction of archaic humans outside of Africa are much debated. An additional complexity has been the recent evidence of limited interbreeding between modern humans and the Neandertals and Denisovans. Modern human migrations and interactions began during the buildup to the Last Glacial Maximum, starting about 100,000 years ago. By examining the history of other organisms through glacial cycles, valuable models for evolutionary biogeography can be formulated. According to one such model, the adoption of a new refugium by a subgroup of a species may lead to important evolutionary changes.

AB P>1. Intraspecific trait variability is a crucial, often neglected, component of functional diversity (FD) in ecological communities. In particular, uncertainty remains as to the importance of intraspecific variability in the quantification of FD.
   2. To explore this uncertainty, we propose two methods addressing two critical and complementary, but largely unexplored, questions: (i) what is the extent of within- vs. between-species FD in different communities? and (ii) to what extent is the response of FD to environment because of compositional turnover vs. intraspecific trait variability across habitats? The methods proposed to address these questions are built on a variance partitioning approach and have the advantage of including species relative abundance, therefore taking into account species dominance and rarity. For each of the questions, we illustrate one dedicated case study in semi-natural grasslands with associated sampling strategies.
   3. The decomposition of total community variance into within- vs. between-species effects can be implemented in a manner similar to the decomposition of quadratic entropy on pairwise individual dissimilarity. The approach can be applied with single and multiple traits, although it proves more informative for single traits. It can prove particularly useful when assessing the role of different sources of trait variability in the assembly of communities.
   4. The assessment of the relative contribution of intraspecific trait variability and species turnover to the response of FD to environment is based on a variance partitioning comparing FD indices computed (i) either using individuals measured in a specific habitat alone (FDhabitat) or (ii) all individuals measured across different habitats (FDfixed). This approach provides a more complete understanding of the response of FD to environment.
   5. We further propose a guide to apply these two methods and to choose the most suitable method for intraspecific trait measurements. Assessing the role of intraspecific trait variability should allow a more comprehensive understanding of the processes that link species and ecosystems.

   RANDOM-WALK; MODELS; AUTOCORRELATION; DIFFUSION; ESTIMATORS; PREFERENCE
AB Background: Although habitat use reflects a dynamic process, most studies assess habitat use statically as if an animal's successively recorded locations reflected a point rather than a movement process. By relying on the activity time between successive locations instead of the local density of individual locations, movement-based methods can substantially improve the biological relevance of utilization distribution (UD) estimates (i.e. the relative frequencies with which an animal uses the various areas of its home range, HR). One such method rests on Brownian bridges (BBs). Its theoretical foundation (purely and constantly diffusive movements) is paradoxically inconsistent with both HR settlement and habitat selection. An alternative involves movement-based kernel density estimation (MKDE) through location interpolation, which may be applied to various movement behaviours but lacks a sound theoretical basis.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: I introduce the concept of a biased random (advective-diffusive) bridge (BRB) and show that the MKDE method is a practical means to estimate UDs based on simplified (isotropically diffusive) BRBs. The equation governing BRBs is constrained by the maximum delay between successive relocations warranting constant within-bridge advection (allowed to vary between bridges) but remains otherwise similar to the BB equation. Despite its theoretical inconsistencies, the BB method can therefore be applied to animals that regularly reorientate within their HRs and adapt their movements to the habitats crossed, provided that they were relocated with a high enough frequency.
   Conclusions/Significance: Biased random walks can approximate various movement types at short times from a given relocation. Their simplified form constitutes an effective trade-off between too simple, unrealistic movement models, such as Brownian motion, and more sophisticated and realistic ones, such as biased correlated random walks (BCRWs), which are too complex to yield functional bridges. Relying on simplified BRBs proves to be the most reliable and easily usable way to estimate UDs from serially correlated relocations and raw activity information.

   Bayesian belief network
ID SYSTEM
AB This paper presents a scheme for large engineering project risk management using a Bayesian belief network and applies it to the Korean shipbuilding industry. Twenty-six different risks were deduced from expert interviews and a literature review. A survey analysis was conducted on 252 experts from 11 major Korean shipbuilding companies in April 2007. The overall major risks were design change, design manpower, and raw material supply as internal risks, and exchange rate as external risk in both large-scale and medium-sized shipbuilding companies. Differences of project performance risks between large-scale and medium-sized shipbuilding companies were identified. Exceeding time schedule and specification discontent were more important to large-scale shipbuilding companies, while exceeding budget and exceeding time schedule were more important to medium-sized shipbuilding companies. The change of project performance risks was measured by risk reduction activities of quality management, and strikes at headquarters and subcontractors, in both large-scale and medium-sized shipbuilding companies. The research results should be valuable in enabling industrial participants to manage their large engineering project risks and in extending our understanding of Korean shipbuilding risks.

AB We studied the phylogeography of Chinese yew (Taxus wallichiana), a tree species distributed over most of southern China and adjacent regions. A total of 1235 individuals from 50 populations from China and North Vietnam were analysed for chloroplast DNA variation using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism of the trnL-F intron-spacer region. A total of 19 different haplotypes were distinguished. We found a very high level of population differentiation and a strong phylogeographic pattern, suggesting low levels of recurrent gene flow among populations. Haplotype differentiation was most marked along the boundary between the Sino-Himalayan and Sino-Japanese Forest floristic subkingdoms, with only one haplotype being shared among these two subkingdoms. The Malesian and Sino-Himalayan Forest subkingdoms had five and 10 haplotypes, respectively, while the relatively large Sino-Japanese Forest subkingdom had only eight. The strong geography-haplotype correlation persisted at the regional floristic level, with most regions possessing a unique set of haplotypes, except for the central China region. Strong landscape effects were observed in the Hengduan and Dabashan mountains, where steep mountains and valleys might have been natural dispersal barriers. The molecular phylogenetic data, together with the geographic distribution of the haplotypes, suggest the existence of several localized refugia during the last glaciation from which the present-day distribution may be derived. The pattern of haplotype distribution across China and North Vietnam corresponded well with the current taxonomic delineation of the three intraspecific varieties of T. wallichiana.

   FETAL ORIGINS
AB Human diseases in adulthood are increasingly associated with growth patterns in early life, implicating early-life nutrition as the underlying mechanism. The thrifty phenotype hypothesis proposed that early-life metabolic adaptations promote survival, with the developing organism responding to cues of environmental quality by selecting an appropriate trajectory of growth. Recently, some authors have proposed that the thrifty phenotype is also adaptive in the longer-term, by preparing the organism for its likely adult environment. However, windows of plasticity close early during human development, and subsequent environmental changes may result in the selected trajectory becoming inappropriate, leading to adverse effects on health. This paradox generates uncertainty as to whether the thrifty phenotype is indeed adaptive for the offspring in humans. The thrifty phenotype should not be considered a dichotomous concept, rather it refers to the capacity of all offspring to respond to environmental information during early ontogenetic development. This article argues that the thrifty phenotype is the consequence of three different adaptive processes - niche construction, maternal effects, and developmental plasticity - all of which in humans are influenced by our large brains. While developmental plasticity represents an adaptation by the offspring, both niche construction and parental effects are subject to selection on parental rather than offspring fitness. The three processes also operate at different paces. Human offspring do not become net calories-producers until around 18 years of age, such that the high energy costs of the human brain are paid primarily by the mother, even after weaning. The evolutionary expansion of human brain volume occurred in environments characterised by high volatility, inducing strong selective pressure on maternal capacity to provision multiple offspring simultaneously. The thrifty phenotype is therefore best considered as a manipulation of offspring phenotype for the benefit of maternal fitness. The information that enters offspring phenotype during early development does not predict the likely future environment of the offspring, but rather reflects the mother's own developmental experience and the quality of the environment during her own maturation. Offspring growth trajectory thus becomes aligned with long-term maternal capacity to provision. In contemporary populations, the sensitivity of offspring development to maternal phenotype exposes the offspring to adverse effects, through four distinct pathways. The offspring may be exposed to (1) poor maternal metabolic control (e.g. gestational diabetes), (2) maternally derived toxins (e.g. maternal smoking), or (3) low maternal social status (e.g. small size). Adverse consequences of these effects may then be exacerbated by (4) exposure either to the "toxic" western environment in postnatal life, in which diet and physical activity levels are mismatched with metabolic experience in utero, or at the other extreme to famine. The rapid emergence of the epidemic of the metabolic syndrome in the 20th Century reflects the rapid acceleration in the pace of niche construction relative to the slower physiological combination of developmental plasticity and parental effects.

AB Lion depredations on livestock are largely responsible for their conflicts with humans and for the historic collapse of their geographic range. Understanding of patterns associated with such predation can be used to mitigate its effects and promote more stable coexistence of lions and humans. We analyzed attacks on livestock over a four-years period on two neighboring arid-land ranches adjoining Tsavo East National Park, Kenya. A total of 312 attacks claiming 433 head of stock were examined. Lions were responsible for 85.9% of the attacks; hyenas and cheetahs were the other predators responsible. Lions and hyenas attacked mainly cattle and did so at night, whereas cheetahs almost exclusively took smaller sheep and goats. There was no temporal autocorrelation of daily losses, suggesting that the attacks are independent events. Both number of attacks and number of stock killed showed significant seasonal differences, and their monthly totals correlated positively with precipitation. Intensified predation in the wet season differs from patterns of lion predation elsewhere but reinforces the pattern that large carnivores take more livestock when native prey are most difficult to find and kill. On average, wildlife attacks claimed 2.4% of range stock annually, and livestock represented ca. 5.8% of the diet of ranch lions. This predation represented 2.6% of the herd's estimated economic value, and cost the ranch $8749 per annum. Each lion cost ranchers approximately $290 per year in depredations. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The literature on alien animal invaders focuses largely on successful invasions over broad geographic scales and rarely examines failed invasions. As a result, it is difficult to make predictions about which species are likely to become successful invaders or which environments are likely to be most susceptible to invasion. To address these issues, we developed a data set on fish invasions in watersheds throughout California (USA) that includes failed introductions. Our data set includes information from three stages of the invasion process (establishment, spread, and integration). We define seven categorical predictor variables (trophic status, size of native range, parental care, maximum adult size, physiological tolerance, distance from nearest native source, and propagule pressure) and one continuous predictor variable (prior invasion success) for all introduced species. Using an information-theoretic approach we evaluate 45 separate hypotheses derived from the invasion literature over these three stages of the invasion process. Our results indicate that successful establishment is best predicted with our global model that includes all seven variables, suggesting an inherent multivariate nature to the establishment stage of the invasion process. Spread of introduced fishes is best predicted using measures of physiological tolerance and propagule pressure. Species integration and impact is best predicted using a measure of prior invasion success. The results from analyses like this will help guide and inform management decisions regarding current and future species introductions.

AB Recent observations of widespread changes in mature tropical forests such as increasing tree growth, recruitment and mortality rates and increasing above-ground biomass suggest that 'global change' agents may be causing predictable changes in tropical forests. However, consensus over both the robustness of these changes and the environmental drivers that may be causing them is yet to emerge. This paper focuses on the second part of this debate. We review (i) the evidence that the physical, chemical and biological environment that tropical trees grow in has been altered over recent decades across large areas of the tropics, and (ii) the theoretical, experimental and observational evidence regarding the most likely effects of each of these changes on tropical forests. Ten potential widespread drivers of environmental change were identified: temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, climatic extremes (including El Nino-Southern Oscillation events), atmospheric CO2 concentrations, nutrient deposition, O-3/acid depositions, hunting, land-use change and increasing liana numbers. We note that each of these environmental changes is expected to leave a unique 'fingerprint' in tropical forests, as drivers directly force different processes, have different distributions in space and time and may affect some forests more than others (e.g. depending on soil fertility). Thus, in the third part of the paper we present testable a priori predictions of forest responses to assist ecologists in attributing particular changes in forests to particular causes across multiple datasets. Finally, we discuss how these drivers may change in the future and the possible consequences for tropical forests.

AB The existence of ecological discontinuities and thresholds has been recognised by ecological economics as a key feature to take into account in the study of environment-economy interactions. This paper reviews some theoretical developments and empirical studies dealing with ecological phenomena involving non-linear dynamics. The literature about this issue reveals that there is abundant evidence of discontinuities and threshold effects: as the consequence of human perturbations on ecological systems. However, due to the complexities involved, the predictive capacity of ecology is limited and large uncertainties still remain. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We investigated the evidence for asymmetric competition between fine roots (<2 mm) of adult European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea) trees in a mixed temperate beech-oak forest by (1) conducting fine-root growth experiments in the field (root chamber technique), (2) comparing the fine-root mass of two-species and monospecific plots, and (3) analysing the density and overlap of beech and oak root systems in shared soil volumes. Field experiments with root chambers, which allow fine-root endings to grow under controlled conditions for several months, showed that beech grew more rapidly than oak roots when both species were grown together. In the mixed beech-oak wood, where stem densities and leaf areas of the two species were similar, beech outnumbered oak three- to five-fold in fine-root biomass, and root tip and ectomycorrhiza numbers, which led to a much greater root:shoot ratio (root area index:leaf area index, RAI:LAI) for beech (3.9) than oak (1.7). The remarkably small fine-root biomass of oak was attributed to competitive replacement by beech roots as indicated by comparison with monospecific oak wood. Although oak had much less fine-root mass than beech, oak outnumbered beech in the coarse root fraction (2<d<5 mm) resulting in a greater fine root:coarse root ratio in beech than oak. The fine-root systems of the two species completely overlapped in the nitrogen-rich organic topsoil but differed with respect to their horizontal distribution patterns: beech root biomass increased with increasing distance from a beech stem whereas oak root mass was not dependent on stem distance. Beech (but not oak) root mass was correlated with the thickness of the organic topsoil horizons which, at average, were thicker at greater distances from beech stems. We conclude that beech fine roots colonise nitrogen-rich patches in the organic horizons of this forest more successfully than do oak roots. Our results (root chamber experiments, oak root abundance in mixed vs. monospecific wood, beech root dominance in the organic topsoil) suggest that asymmetric interspecific root competition in favour of beech exists in this stand.

AB 1. Ellenberg's indicator values scale the flora of a region along gradients reflecting light, temperature, continentality, moisture, soil pH, fertility and salinity. They can be used to monitor environmental change.
   2. Ellenberg values can be extended from central Europe, for which they were defined, to nearby parts of Europe. Given a database of quadrat samples, they can be repredicted by a simple algorithm consisting of two-way weighted averaging, followed by local regression.
   3. A database of British samples was assembled from two large surveys. Ellenberg values were repredicted.
   4. Except for the indicator of continentality, the correlation of repredicted and original values was in the range 0.72 (light) to 0.91 (moisture). The continentality indicator could not be adequately repredicted by the algorithm, and is unusable in Britain.
   5. Discrepancies between original and repredicted values can be attributed to various causes, including wrong original values, differing ecological requirements in Britain and central Europe, biased sampling of the British range of habitats, and the occurrence of small plants in shaded or basic microhabitats within well illuminated or predominantly acid quadrats.
   6. The repredicted values were generally reliable, but a small proportion was clearly wrong. Wrong values were due to either inadequate sampling of species' realized niches in Britain or sampling with quadrats that were too large and included species that were not close associates.

AB 1. Species composition, population structure and the seed banks of the perennial grasses Aristida bipartita, Bothriochloa insculpta, Heteropogon contortus, Themeda triandra and Urochloa mosambicensis, were described for nine sites in mesic savanna grasslands (seed banks for five) on a similar soil type ranging in grazing history from sustained heavy grazing (> 20 years) to light grazing. The influence of two seasons of grazing on the seed production and the seed bank of Themeda, Setaria incrassata, Heteropogon, Aristida, Bothriochloa and Digitaria eriantha, was estimated at two other sites.
   2. Compositional variation reflected grazing history. Lightly grazed sites were characterized by the longer-lived, palatable perennials Themeda, Bothriochloa, Heteropogon and Digitaria, and heavily grazed sites by the shorter-lived perennials Urochloa, Sporobolus nitens, Chloris virgata, the unpalatable Aristida, and some forb species. Grass tuft size declined with increasing grazing pressure. Sustained heavy grazing reduced or eliminated Themeda, Bothriochloa and Heteropogon from the seed bank, but increased the abundance of Aristida and Urochloa spp.
   3. Rainfall influenced the seasonal pattern of seed production, which decreased with intra-seasonal drought. The number of seeds produced m-2 of tuft basal area varied from 21 000 for Setaria to 1.9 million for Aristida. Annual seed production m-2 of ground with light grazing was less-than-or-equal-to 400 for Themeda, for Heteropogon, 1300-4000 for Setaria, > 10 000 for Aristida, and 300 for Bothriochloa.
   4. Seed viability varied from zero for Digitaria to 68% for Setaria, and varied within a season for Themeda (24-49%) and Setaria (26-68%). The seeds of all species tested possessed a period of innate dormancy of < 1 year.
   5. Seven to ten grass and six to seven forb species were found in the seed banks at two sites. Perennial grasses constituted 85-95% of the seed bank, with > 90% of all seeds occurring in the top 2 cm of soil. Seed density differed markedly between sites and grazing treatments.
   6. A simple model of the seed bank dynamics of the perennial grasses showed that because their seeds germinate readily and have a limited survival when in secondary dormancy, the seed bank size is determined primarily by the abundance of the species in the vegetation. Thus, the seed banks of Themeda and Heteropogon, which produce small numbers of seeds, can easily be eliminated by sustained grazing. This was also indicated by the distribution of these two species along the gradient of grazing history.

AB State-of-the-art next-generation sequencing, transcriptomics, proteomics and other high-throughput 'omics' technologies enable the efficient generation of large experimental data sets. These data may yield unprecedented knowledge about molecular pathways in cells and their role in disease. Dimension reduction approaches have been widely used in exploratory analysis of single omics data sets. This review will focus on dimension reduction approaches for simultaneous exploratory analyses of multiple data sets. These methods extract the linear relationships that best explain the correlated structure across data sets, the variability both within and between variables (or observations) and may highlight data issues such as batch effects or outliers. We explore dimension reduction techniques as one of the emerging approaches for data integration, and how these can be applied to increase our understanding of biological systems in normal physiological function and disease.

AB Dengue is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease in humans, and the lack of early prognostics, vaccines, and therapeutics contributes to immense disease burden. To identify patterns that could be used for sequence-based monitoring of the antibody response to dengue, we examined antibody heavy-chain gene rearrangements in longitudinal peripheral blood samples from 60 dengue patients. Comparing signatures between acute dengue, postrecovery, and healthy samples, we found increased expansion of B cell clones in acute dengue patients, with higher overall clonality in secondary infection. Additionally, we observed consistent antibody sequence features in acute dengue in the highly variable major antigen-binding determinant, complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3), with specific CDR3 sequences highly enriched in acute samples compared to postrecovery, healthy, or non-dengue samples. Dengue thus provides a striking example of a human viral infection where convergent immune signatures can be identified in multiple individuals. Such signatures could facilitate surveillance of immunological memory in communities.

   QUANTIFICATION; SUSTAINABILITY; MECHANISMS; RESOURCES; DIVERSITY
AB Production ecology and conservation biology have long focused on providing the knowledge base for intensive food production and biodiversity conservation, respectively. With increasing global food insecurity and continuing biodiversity decline, we show that the largely separate development of these fields is counterproductive. Scenario analyses suggest that feeding the world is possible without further encroachment of agriculture into natural ecosystems. Without ignoring the necessary demographic, socio-economic, institutional and governance requirements, we make the case for a science that develops the best ecological means to produce food in a way that has substantially less negative effects on biodiversity and associated ecosystem services and, indeed, should be able to contribute to their persistence and enhancement. Recent developments in trait-based ecology should soon make it possible to adapt and (re-)design agroecosystems to meet both goals of biodiversity conservation and food security. However, there are real tensions between, on the one hand, the opportunity costs of biodiversity conservation (for direct use and for conversion to agriculture) and on the other hand, the ecosystem service values and option values associated with biodiversity. We elaborate the management of plant genetic resources as a metaphor of the tensions between such values of biodiversity and ecosystem services in general. We conclude that significant changes in policies, institutions and practices are necessary to make advances in ecology work for reconciling biodiversity conservation and food security.

AB We present the Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM), a satellite-based assimilation scheme that estimates hourly values of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) of CO2 for 12 North American biomes using the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), derived from reflectance data of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), plus high-resolution data for sunlight and air temperature. The motivation is to provide reliable, fine-grained first-guess fields of surface CO2 fluxes for application in inverse models at continental and smaller scales. An extremely simple mathematical structure, with minimal numbers of parameters, facilitates optimization using in situ data, with finesse provided by maximal infusion of observed NEE and environmental data from networks of eddy covariance towers across North America (AmeriFlux and Fluxnet Canada). Cross validation showed that the VPRM has strong prediction ability for hourly to monthly timescales for sites with similar vegetation. The VPRM also provides consistent partitioning of NEE into Gross Ecosystem Exchange (GEE, the light-dependent part of NEE) and ecosystem respiration (R, the light-independent part), half-saturation irradiance of ecosystem photosynthesis, and annual sum of NEE at all eddy flux sites for which it is optimized. The capability to provide reliable patterns of surface flux for fine-scale inversions is presently limited by the number of vegetation classes for which NEE can be constrained by the current network of eddy flux sites and by the accuracy of MODIS data and data for sunlight.

AB Organic farming has been suggested to counteract declines in farmland biodiversity, but comparisons to conventional farming have produced variable outcomes. To examine whether this is due to the landscape context farms are situated in and traits of the studied organisms, we surveyed bumble bees in cereal field borders and margins at 12 pairs of matched organic and conventional farms, with half the pairs located in heterogeneous farmland and the remaining in homogeneous plains. Species richness and abundance of bumble bees were significantly positively related to both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity. However, there was an interaction effect between farming practice and landscape context so that species richness and abundance were only significantly higher on organic farms in homogeneous landscapes. The higher abundance of bumble bees on organic farms was partly related to higher flower abundance on these sites. The effect of landscape context on bumble bee abundance was stronger for species with medium sized colonies than for those with smaller and larger colony sizes. These patterns may reflect that species with medium sized foraging ranges are most affected by fragmentation of foraging habitat, because colony size reflects the spatial scale at which bumble bees utilize resources. We conclude that both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity can be used to increase bumblebee species richness and abundance, but that organic farming has a larger effect in homogeneous landscapes and landscape heterogeneity a larger effect on conventional farms. The effects differed between species, suggesting that a single prescription to increase pollinator abundance may not be valid. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the distribution of phytolith assemblages in China from surface soil samples at 243 sites along significant ecological and climatic gradients to develop transfer functions for quantitative reconstruction of palaeoenvironment. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) were used to determine the main environmental variables influencing phytolith distributions. The results reveal that mean annual precipitation (MAP) is the dominant variable controlling the spatial distribution of phytoliths, which accounts for 39% of the total variance. Mean annual temperature (MAT), relative humidity (Humi), and annual evaporation (VAP) are another three significant variables, accounting for 6%, 10%, and 5%, respectively, of the total variance in phytolith distributions. Transfer functions,. based on weighted averaging plus partial least squares (WA-PLS), were developed for MAP (R--boot(2) = 0.90, root-mean-square-error of prediction (RMSEP) = 148 mm), MAT (R--boot(2) = 0.84, RMSEP = 2.52 degrees C), Humi (R--boot(2) = 0.75, RMSEP = 6.36%) and VAP (R--boot(2) =0.59, RMSEP=327mm). Overall, our results confirm that phytoliths can provide reliable and robust estimates of MAP, MAT, Humi and VAP Thus, WA-PLS is a robust calibration method for quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstruction based on phytolith data.

AB 1. Transitions between major vegetation types, such as the tree line, are useful systems for monitoring the response of vegetation to climate change. Tree lines have, however, shown equivocal responses to such change.
   2. Tree lines are considered to be primarily thermally controlled, although recent work has highlighted the importance of biotic factors. Dispersal limitation and the invasibility of the tundra matrix have been implicated and here we propose herbivory as an additional control at some tree lines.
   3. We propose a conceptual model in which differing relative impacts of foliage consumption, availability of establishment sites, trampling, dispersal and seed predation can lead to very different tree-line responses.
   4. The presence of large numbers of small trees above the current tree line at a site in northern Sweden that experiences limited reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) herbivory suggests range expansion. Other locations in the same region with higher reindeer populations have considerably fewer small trees, suggesting that range expansion is occurring much more slowly, if at all.
   5. The use of tree lines as indicators of climate change is confounded by the activity of herbivores, which may either strengthen or nullify the impacts of a changed climate. Similar arguments are likely to be applicable to other ecotones.

AB 1. A number of invasions in the family Tephritidae (fruit flies) have been observed worldwide despite quarantine procedures. In this review, the potential importance of interspecific competition and competitive displacement among different tephritid species is evaluated in the context of recent invasions.
   2. Where polyphagous tephritid species have been introduced in areas already occupied by a polyphagous tephritid, interspecific competition has resulted in a decrease in number and niche shift of the pre-established species. No reciprocal invasions have been observed.
   3. The data on tephritid invasions seem to support a hierarchical mode of competition; however, complete exclusion usually did not occur. Indeed, tephritid distribution and abundance are markedly structured by various abiotic (mostly climatic) and biotic (host plants) factors.
   4. The primary determinant of competitive interactions in near-optimal conditions, such as lowlands with abundant fruit plantations, is probably the life-history strategy. The r-K gradient could be used as a predictor of potential invaders, because K traits (such as large adult size) may favour both exploitation and interference competition.
   5. For future research, a better understanding of competition mechanisms seems essential. Different species competing in the same area should be compared with respect to: (i) demographic parameters, (ii) the outcome of experimental co-infestations on the same fruit, and (iii) behavioural and chemical interference mechanisms.

AB Population differentiation often reflects a balance between divergent natural selection and the opportunity for homogenizing gene flow to erode the effects of selection. However, during ecological speciation, trait divergence results in reproductive isolation and becomes a cause, rather than a consequence, of reductions in gene flow. To assess both the causes and the reproductive consequences of morphological differentiation, we examined morphological divergence and sexual isolation among 17 populations of Timema cristinae walking-sticks. Individuals from populations adapted to using Adenostoma as a host plant tended to exhibit smaller overall body size, wide heads, and short legs relative to individuals using Ceonothus as a host. However, there was also significant variation in morphology among populations within host-plant species. Mean trait values for each single population could be reliably predicted based upon host-plant used and the potential for homogenizing gene flow, inferred from the size of the neighboring population using the alternate host and mitochondrial DNA estimates of gene flow. Morphology did not influence the probability of copulation in between-population mating trials. Thus, morphological divergence is facilitated by reductions in gene flow, but does not cause reductions in gene flow via the evolution of sexual isolation. Combined with rearing data indicating that size and shape have a partial genetic basis, evidence for parallel origins of the host-associated forms, and inferences from functional morphology, these results indicate that morphological divergence in T. cristinae reflects a balance between the effects of host-specific natural selection and gene flow. Our findings illustrate how data on mating preferences can help determine the causal associations between trait divergence and levels of gene flow.

AB 1. Most research on freshwater (and other) food webs has focused on apparently discrete communities, in well-defined habitats at small spatial and temporal scales, whereas in reality food webs are embedded in complex landscapes, such as river corridors. Food web linkages across such landscapes may be crucial for ecological pattern and process, however. Here, we consider the importance of large scale influences upon lotic food webs across the three spatial dimensions and through time.
   2. We assess the roles of biotic factors (e.g. predation, competition) and physical habitat features (e.g. geology, land-use, habitat fragmentation) in moulding food web structure at the landscape scale. As examples, external subsidies to lotic communities of nutrients, detritus and prey vary along the river corridor, and food web links are made and broken across the land-water interface with the rise and fall of the flood.
   3. We identify several avenues of potentially fruitful research, particularly the need to quantify energy flow and population dynamics. Stoichiometric analysis of changes in C : N : P nutrient ratios over large spatial gradients (e.g. from river source to mouth, in forested versus agricultural catchments), offers a novel method of uniting energy flow and population dynamics to provide a more holistic view of riverine food webs from a landscape perspective. Macroecological approaches can be used to examine large-scale patterns in riverine food webs (e.g. trophic rank and species-area relationships). New multivariate statistical techniques can be used to examine community responses to environmental gradients and to assign traits to individual species (e.g. body-size, functional feeding group), to unravel the organisation and trophic structure of riverine food webs.

AB Feed intake (Fl), feed efficiency (FE), protein efficiency ratio (PER) and weight gain (WG) of juvenile channel catfish initially weighing 15.0 +/- 0.23 g (10-12 cm initial total length) were evaluated under three regimes of time-varying water temperature (mean daily water temperature for Stoneville, MS, USA; mean +3; and, mean -3 degrees C) and three of dissolved oxygen (DO; 100, 70 and 30% air saturation, at each temperature). Two independent experiments lasting 6 and 8 weeks, respectively, simulated spring and fall temperature and photoperiod patterns. Temperature-oxygen regimes were applied to randomly assigned duplicate 110-1 aquaria with individual biofilters. Fish were fed once daily, to slight excess, a commercial catfish floating feed. After 45 min, uneaten feed was collected, dried and weighed; then FI was calculated by difference. Fish in each aquarium were weighed collectively, biweekly. In both experiments higher temperatures and higher DO levels produced increased feed consumption. A multivariate regression model was fitted to the data to describe the combined effects of temperature and DO on FI. There was a progressive reduction in Fl as DO declined from 100 to 30% air saturation. In both trials weight gain was higher for fish held 3 degrees C above the mean water temperature at 100% air saturation values of DO; whereas, the lowest values of WG were obtained for fish held at 30% air saturation and 3 degrees C below the mean water temperature. Weight gain increased with temperature, with maximum rates reached at 27.1 degrees C with DO equivalent to 100% air saturation. In contrast, when DO was 30% air saturation, growth rates plateaued as ambient temperature exceeded 22.8 degrees C. This model will assist in optimization of feeding practices in channel catfish aquaculture. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Spatial and temporal variations in fire frequency in the boreal forest of Wood Buffalo National Park (WBNP) were assessed using forest stand age, fire scar and historical data. I test the hypotheses that (1) fire frequency is higher in jack pine forests and aspen forests than in black spruce forests and white spruce forests, (2) these variations in fire frequency can be related to the mean waterbreak distance (MWD) around a site and (3) fire frequency has changed over the past 300 years.
   The fire cycles (the time required to burn an area equal in size to the entire study area) in jack pine forests (39 years) and in aspen forests (39 years) were significantly shorter than those in black spruce forests (78 years) and in white spruce forests (96 years). The length of the fire cycle varies inversely with the MWD around a site, and the MWD was significantly higher in jack pine and aspen forests than in black or white spruce forests. It is suggested that covariations between soil type and the MWD influence, respectively, variations in forest dominant and fire frequency.
   A change in fire frequency at 1860 was apparent in the fire history for all of WBNP, the black spruce dominated stands, and the near and medium MWD classes. The fire cycle estimates for these classes were all significantly shorter during the period 1750 to 1859 (fire cycles=25-49 years) than they were in the period 1860 to 1989 (fire cycles=59-89 years). The possible roles of changes in climate and aboriginal burning practices in causing the temporal change in fire frequency are discussed.

AB Appropriate tests of disturbance theory require that disturbance is defined and measured in an organism-related sense. We quantified 7 measures of disturbance, 3 dealing with the pattern of disturbance of the stream bed (assessed using painted tracer particles), 3 dealing with aspects of discharge variation and 1 being a subjective composite measure of stream channel stability (Pfankuch's index). Hypotheses relating to invertebrate taxon richness (maximal at intermediate levels of disturbance) and the representation of particular insect species traits (assemblages in more disturbed sites contain higher percentages of individuals possessing high adult mobility and streamlined-flattened larval morphology) were both supported when disturbance was measured in terms of bed movement but generally not when measured in terms of discharge variation. When disturbance was estimated by Pfankuch's index, species trait predictions were supported but the taxon richness prediction was not. A co-inertia analysis, searching for a co-structure between our environmental and faunistic data sets, allowed us to distinguish taxa that apparently are resistant to bed movement from tara that appear to be resistant to flow variations; this more detailed analysis indicates that the most appropriate measure of disturbance may vary even among quite closely related taxa. The construction of a comprehensive theory of disturbance in streams requires that disturbance is quantified in a way that allows both multi-site and multi-study comparisons. The painted-particle approach, described here, has the potential to permit such standarized comparative studies.

AB General patterns of protein structural organization have emerged from studies of hundreds of structures elucidated by X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance. Structural units are commonly identified by visual inspection of molecular models using qualitative criteria. Here, we propose an algorithm for identification of structural units by objective, quantitative criteria based on atomic interactions. The underlying physical concept is maximal interactions within each unit and minimal interaction between units (domains). In a simple harmonic approximation, interdomain dynamics is determined by the strength of the interface and the distribution of masses. The most likely domain decomposition involves units with the most correlated motion, or largest interdomain fluctuation time. The decomposition of a convoluted 3-D structure is complicated by the possibility that the chain can cross over several times between units. Grouping the residues by solving an eigenvalue problem for the contact matrix reduces the problem to a one-dimensional search for all reasonable trial bisections. Recursive bisection yields a tree of putative folding units. Simple physical criteria are used to identify units that could exist by themselves. The units so defined closely correspond to crystallographers' notion of structural domains. The results are useful for the analysis of folding principles, for modular protein design and for protein engineering. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been increasingly used as a proxy for terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). Previous work mainly evaluated the relationship between satellite-observed SIF and gridded GPP products both based on coarse spatial resolutions. Finer resolution SIF (1.3kmx2.25km) measured from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) provides the first opportunity to examine the SIF-GPP relationship at the ecosystem scale using flux tower GPP data. However, it remains unclear how strong the relationship is for each biome and whether a robust, universal relationship exists across a variety of biomes. Here we conducted the first global analysis of the relationship between OCO-2 SIF and tower GPP for a total of 64 flux sites across the globe encompassing eight major biomes. OCO-2 SIF showed strong correlations with tower GPP at both midday and daily timescales, with the strongest relationship observed for daily SIF at the 757nm (R-2=0.72, p<0.0001). Strong linear relationships between SIF and GPP were consistently found for all biomes (R-2=0.57-0.79, p<0.0001) except evergreen broadleaf forests (R-2=0.16, p<0.05) at the daily timescale. A higher slope was found for C-4 grasslands and croplands than for C-3 ecosystems. The generally consistent slope of the relationship among biomes suggests a nearly universal rather than biome-specific SIF-GPP relationship, and this finding is an important distinction and simplification compared to previous results. SIF was mainly driven by absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and was also influenced by environmental stresses (temperature and water stresses) that determine photosynthetic light use efficiency. OCO-2 SIF generally had a better performance for predicting GPP than satellite-derived vegetation indices and a light use efficiency model. The universal SIF-GPP relationship can potentially lead to more accurate GPP estimates regionally or globally. Our findings revealed the remarkable ability of finer resolution SIF observations from OCO-2 and other new or future missions (e.g., TROPOMI, FLEX) for estimating terrestrial photosynthesis across a wide variety of biomes and identified their potential and limitations for ecosystem functioning and carbon cycle studies.

AB Rapid climatic changes and increasing human influence at high elevations around the world will have profound impacts on mountain biodiversity. However, forecasts from statistical models (e.g. species distribution models) rarely consider that plant community changes could substantially lag behind climatic changes, hindering our ability to make temporally realistic projections for the coming century. Indeed, the magnitudes of lags, and the relative importance of the different factors giving rise to them, remain poorly understood. We review evidence for three types of lag: "dispersal lags" affecting plant species' spread along elevational gradients, "establishment lags" following their arrival in recipient communities, and "extinction lags" of resident species. Variation in lags is explained by variation among species in physiological and demographic responses, by effects of altered biotic interactions, and by aspects of the physical environment. Of these, altered biotic interactions could contribute substantially to establishment and extinction lags, yet impacts of biotic interactions on range dynamics are poorly understood. We develop a mechanistic community model to illustrate how species turnover in future communities might lag behind simple expectations based on species' range shifts with unlimited dispersal. The model shows a combined contribution of altered biotic interactions and dispersal lags to plant community turnover along an elevational gradient following climate warming. Our review and simulation support the view that accounting for disequilibrium range dynamics will be essential for realistic forecasts of patterns of biodiversity under climate change, with implications for the conservation of mountain species and the ecosystem functions they provide.

AB Peatlands contain approximately one third of all soil organic carbon (SOC). Warming can alter above- and belowground linkages that regulate soil organic carbon dynamics and C-balance in peatlands. Here we examine the multiyear impact of in situ experimental warming on the microbial food web, vegetation, and their feedbacks with soil chemistry. We provide evidence of both positive and negative impacts of warming on specific microbial functional groups, leading to destabilization of the microbial food web. We observed a strong reduction (70%) in the biomass of top-predators (testate amoebae) in warmed plots. Such a loss caused a shortening of microbial food chains, which in turn stimulated microbial activity, leading to slight increases in levels of nutrients and labile C in water. We further show that warming altered the regulatory role of Sphagnum-polyphenols on microbial community structure with a potential inhibition of top predators. In addition, warming caused a decrease in Sphagnum cover and an increase in vascular plant cover. Using structural equation modelling, we show that changes in the microbial food web affected the relationships between plants, soil water chemistry, and microbial communities. These results suggest that warming will destabilize C and nutrient recycling of peatlands via changes in above- and belowground linkages, and therefore, the microbial food web associated with mosses will feedback positively to global warming by destabilizing the carbon cycle. This study confirms that microbial food webs thus constitute a key element in the functioning of peatland ecosystems. Their study can help understand how mosses, as ecosystem engineers, tightly regulate biogeochemical cycling and climate feedback in peatlands

AB Question: Mean Ellenberg indicator values (EIVs) inherit information about compositional similarity, because during their calculation species abundances (or presence-absences) are used as weights. Can this similarity issue actually be demonstrated, does it bias results of vegetation analyses correlating mean EIVs with other aspects of species composition and how often are biased studies published? Methods: In order to separate information on compositional similarity possibly present in mean EIVs, a new variable was introduced, calculated as a weighted average of randomized species EIVs. The performance of these mean randomized EIVs was compared with that of the mean real EIVs on the one hand and random values (randomized mean EIVs) on the other. To demonstrate the similarity issue, differences between samples were correlated with dissimilarity matrices based on various indices. Next, the three mean EIV variables were tested in canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), analysis of variance (ANOVA) between vegetation clusters, and in regression on species richness. Subsequently, a modified permutation test of significance was proposed, taking the similarity issue into account. In addition, an inventory was made of studies published in the Journal of Vegetation Science and Applied Vegetation Science between 2000 and 2010 likely reporting biased results due to the similarity issue. Results: Using mean randomized EIVs, it is shown that compositional similarity is inherited into mean EIVs and most resembles the inter-sample distances in correspondence analysis, which itself is based on iterative weighted averaging. The use of mean EIVs produced biased results in all four analysis types examined: unrealistic (too high) explained variances in CCA, too many significant correlations with ordination axes in DCA, too many significant differences between cluster analysis groups and too high coefficients of determination in regressions on species richness. Modified permutation tests provided ecologically better interpretable results. From 95 studies using Ellenberg indicator values, 36 reported potentially biased results. Conclusions: No statistical inferences should bemade in analyses relatingmean EIVs with other variables derived from the species composition as this can produce highly biased results, leading to misinterpretation. Alternatively, a modified permutation test using mean randomized EIVs can sometimes be used.

AB Hybridization plays an important role in the evolution of many taxonomic groups, but large-scale phylogenetic patterns of hybridization are poorly known. Here, we investigate patterns of hybridization in vascular plants. Our dataset included 282 families, 3212 genera and approximate to 37,000 species accounts from eight regional floras covering continental Europe, two island regions, and parts of North America and Australia. lnterspecific hybrids were common in the wild, occurring in 40% of families and 16% of genera, with an overall frequency of 0.09 hybrids per nonhybrid species. Taxon species richness explained a large amount of variation in the number of hybrids, but taxon bias (study effort) did not. We accounted for species richness in calculating hybridization propensities, and found that both families and genera differed in hybridization propensity. Hybridization propensity of a given group was generally consistent across regions (with the exception of Hawaii), suggesting that hybridization behavior may be determined more by intrinsic properties of a group than by environmental conditions. We found evidence of a strong phylogenetic signal (lambda = 0.93) in hybridization propensity as hybrids were not uniformly distributed across orders of vascular plants. Characterization of the hybridization behavior of groups should lead to increased predictive power regarding their traits and evolutionary trajectories, and will allow comparative tests of the traits driving differences in hybridization propensity.

AB The need for integrated and widely accessible Sources of species traits data to facilitate studies of ecology, conservation, and management has motivated development of traits databases for various tax-a. In spite of the increasing number of traits-based analyses of freshwater fishes in the United States, no consolidated database of traits of this group exists publicly, and much useful information on these species is documented only in obscure sources. The largely inaccessible and unconsolidated traits information makes large-scale analysis involving many fishes and/or traits particularly challenging We have compiled a database of > 100 traits for 809 (731 native and 78 normative) fish species found in freshwaters of the conterminous United states, including 37 native families and 145 native genera. The database, named FishTraits, contains information on four major categories of traits: (1) trophic ecology; (2) body size, reproductive ecology, and life history; (3) habitat preferences; and (4) salinity and temperature tolerances. Information on geographic distribution and conservation status was also compiled. The database enhances many opportunities for conducting research on fish species traits and constitutes the first step toward establishing a central repository for a continually expanding set of traits of North American fishes.

AB Recent advances in molecular biology and the use of DNA microarrays for gene expression profiling are providing new insights into the animal stress response, particularly the effects of stress on gene regulation. However, interpretation of the complex transcriptional changes that occur during stress still poses many challenges because the relationship between changes at the transcriptional level and other levels of biological organisation is not well understood. To confront these challenges, a conceptual model linking physiological and transcriptional responses to stress would be helpful. Here, we provide the basis for one such model by synthesising data from organismal, endocrine, cellular, molecular, and genomic studies. We show using available examples from ectothermic vertebrates that reduced oxygen levels and oxidative stress are common to many stress conditions and that the responses to different types of stress, such as environmental, handling and confinement stress, often converge at the challenge of dealing with oxygen imbalance and oxidative stress. As a result, a common set of stress responses exists that is largely independent of the type of stressor applied. These common responses include the repair of DNA and protein damage, cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, changes in cellular metabolism that reflect the transition from a state of cellular growth to one of cellular repair, the release of stress hormones, changes in mitochondrial densities and properties, changes in oxygen transport capacities and changes in cardio-respiratory function. Changes at the transcriptional level recapitulate these common responses, with many stress-responsive genes functioning in cell cycle control, regulation of transcription, protein turnover, metabolism, and cellular repair. These common transcriptional responses to stress appear coordinated by only a limited number of stress-inducible and redox-sensitive transcription factors and signal transduction pathways, such as the immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun, the transcription factors NF kappa B and HIF-1 alpha, and the JNK and p38 kinase signalling pathways. As an example of environmental stress responses, we present temperature response curves at organismal, cellular and molecular levels. Acclimation and physiological adjustments that can shift the threshold temperatures for the onset of these responses are discussed and include, for example, adjustments of the oxygen delivery system, the heat shock response, cellular repair system, and transcriptome. Ultimately, however, an organism's ability to cope with environmental change is largely determined by its ability to maintain aerobic scope and to prevent loss in performance. These systemic constraints can determine an organism's long-term survival well before cellular and molecular functions are disturbed. The conceptual model we propose here discusses some of the crosslinks between responses at different levels of biological organisation and the central role of oxygen balance and oxidative stress in eliciting these responses with the aim to help the interpretation of environmental genomic data in the context of organismal function and performance.

AB Animal distribution patterns in human-modified landscapes are often examined from the basis of the "fragmentation model", which recognises habitat patches located within an inhospitable matrix. The fragmentation model can establish correlations between landscape pattern and animal distribution patterns. However, it is limited in its ability to generate a process-based understanding of species distribution patterns. Here we propose a process-based conceptual landscape model. The "continuum model" is derived from continuum theory, and recognises the importance of space-related ecological variables alongside other factors, such as the availability of suitable food, shelter, and climatic conditions. The continuum model allows for gradual changes in these variables through space, and assumes species respond individualistically to their environment. We contrast the continuum model with the fragmentation model, and outline how it can be used to interpret and design empirical studies. While the fragmentation model may provide a satisfactory description of ecological patterns where many species are confined to human-defined "patches", the continuum model can help to establish links between fundamental ecological processes and individualistic species distribution patterns. Conservation guidelines arising from the fragmentation model will emphasise the importance of large and well-connected pre-defined "habitat" patches. Conversely, the continuum model recognises potentially large discrepancies between different species' ecological requirements. Conservation guidelines arising from the continuum model therefore will focus on habitat heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales to enhance the number of niches available to different species.

AB There is compelling evidence that losses in plant diversity can alter ecosystem functioning, particularly by reducing primary production. However, impacts of biodiversity loss on decomposition, the complementary process in the carbon cycle, are highly uncertain. By manipulating fungal decomposer diversity in stream microcosm experiments we found that rates of litter decomposition and associated fungal spore production are unaffected by changes in decomposer diversity under benign and harsher environmental conditions. This result calls for caution when generalizing outcomes of biodiversity experiments across systems. In contrast to their magnitude, the variability of process rates among communities increased when species numbers were reduced. This was most likely caused by a portfolio effect (i.e. statistical averaging), with the uneven species distribution typical of natural communities tending to weaken that effect. Curbing species extinctions to maintain ecosystem functioning thus can be important even in situations where process rates are unaffected.

AB Foliar light-saturated net assimilation rates (A) generally decrease with increasing tree height (H) and tree age (Y), but it is unclear whether the decline in A is attributable to size- and age-related modifications in foliage morphology (needle dry mass per unit projected area; M-A), nitrogen concentration, stomatal conductance to water vapor (G), or biochemical foliage potentials for photosynthesis (maximum carboxylase activity of Rubisco; V-cmax). I studied the influences of H and Y on foliage structure and function in a data set consisting of 114 published studies reporting observations on more than 200 specimens of various height and age of Picea abies (L.) Karst. and Pinus sylvestris L. In this data set, foliar nitrogen concentrations were independent of H and Y, but net assimilation rates per unit needle dry mass (A(M)) decreased strongly with increasing H and Y. Although M-A scaled positively with H and Y, net assimilation rates per unit area (A(A) = M-A x A(M)) were strongly and negatively related to H, indicating that the structural adjustment of needles did not compensate for the decline in mass-based needle photosynthetic rates. A relevant determinant of tree height- and age-dependent modifications of A was the decrease in G. This led to lower needle intercellular CO2 concentrations and thereby to lower efficiency with which the biochemical photosynthetic apparatus functioned. However, V-cmax per unit needle dry mass and area strongly decreased with increasing H, indicating that foliar photosynthetic potentials were lower in larger trees at a common intercellular CO2 concentration. Given the constancy of foliar nitrogen concentrations, but the large decline in apparent V-cmax with tree size and age, I hypothesize that the decline in Vc(max) results from increasing diffusive resistances between the needle intercellular air space and carboxylation sites in chloroplasts. Increased diffusive limitations may be the inevitable consequence of morphological adaptation (changes in M-A and needle density) to greater water stress in needles of larger trees. Foliage structural and physiological variables were nonlinearly related to Hand Y, possibly because of hyperbolic decreases in shoot hydraulic conductances with increasing tree height and age. Although H and Y were correlated, foliar characteristics were generally more strongly related to H than to Y, suggesting that increases in height rather than age are responsible for declines in foliar net assimilation capacities.

AB Soft-sediment macrobenthos data for the Norwegian continental shelf (61degreesN, 1 to 2degreesE) was used to examine species distributions, community structure and community differences, and how different measures of biodiversity are related to environmental variability. Water depth at 35 sites ranged from 115 to 331 m over a spatial sampling scale of ca. 45 km x 60 km, and there was considerable variation in sediment characteristics, Of a total of 508 recorded species, 39% were restricted to 1 or 2 sites, whereas only 3 species spanned the entire sampling area. Polychaetes were the most common and widespread taxonomic group; crustaceans and echinoderms were more restricted in their distributions than the other dominant groups. Whittaker's beta diversity measure (beta(W), extent of change in species composition among sites) was highest for those groups with the highest proportion of restricted-range species. The number of shared species, the complementarity (biotic distinctness), and the Bray-Curtis similarity between all pairwise combinations of sites (3 beta diversity measures) were more strongly related to change in environment (notably depth, followed by median grain size and silt-clay content) than to spatial distance between sites. Likewise, a multivariate analysis (BIO-ENV) identified these factors as the major environmental variables influencing the faunal patterns, whereas univariate measures of diversity were not related to depth or median grain size. Univariate measures of diversity, beta diversity measures, and BIO-ENV analyses showed that molluscs, followed by polychaetes, were most highly related to environmental variables. In this study, alpha, beta and gamma diversity were higher than in a study of a single soft-sediment habitat type in the southern part of the Norwegian continental shelf.

AB Declining nest success of forest birds in fragmented habitat has been attributed to increased nest predation. Better understanding of this problem and potential solutions to it require information on why nest predators are attracted to habitat edges. Toward this end we investigated habitat use by black rat snakes (Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta), an important avian-nest predator in eastern deciduous forests. We radio-tracked 52 black rat snakes for periods of 3-41 mo from 1996 to 1999. All black rat snakes exhibited a strong preference for edge habitats. Consistent with edges being used because they facilitate thermoregulation, gravid females associated more strongly with edges than did males and nongravid females, and sites used by snakes when shedding were significantly associated with habitat edges. Gravid females lost an average of > 20% of their body mass, while nongravid females and males did not lose mass, suggesting that edges were not used because they offered high success in foraging. Similarly, an increase in use of edge habitat through the season by all rat snakes was inconsistent with the snakes being attracted principally to hunt: avian prey would have been more abundant in spring when birds were breeding, and the density of small mammals in edges did not vary seasonally. Also, snakes moved longer distances and were found traveling more often when located in forests. Because our results collectively are most consistent with the hypothesis that rat snakes use edges for thermoregulatory reasons, the negative impact of the snakes on nesting birds may be coincidental; the snakes primarily use edges for reasons other than foraging but opportunistically exploit prey they encounter there. Rat snakes appeared to respond to the edge structure rather than to how the edge was created (natural vs. artificial). Thus, fragmentation of forests by humans has created habitat structurally similar to that preferred by rat snakes in their natural habitat, thereby inadvertently increasing contact between the snakes and nesting birds.

ID SCALE DEPENDENCE; BIOMASS
AB A key issue in ecology is how patterns of species diversity differ as a function of scale. The scaling function is the species-area curve. The form of the species-area curve results from patterns of environmental heterogeneity and species dispersal, and may be system-specific. A central concern is how, for a given set of species, the species-area curve varies with respect to a third variable, such as latitude or productivity. Critical is whether the relationship is scale-invariant (i.e. the species-area curves for different levels of the third variable are parallel), rank-invariant (i.e. the curves are non-parallel, but non-crossing within the scales of interest) or neither, in which case the qualitative relationship is scale-dependent. This recognition is critical for the development and testing of theories explaining patterns of species richness because different theories have mechanistic bases at different scales of action. Scale includes four attributes: sample-unit, grain, focus and extent. Focus is newly defined here. Distinguishing among these attributes is a key step in identifying the probable scale(s) at which ecological processes determine patterns.

AB Existing knowledge of the social organization, mating system and reproduction of Humpback Whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) is reviewed to assess how our current understanding of this wide-ranging marine mammal fits into the predictive framework developed from ecological studies of more accessible terrestrial taxa. The small unstable groups characteristic of this species on its summer feeding grounds appear to be a function of absence of predation and of the patchy, mobile nature of most prey; the absence of territoriality and the minimal importance of kinship in associations are also predictable consequences of the latter. The mating system is similar to both leks and to male dominance polygyny, in which males display (sing) or directly compete (perhaps sometimes in coalitions) for access to females. However, the rigid spatial structure characteristic of classic leks is absent. The mating system of this species is sufficiently different to merit a novel category, and 'floating lek' is proposed. The widespread distribution of females resulting from absence of both predation and resources during the breeding season preclude simultaneous monopolization by males of more than one potential mate. Furthermore, these factors, together with a male-biased operational sex ratio, minimize the possibility of competition among females. The intensity of intrasexual competition among males conforms to predictions derived from information on testis size and from expectation of future reproductive success. Female choice and, to a lesser extent, differential allocation of competitive effort by males, appears likely. Lack of interpopulation variation in social and mating behaviour, and in general reproductive biology, is likely a response to similarity of marine environmental conditions. Year-to-year variation in reproductive rates may be linked to variations in the abundance of prey. The invariably uniparous nature of female Humpback Whales is assumed to be related to the energetic demands of lactation, and the lower ratio of available energy partitioned to reproduction that is characteristic of larger mammals. The reversed sexual size dimorphism of this species may reflect different selective pressures on males and females. Finally, there is now evidence that, as in some other taxa, offspring sex ratio is related to maternal condition.

AB Mitigating climate change requires clean energy and the removal of atmospheric carbon. Building soil carbon is an appealing way to increase carbon sinks and reduce emissions owing to the associated benefits to agriculture. However, the practical implementation of soil carbon climate strategies lags behind the potential, partly because we lack clarity around the magnitude of opportunity and how to capitalize on it. Here we quantify the role of soil carbon in natural (land-based) climate solutions and review some of the project design mechanisms available to tap into the potential. We show that soil carbon represents 25% of the potential of natural climate solutions (total potential, 23.8 Gt of CO2-equivalent per year), of which 40% is protection of existing soil carbon and 60% is rebuilding depleted stocks. Soil carbon comprises 9% of the mitigation potential of forests, 72% for wetlands and 47% for agriculture and grasslands. Soil carbon is important to land-based efforts to prevent carbon emissions, remove atmospheric carbon dioxide and deliver ecosystem services in addition to climate mitigation.
   Diverse strategies are needed to mitigate climate change. This study finds that storing carbon in soils represents 25% of land-based potential, of which 60% must come from rebuilding depleted carbon stores.

AB The geographic origins of breeds and the genetic basis of variation within the widely distributed and phenotypically diverse domestic rock pigeon (Columba livia) remain largely unknown. We generated a rock pigeon reference genome and additional genome sequences representing domestic and feral populations. We found evidence for the origins of major breed groups in the Middle East and contributions from a racing breed to North American feral populations. We identified the gene EphB2 as a strong candidate for the derived head crest phenotype shared by numerous breeds, an important trait in mate selection in many avian species. We also found evidence that this trait evolved just once and spread throughout the species, and that the crest originates early in development by the localized molecular reversal of feather bud polarity.

AB According to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, common indicators are needed to monitor the loss of biodiversity and the implications for the sustainable provision of ecosystem services. However, a variety of indicators are already being used resulting in many, mostly incompatible, monitoring systems. In order to synthesise the different indicator approaches and to detect gaps in the development of common indicator systems, we examined 531 indicators that have been reported in 617 peer-reviewed journal articles between 1997 and 2007. Special emphasis was placed on comparing indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem services across ecosystems (forests, grass- and shrublands, wetlands, rivers, lakes, soils and agro-ecosystems) and spatial scales (from patch to global scale). The application of biological indicators was found most often focused on regional and finer spatial scales with few indicators applied across ecosystem types. Abiotic indicators, such as physico-chemical parameters and measures of area and fragmentation, are most frequently used at broader (regional to continental) scales. Despite its multiple dimensions, biodiversity is usually equated with species richness only. The functional, structural and genetic components of biodiversity are poorly addressed despite their potential value across habitats and scales. Ecosystem service indicators are mostly used to estimate regulating and supporting services but generally differ between ecosystem types as they reflect ecosystem-specific services. Despite great effort to develop indicator systems over the past decade, there is still a considerable gap in the widespread use of indicators for many of the multiple components of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and a need to develop common monitoring schemes within and across habitats. Filling these gaps is a prerequisite for linking biodiversity dynamics with ecosystem service delivery and to achieving the goals of global and sub-global initiatives to halt the loss of biodiversity.

AB Aims
   Although the niche concept is of prime importance in ecology, the quantification of plant species' niches remains difficult. Here we propose that plant functional traits, as determinants of species performance, may be useful tools for quantifying species niche parameters over environmental gradients.
   Important findings
   Under this framework, the mean trait values of a species determine its niche position along gradients, and intraspecific trait variability determines its niche breadth. This trait-based approach can provide an operational assessment of niche for a potentially large number of species, making it possible to understand and predict species niche shifts under environmental changes. We further advocate a promising method that recently appeared in the literature, which partitions trait diversity into among- and within-community components as a way to quantify the species niche in units of traits instead of environmental parameters. This approach allows the switch of the focus from ecological niches to trait niches, facilitating the examination of species coexistence along undefined environmental gradients. Altogether, the trait-based approach provides a promising toolkit for quantifying the species ecological niche and for understanding the evolution of species niche and traits.

AB Moisture, nutrients, fire and herbivory are the principal factors governing tree-grass cover ratios of savannas. We investigated tree (Acacia mellifera) recruitment after fire and under conditions of maximum-recorded rainfall, nitrogen addition and grazing in a completely-crossed field experiment. We employed a similar garden experiment with the exception of the fire treatment. Tree germination in the field was extremely low, probably due to below-average natural rainfall in plots that only received natural rain, and insufficient watering frequency in irrigated plots. Due to low germination in the field experiment, no treatment significantly affected tree recruitment. In the garden experiment, frequent watering, nutrient control (i.e. no nitrogen addition) and grazing enhanced tree recruitment with significant interactions between rain, nitrogen and grazing. We infer that above-average rainfall years with frequent rainfall events are required for mass tree recruitment. Grass defoliation makes space and resources available for tree seedlings. Nitrogen enrichment increases the competitive ability of fast-growing grasses more than that of the N-2-fixing tree component. In contrast to conventional wisdom that grazing alone causes encroachment, we suggest that there are complex interactions between the above-mentioned factors and 'triggering' events such as unusually high rainfall.

AB Grizzly bear (Ursus arctos L.) populations in Alberta are threatened by habitat loss and high rates of human-caused mortality. Spatial depictions of fitness would greatly improve management and conservation action. We are currently challenged, however, in our ability to parameterize demographic rates necessary for describing fitness, especially across gradients of human disturbance and for land cover types. Alternative approaches are therefore needed. We describe here a method of estimating relative habitat states and conditions as surrogates of fitness using models of occupancy and mortality risk. By combining occurrence and risk models into a two-dimensional habitat framework, we identified indices of attractive sinks and safe harbour habitats, as well as five habitat states: non-critical habitats, secondary habitats low-quality and secure), primary habitats (high-quality and secure), secondary sinks (low-quality, but high risk), and primary sinks (high-quality and high risk). Primary sink or high attractive sink situations were evident in the foothills where bears were using forest edges associated with forestry and oil and gas activities on Crown lands, while primary habitats or safe harbour sites were most common to protected alpine/sub-alpine sites. We suggest that habitat states and indices be used for setting baseline conditions for management and comparison of habitat conditions over time and identification of grizzly bear conservation reserves. A no net loss policy of critical habitats could be used to maintain existing habitat conditions for landscapes threatened by human development. Under such a policy, conversions of primary habitat would require restoration of equivalent amounts of primary sinks through decommissioning of roads. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In egg-laying animals, mothers can influence the development of their offspring via the suite of biochemicals they incorporate into the nourishing yolk (e.g. lipids, hormones). However, the long-lasting fitness consequences of this early nutritional environment have often proved elusive. Here, we show that the colorful carotenoid pigments that female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) deposit into egg yolks influence embryonic and nestling survival, the sex ratio of fledged offspring, and the eventual ornamental coloration displayed by their offspring as adults. Mothers experimentally supplemented with dietary carotenoids prior to egg-laying incorporated more carotenoids into eggs, which, due to the antioxidant activity of carotenoids, rendered their embryos less susceptible to free-radical attack during development. These eggs were subsequently more likely to hatch, fledge offspring, produce more sons than daughters, and produce sons who exhibited more brightly colored carotenoid-based beak pigmentation. Provisioned mothers also acquired more colorful beaks, which directly predicted levels of carotenoids found in eggs, thus indicating that these pigments may function not only as physiological 'damage-protectants' in adults and offspring but also as morphological signals of maternal reproductive capabilities.

AB 1. The butterfly fauna of lowland monsoon forest on Buru, Indonesia was compared in unlogged forest and forest that had been selectively logged 5 years previously.
   2. Seven variables relating to vegetation structure were measured in each habitat. Tree density and percentage cover of vegetation in the canopy and understorey were significantly higher, and vegetation cover 2 m above the ground was significantly lower, in unlogged forest. There were no differences between sites in the mean heights or girths of trees, but the ranges of both heights and girths were lower in logged forest, Percentage cover of vegetation at ground level was similar at the two sites.
   3. Species richness, abundance and evenness of butterflies and an index of taxonomic distinctiveness were ail significantly higher in unlogged forest. Two endemic species and a further four species with distributions restricted to Maluku Province were recorded only in unlogged forest.
   4. Species abundance data for butterflies at both sites fitted a log-series distribution. Data for unlogged forest also fitted a log-normal distribution, whereas those far logged forest did not. This indicated the presence of a more complex butterfly community in unlogged forest.
   5. These results indicate that the distributional pattern of species abundance of tropical butterflies may be used as an indicator of forest disturbance, and that selective logging of tropical forests in SE Asia may be associated with a significant decrease in biodiversity of butterflies, at least during the first 5 years of forest regeneration.

AB Quantifying global terrestrial photosynthesis is essential to understanding the global carbon cycle and the climate system. Remote sensing has played a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of photosynthesis from leaf to global scale; however, substantial uncertainties still exist. In this review, we provide a historical overview of theory, modeling, and observations of photosynthesis across space and time for decadal intervals beginning in the 1950s. Then we identify the key uncertainties in global photosynthesis estimates, including evaluating light intercepted by canopies, biophysical forcings, the structure of light use efficiency models and their parameters, like photosynthetic capacity, and relationships between sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and canopy photosynthesis. Finally, we review new opportunities with big data and recently launched or planned satellite missions.

AB Forecasted increase drought frequency and severity may drive worldwide declines in forest productivity. Species-level responses to a drier world are likely to be influenced by their functional traits. Here, we analyse forest resilience to drought using an extensive network of tree-ring width data and satellite imagery. We compiled proxies of forest growth and productivity (TRWi, absolutely dated ring-width indices; NDVI, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) for 11 tree species and 502 forests in Spain corresponding to Mediterranean, temperate, and continental biomes. Four different components of forest resilience to drought were calculated based on TRWi and NDVI data before, during, and after four major droughts (1986, 1994-1995, 1999, and 2005), and pointed out that TRWi data were more sensitive metrics of forest resilience to drought than NDVI data. Resilience was related to both drought severity and forest composition. Evergreen gymnosperms dominating semi-arid Mediterranean forests showed the lowest resistance to drought, but higher recovery than deciduous angiosperms dominating humid temperate forests. Moreover, semi-arid gymnosperm forests presented a negative temporal trend in the resistance to drought, but this pattern was absent in continental and temperate forests. Although gymnosperms in dry Mediterranean forests showed a faster recovery after drought, their recovery potential could be constrained if droughts become more frequent. Conversely, angiosperms and gymnosperms inhabiting temperate and continental sites might have problems to recover after more intense droughts since they resist drought but are less able to recover afterwards.

AB Population genetic models predict that alleles with small selection coefficients may be swamped by migration and will not contribute to local adaptation. But if most alleles contributing to standing variation are of small effect, how does local adaptation proceed? Here I review predictions of population and quantitative genetic models and use individual-based simulations to illustrate how the architecture of local adaptation depends on the genetic redundancy of the trait, the maintenance of standing genetic variation (V-G), and the susceptibility of alleles to swamping. Even when population genetic models predict swamping for individual alleles, considerable local adaptation can evolve at the phenotypic level if there is sufficient V-G. However, in such cases the underlying architecture of divergence is transient: F-ST is low across all loci, and no locus makes an important contribution for very long. Because this kind of local adaptation is mainly due to transient frequency changes and allelic covariances, these architectures will be difficultif not impossibleto detect using current approaches to studying the genomic basis of adaptation. Even when alleles are large and resistant to swamping, architectures can be highly transient if genetic redundancy and mutation rates are high. These results suggest that drift can play a critical role in shaping the architecture of local adaptation, both through eroding V-G and affecting the rate of turnover of polymorphisms with redundant phenotypic effects.

AB The interplay of orographic uplift and climatic changes in the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains region (HHM) have had a key role in speciation and population demography. To gain further insight into these processes, we investigated their effects on Taxus wallichiana by combining molecular phylogeography and species distribution modeling.
   Molecular data were obtained from 43 populations of T. wallichiana. Nineteen climatic variables were analyzed alongside genetic discontinuities. Species distribution modeling was carried out to predict potential past distribution ranges.
   Two distinct lineages were identified, which diverged c. 4.2 (2.0-6.5) million years ago (Ma), a timescale that corresponds well with the recent uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and subsequent climatic changes of the region. Correlations with climatic variables also suggest that ecological factors may have further reinforced the separation of the two lineages. Both lineages experienced population expansion during the last glaciation.
   The high genetic divergence, long-term isolation and ecological differentiation suggest a scenario of cryptic speciation in T. wallichiana associated with geological and climatic changes in the HHM. Our findings also challenge the notion of general population 'contraction' during the last glaciation in the HHM.

AB 1. The prominent new place of ecosystem services in environmental policy, land management and land planning requires that the best ecological knowledge be applied to ecosystem service quantification. Given strong evidence that functional diversity underpins the delivery of key ecosystem services, assessments of these services may progress rapidly using a trait-based approach.
   2. The trait-based approach shows promising results, especially for plant trait effects on primary production and some processes associated with carbon and nitrogen cycling in grasslands. However, there is a need to extend the proof of concept for a wider range of ecosystems and ecosystem services and to incorporate not only the functional characteristics of plants but those of other organisms with which plants interact for the provision of ecosystem services.
   3. The five papers in this Special Feature illustrate how some of the key conceptual and methodological challenges can be resolved, and provide a range of case studies across three continents. Relevant plant functional traits depict different axes of variation including stature, the leaf economics spectrum, and associated or independent variations in root or stem traits. The application of the trait approach to ecosystem processes underpinned by interactions between plants and other biota is illustrated for soil micro-organisms and granivorous invertebrates. There is strong evidence for the biomass ratio hypothesis (i.e. prevalent effects of the traits of dominant species through the community-weighted mean), along with less prevalent and more complex effects of heterogeneous trait values between species (i.e. functional divergence).
   4. Synthesis. Together, the five papers in this Special Feature illustrate how trait-based approaches may help elucidate the complexity of ecological mechanisms operating in the field to determine ecosystem service delivery. To address scientific and management questions about the provision of multiple services, progress is needed in understanding how functional trade-offs and synergies within organisms scale up to interactions between ecosystem services. Service-oriented ecosystem management within the context of global change, or ecological restoration, remains a major challenge, but trait-based understanding opens new avenues towards more generic, integrated approaches.

AB Motivated by the need to solve ecological problems (climate change, habitat fragmentation and biological invasions), there has been increasing interest in species distribution models (SDMs). Predictions from these models inform conservation policy, invasive species management and disease-control measures. However, predictions are subject to uncertainty, the degree and source of which is often unrecognized. Here, we review the SDM literature in the context of uncertainty, focusing on three main classes of SDM: niche-based models, demographic models and process-based models. We identify sources of uncertainty for each class and discuss how uncertainty can be minimized or included in the modelling process to give realistic measures of confidence around predictions. Because this has typically not been performed, we conclude that uncertainty in SDMs has often been underestimated and a false precision assigned to predictions of geographical distribution. We identify areas where development of new statistical tools will improve predictions from distribution models, notably the development of hierarchical models that link different types of distribution model and their attendant uncertainties across spatial scales. Finally, we discuss the need to develop more defensible methods for assessing predictive performance, quantifying model goodness-of-fit and for assessing the significance of model covariates.

AB Aim
   Treelines occur globally within a narrow range of mean growing season temperatures, suggesting that low-temperature growth limitation determines the position of the treeline. However, treelines also exhibit features that indicate that other mechanisms, such as biomass loss not resulting in mortality (dieback) and mortality, determine treeline position and dynamics. Debate regarding the mechanisms controlling treeline position and dynamics may be resolved by identifying the mechanisms controlling prominent treeline spatial patterns (or 'form') such as the spatial structure of the transition from closed forest to the tree limit. Recent treeline studies world-wide have confirmed a close link between form and dynamics.
   Location
   The concepts presented refer to alpine treelines globally.
   Methods
   In this review, we describe how varying dominance of three general 'first-level' mechanisms (tree performance: growth limitation, seedling mortality and dieback) result in different treeline forms, what 'second-level' mechanisms (stresses, e.g. freezing damage, photoinhibition) may underlie these general mechanisms, and how they are modulated by interactions with neighbours ('third-level' mechanisms). This hierarchy of mechanisms should facilitate discussions about treeline formation and dynamics.
   Results
   We distinguish four primary treeline forms: diffuse, abrupt, island and krummholz. Growth limitation is dominant only at the diffuse treeline, which is the form that has most frequently responded as expected to growing-season warming, whereas the other forms are controlled by dieback and seedling mortality and are relatively unresponsive.
   Main conclusions
   Treeline form provides a means for explaining the current variability in treeline position and dynamics and for exploring the general mechanisms controlling the responses of treelines to climatic change. Form indicates the relative dependence of tree performance on various aspects of the external climate (especially summer warmth versus winter stressors) and on internal feedbacks, thus allowing inferences on the type as well as strength of climate-change responses.

AB The great variety of geological and hydrological conditions in the deep sea generates many different habitats. Some are only recently explored, although their true extent and geographical coverage are still not fully established. Both continental margins and mid-oceanic seafloors are much more complex ecologically, geologically, chemically and hydrodynamically than originally thought. As a result, fundamental patterns of species distribution first observed and explained in the context of relatively monotonous slopes and abyssal plains must now be re-evaluated in the light of this newly recognized habitat heterogeneity. Based on a global database of nematode genus composition, collected as part of the Census of Marine Life, we show that macrohabitat heterogeneity contributes significantly to total deep-sea nematode diversity on a global scale. Different deep-sea settings harbour specific nematode assemblages. Some of them, like coral rubble zones or nodule areas, are very diverse habitats. Factors such as increased substrate complexity in the case of nodules and corals seem to facilitate the co-existence of a large number of genera with different modes of life, ranging from sediment dwelling to epifaunal. Furthermore, strong biochemical gradients in the case of vents or seeps are responsible for the success of particular genera, which are not prominent in more typical soft sediments. Many nematode deep-sea genera are cosmopolitan, inhabiting a variety of deep-sea habitats and oceans, whereas only 21% of all deep-sea genera recorded are restricted to a single habitat. In addition to habitat heterogeneity, regional differences are important in structuring nematode assemblages. For instance, seeps from different regions yield different genera that thrive on the sulphidic sediments. This study also shows that many areas and habitats remain highly under-sampled, affecting our ability to understand fully the contribution of habitat heterogeneity versus regional differences to global nematode diversity.

AB In fragmented landscapes, species persistence within isolated habitat patches is governed by a myriad of species life-history, habitat patch and landscape characteristics. We investigated the inter-specific variation in non-forest gap-crossing abilities of an entire tropical forest-dependent avifauna. We then related this measure of dispersal ability to species life-history characteristics and occupancy data from 31 variable-sized forest patches sampled within the same fragmented forest landscape. A total of 5436 gap-crossing movements of 231 forest-dependent bird species were observed across ten linear forest gaps of varying widths, adjacent to large areas of undisturbed forest. Species persistence in isolated fragments was strongly linked to gap-crossing ability. The most capable gap-crossers were medium to large-bodied species in the large insectivore, frugivore and granivore guilds, matching the most prevalent subset of species in small forest patches. However, some competent gap-crossing species failed to occur in small patches, and minimum forest-patch area requirements were more important in determining patch occupancy for these species. Narrow forest gaps (4-70 m) created by roads and power-lines may become territory boundaries, thereby eliminating home-range gap-crossing movements for many forest species, but permit rarer dispersal events. Wider gaps (> 70 m) may inhibit gap-crossing behaviour for all but the most vagile species. Although patch size and quality may be the most important factors in structuring species assemblages in forest fragments, our results show that the degree of patch isolation and permeability of the surrounding matrix also explain which species can persist in forest isolates. Reducing the number and width of forest-dividing gaps; maintaining and/or creating forest corridors and increasing matrix permeability through the creation and maintenance of 'stepping-stone' structures will maximise the species retention in fragmented tropical forest landscapes.

AB A major goal of ecology is to determine the causes of the latitudinal gradient in global distribution of species richness. Current evidence points to either energy availability or habitat heterogeneity as the most likely environmental drivers in terrestrial systems, but their relative importance is controversial in the absence of analyses of global (rather than continental or regional) extent. Here we use data on the global distribution of extant continental and continental island bird species to test the explanatory power of energy availability and habitat heterogeneity while simultaneously addressing issues of spatial resolution, spatial autocorrelation, geometric constraints upon species' range dynamics, and the impact of human populations and historical glacial ice-cover. At the finest resolution (1 degrees), topographical variability and temperature are identified as the most important global predictors of avian species richness in multipredictor models. Topographical variability is most important in single-predictor models, followed by productive energy. Adjusting for null expectations based on geometric constraints on species richness improves overall model fit but has negligible impact on tests of environmental predictors. Conclusions concerning the relative importance of environmental predictors of species richness cannot be extrapolated from one biogeographic realm to others or the globe. Rather a global perspective confirms the primary importance of mountain ranges in high-energy areas.

AB 1. To assess low temperature limits of root growth in woody plants from periodically cold climates, we exposed seedlings of broadleaved and conifer taxa to contrasting soil temperature gradients under unlimited nutrient supply.
   2. Five of the six species tested (Alnus viridis, Alnus glutinosa, Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris, Pinus cembra) produced hardly any (< 3%) new roots at temperatures below 6 degrees C, while Betula pendula did produce a few roots. Across all species, 85% of all new roots in the cold profile were confined to the rooting zone above 9 degrees C. Total root production in the gradual 16 to 2 degrees C temperature profile was only 40% of that obtained at a constant temperature of 16 degrees C.
   3. New shoot growth (21-23 degrees C) was unaffected by these soil temperature differences. Neither specific root length nor root width responded to treatments. Low and high elevation taxa did not differ in any of the traits or responses tested.
   4. Given that shoots were experiencing optimal conditions, the root data suggest a direct growth (sink) limitation by low temperatures during spring at low elevation, and potentially year-round limitation at the high-elevation climatic treeline. The critical temperature for significant root growth is approximate to 6 degrees C, which is close to the worldwide mean soil temperature at climatic treelines.

AB In spite of the many advances in land use and land cover change modelling over the past decade many challenges remain. One of these challenges relates to the explicit treatment of feedback mechanisms in descriptive models of the land use system. This paper argues for model-based analysis to explore the role of feedback mechanisms as determinants of land use dynamics and system evolution. Different types of feedbacks in the land use system are discussed addressing interactions over scales of analysis, feedbacks between impacts and driving forces of land use change and feedbacks between agents and land units. The inclusion of feedbacks in land use models will require new methods for model parameterization and calibration, but will ultimately increase our understanding of land use system dynamics.

ID GENERAL COEFFICIENT; GUILD STRUCTURE; SIMILARITY; COMMUNITY; RICHNESS
AB Euclidean distance is commonly involved in calculating functional diversity (FD), for example, in measures based on dendrogram branch lengths. We point out that this function is inappropriate in many cases and that the choice of clustering method is more crucial than earlier thought. Gower's formula and UPGMA clustering are suggested here as a standard combination of techniques for calculating FD. The advantage of Gower's measure is its suitability to a mixture of scale types and its tolerance to missing values. Examples demonstrate that UPGMA clustering is more robust and has a better goodness of fit to dissimilarities than complete and single linkage classifications. In addition, we propose that the effect of individual species on FD is best evaluated by species removals and subsequent comparisons of tree length values. The influence of each functional trait is optimally judged by considering both dendrogram length and topological changes.

AB Effective catchment management in the face of landuse alteration depends on our ability to quantify ecologically significant changes and to discriminate among varying levels of impact. We compared the efficiency of traditional structural indices of change (species composition) with functional measures based on species traits (including life-history, trophic, and morphological features) in an analysis of grassland streams along a gradient of agricultural development (ungrazed native tussock, grazed tussock, extensively grazed pasture, and intensive dairy and deer farming). Streams were categorized in relation to overall agricultural intensity, and separately in terms of increasing nutrient concentrations and fine sediments on the streambed. Only 5 of 60 individual species demonstrated a significant separation across the landuse gradient, whereas 14 of 53 trait categories did so. Traits associated with population resilience (short generation time, asexual reproduction) became more prevalent with more intense agricultural pressure, reflecting predicted increases in intensity and frequency of stream disturbance. We observed a shift away from a tendency to lay unattached eggs at the water surface of the stream, reflecting the increasing likelihood of smothering by sediment, as well as increases in highly flexible and streamlined body shapes. Principal components and correspondence analyses involving species or trait composition all were able to discriminate landuse practises, but more of the overall between-landuse variance was accounted for by trait composition than species composition. All biological measures (species or trait composition) were correlated with both nutrient concentrations and sedimentation. Nutrient concentrations were better related to species and trait-category densities, whereas sedimentation was related to trait-category relative abundances. Overall, species traits successfully complemented traditional structural measures by helping to differentiate the consequences of landuse intensification in grassland stream communities. Rather than simply recording a loss or reduction of species, our functional approach was able to identify sensitive life-history characteristics linked to the functioning of ecosystems, thereby facilitating the development of targeted management actions.

AB Empirical estimates of the relative importance of different barriers to gene flow between recently diverged species are important for understanding processes of speciation. I investigated the factors contributing to reproductive isolation between Costus pulverulentus and C. scaber (Costaceae), two closely related hummingbird-pollinated understory Neotropical herbs. I studied broad-scale geographic isolation, microhabitat isolation, flowering phenology, overlap in pollinator assemblages, floral constancy by pollinators, mechanical floral isolation, pollen-pistil interactions, seed set in interspecific crosses, and postzygotic isolation (hybrid seed germination, greenhouse survival to flowering, and pollen fertility). Aside from substantial geographic isolation, I found evidence for several factors contributing to reproductive isolation in the sympatric portion of their geographic ranges, but the identity and relative strength of these factors varied depending on the direction of potential gene flow. For C. pulverulentus as the maternal parent, mechanical floral isolation was the most important factor, acting as a complete block to interspecific pollen deposition. For C. scaber as the maternal parent, microhabitat isolation, pollinator assemblage, mechanical floral isolation, and postpollination pollen-pistil incompatibility were important. Overall, prezygotic barriers were found to be strong, resulting in 100% reproductive isolation for C. pulverulentus as the maternal parent and 99.0% reproductive isolation for C. scaber as the maternal parent. Some postzygotic isolation also was identified in the F-1 generation, increasing total isolation for C. scaber to 99.4%. The results suggest that ecological factors, including habitat use and plant-pollinator interactions, contributed to speciation in this system and evolved before extensive intrinsic postzygotic isolation.

AB According to conventional wisdom, functional diversity is exclusively a consequence of species having evolved adaptations to fill different niches within a heterogeneous environment. This view anticipates only one optimal combination of trait values in a given environment, but it is also conceivable that alternative designs of equal fitness in the same environment might evolve. To investigate that possibility, we use a genetic algorithm to search for optimal combinations of 34 functional traits in a realistic model of tree seedling growth and survival. We show that separate lineages of seedlings evolving in identical environments result in many alternative functional designs of approximately equal fitness.

AB Microbial communities are integral parts of soil and their activity is very important to the functioning of soil. Therefore, microorganisms should be included in soil quality classification and assessment concepts. The challenges of using microbial indicators are to identify the best choice among the many techniques available to assess soil quality and to convert the information obtained from the microbial indicator into a form relevant for policy makers. In this article, we present a wide range of possible microbial indicators, some of them standardized; each provides slightly different information on soil quality. Experience with the use of indicators for assessment of microbial communities and soil quality is discussed. At present, as many microbial indicators as possible should be included to gain experience. At a minimum, measures of microbial biomass, respiration, and N mineralization and a community profiling method (e.g., DGGE, PLFA, or CLPP) should be included. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Bats of the family Phyllostomidae are fundamental components of Neotropical mammalian diversity and display the greatest dietary diversity seen in any mammalian family. We studied trophic structure in a species-rich local assemblage of phyllostomids for which dietary data were collected during 10 years on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Correspondence analysis of >3800 dietary records from 30 syntopic species showed a structure supporting traditional divisions of animalivorous and phytophagous phyllostomids. Putatively omnivorous species actually grouped among the latter. Phytophagous phyllostomids separated into Piper-specialists, Ficus-specialists, and eclectic plant eaters which in turn were the main consumers of flower products. Discrete dietary groups were compatible with several clades of the two current phylogenetic hypotheses of phyllostomids. We show that the trophic structure of the local contemporary assemblage is largely conservative with respect to traceable ancestral habits, strongly suggesting that overall trophic structure was likely determined historically.

AB 1 The savanna-forest boundary in the tropics is marked by a discontinuity not only in tree density, but also in species composition, with few tree species regularly occurring in both savanna and forest environments.
   2 We performed comparative growth analysis for nine congeneric pairs, each containing one savanna species and one forest species, grown in a factorial design involving two light and two nutrient levels.
   3 Contrary to predictions, there was no difference in relative growth rates (RGR) between savanna and forest species. However, there were clear differences in allocation patterns and in phenotypic responses to light intensity. Savanna species allocated more biomass to roots and maintained lower leaf area per unit plant mass (LAR), and lower leaf area per unit leaf mass (SLA).
   4 Savanna species also exhibited greater phenotypic plasticity in specific leaf area, leaf area ratio and net assimilation rate in response to light intensity. An increase in LAR in response to shading of savanna species offset a decrease in net assimilation rate per unit leaf area (NAR), such that RGR was largely unaffected.
   5 For most plant traits measured, more of the interspecific variation could be attributed to differences among genera than to differences between the two functional types, indicating that these seedling traits are highly conserved within the congeneric species pairs. Many of these traits were correlated to seed mass, which is itself highly conserved within genera.

AB 1 In order to investigate the use of plant functional types as an alternative to floristic descriptions of response to grazing, we analysed plant communities from a cattle grazing experiment conducted in grassy eucalypt woodland in subtropical Queensland, Australia. The two variables analysed (landscape position and stocking rate) accounted for similar proportions of variation in the vegetation ground layer, although forbs were more sensitive to slope position and perennial grasses were more sensitive to stocking rate.
   2 As grazing pressure increased, perennial grasses declined, while the relative proportion of forbs and annual grasses increased. Detailed functional group analyses were conducted for the perennial grass and forb life-forms. Annual grasses were represented by only two species, preventing identification of functional types within this life-form.
   3 We conducted a five-step analysis for both perennial grasses and forbs as follows: (i) defining grazing-related species response groups; (ii) defining species groups based on natural attribute correlations; (iii) identifying attributes that changed significantly with grazing; (iv) identifying syndromes by relating (ii) and (iii); (v) describing functional types from (iii) and (iv), and assessing them against actual species response.
   4 Eight grass and eight forb functional types were identified. Of the taxa that had an observed response to grazing, 54% of the grass taxa and 57% of the forb taxa corresponded to one of these functional types in terms of meeting both grazing response and trait criteria. The five-stage analysis provided a comprehensive but complex approach to functional type identification.
   5 The functional types identified can be summarized as follows. Low levels of grazing were associated with more medium-sized, moderately leafy perennial grasses with wind-dispersed or adhesive seeds, and more erect or twining forbs with large to medium sized seeds. High levels of grazing were associated with: more annual grasses; low-growing leafy perennial grasses with small seeds having no dispersal appendages; mat-forming large-seeded forbs; and low-growing, scrambling, small-seeded forbs.

AB Using an expanded surface sample data set, representing lakes distributed across a transect from southernmost Canada to the Canadian High Arctic, a revised midge-palaeotemperature inference model was developed for eastern Canada. Modelling trials with weighted averaging (with classical and inverse deshrinking; with and without tolerance downweighting) and weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) regression, with and without square-root transformation of the species data, were used to identify the best model. Comparison of measured and predicted temperatures revealed that a 2 component WA-PLS model for square-root transformed percentage species data provided the model with the highest explained variance (r(jack)(2)=0.88) and the lowest error estimate (RMSEPjack=2.26 degrees C).
   Comparison of temperature inferences based on the new and old models indicates that the original model may have seriously under-estimated the magnitude of late-glacial temperature oscillations in Atlantic Canada. The new inferences suggest that summer surface water temperatures in Splan Pond, New Brunswick were approximately 10 to 12 degrees C immediately following deglaciation and during the Younger Dryas. During the Allerod and early Holocene, surface water temperatures of 20 to 24 degrees C were attained. The new model thus provides the basis for more accurate palaeotemperature reconstructions throughout easternmost Canada.

AB Almost half of the total organic carbon (C) in terrestrial ecosystems is stored in forest soils. By altering rates of input or release of C from soils, forest management activities can influence soil C stocks in forests. In this review, we synthesize current evidence regarding the influences of 13 common forest management practices on forest soil C stocks. Afforestation of former croplands generally increases soil C stocks, whereas on former grasslands and peatlands, soil C stocks are unchanged or even reduced following afforestation. The conversion of primary forests to secondary forests generally reduces soil C stocks, particularly if the land is converted to an agricultural land-use prior to reforestation. Harvesting, particularly clear-cut harvesting, generally results in a reduction in soil C stocks, particularly in the forest floor and upper mineral soil. Removal of residues by harvesting whole-trees and stumps negatively affects soil C stocks. Soil disturbance from site preparation decreases soil C stocks, particularly in the organic top soil, however improved growth of tree seedlings may outweigh soil C losses over a rotation. Nitrogen (N) addition has an overall positive effect on soil C stocks across a wide range of forest ecosystems. Likewise, higher stocks and faster accumulation of soil C occur under tree species with N-fixing associates. Stocks and accumulation rates of soil C also differ under different tree species, with coniferous species accumulating more C in the forest floor and broadleaved species tending to store more C in the mineral soil. There is some evidence that increased tree species diversity could positively affect soil C stocks in temperate and subtropical forests, but tree species identity, particularly N-fixing species, seems to have a stronger impact on soil C stocks than tree species diversity. Management of stand density and thinning have small effects on forest soil C stocks. In forests with high populations of ungulate herbivores, reduction in herbivory levels can increase soil C stocks. Removal of plant biomass for fodder and fuel is related to a reduction in the soil C stocks. Fire management practices such as prescribed burning reduce soil C stocks, but less so than wildfires which are more intense. For each practice, we identify existing gaps in knowledge and suggest research to address the gaps.

AB Plants are frequently classified as isohydric or anisohydric in an attempt to portray their water relations strategy or ecological niche. However, despite the popularity of the iso/anisohydric classification, the underlying biology remains unclear. We use here a simple hydraulic model and the extensive literature on grapevine hydraulics to illustrate that the iso/anisohydric classification of a plant depends on the definition used and the environment in which it is grown, rather than describing an intrinsic property of the plant itself. We argue that abandoning the iso/anisohydric terminology and returning to a more fundamental hydraulic framework would provide a stronger foundation for species comparisons and ecological predictions.

AB Microbial communities are spatially organized in both the environment and the human body. Although patterns exhibited by these communities are described by microbial biogeography, this discipline has previously only considered large-scale, global patterns. By contrast, the fine-scale positioning of a pathogen within an infection site can greatly alter its virulence potential. In this Review, we highlight the importance of considering spatial positioning in the study of polymicrobial infections and discuss targeting biogeography as a therapeutic strategy.

AB Invasion science is a very active subdiscipline of ecology. However, some scientists contend that theoretical integration has been limited and that predictive power remains weak. This paper, focusing on plants, proposes a new multi-pronged research strategy that builds on recent advances in invasion science. More intensive studies on particular model organisms and ecosystems are needed to improve our understanding of the full suite of interacting factors that influence invasions (model system research'). At the same time, comparative studies across many study systems are essential for unravelling the context-dependencies of insights that emerge from particular studies (multi-site studies'); and quantitative synthesis based on large datasets should be constrained to well-defined theoretical domains (focused meta-analysis'). We also suggest ways for better integration of information about species biology and ecosystem characteristics (invasion syndromes'). We expect that a resulting theory of invasions will need to be conceived as a somewhat heterogeneous conglomerate of elements of varying generality and predictive power: laws that apply to well-specified domains, general concepts and theoretical frameworks that can guide thinking in research and management, and in-depth knowledge about the drivers of particular invasions.

AB The Darwin-Bateman paradigm recognizes competition among males for access to multiple mates as the main driver of sexual selection. Increasingly, however, females are also being found to benefit from multiple mating so that polyandry can generate competition among females for access to multiple males, and impose sexual selection on female traits that influence their mating success. Polyandry can reduce a male's ability to monopolize females, and thus weaken male focused sexual selection. Perhaps the most important effect of polyandry on males arises because of sperm competition and cryptic female choice. Polyandry favours increased male ejaculate expenditure that can affect sexual selection on males by reducing their potential reproductive rate. Moreover, sexual selection after mating can ameliorate or exaggerate sexual selection before mating. Currently, estimates of sexual selection intensity rely heavily on measures of male mating success, but polyandry now raises serious questions over the validity of such approaches. Future work must take into account both pre- and post-copulatory episodes of selection. A change in focus from the products of sexual selection expected in males, to less obvious traits in females, such as sensory perception, is likely to reveal a greater role of sexual selection in female evolution.

AB Tropical tree communities present one of the most challenging systems for studying the processes underlying community assembly. Most community assembly hypotheses consider the relative importance of the ecological similarity of co-occurring species. Quantifying this similarity is a daunting and potentially impossible task in species-rich assemblages. During the past decade tropical tree ecologists have increasingly utilized phylogenetic trees and functional traits to estimate the ecological similarity of species in order to test mechanistic community assembly hypotheses. A large amount of work has resulted with many important advances having been made along the way. That said, there are still many outstanding challenges facing those utilizing phylogenetic and functional trait approaches to study community assembly. Here I review the conceptual background, major advances and major remaining challenges in phylogenetic- and trait-based approaches to community ecology with a specific focus on tropical trees. I argue that both approaches tremendously improve our understanding of tropical tree community ecology, but neither approach has fully reached its potential thus far.

AB Improvements in attentional performance are at the core of proposed niechanisms for stress reduction in mindfulness meditation practices. However, this claim can be questioned because no previous studies have actively manipulated test effort in control groups and controlled for effects of stress reduction per se. In a blinded design, 48 young, healthy meditation novices were randomly assigned to a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), nonmindfulness stress reduction (NMSR), or inactive control group. At posttest, inactive controls were randomly split into nonincentive and incentive controls,. the latter receiving a financial reward to improve attentional performance. Pre- and postintervention, 5 validated attention paradigms were employed along with self-report scales on mindfulness and perceived stress and saliva cortisol samples to measure physiological stress. Attentional effects of MBSR, NMSR, and the financial incentive were comparable or significantly larger in the incentive group on all reaction-time-based measures. However, selective attention in the MBSR group improved significantly more than in any other group. Similarly, only the MBSR intervention improved the threshold for conscious perception and visual working memory capacity. Furthermore, stress-reducing effects of MBSR were supported because those in the MBSR group showed significantly less perceived and physiological stress while increasing their mindfulness levels significantly. We argue that MBSR may contribute uniquely to attentional improvements but that further research focusing on non-reaction-time-based measures and outcomes less confounded by test effort is needed. Critically, our data demonstrate that previously observed improvements of attention after MBSR may be seriously confounded by test effort and nonmindfulness stress reduction.

AB The eukaryotic picoplankton is a heterogeneous collection of small protists 1 to 3 mu m in size populating surface oceans at abundances of 10(2) to 10(4) cells ml(-1). Pigmented cells are important primary producers that are at the base of food webs. Colorless cells are mostly bacterivores and play key roles in channeling bacteria to higher trophic levels as well as in nutrient recycling. Mixotrophy and parasitism are relevant but less investigated trophic paths. Molecular surveys of picoeukaryotes have unveiled a large phylogenetic diversity and new lineages, and it is critical to understand the ecological and evolutionary significance of this large and novel diversity. A main goal is to assess how individuals are organized in taxonomic units and how they participate in ecological processes. Picoeukaryotes are convincingly integral members of marine ecosystems in terms of cell abundance, biomass, activity, and diversity and they play crucial roles in food webs and biogeochemical cycles.

AB Biological diversity could enhance ecosystem service provision by increasing the mean level of services provided, and/or by providing more consistent (stable) services over space and time. Ecological theory predicts that when an ecosystem service is provided by many species, it will be stabilized against disturbance by a variety of 'stabilizing mechanisms.' However, few studies have investigated whether stabilizing mechanisms occur in real landscapes affected by human disturbance. We used two datasets on crop pollination by wild native bees to screen for and differentiate along three stabilizing mechanisms: density compensation (negative co-variance among species' abundances); response diversity (differential response to environmental variables among species); and cross-scale resilience (response to the same environmental variable at different scales by different species). In both datasets, we found response diversity and cross-scale resilience, but not density compensation. We conclude that stabilizing mechanisms may contribute to the stability of pollination services in our study areas, emphasizing the insurance value of seemingly 'redundant' species. Furthermore, the absence of density compensation that we found at the landscape scale contrasts with findings of previous small-scale experimental and modelling work, suggesting that we should not assume that density compensation will stabilize ecosystem services in real landscapes.

   XANTHOPHYLL-CYCLE; PHOTOSYSTEM-II; CARBON GAIN; GROWTH IRRADIANCE;
   DECIDUOUS FOREST; CANOPY STRUCTURE
AB There is a strong natural light gradient from the top to the bottom in plant canopies and along gap-understorey continua. Leaf structure and photosynthetic capacities change close to proportionally along these gradients, leading to maximisation of whole canopy photosynthesis. However, other environmental factors also vary within the light gradients in a correlative manner. Specifically, the leaves exposed to higher irradiance suffer from more severe heat, water, and photoinhibition stresses. Research in tree canopies and across gap-understorey gradients demonstrates that plants have a large potential to acclimate to interacting environmental limitations. The optimum temperature for photosynthetic electron transport increases with increasing growth irradiance in the canopy, improving the resistance of photosynthetic apparatus to heat stress. Stornatal constraints on photosynthesis are also larger at higher irradiance because the leaves at greater evaporative demands regulate water use more efficiently. Furthermore, upper canopy leaves are more rigid and have lower leaf osmotic potentials to improve water extraction from drying soil. The current review highlights that such an array of complex interactions significantly modifies the potential and realized whole canopy photosynthetic productivity, but also that the interactive effects cannot be simply predicted as composites of additive partial environmental stresses. We hypothesize that plant photosynthetic capacities deviate from the theoretical optimum values because of the interacting stresses in plant canopies and evolutionary trade-offs between leaf- and canopy-level plastic adjustments in light capture and use.

AB Patterns of native and alien plant diversity in response to disturbance were examined along an elevational gradient in blue oak savanna, chaparral, and coniferous forests. Total species richness, alien species richness, and alien cover declined with elevation, at scales from 1 to 1000 m(2). We found no support for the hypothesis that community diversity inhibits alien invasion. At the 1-m(2) point scale, where we would expect competitive interactions between the largely herbaceous flora to be most intense, alien species richness as well as alien cover increased with increasing native species richness in all communities. This suggests that aliens are limited not by the number of native competitors, but by resources that affect establishment of both natives and aliens.
   Blue-oak savannas were heavily dominated by alien species and consistently had more alien than native species at the 1-m(2) scale. All of these aliens are annuals, and it is widely thought that they have displaced native bunchgrasses. If true, this means that aliens have greatly increased species richness. Alternatively, there is a rich regional flora of native annual forbs that could have dominated these grasslands prior to displacement by alien grasses. On our sites, livestock grazing increased the number of alien species and alien cover only slightly over that of sites free of livestock grazing for more than a century, indicating some level of permanency to this invasion.
   In chaparral,,both diversity and aliens increased markedly several years after fire. Invasive species are rare in undisturbed shrublands, and alien propagules fail to survive the natural crown fires in these ecosystems. Thus, aliens necessarily must colonize after fire and, as a consequence, time since fire is an important determinant of invasive presence. Blue oak savannas are an important propagule source for alien species because they maintain permanent populations of all alien species encountered in postfire chaparral, and because the vegetation mosaic in this region places them in proximity to chaparral. The speed at which alien propagules reach a burned site and the speed at which the shrublands return to their former closed-canopy condition determine alien invasion. Frequent burning of this vegetation alters the balance in favor of alien invasion.
   In the higher-elevation coniferous forests, species diversity was a function of fire severity and time since fire. High-intensity fires create gaps that decrease canopy coverage and increase light levels and nutrients for an ephemeral successional flora. Few species have persistent seed banks, so the time since fire is an important determinant of colonization success. There was a highly significant interaction between fire severity and time since fire for understory cover, species richness, and alien richness and cover. Understory was sparse in the first year after fire, particularly in low-severity burns, and increased substantially several years after fire, particularly on high-severity burns. Both fire severity and time since fire affected alien species richness and dominance. Coniferous forests had about one-third as many alien species as the foothill oak savannas, and fewer than half of the species were shared between these communities. Unburned coniferous forests were largely free of alien species, whereas some burned sites had a significant alien presence, which presents a challenge for fire restoration of these forests.

AB Improved understanding of tree growth responses to climate is needed to model and predict forest ecosystem responses to current and future climatic variability. We used dendroecological methods to study the effects of climatic variability on radial growth of a subalpine conifer, mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana). Tree-ring chronologies were developed for 31 sites. spanning the latitudinal and elevational ranges of mountain hemlock in the Pacific Northwest. Factor analysis was used to identify common patterns of interannual growth variability among the chronologies, and correlation and regression analyses were used to identify climatic factors associated with that variability.
   Factor analysis identified three common growth patterns, representing groups of sites with different climate-growth relationships. At high-elevation and midrange sites in Washington and northern Oregon. growth was negatively correlated with spring snowpack depth, and positively correlated with growth-year summer temperature and the winter Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (PDO). In southern Oregon, growth was negatively correlated with spring snowpack depth and previous summer temperature, and positively correlated with previous summer precipitation. At the low-elevation sites. growth was mostly insensitive to annual climatic variability but displayed sensitivity to decadal variability in the PDO opposite to that found at high-elevation sites.
   Mountain hemlock growth appears to be limited by late snowmelt. short growing seasons. and coot summer temperatures throughout much of its range in the Pacific Northwest. Earlier snowmelt. higher summer temperatures. and lower summer precipitation in southern Oregon produce conditions under which growth is limited by summer temperature and/or soil water availability.
   Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations could produce warmer temperatures and reduced snowpack depths in the next century. Such changes would likely increase mountain hemlock growth and productivity throughout much of its range in Washington and northern Oregon. Increased summer drought stress and reduced productivity would be likely, however. in mountain hemlock forests of southern Oregon and near the species lower elevation limit at some sites.

AB We examined the breeding success of forest grouse in relation to anthropogenic forest fragmentation in Finland. Employing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and grouse data derived from Finnish wildlife triangle censuses conducted during 1989-1994, we combined the locations of 2267 Black Grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and 1060 Capercaillie (T. urogallus) females after the breeding season in mid-August with landscape data. The indicators of breeding success were the proportion of grouse hens with a brood and brood size. Two study areas teach 45 000 km(2)) in the boreal zone were selected for investigation.
   The breeding success of grouse was negatively correlated with both fragmentation of forest area per se by farmland and the: decreasing proportion of older forest as a result of clear-cutting. The extent of landscape accounting best for variation in nesting success was an order of magnitude larger (similar to 100 km(2)) than the area most probably used by a grouse female and her brood during the summer, which suggests that landscape scale factors may override local factors such as track size and distance from edge. The proportion of grouse hens with a brood was lower in heavily fragmented landscapes than in more continuous forest landscapes whereas only minor differences in brood size were detected. We suggest that the most likely cause of the observed spatial correlation was higher nest predation by generalist predators in fragmented forest landscapes. The effects of landscape composition on the breeding success of grouse were more marked in northern than in southern Finland, probably because predator populations are more food-regulated in the north. The diminished breeding success of forest grouse as a result of increased forest fragmentation is a probable cause of population declines in forest grouse species during the past decades in Fennoscandia.

AB The occupation of adjacent, nonoverlapping positions along environmental gradients by closely related and ecologically similar species has drawn considerable attention from many ecologists over the past decades. Condition-specific competition, wherein competitive superiority varies with the abiotic environmental gradient, has been proposed as the major structuring force behind such distributions. However, few studies have elucidated the underlying mechanisms, such as behavioral and demographic processes. We conducted laboratory experiments to examine the effects of temperature on interspecific competition between two stream salmonid fishes, Salvelinus malma and S. leucomaenis. The two species have a largely allopatric altitudinal distribution on Hokkaido Island, Japan, proposed to be the result of temperature-mediated competition. We tested predictions that at a higher temperature (12 degrees C), S. leucomaenis would dominate over S. malma in aggressive interactions, foraging performance, growth, and survival, but become subordinate at a lower temperature (6 degrees C). Indeed, S. leucomaenis initiated a greater number of aggressive acts, attained greater food intake and greater growth, and finally excluded S. malma at the higher temperature. Although the two species initiated a similar number of aggressive acts and foraged equally well at the lower temperature, S. leucomaenis achieved a higher growth rate than S. malma; however, the latter eventually became numerically dominant. Clear competitive release in allopatry occurred for S. malma only at the higher temperature, providing direct evidence of condition-specific asymmetric competition. The lower distribution boundary of S. malma in Hokkaido streams may therefore be determined by temperature-mediated condition-specific competition. However, mechanisms determining the upper distribution boundary of S. leucomaenis could not be fully explained by the competitive results at lower temperature, but required an understanding of how effects of competition interacted with species-specific physiological traits. Thus, species distributions along an environmental gradient cannot be solely explained by a simple model of condition-specific competition without considering mechanistic linkages among behavioral and physiological responses to the environment, resource use, and demographic processes.

AB This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of wildfires on ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal communities in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stands. Below- and above-ground communities were analysed in terms of species richness and evenness by examining mycorrhizas and sporocarps in a chronosequence of burned stands in comparison with adjacent unburned late-successional stands. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-region (rDNA) of mycobionts from single mycorrhizas was digested with three restriction enzymes and compared with an ITS-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) reference database of EM sporocarps. Spatial variation seemed to be more prominent than the effects of fire on the EM fungal species composition. Most of the common species tended to be found in all sites, suggesting that EM fungal communities show a high degree of continuity following low-intensity wildfires. Species richness was not affected by fire, whereas the evenness of species distributions of mycorrhizas was lower in the burned stands. The diversity of EM fungi was relatively high considering that there were only three EM tree species present in the stands. In total, 135 EM taxa were identified on the basis of their RFLP patterns; 66 species were recorded as sporocarps, but only 11 of these were also recorded as mycorrhizas. The species composition of the below-ground community of EM fungi did not reflect that of the sporocarps produced. EM fungal species present in our ITS-RFLP reference database accounted for 54-99% of the total sporocarp production in the stands, but only 0-32% of the mycorrhizal abundance.

AB Almost all productive Swedish forests have been managed for timber production for a long period of time. More sensitive so-called red-listed species are today restricted to small remnant habitats in a managed landscape matrix. It has been hypothesized that natural biodiversity can be maintained if forest management mimics natural processes, blends natural structures and includes natural composition into the production forest. The most important restoration measures in Swedish boreal forests for promoting biodiversity are to increase the number and quality of undisturbed forests, the amounts of coarse woody debris, the number of deciduous trees, and to introduce fire as an ecological process.
   On the basis of current knowledge of natural forest dynamics, we here present management options for three major site types in boreal Sweden which mimic natural dynamics better than traditional forestry. In the natural stages, the sites carried (1) Scots pine forest, (2) deciduous or Norway spruce dominated forest, and (3) Norway spruce forest regenerated by so-called gap dynamics, respectively.
   The flora and fauna that characterize the first two, fire-influenced sites are considered relatively well-adapted to the kind of large-scale disturbances characterizing forestry. On these sites, therefore, the modifications proposed are within today's approach to applying the clear felling system. Sites that seldom experience fire may host species extremely sensitive to large-scale disturbances. If such sites are to be used for timber production, modified forestry practices using selection or shelterwood systems with relatively dense shelterwoods are suggested. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Forest management alters the pattern of forest dynamics from that in natural conditions in the boreal region. In order to examine how certain forestry measures matching natural dynamics affect forest insects, we compared assemblages of saproxylic Coleoptera on dead, standing birch trunks left behind in eight clear-cut areas with corresponding assemblages in seven mature forests in southern and eastern Finland. We used trunk-window traps for sampling. Distinct beetle assemblages were associated with the different habitats. Median numbers of species or specimens caught did not differ between closed forests and clear-cuts, but individual beetle species occurred unevenly among the habitats. Several beetle species associated with open forest habitat, e.g. burned forests or storm-damage areas, including species regarded as threatened in Finland, were found almost exclusively, in clear-cuts. Correspondingly, a number of beetle species occurring frequently in closed forests were not found in clear-cuts. We conclude that dead trunks left in the clear-cut areas may host not only generalist saproxylic species but also many beetle species specialized to warm, sun-exposed environments, and such species may not be able to survive in closed forests. Management measures matching suppressed natural disturbances are found useful in preserving diversity in managed forests.

AB 1. This paper examines long-term changes in the structure and composition of the groundfish species assemblage in three regions of the north-western North Sea. Scottish fisheries research vessel data collected during the months July-September over the period 1929-53 are compared with more recent August groundfish survey data covering the period 1980-93. Trends in the whole groundfish assemblage, and in a subset of the assemblage that is not targeted by commercial fisheries, are described.
   2. Long-term differences in species assemblage were subtle, and were most apparent in the dominance structure. Species diversity in the whole groundfish assemblage was marginally greater in the period 1929-53, but no difference was apparent within the non-target species assemblage. For the whole groundfish assemblage, diversity was greatest in the inshore region and least in the offshore area, but there was no obvious spatial gradient for the non-target species assemblage.
   3. Multivariate analyses indicated long-term changes and between-area differences in the species composition for both the whole groundfish assemblage and the non-target species subset. More detailed examination of the data revealed that the long-term changes resulted from relatively small and subtle differences in the relative abundance of rarer species, such as grey gurnard Eutrigla gurnardus (L.) and spur-dog Squalus acanthius L.. In contrast, changes in the relative abundance of the more common species, such as Norway pout Trisopterus esmarkii (Nilsson) and whiting Merlangius merlangus (L.), explained much of the between-area variation.
   4. Examination of species aggregated length-frequency distributions suggested that by the 1980s there had been a shift towards assemblages in which smaller fish were more highly represented. This was only apparent, however, in the whole groundfish species assemblage; the length-frequency distributions of non-targeted species were almost identical in the two time periods.
   5. Overall, the results suggest that, although differences in the structure of the whole fish assemblage can be detected, the non-target groundfish assemblage appears to have remained relatively unchanged, despite a century of intensive fishing activity.

AB Most general models do not include herbivory as a major agent of successional change. Potentially, herbivores can affect succession in three ways: accelerating or decelerating the rate of succession, where the sequence of dominant species is unaltered, or deflecting succession onto a new trajectory, where the species composition of dominants becomes substantially different than during ungrazed succession. We examined these alternatives for benthic algae on a coral-reef crest off Oahu, Hawaii. In this system, exposed coral-rock surfaces naturally undergo one of two major grazing regimes: (1) relatively protected inside defended territories of the damselfish Stegastes fasciolatus (Pomacentridae), where the benthos is dominated by filamentous algae; or (2) exposed to abundant schooling parrotfishes (Scaridae) and surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae) outside territories, where to abundant schooling parrotfishes (Scaridae) and surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae) outside territories, where the bottom is covered mostly by crustose algae. We compared the effects of this differential grazing on primary succession, relative to ungrazed succession, by distributing on the same date 1332 settling surfaces among three treatments: exposed inside damselfish territories, exposed just outside territories, and within fish-exclusion cages just outside territories. To balance the advantages and disadvantages of different settling surfaces, we used equal numbers of each of three kinds of 50-cm(2) settling plates: naturally contoured coral rock, coral rock cut into flat plates, and roughly sanded PVC plastic. To follow relative successional pathways, we sampled destructively 63 plates (21 from each grazing treatment) 17 times over 1 yr. Plates placed in the field several months before and after the main experiment suggested no seasonal differences in algal colonization. A concurrent cage-control experiment involving 144 settling plates, combined with measurements of light and water motion inside vs. outside cages, indicated that the secondary effects of cages were minor compared to the primary effect of preventing fish grazing.
   In the absence of fish grazing within cages, algal succession over the year followed three stages: early dominance by simple green and brown filaments (such as Enteramorpha rhizoidea and Ectocarpus indicus), a midsuccessional stage dominated by thin and finely branched red filaments (such as Centroceras clavulatum and Taenioma perpusillum), and a late stage dominated by blades and coarsely branched thick filaments (especially Tolypoicladia glomerulata). Species diversity followed a unimodal pattern during ungrazed succession, declining as a few species of late-stage algae predominated.
   Inside damselfish territories, succession was decelerated. The early stage was protracted and the midsuccessional stage, similar to natural assemblages inside territories, still dominated by the end of the year. Here, herbivory was of moderately destructive intensity (as measured by the density of fish bite marks that removed algal holdfasts) and fairly nonselective (as measured by comparisons of the gut contents of damselfish paired with samples of their algal mats). Algal biomass reached only about a quarter of what accumulated during ungrazed succession, but species diversity gradually increased through time. By the end of the experiment, algal species diversity was greatest inside damselfish territories compared to the other two grazing treatments.
   Outside territories, where grazing was destructively intense, resulting in the removal of all erect algae, succession was strongly deflected. The early stage was quickly replaced by a low-biomass and low-diversity assemblage of crusts (such as Hydrolithon reinboldii) and prostrate blue-green mats (such as Calothrix crustacea), characteristic of natural assemblages outside territories.
   Besides demonstrating the importance of herbivory during succession and providing insight on the mechanisms involved, these patterns have ramifications for explaining the maintenance of high local species diversity on coral reefs at two spatial scales. Between patches, differential grazing by territorial damselfish vs. schooling herbivores causes succession to follow different trajectories toward different algal assemblages. Within patches defined by damselfish territories, moderate grazing decelerates succession and prolongs a high-diversity midsuccessional stage. Both these patterns provide an example of predation maintaining high local diversity in tropical systems, and indicate that territorial damselfish can function as keystone species on coral reefs.

AB Ecologists who specialize in translational ecology (TE) seek to link ecological knowledge to decision making by integrating ecological science with the full complement of social dimensions that underlie today's complex environmental issues. TE is motivated by a search for outcomes that directly serve the needs of natural resource managers and decision makers. This objective distinguishes it from both basic and applied ecological research and, as a practice, it deliberately extends research beyond theory or opportunistic applications. TE is uniquely positioned to address complex issues through interdisciplinary team approaches and integrated scientist-practitioner partnerships. The creativity and context-specific knowledge of resource managers, practitioners, and decision makers inform and enrich the scientific process and help shape use-driven, actionable science. Moreover, addressing research questions that arise from on-the-ground management issues -as opposed to the top-down or expert-oriented perspectives of traditional science -can foster the high levels of trust and commitment that are critical for long-term, sustained engagement between partners.

AB The ability to explain why multispecies assemblages produce greater biomass compared to monocultures, has been a central goal in the quest to understand biodiversity effects on ecosystem function. Species contributions to ecosystem function can be driven by two processes: niche complementarity and a selection effect that is influenced by fitness (competitive) differences, and both can be approximated with measures of species' traits. It has been hypothesised that fitness differences are associated with few, singular traits while complementarity requires multidimensional trait measures. Here, using experimental data from plant assemblages, I show that the selection effect was strongest when trait dissimilarity was low, while complementarity was greatest with high trait dissimilarity. Selection effects were best explained by a single trait, plant height. Complementarity was correlated with dissimilarity across multiple traits, representing above and below ground processes. By identifying the relevant traits linked to ecosystem function, we obtain the ability to predict combinations of species that will maximise ecosystem function.

AB Managers are being challenged by multiple (and diverse) stakeholders, which have variety of expectations and informational needs about their firm's supply chains. Collectively, these expectations and needs form a multi-faceted view of stakeholder accountability, namely the extent to which a firm justifies behaviors and actions across its extended supply chain to stakeholders. To date, sustainable supply chain management research has largely focused on monitoring as a self-managed set of narrowly defined evaluative activities employed by firms to provide stakeholder accountability. Nevertheless, evidence is emerging that firms have developed a wide variety of monitoring systems in order to align with stakeholders' expectations and leverage accountability to stakeholders. Drawing from the accounting literature, we synthesize a model that proposes how firms might address accountability for sustainability issues in their supply chain. At its core, the construct of sustainable evaluation and verification (SEV) captures three interrelated dimensions: inclusivity, scope, and disclosure. These dimensions characterize how supply chain processes might identify key measures, collect and process data, and finally, verify materiality, reliability and accuracy of any data and resulting information. As a result, the concept of monitoring is significantly extended, while also considering how different stakeholders can play diverse, active roles as metrics are established, audits are conducted, and information is validated. Also, several antecedents of SEV systems are explored. Finally, the means by which an SEV system can create a competitive advantage are investigated. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Increasing evidence has revealed a close association between intestinal bacterial communities and human health. However, given that host phylogeny shapes the composition of intestinal microbiota, it is unclear whether changes in intestinal microbiota structure in relation to shrimp health status. In this study, we collected shrimp and seawater samples from ponds with healthy and diseased shrimps to understand variations in bacterial communities among habitats (water and intestine) and/or health status. The bacterial communities were clustered according to the original habitat and health status. Habitat and health status constrained 14.6 and 7.7 % of the variation in bacterial communities, respectively. Changes in shrimp intestinal bacterial communities occurred in parallel with changes in disease severity, reflecting the transition from a healthy to a diseased state. This pattern was further evidenced by 38 bacterial families that were significantly different in abundance between healthy and diseased shrimps; moderate changes were observed in shrimps with sub-optimal health. In addition, within a given bacterial family, the patterns of enrichment or decrease were consistent with the known functions of those bacteria. Furthermore, the identified 119 indicator taxa exhibited a discriminative pattern similar to the variation in the community as a whole. Overall, this study suggests that changes in intestinal bacterial communities are closely associated with the severity of shrimp disease and that indicator taxa can be used to evaluate shrimp health status.

AB Soil microorganisms are sensitive to environment disturbances, and such alterations have consequences on microbial diversity and functions. Our hypothesis is that alpha diversity of microbial communities and functional diversity decrease from undisturbed to disturbed soils, with consequences for functional redundancy in the soil ecosystem. To test this hypothesis, we used soil DNA shotgun metagenomics approach to assess the soil microbiome in a chronosequence of land-use from a native tropical forest, followed by deforestation and cultivation of soybean croplands and pasture in different seasons. Agriculture and pasture soils were among the most diverse and presented higher functional redundancy, which is important to maintain the ecosystem functioning after the forest conversion. On the other hand, the ecosystem equilibrium in forest is maintained based on a lower alpha diversity but higher abundance of microorganisms. Our results indicate that land-use change alters the structure and composition of microbial communities; however, ecosystem functionality is overcome by different strategies based on the abundance and diversity of the communities.

AB Citizen scientists have the potential to play a crucial role in the study of rapidly changing lady beetle (Coccinellidae) populations. We used data derived from three coccinellid-focused citizen-science programs to examine the costs and benefits of data collection from direct citizen-science (data used without verification) and verified citizen-science (observations verified by trained experts) programs. Data collated through direct citizen science overestimated species richness and diversity values in comparison to verified data, thereby influencing interpretation. The use of citizen scientists to collect data also influenced research costs; our analysis shows that verified citizen science was more cost effective than traditional science (in terms of data gathered per dollar). The ability to collect a greater number of samples through direct citizen science may compensate for reduced accuracy, depending on the type of data collected and the type(s) and extent of errors committed by volunteers.

AB Lakes can influence regional climate, yet most general circulation models have, at best, simple and largely untested representations of lakes. We developed the Lake, Ice, Snow, and Sediment Simulator (LISSS) for inclusion in the land-surface component (CLM4) of an earth system model (CESM1). The existing CLM4 lake model performed poorly at all sites tested; for temperate lakes, summer surface water temperature predictions were 10-25 degrees C lower than observations. CLM4-LISSS modifies the existing model by including (1) a treatment of snow; (2) freezing, melting, and ice physics; (3) a sediment thermal submodel; (4) spatially variable prescribed lake depth; (5) improved parameterizations of lake surface properties; (6) increased mixing under ice and in deep lakes; and (7) correction of previous errors. We evaluated the lake model predictions of water temperature and surface fluxes at three small temperate and boreal lakes where extensive observational data was available. We also evaluated the predicted water temperature and/or ice and snow thicknesses for ten other lakes where less comprehensive forcing observations were available. CLM4-ISSS performed very well compared to observations for shallow to medium-depth small lakes. For large, deep lakes, the under-prediction of mixing was improved by increasing the lake eddy diffusivity by a factor of 10, consistent with previous published analyses. Surface temperature and surface flux predictions were improved when the aerodynamic roughness lengths were calculated as a function of friction velocity, rather than using a constant value of 1 mm or greater. We evaluated the sensitivity of surface energy fluxes to modeled lake processes and parameters. Large changes in monthly-averaged surface fluxes (up to 30 W m(-2)) were found when excluding snow insulation or phase change physics and when varying the opacity, depth, albedo of melting lake ice, and mixing strength across ranges commonly found in real lakes. Typical variation among model parameterization choices can therefore cause persistent local surface flux changes much larger than expected changes in greenhouse forcing. We conclude that CLM4-LISSS adequately simulates lake water temperature and surface energy fluxes, with errors comparable in magnitude to those resulting from uncertainty in global lake properties, and is suitable for inclusion in global and regional climate studies.

AB This review identifies several important challenges in null model testing in ecology: 1) developing randomization algorithms that generate appropriate patterns for a specified null hypothesis; these randomization algorithms stake out a middle ground between formal PearsonNeyman tests (which require a fully-specified null distribution) and specific process-based models (which require parameter values that cannot be easily and independently estimated); 2) developing metrics that specify a particular pattern in a matrix, but ideally exclude other, related patterns; 3) avoiding classification schemes based on idealized matrix patterns that may prove to be inconsistent or contradictory when tested with empirical matrices that do not have the idealized pattern; 4) testing the performance of proposed null models and metrics with artificial test matrices that contain specified levels of pattern and randomness; 5) moving beyond simple presenceabsence matrices to incorporate species-level traits (such as abundance) and site-level traits (such as habitat suitability) into null model analysis; 6) creating null models that perform well with many sites, many species pairs, and varying degrees of spatial autocorrelation in species occurrence data. In spite of these challenges, the development and application of null models has continued to provide valuable insights in ecology, evolution, and biogeography for over 80 years.

AB Landscape fragmentation is usually caused by many different anthropogenic influences and landscape elements Scientifically revealing the spatial relationships between landscape fragmentation and related factors is highly significant for land management and urban planning The former studies on statistical relationships between landscape fragmentation and related factors were almost global and single-scaled In fact, landscape fragmentations and their causal factors are usually location-dependent and scale-dependent Therefore we used geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) with a case study in Shenzhen City Guangdong Province China to examine spatially varying and scale-dependent relationships between effective mesh size an indicator of landscape fragmentation and related factors We employed the distance to main roads as a direct influencing factor and slope and the distance to district centers as indirect influencing factors which affect landscape fragmentation through their impacts on land use and urbanization respectively The results show that these relationships are spatially non-stationary and scale-dependent, indicated by clear spatial patterns of parameter estimates obtained from GWR models and the curves with a characteristic scale of 12 km for three explanatory variables respectively Moreover GWR models have better model performance than OLS models with the same Independent variable as is indicated by lower AICc values higher Adjusted R-2 values from GWR and the reduction of the spatial autocorrelation of residuals GWR models can reveal detailed site information on the different roles of related factors in different parts of the study area Therefore this finding can provide a scientific basis for policy-making to mitigate the negative effects of landscape fragmentation (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB A major challenge in ecology is to understand how the millions of species on Earth are organized into biological communities. Mechanisms promoting coexistence are one such class of organizing processes, which allow multiple species to persist in the same trophic level of a given web of species interactions. If some mechanism promotes the coexistence of two or more species, each species must be able to increase when it is rare and the others are at their typical abundances; this invasibility criterion is fundamental evidence for species coexistence regardless of the mechanism. In an attempt to evaluate the level of empirical support for coexistence mechanisms in nature, we surveyed the literature for empirical studies of coexistence at a local scale (i.e., species found living together in one place) to determine whether these studies satisfied the invasibility criterion. In our survey, only seven of 323 studies that drew conclusions about species coexistence evaluated invasibility in some way in either observational or experimental studies. In addition, only three other studies evaluated necessary but not sufficient conditions for invasibility (i.e., negative density dependence and a trade-off in performance that influences population regulation). These results indicate that, while species coexistence is a prevalent assumption for why species are able to live together in one place, critical empirical tests of this fundamental assumption of community structure are rarely performed. These tests are central to developing a more robust understanding of the relative contributions of both deterministic and stochastic processes structuring biological communities.

AB We study the dynamics of evolutionary recovery after an abrupt environmental shift in a density-regulated population with evolving plasticity. Maladaptation to the new environment initially causes the population to decline, until adaptive phenotypic plasticity and genetic evolution restore positive population growth rate. We assume that selection on a quantitative trait is density-independent and that the initial cost of plasticity is much lower than the benefit of the initial plastic response. The initial partially adaptive plasticity reduces the effective magnitude of the environmental shift, whereas evolution of plasticity increases the rate of adaptation. Both effects greatly facilitate population persistence. In contrast, density dependence of population growth always hinders persistence. With theta-logistic population regulation, a lower value of. produces a faster initial population decline and a higher extinction risk.

AB Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain the annual migration of the Serengeti wildebeest, but few studies have compared distribution patterns with environmental drivers. We used a rainfall-driven model of grass dynamics and wildebeest movement to generate simulated monthly wildebeest distributions, with wildebeest movement decisions depending on 14 candidate models of adaptive movement in response to resource availability. We used information-theoretic approaches to compare the fits of simulated and observed monthly distribution patterns at two spatial scales over a 3-year period. Models that included the intake rate and nitrogen (N) concentration of green grass and the suppressive effect of tree cover on grass biomass provided the best model fits at both spatial scales tested, suggesting that digestive constraints and protein requirements may play key roles in driving migratory behavior. The emergence of a migration was predicted to be dependent on the ability of the wildebeest to track changes in resource abundance at relatively large scales (180-100 km). When movement decisions are based solely on local resource availability, the wildebeest fail to migrate across the ecosystem. Our study highlights the potentially key role of strong and countervailing seasonally driven rainfall and fertility gradients-a consistent feature of African savanna ecosystems-as drivers of long-distance seasonal migrations in ungulates.

AB Marine herbivorous fishes are considered to be of critical importance in determining the biological structure of shallow reef environments, and by implication have key roles in carbon flux in reef ecosystems. Despite this, the nutritional processes that underpin these critical ecological roles have received comparatively little attention.
   Here we give an overview of recent progress in the nutritional ecology of marine herbivorous fishes, and then examine two recent paradigms that we consider important in the development of the field: (i) the role of temperature in latitudinal gradients of diversity and abundance, and (ii) the impact of these fishes on coral reefs. Our aim is to illustrate how an integrative nutritional ecology approach can enrich insights gained from studies of fish herbivory, and to emphasize the distinctive differences between herbivory in marine and terrestrial systems.
   We argue that much of the work on trophic biology in marine herbivorous fishes has focused on the ecological impacts of fishes on reefs, the deterrent properties of marine algae, and the morphological and mechanical aspects of ingestion. This has come at the expense of two of the elements necessary for an integrative understanding of feeding ecology, that is, food composition and the physiological processes involved in nutrient extraction and utilization. Together, these factors have hindered the development of the nutritional framework for analysing food resources, feeding patterns and evolutionary trends that has proved successful for terrestrial vertebrate herbivores.
   The reef grazing and algal secondary metabolite paradigms, while both extremely productive, have failed to develop the clear predictive framework for diet choice required in broader contexts such as reef management and understanding the evolution of herbivory. The lack of a focus on nutritional factors has led to premature conclusions on the influence of temperature on algal digestion, both at the level of digestive processes and the biogeography of marine faunas.
   Some marine herbivorous fishes appear to be bending the 'rules' of hindgut fermentation, especially with respect to temperature and fermentation substrates, and so the study of nutritional ecology in these animals has potential to generate novel insights for the field of vertebrate nutrition in general.

AB Background Modelling plant growth allows us to test hypotheses and carry out virtual experiments concerning plant growth processes that could otherwise take years in field conditions. The visualization of growth simulations allows us to see directly and vividly the outcome of a given model and provides us with an instructive tool useful for agronomists and foresters, as well as for teaching. Functional-structural (FS) plant growth models are nowadays particularly important for integrating biological processes with environmental conditions in 3-D virtual plants, and provide the basis for more advanced research in plant sciences.
   Scope In this viewpoint paper, we ask the following questions. Are we modelling the correct processes that drive plant growth, and is growth driven mostly by sink or source activity? In current models, is the importance of soil resources (nutrients, water, temperature and their interaction with meristematic activity) considered adequately? Do classic models account for architectural adjustment as well as integrating the fundamental principles of development? Whilst answering these questions with the available data in the literature, we put forward the opinion that plant architecture and sink activity must be pushed to the centre of plant growth models. In natural conditions, sinks will more often drive growth than source activity, because sink activity is often controlled by finite soil resources or developmental constraints.
   PMA06 This viewpoint paper also serves as an introduction to this Special Issue devoted to plant growth modelling, which includes new research covering areas stretching from cell growth to biomechanics. All papers were presented at the Second International Symposium on Plant Growth Modeling, Simulation, Visualization and Applications (PMA06), held in Beijing, China, from 13-17 November, 2006. Although a large number of papers are devoted to FS models of agricultural and forest crop species, physiological and genetic processes have recently been included and point the way to a new direction in plant modelling research.

AB Question: Understanding functional change in vegetation and how it might impact on vegetation change and ecosystem function entails measuring plant traits and attributes in situ. However, it is not realistically possible to sample every species for every trait, hence we need to address the consequences of not sampling all species.
   Location: Nine arable and grassland sites from the machair of the Western Isles, UK and twenty grassland and woodland sited from Nynas Nature Reserve, southern Sweden.
   Methods: The effects of progressively reducing the proportion of species used to estimate the weighted mean of a range of continuous and qualitative traits were assessed.
   Results: Relative abundance and species traits were related, and hence there is a cost in accuracy in reducing the number of species sampled in estimating the weighted mean for the vegetation. This cost was higher for qualitative traits than quantitative ones.
   Conclusion: The analysis suggested that for the quantitative trait; a minimum of those species that make up at least 80% of the vegetation should be sampled if traits do not vary greatly between species. If this variability is high and the trait is likely to be correlated to abundance then greater effort in sampling species for traits is required. Qualitative information oil the rarer species should still be entered into the analysis if it can be accessed in any way, even if quantitative information for that species is unavailable.

AB Experimental manipulations and observational surveys often produce conflicting conclusions regarding the effects of native species diversity on community susceptibility to invasion. Both provide useful pieces of information, but typically each asks fundamentally different questions. Surveys tell us that locations with species-rich native communities are characterized by conditions that promote exotic species richness, whereas experiments tell us that, within a location, the loss of resident species increases the likelihood of the establishment of new species. In the present study, we apply observational data to a study of the consequences of species loss for invasion in order to assess the generality across scales and the relative importance of experimental results. We begin by using long-term recruitment data to explore how small-scale mechanisms of biotic resistance could operate on a landscape scale. We find that individual species have complementary seasonal recruitment patterns such that more diverse communities might be able to more consistently fill space that opens throughout the season, leading to reduced invasion success. However, field surveys of native and invader richness show that the slope of the relationship between native and invader diversity changes with the availability of resources (space) and the presence of habitat-forming foundation species. In these systems, biotic resistance appears to be important only when resources are scarce and foundation species are rare. Thus, we conclude that biotic resistance, as identified in experiments, is a consistent effect of diversity that can be explained mechanistically at even a landscape scale, but that it plays a dominant role only when total diversity is constrained by resource limitation. This situation is common in experimentally constructed communities, but may be less so in nature.

AB Forest inventory data were collected in 1998-2000 from fifteen I ha permanent plots along a disturbance gradient in a dry tropical forest region of India. A total of 4033 stems, 49 species, 44 genera and 24 families of adult trees (greater than or equal to30 cm CBH), occurred in the 15 ha of forest area. The study indicated that the dry tropical forest is characterised by a patchy distribution of species and individuals with mixed species composition, and the sites are represented by different combinations of the dominants and co-dominant species. A PCA ordination indicated that the variation in species composition of the sites is explained by the variation in soil nitrogen as well as the degree of disturbance. About half the analysed species showed changing nature in dispersion along the disturbance gradient. The distribution of Boswellia serrata, Holarrhena antidysenterica and Lannea coromandelica changed from clumped to uniform and the distribution of Butea monosperma, Cassia fistula and Elaeodendron glaucum changed from uniform to clumped as the degree of disturbance increased. The mean stem density was highest (419 stems ha(-1)) at the least disturbed site and lowest (35 stems ha(-1)) at the highly disturbed site, and for basal area, the highest value (13.78 m(2) ha(-1)) was for the second least disturbed forest site and the lowest value (1.30 m(2) ha(-1)) was for the most disturbed site. The total number of stems, indices of species richness, evenness and a-diversity decreased with disturbance. A strong influence of number of species per individual on P-diversity suggests that for resisting change in floristics due to disturbance, a site must have low species-individual ratio.

AB With the widespread decline and endangerment of freshwater fishes, there is a need to clearly define habitat requirements for effective species management and habitat restoration. Fish biologists often infer habitat requirements on the basis of correlative habitat associations in the wild. This generates descriptive models that predict species presence or abundance at a hierarchy of scales: distributional (macrohabitat) models predict the presence/absence of species at large scales, capacity models predict the abundance at the reach or channel unit scale when a species is present, and microhabitat models predict the distribution of individual fish at smaller spatial scales (e.g., instream habitat suitability Curves for velocity, depth, and substrate). However, relationships based on habitat associations in the wild rarely give definitive insight into the absolute requirement for a particular habitat (i.e.. necessity of a habitat for the persistence of individuals and Populations). The assumption that habitat selection accurately reflects the fitness consequences of habitat use is rarely validated; more rigorous assessment of habitat requirement Usually involves manipulative experiments or measurements of fitness (individual growth, survival. or reproductive Success) in different habitat types. Bioenergetic habitat models offer a promising mechanistic alternative to correlative habitat suitability models for drift-feeding, fish and have the potential to predict habitat-specific growth rates on the basis of swimming costs and energy intake. Once smaller-scale habitat requirements of individuals ire well defined, the final step is to determine when and how the requirements of individuals limit populations. Extrapolating smaller-scale habitat requirements to the Population level requires either large-scale (ecosystem) manipulations of habitat, adaptive management, or habitat-explicit population models. For species with distinct ontogenic shifts in habitat requirements, the concept of optimal habitat ratios may be useful for identifying limiting habitat factors and defining baselines for habitat restoration. Defining, optimal habitat configurations for different species may also provide a basis for predicting how habitat change differentially affects species with contrasting habitat needs.

AB Stable N isotopes are used to examine the source, flow and fate of N at scales ranging from greenhouse pots to landscapes. There are two main approaches: the N-15-enriched method applies an artificially enriched source of N-15 and the N-15 natural abundance (delta N-15) method uses natural N-15 differences between N sources and sinks.
   The delta N-15 method is good for semi-quantitative estimates of N flow in undisturbed ecosystems, for analyzing patterns, and for developing new hypotheses, particularly when spatial variability across a landscape or watershed can be explained. The spatial variability of delta N-15 across a landscape is often non-random, following predictable spatial patterns. Topographic features control the rate of various hydrological and biological processes, resulting in significantly different. N between lower and upper slope positions. However, if the difference between source-delta N-15 and sink-delta N-15 is small due to inherent background variability and/or if fractionating processes have a large effect on the isotopic signature of the N to be traced, delta N-15 will not work as a tracer.
   With the N-15-enriched method, the isotopic signature of the enriched tracer can be pre-determined to ensure a significant difference in atom% (15) N between source and background levels, even when fractionation occurs. In most situations, the N-15-enriched method can be successfully used as a tracer to test hypotheses and to quantify N cycling through the landscape, regardless of background variability in delta N-15. Limitations of the N-15-enriched method include the cost associated with applying an enriched tracer, especially at the landscape scale, and the potentially confounding effects of applying N to a previously undisturbed landscape.

AB All life forms rely on bacterial processes for their survival. Bacterial diversity is greater than the diversity of any other group of organisms. Bacteria are responsible for diverse metabolic functions that affect soil and plant health. Nutrient cycling, organic matter formation and decomposition, soil structure formation, and plant growth promotion are among the beneficial functions that bacteria perform. Deleterious effects include plant disease promotion. As bacterial functioning is critical to soil and plant health, the objective of this manuscript was to explore bacterial diversity and bioindication in agroecosystems. Microbial research has generally involved studying bacteria that are culturable. However, it is estimated that only a small portion of all bacteria are culturable, a vast portion of soil bacterial communities remains unstudied. With molecular techniques, more information can be obtained about those bacteria that are contributing to ecosystem functioning and are viable, but not culturable. Enhancing knowledge of soil bacterial functioning and diversity will aid in the development of sustainable agroecosystems. (C)Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Fragmentation of forested landscapes can reduce the reproductive success of birds occupying residual forest patches. Previous studies,however, have focused primarily on how nest predation can change when landscapes become fragmented by agriculture rather than by logging. To determine if predation on artificial nests in forest patches was influenced by the surrounding landscape, we placed ground and shrub ness along the edge and interior of forest patches located in agricultural, logged,and contiguous forest landscapes within a single region of the southern boreal mixedwood forest of central Canada. Nest predators were identified using remotely triggered cameras and by marks left in plasticine eggs, whereas the relative abundance of nest predators such as corvids and small mammals was estimated by surveys and live-trapping. The percentage of ground nests destroyed at the edge and interior of patches in the logged and contiguous forest landscapes was significantly lower than the edge or interior of patches in the agricultural landscape. No differences in predation rate were observed for shrub nests among landscapes. We attributed higher rates of predation in the agricultural landscape to higher densities of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) in the interior and a greater diversity of predators along edges. The similarity in predation rate between logged and contiguous forest landscape suggest that fragmentation caused by logging may result in little change in predator communities and in this respect, might be similar to fragmentation caused by natural disturbance regimes such as fire. In contrast, fragmentation by agriculture seems to have more serious consequences for nesting birds. Policy changes that limit the growth of agriculture in the southern boreal mixedwood forest are required to conserve the diverse avifauna of this region.

AB Remarkable parallels link the development of varietal mixtures across subsistence farming systems. Mixtures are grown and persist because they prolong harvest and income flow and provide diversity of diet. From our review of research on agronomic and disease aspects of mixtures in modern agriculture, it is also clear that improved stability and decreased disease severity are common features of mixtures relative to their components in monoculture. Such advantages are of value to both modern and subsistence agriculture. However, in the majority of cases, the yield advantage of mixtures is small. Overall, we conclude that varietal mixtures are presently a viable strategy for sustainable productivity in subsistence agriculture, have potential for improvement without sacrifice of diversity, are an important resource for future global food production and may have an expanding role in modern agriculture in situations where qualitative uniformity is not the guiding priority.

AB Pesticides are contributing in current agriculture to fulfil the need of raising population. Uses of pesticides are not limited to agriculture, but they are also used to control over domestic pests, disease insect vectors and home gardening. But they are very toxic in nature and pose acute risks on the human health and the environment. They negatively affected the agricultural workers and trigger social conflicts when employed extensively and without safety measures. Further, they also have adverse effects on the neighboring communities. Chiefly, agriculture workers meet with both direct and indirect exposure with these chemicals. Common man comes in contact with these chemicals by skin contacting which is due to leaking and drifting of pesticides during mixing and causing serious threat to human health such as diabetes, reproductive disorders, neurological dysfunction, cancer and respiratory disorders. In this review, we discussed classification, mechanisms, benefits and adverse effects of the pesticides on both human beings and the environment. We had also discussed some remedial measures to mitigate their toxicity. In future, research is needed to develop innovative ideas in current farming which are able to decrease the application of chemical pesticides. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB <list list-type="1" id="fec12292-list-0001"> Insect pollination is a vital ecosystem service that maintains biodiversity and sustains agricultural crop yields. Social bees are essential insect pollinators, so it is concerning that their populations are in global decline. Although pesticide exposure has been implicated as a possible cause for bee declines, we currently have a limited understanding of the risk these chemicals pose. Whilst environmental exposure to pesticides typically has non-lethal effects on individual bees, recent reports suggest that sublethal exposure can affect important behavioural traits such as foraging. However, at present, we know comparatively little about how natural foraging behaviour is impaired and the relative impacts of acute and chronic effects. Using Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging technology, we examined how the day-to-day foraging patterns of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were affected when exposed to either a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and/or a pyrethroid (-cyhalothrin) independently and in combination over a four-week period. This is the first study to provide data on the impacts of combined and individual pesticide exposure on the temporal dynamics of foraging behaviour in the field over a prolonged period of time. Our results show that neonicotinoid exposure has both acute and chronic effects on overall foraging activity. Whilst foragers from control colonies improved their pollen foraging performance as they gained experience, the performance of bees exposed to imidacloprid became worse: chronic behavioural impairment. We also found evidence, suggesting that pesticide exposure can change forager preferences for the flower types from which they collect pollen. Our findings highlight the importance of considering prolonged exposure (which happens in the field) when assessing the risk that pesticides pose to bees. The effects of chronic pesticide exposure could have serious detrimental consequences for both colony survival and also the pollination services provided by these essential insect pollinators. <doi origin="wiley" registered="yes">10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2435</doi

AB Feedbacks between the terrestrial carbon cycle and climate change could affect many ecosystem functions and services, such as food production, carbon sequestration and climate regulation. The rate of climate warming varies on diurnal and seasonal timescales. A synthesis of global air temperature data reveals a greater rate of warming in winter than in summer in northern mid and high latitudes, and the inverse pattern in some tropical regions. The data also reveal a decline in the diurnal temperature range over 51% of the global land area and an increase over only 13%, because night-time temperatures in most locations have risen faster than daytime temperatures. Analyses of satellite data, model simulations and in situ observations suggest that the impact of seasonal warming varies between regions. For example, spring warming has largely stimulated ecosystem productivity at latitudes between 30 degrees and 90 degrees N, but suppressed productivity in other regions. Contrasting impacts of day- and night-time warming on plant carbon gain and loss are apparent in many regions. We argue that ascertaining the effects of non-uniform climate warming on terrestrial ecosystems is a key challenge in carbon cycle research.

AB Phylogeography, born to bridge population genetics and phylogenetics in an explicit geographic context, has provided a successful platform for unveiling species evolutionary histories. The Mediterranean Basin, one of the earth's 25 biodiversity hotspots, is known for its complex geological and palaeoclimatic history. Aiming to throw light on the causes and circumstances that underlie such a rich biota, a review of the phylogeographic literature on plant lineages from the Mediterranean Basin is presented focusing on two levels. First, phylogeographic patterns are examined, arranged by potential driving forces such as longitude, latitude - and its interaction with altitude -, straits or glacial refugia. Spatial coincidences in phylogeographic splits are found but, in comparison to other regions such as the Alps or North America, no largely common phylogeographic patterns across species are found in this region. Factors contributing to phylogeographic complexity and scarcity of common patterns include less drastic effects of Pleistocene glaciations than other temperate regions, environmental heterogeneity, the blurring of genetic footprints via admixing over time and, for older lineages, possibly a greater stochasticity due to the accumulation of responses to palaeoclimatic changes. At a second level, processes inferred in phylogeographically framed studies that are potential drivers of evolution are examined. These include gradual range expansion, vicariance, long-distance dispersal, radiations, hybridization and introgression, changes in reproductive system, and determinants of successful colonization. Future phylogeographic studies have a great potential to help explaining biodiversity patterns of plant groups and understanding why the Basin has come to be one of the biodiversity hotspots on earth. This potential is based on the crucial questions that can be addressed when geographic gaps are adequately filled (mainly northern Africa and the eastern part of the region), on the important contribution of younger lineages - for which phylogeographic approaches are most useful - to the whole diversity of the Basin, and on the integration of new methods, particularly those that allow refining the search for spatio-temporal concordance across genealogies.

AB The establishment of protected areas, such as Natura 2000, is a common approach to curbing biodiversity loss. But many of these areas are owned or managed by private actors. Policies indicate that their involvement should be encouraged to ensure long term success. However, to date there have been no systematic evaluations of whether local actor involvement in the management of protected areas does in fact contribute to the conservation of biodiversity, which is the expressed policy goal. Research incorporating both qualitative and quantitative data was carried out in three case studies in Scotland where local actor input was required in the development and/or implementation of Natura 2000 management plans. No relationship was found between the characteristics of the process of stakeholder involvement and stakeholders' perceptions of future biodiversity outcomes. Social outcomes of increased stakeholder involvement, such as increased trust, did however increase the perceived likelihood of positive future biodiversity outcomes. The findings indicate that efforts aimed at increasing stakeholder involvement in the management of protected areas need to consider making processes more independent, and acknowledge and address underlying biodiversity conflicts. The findings also emphasise the need to evaluate multi-level conservation efforts in terms of processes, social outcomes and biodiversity outcomes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Finite mesophyll diffusion conductance (gm) significantly constrains net assimilation rate (An), but gm variations and variation sources in response to environmental stresses during leaf development are imperfectly known. The combined effects of light and water limitations on gm and diffusion limitations of photosynthesis were studied in saplings of Populus tremula L. An one-dimensional diffusion model was used to gain insight into the importance of key anatomical traits in determining gm. Leaf development was associated with increases in dry mass per unit area, thickness, density, exposed mesophyll (Smes/S) and chloroplast (Sc/S) to leaf area ratio, internal air space (fias), cell wall thickness and chloroplast dimensions. Development of Smes/S and Sc/S was delayed under low light. Reduction in light availability was associated with lower Sc/S, but with larger fias and chloroplast thickness. Water stress reduced Sc/S and increased cell wall thickness under high light. In all treatments, gm and An increased and CO2 drawdown because of gm, CiCc, decreased with increasing leaf age. Low light and drought resulted in reduced gm and An and increased CiCc. These results emphasize the importance of gm and its components in determining An variations during leaf development and in response to stress.

AB Species distribution models are used for a range of ecological and evolutionary questions, but often are constructed from few and/or biased species occurrence records. Recent work has shown that the presence-only model Maxent performs well with small sample sizes. While the apparent accuracy of such models with small samples has been studied, less emphasis has been placed on the effect of small or biased species records on the secondary modeling steps, specifically accuracy assessment and threshold selection, particularly with profile (presence-only) modeling techniques. When testing the effects of small sample sizes on distribution models, accuracy assessment has generally been conducted with complete species occurrence data, rather than similarly limited (e.g. few or biased) test data. Likewise, selection of a probability threshold a selection of probability that classifies a model into discrete areas of presences and absences has also generally been conducted with complete data. In this study we subsampled distribution data for an endangered rodent across multiple years to assess the effects of different sample sizes and types of bias on threshold selection, and examine the differences between apparent and actual accuracy of the models. Although some previously recommended threshold selection techniques showed little difference in threshold selection, the most commonly used methods performed poorly. Apparent model accuracy calculated from limited data was much higher than true model accuracy, but the true model accuracy was lower than it could have been with a more optimal threshold. That is, models with thresholds and accuracy calculated from biased and limited data had inflated reported accuracy, but were less accurate than they could have been if better data on species distribution were available and an optimal threshold were used.

AB 1. Atmospheric conditions strongly influence ecological systems, and tools that simplify the access and processing of atmospheric data can greatly facilitate ecological research.
   2. We have developed RNCEP, a package of functions in the open-source R language, to access, organise and visualise freely available atmospheric data from two long- term high- quality data sets with global coverage.
   3. These functions retrieve data, via the Internet, for either a desired spatiotemporal extent or interpolated to a point in space and time. The package also contains functions to temporally aggregate data, producing user- defined variables, and to visualise these data on a map.
   4. By making access to atmospheric data and integration with biological data easier and more flexible, we hope to facilitate and encourage the exploration of relationships between biological systems and atmospheric conditions.

AB Herein we review theoretical and methodological considerations important for finding and delimiting cryptic species of parasites (species that are difficult to recognize using traditional systematic methods). Applications of molecular data in empirical investigations of cryptic species are discussed from an historical perspective, and we evaluate advantages and disadvantages of approaches that have been used to date. Developments concerning the theory and practice of species delimitation are emphasized because theory is critical to interpretation of data. The advantages and disadvantages of different molecular methodologies, including the number and kind of loci, are discussed relative to tree-based approaches for detecting and delimiting cryptic species. We conclude by discussing some implications that cryptic species have for research programmes in parasitology, emphasizing that careful attention to the theory and operational practices involved in finding, delimiting, and describing new species (including cryptic species) is essential, not only for fully characterizing parasite biodiversity and broader aspects of comparative biology such as systematics, evolution, ecology and biogeography, but to applied research efforts that strive to improve development and understanding of epidemiology, diagnostics, control and potential eradication of parasitic diseases.

AB Aim
   The controls of gross radiation use efficiency (RUE), the ratio between gross primary productivity (GPP) and the radiation intercepted by terrestrial vegetation, and its spatial and temporal variation are not yet fully understood. Our objectives were to analyse and synthesize the spatial variability of GPP and the spatial and temporal variability of RUE and its climatic controls for a wide range of vegetation types.
   Location
   A global range of sites from tundra to rain forest.
   Methods
   We analysed a global dataset on photosynthetic uptake and climatic variables from 35 eddy covariance (EC) flux sites spanning between 100 and 2200 mm mean annual rainfall and between -13 and 26 degrees C mean annual temperature. RUE was calculated from the data provided by EC flux sites and remote sensing (MODIS).
   Results
   Rainfall and actual evapotranspiration (AET) positively influenced the spatial variation of annual GPP, whereas temperature only influenced the GPP of forests. Annual and maximum RUE were also positively controlled primarily by annual rainfall. The main control parameters of the growth season variation of gross RUE varied for each ecosystem type. Overall, the ratio between actual and potential evapotranspiration and a surrogate for the energy balance explained a greater proportion of the seasonal variation of RUE than the vapour pressure deficit (VPD), AET and precipitation. Temperature was important for determining the intra-annual variability of the RUE at the coldest energy-limited sites.
   Main conclusions
   Our analysis supports the idea that the annual functioning of vegetation that is adapted to its local environment is more constrained by water availability than by temperature. The spatial variability of annual and maximum RUE can be largely explained by annual precipitation, more than by vegetation type. The intra-annual variation of RUE was mainly linked to the energy balance and water availability along the climatic gradient. Furthermore, we showed that intra-annual variation of gross RUE is only weakly influenced by VPD and temperature, contrary to what is frequently assumed. Our results provide a better understanding of the spatial and temporal controls of the RUE and thus could lead to a better estimation of ecosystem carbon fixation and better modelling.

AB Diatoms are key players in the global carbon cycle and most aquatic ecosystems. Their cell sizes impact carbon sequestration and energy transfer to higher trophic levels. We report fundamental differences in size distributions of marine and freshwater diatoms, with marine diatoms significantly larger than freshwater species. An evolutionary game theoretical model with empirical allometries of growth and nutrient uptake shows that these differences can be explained by nitrogen versus phosphorus limitation, nutrient fluctuations and mixed layer depth differences. Constant and pulsed phosphorus supply select for small sizes, as does constant nitrogen supply. In contrast, intermediate frequency nitrogen pulses common in the ocean select for large sizes or the evolutionarily stable coexistence of large and small sizes. Size-dependent sinking interacts with mixed layer depth (MLD) to further modulate optimal sizes, with smaller sizes selected for by strong sinking and shallow MLD. In freshwaters, widespread phosphorus limitation, together with strong sinking and shallow MLD produce size distributions with smaller range, means and upper values, compared with the ocean. Shifting patterns of nutrient limitation and mixing may alter diatom size distributions, affecting global carbon cycle and the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems.

AB There have been numerous claims in the ecological literature that spatial autocorrelation in the residuals of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models results in shifts in the partial coefficients, which bias the interpretation of factors influencing geographical patterns. We evaluate the validity of these claims using gridded species richness data for the birds of North America, South America, Europe, Africa, the ex-USSR, and Australia. We used richness in 110x110 km cells and environmental predictor variables to generate OLS and simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) multiple regression models for each region. Spatial correlograms of the residuals from each OLS model were then used to identify the minimum distance between cells necessary to avoid short-distance residual spatial autocorrelation in each data set. This distance was used to subsample cells to generate spatially independent data. The partial OLS coefficients estimated with the full dataset were then compared to the distributions of coefficients created with the subsamples. We found that OLS coefficients generated from data containing residual spatial autocorrelation were statistically indistinguishable from coefficients generated from the same data sets in which short-distance spatial autocorrelation was not present in all 22 coefficients tested. Consistent with the statistical literature on this subject, we conclude that coefficients estimated from OLS regression are not seriously affected by the presence of spatial autocorrelation in gridded geographical data. Further, shifts in coefficients that occurred when using SAR tended to be correlated with levels of uncertainty in the OLS coefficients. Thus, shifts in the relative importance of the predictors between OLS and SAR models are expected when small-scale patterns for these predictors create weaker and more unstable broad-scale coefficients. Our results indicate both that OLS regression is unbiased and that differences between spatial and nonspatial regression models should be interpreted with an explicit awareness of spatial scale.

AB Aim This paper reviews the main geographical determinants of naturalization in plants.
   Location Global.
   Methods Comparative studies of large data sets of alien floras are the main source of information on global patterns of naturalization.
   Results Temperate mainland regions are more invaded than tropical mainland regions but there seems to be no difference in invasibility of temperate and tropical islands. Islands are more invaded than the mainland. The number of naturalized species in temperate regions decreases with latitude and their geographical ranges increase with latitude. The number of naturalized species on islands increases with temperature. Naturalized species contribute to floristic homogenization, but the phenomenon is scale-dependent.
   Main conclusion Some robust patterns are evident from currently available data, but further research is needed on several aspects to advance our understanding of the biogeography of naturalization of alien plants. For example, measures of propagule pressure are needed to determine the invasibility of communities/ecosystems/regions. The patterns discussed in this paper are derived largely from numbers and proportions of naturalized species, and little is known about the proportion of introduced species that become naturalized. Further insights on naturalization rates, i.e. the proportion of aliens that successfully naturalize within regions, and on geographical and other determinants of its variation would provide us with better understanding of the invasion process. Comparative studies, and resulting generalizations, are almost exclusively based on numbers of species, but alien species differ in their impact on native biodiversity and ecosystem processes.

AB In response to the profound threat of exotic species to natural systems, much attention has been focused on the biotic resistance hypothesis, which predicts that diverse, communities should better resist invasions. While studies of natural communities generally refute this hypothesis, reporting positive relationships between native species diversity and invasibility, some local-scale studies have instead obtained negative relationships. Most treatments of the topic have failed to recognize that all exotic invaders do not behave alike: while "weak" invaders become minor components of communities, "strong" invaders become community dominants at the expense of native species. At the same time, the specific impacts of strong invaders on communities are poorly documented yet critical to understanding implications of diversity loss. With these shortfalls in mind, we examined local-scale relationships between native and exotic plant taxa in buncligrass communities of western Montana, USA. We found that measures of native species diversity and invasibility were positively correlated in communities with low levels of invasion where both weak and strong invaders occurred at low densities, but negatively correlated in communities with high levels of invasion where the strong invader Centaurea maculosa dominated. Furthermore, at both low and high levels of invasion, weak invaders tended to vary positively with native species richness while strong invaders varied negatively. Weak invaders determined positive overall relationships between native and exotic species in low invasion communities and appeared to coexist with native taxa. Strong invaders prevailed in high invasion communities, driving negative overall relationships therein. That negative relationships primarily reflected strong invader impacts was supported by the fact that negative correlations of C. maculosa with native species diversity and abundance held when we statistically controlled for levels of native species representing preinvasion conditions. In addition, negative associations of C. maculosa with native taxa varied in strength by functional group and species, with large effects on numerically dominant species, suggesting a dramatic shift in community composition and structure. The distinction between weak and strong invaders is important for reconciling conflicting results from previous studies of natural communities, and moving attention beyond the current debate surrounding the biotic resistance hypothesis.

AB During the flood season of 1992-1993, 139 species of fishes were collected from a floodplain Like system in the central Amazon Basin. Fish species distribution was examined relative to abiotic variables in seven vegetation strata on Marchantaria Island, Solimoes River. Both environmental variables and species distributions were influenced by a river channel to floodplain-interior gradient. Species diversity was significantly higher ill vegetated areas than in unvegetated areas, with deeper water Paspalum repens stands harbouring the highest diversity. As a result, species richness and catches were positively related to habitat complexity, while catch was also negatively related to dissolved oxygen (DO) and water depth. Low DO and shallow waters appeared to act as a refuge from predation. Fish assemblages were related to water chemistry, but species richness was not. Canonical correspondence analysis provided evidence that floodplain fish assemblages formed by the 76 most common species were influenced by physical variables, macrophyte coverage and habitat complexity, which jointly accounted for 67% of the variance of fish species assemblages. Omnivores showed no pattern relative to the river channel to floodplain-interior gradient while detritivores were more likely to be found at interior floodplain sites and piscivores closer to the river. Piscivores could he further separated into three groups, one with seven species associated with tree-floating macrophytes in deep water, a second with five species found in shallow waters with rooted grasses and a third with six open water orientated species. The results suggest that fish assemblages in the Amazon floodplain are not random associations of species. (C) 2003 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

AB Maternal and paternal effects can lead to complicated evolutionary dynamics, including evolution in the opposite direction to selection. Recent studies demonstrate that parental effects on sexually selected traits, as well as preferences for those traits, might be large. Although these findings are likely to have consequences for both the evolutionary dynamics and equilibria of sexual selection, theory is lacking. Because parents are expected to maximize their own fitness, rather than that of a specific offspring, the magnitude (and even direction) of parental effects are context dependent. By extension, this dynamic nature of parental effects might help to explain the maintenance of variation in many sexually selected traits.

AB Understanding vegetation responses to climate change on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) helps in elucidating the land-atmosphere energy exchange, which affects air mass movement over and around the TP. Although the TP is one of the world's most sensitive regions in terms of climatic warming, little is known about how the vegetation responds. Here, we focus on how spring phenology and summertime greenness respond to the asymmetric warming, that is, stronger warming during nighttime than during daytime. Using both insitu and satellite observations, we found that vegetation green-up date showed a stronger negative partial correlation with daily minimum temperature (T-min) than with maximum temperature (T-max) before the growing season (preseason' henceforth). Summer vegetation greenness was strongly positively correlated with summer T-min, but negatively with T-max. A 1-K increase in preseason T-min advanced green-up date by 4days (P<0.05) and in summer enhanced greenness by 3.6% relative to the mean greenness during 2000-2004 (P<0.01). In contrast, increases in preseason T-max did not advance green-up date (P>0.10) and higher summer T-max even reduced greenness by 2.6%K-1 (P<0.05). The stimulating effects of increasing T-min were likely caused by reduced low temperature constraints, and the apparent negative effects of higher T-max on greenness were probably due to the accompanying decline in water availability. The dominant enhancing effect of nighttime warming indicates that climatic warming will probably have stronger impact on TP ecosystems than on apparently similar Arctic ecosystems where vegetation is controlled mainly by T-max. Our results are crucial for future improvements of dynamic vegetation models embedded in the Earth System Models which are being used to describe the behavior of the Asian monsoon. The results are significant because the state of the vegetation on the TP plays an important role in steering the monsoon.

AB Citizen science has a long history in the ecological sciences and has made substantial contributions to science, education, and society. Developments in information technology during the last few decades have created new opportunities for citizen science to engage ever larger audiences of volunteers to help address some of ecology's most pressing issues, such as global environmental change. Using online tools, volunteers can find projects that match their interests and learn the skills and protocols required to develop questions, collect data, submit data, and help process and analyze data online. Citizen science has become increasingly important for its ability to engage large numbers of volunteers to generate observations at scales or resolutions unattainable by individual researchers. As a coupled natural and human approach, citizen science can also help researchers access local knowledge and implement conservation projects that might be impossible otherwise. In Japan, however, the value of citizen science to science and society is still underappreciated. Here we present case studies of citizen science in Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and describe how citizen science is used to tackle key questions in ecology and conservation, including spatial and macro-ecology, management of threatened and invasive species, and monitoring of biodiversity. We also discuss the importance of data quality, volunteer recruitment, program evaluation, and the integration of science and human systems in citizen science projects. Finally, we outline some of the primary challenges facing citizen science and its future.

AB In vertebrates and invertebrates, morphological and functional features of gastrointestinal (GI) tracts generally reflect food chemistry, such as content of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and material(s) refractory to rapid digestion (e. g., cellulose). The expression of digestive enzymes and nutrient transporters approximately matches the dietary load of their respective substrates, with relatively modest excess capacity. Mechanisms explaining differences in hydrolase activity between populations and species include gene copy number variations and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Transcriptional and posttranscriptional adjustments mediate phenotypic changes in the expression of hydrolases and transporters in response to dietary signals. Many species respond to higher food intake by flexibly increasing digestive compartment size. Fermentative processes by symbiotic microorganisms are important for cellulose degradation but are relatively slow, so animals that rely on those processes typically possess special enlarged compartment(s) to maintain a microbiota and other GI structures that slow digesta flow. The taxon richness of the gut microbiota, usually identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, is typically an order of magnitude greater in vertebrates than invertebrates, and the interspecific variation in microbial composition is strongly influenced by diet. Many of the nutrient transporters are orthologous across different animal phyla, though functional details may vary (e.g., glucose and amino acid transport with K+ rather than Na+ as a counter ion). Paracellular absorption is important in many birds. Natural toxins are ubiquitous in foods and may influence key features such as digesta transit, enzymatic breakdown, microbial fermentation, and absorption. (C) 2013 American Physiological Society.

AB Ecosystem health is a desired endpoint of environmental management and should be a primary design goal for ecological engineering. This paper describes ecosystem health as a comprehensive, multiscale, measure of system vigor, organization and resilience. Ecosystem health is thus closely linked to the idea of sustainability, which implies the ability of the system to maintain its structure (organization) and function (vigor) over time in the face of external stress (resilience). To be truly successful, ecological engineering should pursue the broader goal of designing healthy ecosystems, which may be novel assemblages of species that perform desired functions and produce a range of valuable ecosystem services. In this way ecological engineering can achieve its goals, embedded in its definition as the "design of sustainable ecosystems that integrate human society with its natural environment for the benefit of both." It allows the benefits of ecological engineering practices 'to both humans and the rest of nature' to be assessed in an integrated and consistent way that will allow us to build a sustainable and desirable future.

AB Many species have already shifted their distributions in response to recent climate change. Here, we aimed at predicting the future breeding distributions of European birds under climate, land-use, and dispersal scenarios. We predicted current and future distributions of 409 species within an ensemble forecast framework using seven species distribution models (SDMs), five climate scenarios and three emission and land-use scenarios. We then compared results from SDMs using climate-only variables, habitat-only variables or both climate and habitat variables. In order to account for a species dispersal abilities, we used natal dispersal estimates and developed a probabilistic method that produced a dispersal scenario intermediate between the null and full dispersal scenarios generally considered in such studies. We then compared results from all scenarios in terms of future predicted range changes, range shifts, and variations in species richness. Modeling accuracy was better with climate-only variables than with habitat-only variables, and better with both climate and habitat variables. Habitat models predicted smaller range shifts and smaller variations in range size and species richness than climate models. Using both climate and habitat variables, it was predicted that the range of 71% of the species would decrease by 2050, with a 335km median shift. Predicted variations in species richness showed large decreases in the southern regions of Europe, as well as increases, mainly in Scandinavia and northern Russia. The partial dispersal scenario was significantly different from the full dispersal scenario for 25% of the species, resulting in the local reduction of the future predicted species richness of up to 10%. We concluded that the breeding range of most European birds will decrease in spite of dispersal abilities close to a full dispersal hypothesis, and that given the contrasted predictions obtained when modeling climate change only and land-use change only, both scenarios must be taken into consideration.

AB Model transferability (extrapolative accuracy) is one important feature in species distribution models, required in several ecological and conservation biological applications. This study uses 10 modelling techniques and nationwide data on both (1) species distribution of birds, butterflies, and plants and (2) climate and land cover in Finland to investigate whether good interpolative prediction accuracy for models comes at the expense of transferability i.e. markedly worse performance in new areas. Models interpolation and extrapolation performance was primarily assessed using AUC (the area under the curve of a receiver characteristic plot) and Kappa statistics, with supplementary comparisons examining model sensitivity and specificity values. Our AUC and Kappa results show that extrapolation to new areas is a greater challenge for all included modelling techniques than simple filling of gaps in a well-sampled area, but there are also differences among the techniques in the degree of transferability. Among the machine-learning modelling techniques, MAXENT, generalized boosting methods (GBM), and artificial neural networks (ANN) showed good transferability while the performance of GARP and random forest (RF) decreased notably in extrapolation. Among the regression-based methods, generalized additive models (GAM) and generalized linear models (GLM) showed good transferability. A desirable combination of good prediction accuracy and good transferability was evident for three modelling techniques: MAXENT, GBM, and GAM. However, examination of model sensitivity and specificity revealed that model types may differ in their tendencies to either increased over-prediction of presences or absences in extrapolation, and some of the methods show contrasting changes in sensitivity vs specificity (e.g. ANN and GARP). Among the three species groups, the best transferability was seen with birds, followed closely by butterflies, whereas reliable extrapolation for plant species distribution models appears to be a major challenge at least at this scale. Overall, detailed knowledge of the behaviour of different techniques in various study settings and with different species groups is of utmost importance in predictive modelling.

AB Species' potential distribution modelling is the process of building a representation of the fundamental ecological requirements for a species and extrapolating these requirements into a geographical region. The importance of being able to predict the distribution of species is currently highlighted by issues like global climate change, public health problems caused by disease vectors, anthropogenic impacts that can lead to massive species extinction, among other challenges. There are several computational approaches that can be used to generate potential distribution models, each achieving optimal results under different conditions. However, the existing software packages available for this purpose typically implement a single algorithm, and each software package presents a new learning curve to the user. Whenever new software is developed for species' potential distribution modelling, significant duplication of effort results because many feature requirements are shared between the different packages. Additionally, data preparation and comparison between algorithms becomes difficult when using separate software applications, since each application has different data input and output capabilities. This paper describes a generic approach for building a single computing framework capable of handling different data formats and multiple algorithms that can be used in potential distribution modelling. The ideas described in this paper have been implemented in a free and open source software package called openModeller. The main concepts of species' potential distribution modelling are also explained and an example use case illustrates potential distribution maps generated by the framework.

AB Natural hybridization between closely related taxa is a common phenomenon in both plants and animals. Hybridization has often been viewed as a destructive force that could erode established gene pools, but it is increasingly being recognized as a potentially creative force in evolution because it can lead to a mixture of novel genotypes, some of which have the potential for rapid adaptation to new environmental conditions. However, the evolutionary dynamics leading to the emergence of newly adapted gene pools after hybridization are largely unexplored. Here, we argue that the identification and analysis of the dynamic processes that occur after the first contact deserve specific attention, because this is the phase where hybrid speciation is most different from other forms of speciation.

AB The science behind ecology has been contested for years, partially because of the misuse and misrepresentation of concepts within ecology. This paper discusses the use of Bergmann's rule, a fundamental rule of biogeography. The rule was proposed by Carl Bergmann in 1847 and was published only in German; therefore, the majority of researchers have relied on a single translation by Mayr suggesting that races from cooler climates tend to be larger in species of warm-blooded vertebrates than races of the same species living in warmer climates. That many scientists cannot go back to the original source of information because it has not been published in English has resulted in relying on others for interpretation and led to several problems, the largest of which is whether the definition of the rule should include the mechanism, which had been proposed by Bergmann. There has been a large field of research on the subject, but few tests of the mechanisms behind the observed phenomenon. We conducted a review of the literature on Bergmann's rule, and from this suggest (1) Bergmann's original rule be maintained (a direct translation is provided), (2) mechanism is inherent in Bergmann's rule and is required for a rule to be of scientific value; patterns should be labelled as trends, not rules, (3) the focus should be on falsifying hypothesized mechanisms rather than simply describing patterns, and (4) to truly evaluate Bergmann's rule in a scientific manner the original German source should be translated and made available to the scientific public.

AB Elevational tree line change in the southern Swedish Scandes was quantified for the period 1915-2007 and for two sub-periods 1915-1975 and 1975-2007. The study focused on Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii, Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris at a large number of sites distributed over an 8000-km(2) area. The basic approach included revisitations of fixed sites (elevational belt transects) and measurements of tree line positions (m a.s.l.) during these three periods.
   Over the past century, tree lines of all species rose at 95% of the studied localities, with means of 70-90 m. All three species displayed maximum upshifts by about 200 m, which manifests a near-perfect equilibrium with instrumentally recorded air temperature change. This magnitude of response was realized only in particular topographic situations, foremost wind-sheltered and steep concave slopes. Other sites, with more wind-exposed topoclimatic conditions, experienced lesser magnitudes of upshifts. Thus, spatial elevational tree line responses to climate change are markedly heterogeneous and site-dependent. Modelling of the future evolution of the forest-alpine tundra transition has to consider this fact. Even in a hypothetical case of substantial climate warming, tree lines are unlikely to advance on a broad front and a large proportion of the alpine tundra will remain treeless.
   During the period 1975-2007, the tree lines of Picea and Pinus (in particular) advanced more rapidly than that of Betula towards the alpine region. These species-specific responses could signal a potential trajectory for the evolution of the ecotone in a warmer future. Thereby a situation with some resemblance with the relatively warm and dry early Holocene would emerge.
   Substantial tree line upshifts over the past two to three decades coincide with air and soil warming during all seasons. This implies that both summer and winter temperatures have to be included in models of climate-driven tree line performance.
   Synthesis. Maximum tree line rise by 200 m represents a unique trend break in the long-term Holocene tree line regression, which has been driven by average climate cooling for nearly 10 000 years. Tree line positions are well-restored to their pre-Little Ice Age positions. Recent tree line ascent is a truly anomalous event in Holocene vegetation history and possibly unprecedented for seven millennia.

AB Ambient noise influences the availability and use of acoustic information in animals in many ways. While much research has focused on the effects of noise on acoustic communication, here, we present the first study concerned with anthropogenic noise and foraging behaviour. We chose the greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis) as a model species because it represents the especially vulnerable group of gleaning bats that rely on listening for prey rustling sounds to find food (i. e.. 'passive listening'). In a choice experiment with two foraging compartments, we investigated the influence of background noise on foraging effort and foraging success. We tested the hypotheses that: (1) bats will avoid foraging areas with particularly loud background noise; and (2) the frequency -time structure of the noise will determine, in part, the degree to which it deters bats. We found a clear effect of the type of noise on the allocation of foraging effort to the compartments and on the distribution of prey capture events. When playing back silence, the bats made equal use of and were equally successful in both compartments. In the other three treatments (where a non-silent sound was played back), the bats avoided the playback compartment. The degree to which the background noise deterred bats from the compartment increased from traffic noise to vegetation movement noise to broadband computer-generated noise. Vegetation noise, set 12 dB below the traffic noise amplitude, had a larger repellent effect; presumably because of its acoustic similarity with prey sounds. Our experimental data suggest that foraging areas very close to highways and presumably also to other sources of intense, broadband noise are degraded in their suitability as foraging areas for such. passive listening' bats.

AB 1. Climate change has already caused distribution shifts in many species, and climate predictions strongly suggest that these will accelerate in the future. Obtaining reliable predictions of species range shifts under climate change is thus currently one of the most crucial challenges for both ecologists and stakeholders.
   2. Here we simulate the distributions of 16 North American tree species at a continental scale for the 21st century according to two IPCC storylines, using a process-based species distribution model that for the first time allows identification of the possible causes of distribution change.
   3. Our projections show local extinctions in the south of species ranges (21% of the present distribution, on average), and colonizations of new habitats in the north, though these are limited by dispersal ability for most species. Areas undergoing local extinctions are slightly larger under climate scenario A2 (+3.2 degrees C, +22% on average) than B2 (+1.0 degrees C, +19% on average). This small difference is caused by nonlinear responses of processes (leaves and flowers phenological processes in particular) to temperature. We also show that local extinction may proceed at a slower rate than forecasted so far.
   4. Although predicted distribution shifts are very species-specific, we show that the loss of habitats southward will be mostly due to increased drought mortality and decreased reproductive success, while northward colonizations will be primarily promoted by increased probability of fruit ripening and flower frost survival.
   5. Synthesis. Our results show that different species will not face the same risks due to climate change, because their responses to climate differ as well as their dispersal rate. Focusing on processes, our study therefore tempers the alarming conclusions of widely used niche-based models about biodiversity loss, mainly because our predictions take into account the local adaptation and trait plasticity to climate of the species.

AB Well-founded methods to assess habitat connectivity are essential to inform land management decisions that include conservation and restoration goals. Indeed, to be able to develop a conservation plan that maintains animal movement through a fragmented landscape, spatial locations of habitat and paths among them need to be represented. Graph-based approaches have been proposed to determine paths among habitats at various scales and dispersal movement distances, and balance data requirements with information content. Conventional graphs, however, do not explicitly maintain geographic reference, reducing communication capacity and utility of other geo-spatial information. We present spatial graphs as a unifying theory for applying graph-based methods in a geographic context. Spatial graphs integrate a geometric reference system that ties patches and paths to specific spatial locations and spatial dimensions. Arguably, the complete graph, with paths between every pair of patches, may be one of the most relevant graphs from an ecosystem perspective, but it poses challenges to compute, process and visualize. We developed Minimum Planar Graphs as a spatial generalization of Delaunay triangulations to provide a reasonable approximation of complete graphs that facilitates visualization and comprehension of the network of connections across landscapes. If, as some authors have suggested, the minimum spanning tree identifies the connectivity "backbone" of a landscape, then the Minimum Planar Graph identifies the connectivity "network". We applied spatial graphs, and in particular the Minimum Planar Graph, to analyze woodland caribou habitat in Manitoba, Canada to support the establishment of a national park.

AB It is increasingly acknowledged that migratory birds, notably waterfowl, play a critical role in the maintenance and spread of influenza A viruses. In order to elucidate the epidemiology of influenza A viruses in their natural hosts, a better understanding of the pathological effects in these hosts is required. Here we report on the feeding and migratory performance of wild migratory Bewick's swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii Yarrell) naturally infected with low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A viruses of subtypes H6N2 and H6N8. Using information on geolocation data collected from Global Positioning Systems fitted to neck-collars, we show that infected swans experienced delayed migration, leaving their wintering site more than a month after uninfected animals. This was correlated with infected birds travelling shorter distances and fuelling and feeding at reduced rates. The data suggest that LPAI virus infections in wild migratory birds may have higher clinical and ecological impacts than previously recognised.

AB Changes in the species composition and structure of Mediterranean macroalgal-dominated communities from the upper sublittoral zone are described along a gradient of nutrient enrichment coming from a urban sewage outfall. Ulva-dominated communities only appear close to the sewage outfall. Corallina-dominated communities replace ulvacean algae at intermediate levels of nutrient enrichment. Cystoseira-dominated communities thrive in the reference site but already appear at nutrient levels that are threefold higher than those reported from unpolluted sites. Assemblage variability of Cystoseira-dominated communities decreases along the gradient of nutrient enrichment. Methods based on the functional-form groups of macroalgae to assess the water quality provide equivocal results at intermediate levels of nutrient enrichment because species belonging to the same group can display a completely different response to pollution. Alternatively, methods based on indicator species showed correlated evidence among species abundances and pollution levels and seem to have better performances in water quality assessment.

AB The neutral model posits that random variation in extinction and speciation events, coupled with limited dispersal, can account for many community properties, including the relative abundance distribution. There are important analogies between this model in ecology and a three-tiered hierarchy of models in evolution (Hardy Weinburg, drift, drift and selection). Because it invokes random processes and is used in statistical tests of empirical data, the neutral model can be interpreted as a specialized form of a null model. However, the application and interpretation of neutral models differs from that of standard null models in three important ways: 1) whereas most null models incorporate species-level constraints that are often associated with niche differences, the neutral model assumes that all species are functionally equivalent. 2) Null models are usually fit with constraints that are measured directly from the data set itself. In contrast, the neutral model requires parameters for speciation, extinction, and migration rates that are almost never measured directly, so their values must be guessed at or fitted. 3) Most important, null models are viewed as simple statistical descriptors: unspecified "random" forces generate variation in a simple model that excludes particular biological mechanisms (usually species interactions). Although the neutral model was originally framed as a null model, recent proponents of the neutral model have begun to treat it as a literal process-based description of community assembly.
   These differences lie at the heart of much of the recent controversy over the neutral model. If the neutral model is truly a process-based model, then its assumptions should be directly tested, and its predictions should be compared to those of an appropriate null model. Such tests are rarely informative, and most empirical data sets can be fit more parsimoniously to a simple log-normal distribution. Because unknown parameters in the neutral model must usually be guessed at or fit in ad-hoc ways, classical frequentist tests are compromised, and may be biased towards finding a good fit with the model. There has been little analysis of the potential for type I and type II errors in statistical tests of the neutral model.
   The neutral model has recently been proposed as a specific form of more general null models in biogeography (the mid-domain effect) and community ecology (species co-occurrence). In both cases, the neutral model is qualitatively, but not quantitatively, similar to the predictions of classic null models. However, because the important parameters in the neutral model can rarely be measured directly, it may be of limited value as a null hypothesis for empirical tests.
   Future progress may come from moving beyond dichotomous tests of neutral versus null models. Instead, the neutral model might be viewed as a mechanism that contributes to pattern along with other processes. Alternatively, the fit of data to the neutral model can be compared to the fit to other process-based models that are not based on neutrality assumptions. Finally, the neutral model can also be tested directly if its parameters can be estimated independently of the test data. However, these approaches may require more data than are often available. For these reasons, simple null model tests will continue to be important in the evaluation of the neutral model.

AB A dominant hypothesis explaining tree species coexistence in tropical forest is that trade-offs in characters allow species to adapt to different light environments, but tests for this hypothesis are scarce. This study is the first that uses a theoretical plant growth model to link leaf trade-offs to whole-plant performances and to differential performances across species in different light environments. Using data of 50 sympatric tree species from a Bolivian rain forest, we observed that specific leaf area and photosynthetic capacity codetermined interspecific height growth variation in a forest gap; that leaf survival rate determined the variation in plant survival rate under a closed canopy; that predicted height growth and plant survival rate matched field observations; and that fast-growing species had low survival rates for both field and predicted values. These results show how leaf trade-offs influence differential tree performance and tree species' coexistence in a heterogeneous light environment.

AB The importance of hybridization in the evolution of plant species is widely accepted, but its contributions to animal species evolution remain less recognized. Here we review evidence that hybridization has contributed to the evolution of reef corals, a group underpinning the coral reef ecosystem. Increasingly threatened by human and climate-related impacts, there is need to understand the evolutionary processes that have given rise to their diversity and contribute to their resilience. Reticulate evolutionary pathways among the ecologically prominent, mass-spawning genus Acropora suggest that hybridization, although rare on ecological timescales, has been instrumental in their diversification on evolutionary timescales. Evidence that coral hybrids colonize marginal habitats distinct from those of parental species' and that hybridization may be more frequent at peripheral boundaries of species' ranges supports a role for hybridization in range expansion and adaptation to changing environments. We conclude that outcomes of hybridization are significant for the future resilience of reef corals and warrant inclusion in conservation strategies.

AB Question: What are the main broad-scale spatial and temporal gradients in species composition of arable weed communities and what are their underlying environmental variables?
   Location: Czech Republic and Slovakia.
   Methods: A selection of 2653 geographically stratified releves sampled between 1954-2003 was analysed with direct and indirect ordination, regression analysis and analysis of beta diversity.
   Results: Major changes in weed species composition were associated with a complex gradient of increasing altitude and precipitation and decreasing temperature and base status of the soils. The proportion of hemicryptophytes increased, therophytes and alien species decreased, species richness increased and beta diversity decreased with increasing altitude. The second most important gradient of weed species composition was associated with seasonal changes, resulting in striking differences between weed communities developed in spring and summer. In summer, weed communities tended to have more neophytes, higher species richness and higher beta diversity. The third gradient reflected long-term changes in weed vegetation over past decades. The proportion of hemicryptophytes and neophytes increased, while therophytes and archaeophytes decreased, as did species richness over time. The fourth gradient was due to crop plants. Cultures whose management involves less disturbances, such as cereals, harboured less geophytes and neophytes, and had higher species richness but lower beta diversity than frequently disturbed cultures, such as root crops.
   Conclusions: Species composition of Central European weed vegetation is mainly influenced by broad-scale climatic and edaphic factors, but its variations due to seasonal dynamics and long-term changes in agricultural management are also striking. Crop plants and crop-specific management affect it to a lesser, but still significant extent.

AB Mycorrhizae regulate elemental and energy flows in terrestrial ecosystems. We understand much of how mycorrhizae work, but integrating all possible mechanisms into a whole has proven elusive. Multiple evolutionary events and the long evolutionary history mean that different plants and fungi bring independent characteristics to the symbiosis. This variety results in extensive physiological variation. How do we integrate functional responses with diversity to understand the role of mycorrhizae in ecosystems? We review ecophysiological mechanisms of mycorrhizae and organize these into functional groups. Species-area relationships are not curvilinear, but resemble the "broken stick" model. We coupled functional groups with a meta-community analysis to show how complex behavior can be generated using a simple matrix model of resource exchange. This approach provides insights into how we might integrate diversity and function across landscapes.

AB Sperm competition is widely recognized as a potent force in evolution, influencing male behavior, morphology, and physiology. Recent game theory analyses have examined how sperm competition can influence the evolution of ejaculate expenditure by males and the morphology of sperm contained within ejaculates. Theoretical analyses rest on the assumption that there is sufficient genetic variance in traits important in sperm competition to allow evolving populations to move to the evolutionarily stable equilibrium. Moreover, patterns of genotypic variation can provide valuable insight into the nature of selection currently acting on traits. However, our knowledge of genetic variance underlying traits important in sperm competition is limited. Here we examine patterns of phenotypic and genotypic variation in four sperm competition traits in the dung beetle Onthophagus taurus. Testis weight, ejaculate volume, and copula duration were found to have high coefficients of additive genetic variation (CV(A)s), which is characteristic of fitness traits and traits subject to sexual selection. Heritabilities were high, and there was some evidence for Y-linked inheritance in testis weight. In contrast, sperm length had a low CVA, which is characteristic of traits subject to stabilizing selection. Nevertheless, there was little residual variance so that the heritability of sperm length exceeded 1.0. Such a pattern is consistent with Y-linked inheritance in sperm length, Interestingly, we found that testis weight and sperm length were genetically correlated with heritable male condition. This finding holds important implications for potential indirect benefits associated with the evolution of polyandry.

AB Following an introduction to the broader context of the Symposium, the score of the oral presentations is summarized under three themes: a global synthesis of fisheries impacts in different ecosystems; an overview of the methods available for quantifying ecosystem impacts; and the integration of fisheries and environmental management. The presentations generated substantial evidence that marine ecosystems have been impacted by fishing. Also there appeared to be a broad consensus that the present approach to achieving conservation objectives of fisheries management does not sufficiently take into account ecosystem considerations. There was not, however, a consensus on what additional restrictions are required, or on what features of ecosystems need to be protected. A way forward is to add ecosystem objectives to the conservation component of fisheries management plans, as well as to the management plans for other ocean-use setters. The aggregate ocean-use activities would need to be evaluated in a nested manner, at a range of geographic scares. in relation to the more broadly defined conservation objectives. It is suggested that the geographic scales for evaluation of ecosystem considerations could be defined in a pragmatic manner based on the somewhat artificial boundaries of political and administrative systems already in place. The six conservation objectives proposed are maintenance of (1) ecosystem diversity, (2) species diversity, (3) genetic variability within species, (4) directly impacted species, (5) ecologically dependent species. and (6) trophic level balance. Indicators for each objective are discussed, as well as reference points that would trigger management actions. Such a broadening of conservation objectives for fisheries management would require both enhanced monitoring and a greater workload added to the process of provision of scientific advice through peer review. Of equal importance would be the challenges of establishing a governance framework to address multiple uses of marine resources. The spirit of the Symposium was that these coupled scientific and governance challenges will be very stimulating. (C) 2000 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

AB Recent theoretical and experimental studies have addressed whether the relative importance of aboveground and belowground competition changes along gradients of biomass productivity. Results have been contradictory, with some researchers finding a decrease in the importance of belowground competition and an increase in aboveground competition with increased productivity, and others finding either no relationship. or a positive correlation between the various factors. Belowground competitive intensity (BCI), resulting from root interactions, and total competitive intensity (TCI), resulting from both root and shoot interactions, have usually been measured as the proportional growth reduction due to competition (relative to growth without competition). Instead of direct measurement, aboveground competitive intensity (ACI) has been estimated by assuming that aboveground competition and belowground competition do not interact to affect plant growth, and therefore ACI + BCI = TCI. In this study, Abutilon theophrasti was used as a focal species to determine whether an interaction between the two competitive forms could exist. Target plants were grown with varying degrees of interaction with the roots of neighboring plants, through the use of modified root exclusion tubes, and by tying back the aboveground neighboring vegetation. In total, 16 combinations of varying intensities of aboveground and belowground interactions with neighbors were created at each of two fertilization levels. The strength of belowground competition decreased with fertilization, while neither aboveground competition nor total competition (occurring both above- and belowground simultaneously) varied among fertilization treatments. Not only was there evidence for an interaction between above- and belowground competition, the form of interaction varied with productivity, switching from no interaction in the unfertilized block to a positive interaction in the fertilized block. With fertilization, belowground competition decreased a plant's ability to compete in asymmetric competition for light. These results contrast with existing models of the role of competition in plant communities, and a new model is presented. In order to understand the rule of aboveground and belowground competition in plant communities, the potential for interactions between the two competitive forms must be considered in future studies.

AB In order to understand how bacterial communities develop in natural ecosystems, the culturable aerobic-heterotroph bacterial communities of three habitats (rhizosphere, endorhiza, and soil) associated with field-grown cucumber roots were examined for quantitative and qualitative changes in structure, over time. Soil and root samples were taken 0, 7, 14, 21, 35, and 70 days after planting (DAP) in 1994, and 0, 7, 14, 28, 42, and 70 DAP in 1995. Individual bacterial colonies of aerobic-heterotroph bacteria were sampled randomly and characterized using the Sherlock System (Microbial ID, Inc., Newark, Del), for fatty acid methyl ester analysis. More than 6,000 bacterial isolates were identified to the genus level and used in calculating richness, diversity, and similarity indices for the three habitats. Diversity was assessed using Hill's modifications of Shannon's index and Simpson's index (N1 and N2, respectively), while similarity was determined using the coefficient of biotic similarity. The same general trends were observed for the community structures of each habitat in both years. The soil was the least diverse and the rhizosphere was most diverse throughout both growing seasons. Bacillus and Arthrobacter spp. were dominant in soil, while Gram-negative bacteria tended to be more abundant in the rhizosphere and endorhiza. The initial membership of the endorhiza (7-14 DAP) appeared to be a function of the rhizosphere community, since both habitats were composed of similar genera. However, the endorhiza was less diverse than the rhizosphere because one or two genera tended to be dominant in each sample, particularly Agrobacterium and Enterobacter spp. Analysis of community similarity indicated that the soil was a distinct habitat and remained relatively unchanged throughout the study. The rhizosphere and endorhiza were dissimilar from the soil and from each other at particular sampling times. These results indicate that the soil, rhizosphere, and endorhiza communities are structurally distinct (the relative abundance of a particular bacterial genera differs among habitats) but share a common membership. Thus, when examining bacterial communities, both the qualitative (i.e., membership) and quantitative (i.e., abundance) aspects must be examined in order to study shifts in community structure.

AB We studied breeding songbird populations in a managed, predominantly forested landscape, in southeastern Missouri. We determined differences in the relative abundance of breeding birds in forest stands that had been harvested by the clearcut (n = 12), shelterwood (n = 12), group selection (n = 12), and single-tree selection (n = 10) forest regeneration methods, and mature even-aged stands (n = 12). Five migrant songbirds, the blue-winged warbler (Vermivora pinus), prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor), rufous-sided towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus), and yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens), were more abundant in clearcut treatments than other treatments (P < 0.001). Indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) and field sparrows (Spizella pusilla) were more abundant in clearcut and shelterwood treatments than other treatments (P < 0.001). Hooded warblers (Wilsonia citrina) and northern parulas (Parula americana) were more abundant in the selection treatments than other treatments (P < 0.001). Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) and wood thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) were most abundant in mature sites (P < 0.001). Acadian flycatchers (Empidonax virescens) and red-eyed vireos (Vireo olivaceus) were more abundant in group and single-tree selection treatments and mature stands than in clearcut or shelterwood treatments (P < 0.02). Numbers of brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) were greater in clearcut treatments than in other treatments (P < 0.001). The abundances of 2 avian nest predators, the blue lay (Cyanocitta cristata), and the American crow (Corvus brachyrhyches), were not significantly greater in any of the 5 treatments (P > 0.30). Nest success of species nesting in clearcut and shelterwood treatments was 18-50%. The percent of the sire in gaps, shrub stem density, and tree-diameter distribution differed among forest regeneration methods (P < 0.001). We believe habitat requirements of birds in managed forests can be best met by a mixture of even- and uneven-aged forest management that creates a range of disturbance sizes.

AB (1) Mean body length and mean sea-age at maturity of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, increased with increasing mean annual water discharge (1-300 m3 s-1) of the spawning river, r2 = 0.53 and r2 = 0.41, respectively. Rivers between 40 and 300 m3s-1, however, showed no such significant correlation. (2) Mean body length and mean sea-age at maturity also increased with passable length (4-126 km) of the spawning river, r2 = 0.30 and r2 = 0.24, respectively. However, passable river length did not add significantly to regression models having mean annual water discharge as the independent variable. (3) Among rivers, body length at sexual maturity for one-(r2 = 0.31) and two-sea-winter (r2 = 0.34) fish increased with mean sea-age at maturity of the population. (4) Among post-spawners, some spawned annually, others biennially. The proportion of biennial spawners increased significantly with sea-age at maturity (r2 = 0.69). In rivers with mean sea-age at maturity between 1.0 and 1.4 years, 0-40% of the fish spawned biennially. In rivers where sea-age at maturity was between 2.0 and 2.3 years, 80-100% spawned biennially. (5) The proportion of biennial spawners depended on fish size (r2 = 0.97). The majority of the smallest adults (< 60 cm) spawned annually, the largest (> 90 cm) biennially. (6) Recapture rates of tagged post-spawners decreased with increasing body length (r2= 0.45) suggesting that small adults had higher sea survival than large ones.

AB Satellite retrievals of information about the Earth's surface are widely used to monitor global terrestrial photosynthesis and primary production and to examine the ecological impacts of droughts. Methods for estimating photosynthesis from space commonly combine information on vegetation greenness, incoming radiation, temperature and atmospheric demand for water (vapour-pressure deficit), but do not account for the direct effects of low soil moisture. They instead rely on vapour-pressure deficit as a proxy for dryness, despite widespread evidence that soil moisture deficits have a direct impact on vegetation, independent of vapour-pressure deficit. Here, we use a globally distributed measurement network to assess the effect of soil moisture on photosynthesis, and identify a common bias in an ensemble of satellite-based estimates of photosynthesis that is governed by the magnitude of soil moisture effects on photosynthetic light-use efficiency. We develop methods to account for the influence of soil moisture and estimate that soil moisture effects reduce global annual photosynthesis by similar to 15%, increase interannual variability by more than 100% across 25% of the global vegetated land surface, and amplify the impacts of extreme events on primary production. These results demonstrate the importance of soil moisture effects for monitoring carbon-cycle variability and drought impacts on vegetation productivity from space.

AB The nitrogen (N) cycle involves a set of N compounds transformed by plants and microbes. Some of these N compounds, such as nitrous oxide (N2O) or nitrate (No-3(-)), are environmental pollutants jeopardizing biodiversity, human health or the global climate. The natural abundances of the common (N-14) and rare (N-15) stable N isotopes in a given compound, i.e. the isotopic composition, depend on individual production and consumption processes. As each process has an individual preference for the common or rare isotope (isotope effect) the measurement of the isotopic composition has been identified as a powerful tool for improved process understanding and source process identification. Both are key requirements for the development of strategies aiming at mitigating the release of environmental harmful N compounds. However, up to now, no comprehensive compilation of N cycle isotope effects is available.
   A compilation of isotope effects is also in high demand for testing biogeochemical models as such models are increasingly used to study N cycling in ecosystems and across landscapes and regions. Biogeochemical models are usually calibrated and validated only with single, easily accessible quantities. The isotopic composition of N compounds has a high potential to be used as additional, integrative parameter for a more thorough assessment of simulation results. For instance, the isotopic composition of soil N is determined by fractionation of the most relevant processes and, thus, integrates several N cycle processes, some of which cannot be accessed easily by direct measurement. To implement isotopic fractionation in ecosystem models and to utilize those for model validation, the magnitude of the isotope effects associated with individual transformations in the N cycle need to be assessed.
   This review summarizes the available methods to determine N isotope effects of various key ecosystem processes, thereby systematically comparing isotope effects for different experimental conditions and processes, exploring the accuracy of theoretical calculations of isotope effects and finally, addressing concepts to implement isotope effects into biogeochemical modeling.
   Our review shows that published isotope effects for N processes in soil incubations seem to be stronger as compared to those in water saturated systems. In addition to the choice of isotope effects adequate for the respective ecosystem, the challenge for modeling approaches is the sequential calculation of isotopic compositions. Associated numerical inaccuracies can be minimized by controlling the share of reacted substrates, i.e. the time step. The criterion to determine the time step needs to consider the strongest isotope effect, required accuracy of the calculations and the share of substrate consumed from or provided to the compound pool.
   The combination of biogeochemical models with delta N-15 methods and novel measures like site preference (SP) of N2O is a promising approach for improving process understanding at various spatial and temporal scales. Nevertheless, the compilation of isotope effects in this review may not only be of benefit for modelers, but also for experimentalists, as measurement and modeling of isotope effects may eventually help to test and validate our current process understanding of the N cycle.

AB Our daily life depends on many services delivered by the planet's ecosystems. Groundwater ecosystems deliver services that are of immense societal and economic value, such as: 1) purification of water and its storage in good quality for decades and centuries, 2) active biodegradation of anthropogenic contaminants and inactivation and elimination of pathogens, 3) nutrient recycling, and 4) mitigation of floods and droughts. Many of these services are directly connected to the presence and activity of specific organisms, microorganisms, or metazoa. Sustainable protection and management of important groundwater ecosystem services will require quantitative understanding of processes at different spatial and temporal scales and assessment of their resistance and resilience with regard to common anthropogenic impacts. Our review compiles known groundwater ecosystem services and, where appropriate, highlights important research gaps.

AB Beta diversity modelling has received increased interest recently. There are multiple definitions of beta diversity, but here, we focus on variability in species composition among sampling units within a given area. This facet can be described using various approaches. Some approaches ignore the spatial scale of the area considered (i.e. region limits), while some consider different region limits as a starting point for the analysis of beta diversity. We focused specifically on the beta diversity-environmental heterogeneity relationship in running waters. First, we present two conceptual models, which assume either (1) strong environmental control among localities (riffle sites in our case) within each region unit (a region unit encompasses a species pool and can be a stream or a basin or an ecoregion) or (2) that the spatial level of a region unit affects the relative importance of mechanisms affecting variability in species composition among localities (i.e. among riffle sites) within each region unit. Second, we compared three recent studies that used similar methods to examine the beta diversity-environmental heterogeneity relationship, but which were based on different region units, comprising sets of streams or sets of basins or sets of ecoregions. Our conceptual framework assumes that environmental control is not likely to be the sole mechanism affecting variability in community composition among localities within each region unit, but it is likely to be most important when dispersal rates are intermediate (i.e. among localities within a basin). In contrast, if dispersal rates are very high (i.e. among localities within a stream) or very low (i.e. among localities within an ecoregion), environmental control is in part masked by high dispersal rates or is prevented from occurring because not all species can reach all localities, respectively. Such scale dependency in the relative strength of environmental control might therefore transcend spatial scales from individual region units to the strength of the beta diversity-environmental heterogeneity relationship. We emphasise that the beta diversity-environmental heterogeneity relationship can only be tested across multiple region units. The results of three case studies are consistent with these predictions. Specifically, the beta diversity-environmental heterogeneity regression was highly significant across multiple basins, but not across multiple streams or across multiple ecoregions. We suggest that researchers take spatial scale and region unit level explicitly into account when inferring the mechanisms structuring ecological communities and mapping variation in beta diversity. We also propose a unified terminology for studies examining the beta diversity-environmental heterogeneity relationship in running waters because inconsistent terminology is likely to hamper the progress of our science.

AB Knowledge about the phylogeny and ecology of communities along environmental gradients helps to disentangle the role of competition-driven processes and environmental filtering for community assembly. In this study, we evaluated patterns in species richness, phylogenetic structure and life-history traits of bee communities along altitudinal gradients in the Alps, Germany. We found a linear decline in species richness and abundance but increasing phylogenetic clustering in communities with increasing altitude. The proportion of social- and ground-nesting species, as well as mean body size and altitudinal range of bee communities, increased with increasing altitude, whereas the mean geographical distribution decreased. Our results suggest that community assembly at high altitudes is dominated by environmental filtering effects, whereas the relative importance of competition increases at low altitudes. We conclude that inherent phylogenetic and ecological species attributes at high altitudes pose a threat for less competitive alpine specialists with ongoing climate change.

AB Temperature profoundly influences physiological responses in animals, primarily due to the effects on biochemical reaction rates. Since physiological responses are often exemplified by their rate dependency (e. g., rate of blood flow, rate of metabolism, rate of heat production, and rate of ion pumping), the study of temperature adaptations has a long history in comparative and evolutionary physiology. Animals may either defend a fairly constant temperature by recruiting biochemical mechanisms of heat production and utilizing physiological responses geared toward modifying heat loss and heat gain from the environment, or utilize biochemical modifications to allow for physiological adjustments to temperature. Biochemical adaptations to temperature involve alterations in protein structure that compromise the effects of increased temperatures on improving catalytic enzyme function with the detrimental influences of higher temperature on protein stability. Temperature has acted to shape the responses of animal proteins in manners that generally preserve turnover rates at animals' normal, or optimal, body temperatures. Physiological responses to cold and warmth differ depending on whether animals maintain elevated body temperatures (endothermic) or exhibit minimal internal heat production (ectothermic). In both cases, however, these mechanisms involve regulated neural and hormonal over heat flow to the body or heat flow within the body. Examples of biochemical responses to temperature in endotherms involve metabolic uncoupling mechanisms that decrease metabolic efficiency with the outcome of producing heat, whereas ectothermic adaptations to temperature are best exemplified by the numerous mechanisms that allow for the tolerance or avoidance of ice crystal formation at temperatures below 0 degrees C.

AB One of the least explored sources of algorithmic uncertainty in bioclimatic envelope models (BEM) is the selection of thresholds to transform modelled probabilities of occurrence (or indices of suitability) into binary predictions of species presence and absence. We investigate the impacts of such thresholds in the specific context of climate change. BEM for European tree species were fitted combining 9 climatic models and emissions scenarios, 7 modelling techniques, and 14 threshold-setting techniques. We quantified sources of uncertainty in projections of turnover, and found that the choice of the modelling technique explained most of the variability (39%), while threshold choice explained 25% of the variability in the results, and their interaction an additional 19%. Choice of future climates explained 9% of total variability among projections. Estimated species range shifts obtained by applying different thresholds and models were grouped by IUCN-based categories of threat. Thresholds had a large impact on the inferred risks of extinction, producing 1.7- to 9.9-fold differences in the proportions of species projected to become threatened by climate change. Results demonstrate that threshold selection has large - albeit often unappreciated - consequences for estimating species range shifts under climate change. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Model averaging, specifically information theoretic approaches based on Akaike's information criterion (IT-AIC approaches), has had a major influence on statistical practices in the field of ecology and evolution. However, a neglected issue is that in common with most other model fitting approaches, IT-AIC methods are sensitive to the presence of missing observations. The commonest way of handling missing data is the complete-case analysis (the complete deletion from the dataset of cases containing any missing values). It is well-known that this results in reduced estimation precision (or reduced statistical power), biased parameter estimates; however, the implications for model selection have not been explored. Here we employ an example from behavioural ecology to illustrate how missing data can affect the conclusions drawn from model selection or based on hypothesis testing. We show how missing observations can be recovered to give accurate estimates for IT-related indices (e.g. AIC and Akaike weight) as well as parameters (and their standard errors) by utilizing 'multiple imputation'. We use this paper to illustrate key concepts from missing data theory and as a basis for discussing available methods for handling missing data. The example is intended to serve as a practically oriented case study for behavioural ecologists deciding on how to handle missing data in their own datasets and also as a first attempt to consider the problems of conducting model selection and averaging in the presence of missing observations.

AB Approximately 20 000 years ago the last glacial maximum (LGM) radically altered the distributions of many Northern Hemisphere terrestrial organisms. Fewer studies describing the biogeographic responses of marine species to the LGM have been conducted, but existing genetic data from coastal marine species indicate that fewer taxa show clear signatures of post-LGM recolonization. We have assembled a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data set for 14 co-distributed northeastern Pacific rocky-shore species from four phyla by combining new sequences from ten species with previously published sequences from eight species. Nuclear sequences from four species were retrieved from GenBank, plus we gathered new elongation factor 1-alpha sequences from the barnacle Balanus glandula. Results from demographic analyses of mtDNA for five (36%) species (Evasterias troschelii, Pisaster ochraceus, Littorina sitkana, L. scutulata, Xiphister mucosus) were consistent with large population expansions occurring near the LGM, a pattern expected if these species recently recolonized the region. However, seven (50%) species (Mytilus trossulus, M. californianus, B. glandula, S. cariosus, Patiria miniata, Katharina tunicata, X. atropurpureus) exhibited histories consistent with long-term stability in effective population size, a pattern indicative of regional persistence during the LGM. Two species of Nucella with significant mtDNA genetic structure showed spatially variable demographic histories. Multilocus analyses for five species were largely consistent with mtDNA: the majority of multilocus interpopulation divergence times significantly exceeded the LGM. Our results indicate that the LGM did not extirpate the majority of species in the northeastern Pacific; instead, regional persistence during the LGM appears a common biogeographic history for rocky-shore organisms in this region.

AB Transportation infrastructures such as roads, railroads and canals can have major environmental impacts. Ecological road effects include the destruction and fragmentation of habitat, the interruption of ecological processes and increased erosion and pollution. Growing concern about these ecological road effects has led to the emergence of a new scientific discipline called road ecology. The goal of road ecology is to provide planners with scientific advice on how to avoid, minimize or mitigate negative environmental impacts of transportation. In this review, we explore the potential of molecular genetics to contribute to road ecology. First, we summarize general findings from road ecology and review studies that investigate road effects using genetic data. These studies generally focus only on barrier effects of roads on local genetic diversity and structure and only use a fraction of available molecular approaches. Thus, we propose additional molecular applications that can be used to evaluate road effects across multiple scales and dimensions of the biodiversity hierarchy. Finally, we make recommendations for future research questions and study designs that would advance molecular road ecology. Our review demonstrates that molecular approaches can substantially contribute to road ecology research and that interdisciplinary, long-term collaborations will be particularly important for realizing the full potential of molecular road ecology.

AB The current rate of invasive species introductions is unprecedented, and the dramatic impacts of exotic invasive plants on community and ecosystem properties have been well documented. Despite the pressing management implications, the mechanisms that control exotic plant invasion remain poorly understood. Several factors, such as disturbance, propagule pressure, species diversity, and herbivory, are widely believed to play a critical role in exotic plant invasions. However, few studies have examined the relative importance of these factors, and little is known about how propagule pressure interacts with various mechanisms of ecological resistance to determine invasion success.
   We quantified the relative importance of canopy disturbance, propagule pressure, species diversity, and herbivory in determining exotic plant invasion in 10 eastern hemlock forests in Pennsylvania and New Jersey (USA). Use of a maximum-likelihood estimation framework and information theoretics allowed us to quantify the strength of evidence for alternative models of the influence of these factors on changes in exotic plant abundance. In addition, we developed models to determine the importance of interactions between ecosystem properties and propagule pressure. These analyses were conducted for three abundant, aggressive exotic species that represent a range of life histories: Alliaria petiolata, Berberis thunbergii, and Microstegium vimineum.
   Of the four hypothesized determinants of exotic plant invasion considered in this study, canopy disturbance and propagule pressure appear to be the most important predictors of A. petiolata, B. thunbergii, and M. vimineum invasion. Herbivory was also found to be important in contributing to the invasion of some species. In addition, we found compelling evidence of an important interaction between propagule pressure and canopy disturbance. This is the first study to demonstrate the dominant role of the interaction between canopy disturbance and propagule pressure in determining forest invasibility relative to other potential controlling factors. The importance of the disturbance-propagule supply interaction, and its nonlinear functional form, has profound implications for the management of exotic plant species populations. Improving our ability to predict exotic plant invasions will require enhanced understanding of the interaction between propagule pressure and ecological resistance mechanisms.

AB Mothers in a range of taxa manipulate the phenotype of their offspring in response to environmental change in order to maximize their own fitness. Most studies have focused on changes in the mean phenotype of offspring. Focusing on mean offspring phenotypes is appropriate for species in which mothers are likely to successfully predict the environment their offspring will experience, but what happens when the offspring's environment is unpredictable? Theory suggests that when mothers face uncertainty regarding their offspring's environment, they should increase within-clutch variation in the offspring phenotype (i.e. they should bet hedge). While comparative analyses support the idea that mothers do bet hedge in response to environmental unpredictability, empirical tests are very rare and it remains unclear whether mothers adaptively adjust variance in offspring traits ( a phenomenon we call dynamic bet hedging). As a first step towards examining dynamic bet hedging, we reanalysed data from five previously published studies. These studies were across a range of taxa, but all manipulated the maternal environment/phenotype and then examined changes in mean offspring size. We found some support for the theoretical predictions that mothers should increase within-clutch offspring size variation when faced with unpredictable environments. We predict that dynamic bet hedging is more common than previously anticipated and suggest that it has some interesting implications for the studies that focus on shifts in mean offspring traits alone. Hence, future studies should examine maternal effects on both the mean and the variance of offspring traits.

AB Earthworms play a major role in many aspects of soil fertility, food web ecology and ecosystem functioning, and hence are frequently the subjects of, for example, ecological and toxicological research. Our aim was to examine the genetic structure of common earthworm species, to identify cryptic lineages or species that may be distinct ecotypes or biotypes (and hence confound current research based upon morphotypes) and to try to explain the massive cryptic diversity that eventually emerged. We demonstrated that species such as Allolobophora chlorotica, Aporrectodea longa, Aporrectodea rosea and Lumbricus rubellus all comprise highly divergent lineages with species-level divergence at the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene. In Allo. chlorotica alone, we found 55 haplotypes for COI, with 35 of these being found in pink and 20 in green morph worms. There were no cases of the two colour morphs sharing COI haplotypes. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial COI and 16S genes showed the presence of five highly divergent lineages, suggesting the presence of multiple cryptic species within Allo. chlorotica. There was no clear geographical pattern to lineage distribution and many populations were polymorphic for both mitochondrial DNA lineage and colour morph. Amplified fragment length polymorphism results, based on two primer combinations, were broadly congruent with mitochondrial DNA results with one significant exception. Despite showing over 14% divergence at COI, amplified fragment length polymorphism markers showed that the two green morph lineages may be interbreeding and therefore represent a single taxon. The cryptic diversity revealed by these results has profound consequences for all areas of earthworm research.

AB In marine soft sediments, large organisms are potentially important players in the nonlinear interactions that occur among animals, their food, and their chemical environment, all of which influence the contribution of benthos to ecosystem function. We investigated the consequences of removing large individuals of two functionally contrasting benthic communities on nutrient regeneration, microphyte standing stock, and macrobenthic community composition. The experiment was conducted at two adjacent sites that were physically similar but biologically different, one dominated by large deposit feeders and the other by large suspension feeders. Chemical fluxes were measured in experimental plots, and sediments were sampled to assess changes in macrofauna, sediment grain size, organic content, and microphyte standing stock. Our results demonstrate that the removal of large suspension feeders or deposit feeders influenced the flux of nitrogen and oxygen, surficial sediment characteristics, and community composition. In the deposit-feeder community, interactions between nutrient regeneration and grazing highlight important feedbacks between large macrofauna and biogeochemical processes and production by microphytes, indicating that the loss of large infauna driven by increased rates of anthropogenic disturbance may lead to functional extinction and cause shifts in community structure and ecosystem performance.

AB Some form of the light use efficiency (LUE) model is used in most models of ecosystem carbon exchange based on remote sensing. The strong relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and light absorbed by green vegetation make models based on LUE attractive in the remote sensing context. However, estimation of LUE has proven problematic since it varies with vegetation type and environmental conditions. Here we propose that LUE may in fact be correlated with vegetation greenness (measured either as NDVI at constant solar elevation angle, or a red edge chlorophyll index), making separate estimates of LUE unnecessary, at least for some vegetation types. To test this, we installed an automated tram system for measurement of spectral reflectance in the footprint of an eddy covariance flux system in the Southern California chaparral. This allowed us to match the spatial and temporal scales of the reflectance and flux measurements and thus to make direct comparisons over time scales ranging from minutes to years. The 3-year period of this study included both "normal" precipitation years and an extreme drought in 2002. In this sparse chaparral vegetation, diurnal and seasonal changes in solar angle resulted in large variation in NDVI independent of the actual quantity of green vegetation. In fact, one would come to entirely different conclusions about seasonal changes in vegetation greenness depending on whether NDVI at noon or NDVI at constant solar elevation angle were used. Although chaparral vegetation is generally considered "evergreen", we found that the majority of the shrubs were actually semi-deciduous, leading to large seasonal changes in NDVI at constant solar elevation angle. LUE was correlated with both greenness indices at the seasonal timescale across all years. In contrast, the relationship between LUE and PRI was inconsistent. PRI was well correlated with LUE during the "normal" years but this relationship changed dramatically during the extreme drought. Contrary to expectations, none of the spectral reflectance indices showed consistent relationships with CO2 flux or LUE over the diurnal time-course, possibly because of confounding effects of sun angle and stand structure on reflectance. These results suggest that greenness indices can be used to directly estimate CO2 exchange at weekly timescales in this chaparral ecosystem, even in the face of changes in LUE. Greenness indices are unlikely to be as good predictors of CO2 exchange in dense evergreen vegetation as they were in the sparse, semi-deciduous chaparral. However, since relatively few ecosystems are entirely evergreen at large spatial scales or over long time spans due to disturbance, these relationships need to be examined across a wider range of vegetation types.

AB Drought leads to a loss of longitudinal and lateral hydrologic connectivity, which causes direct or indirect changes in stream ecosystem properties. Changes in macrohabitat availability from a riffle-pool sequence to isolated pools are among the most conspicuous consequences of connectivity loss. Macroinvertebrate assemblages were compared among 3 distinct stream macrohabitats (riffles [R], pools connected to riffles [Pc], disconnected pools [Pd]) of 19 Mediterranean-climate sites in northern California to examine the influence of loss of habitat resulting from drought disturbance. At the time of sampling, 10 sites were perennial and included R and Pc macrohabitats, whereas 9 sites were intermittent and included only Pd macrohabitats. Taxa richness was more variable in Pd, and taxa richness was significantly lower in Pd than in Pc but not R. These results suggested a decline in richness between Pc and Pd that might be associated with loss of connectivity. Lower Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) richness relative to Odonata, Coleoptera, and Heteroptera (OCH) richness was observed for Pd than R and Pc macrohabitats. Family composition was more similar between R and Pc than between R or Pc and Pd macrohabitats. This similarity may be associated with greater connectivity between R and Pc macrohabitats. Correspondence analysis indicated that macroinvertebrate composition changed along a gradient from R to Pc and Pd that was related to a perennial-intermittent gradient across sites. High variability among macroinvertebrate assemblages in Pd could have been related to variability in the duration of intermittency. In cluster analysis, macroinvertebrate assemblages were grouped by macrohabitat first and then by site, suggesting that the macrohabitat filter had a greater influence on macroinvertebrate assemblages than did local site characteristics. Few taxa were found exclusively in Pc, and this macrohabitat shared numerous taxa with R and Pd, indicating that Pc may act as a bridge between R and Pd during drought. Drought is regarded as a ramp disturbance, but our results suggest that the response of macroinvertebrate assemblages to the loss of hydrological connectivity among macrohabitats is gradual, at least in Mediterranean-climate streams where drying is gradual. However, the changes may be more dramatic in and and semiarid streams or in Mediterranean-climate streams if drying is rapid.

AB Long-term effects of conditions during early development on fitness are important for life history evolution and population ecology. Using multistrata mark-recapture models on 20 years of data, we quantified the relation between rearing conditions and lifetime fitness in a long-lived shorebird, the oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus). We addressed specifically the relative contribution of short- and long-term effects of rearing conditions to overall fitness consequences.
   Rearing conditions were defined by differences in natal habitat quality, in which there is a clear dichotomy in our study population. In the first year of life, fledglings from high-quality natal origin had a 1.3 times higher juvenile survival. Later in life (age 3-11), individuals of high-quality natal origin had a 1.6 times higher adult prebreeder survival. The most striking effect of natal habitat quality was that birds that were reared on high-quality territories had a higher probability of settling in high-quality habitat (44% vs. 6%). Lifetime reproductive success of individuals born in high-quality habitat was 2.2 times higher than that of individuals born in low-quality habitat. This difference increased further when fitness was calculated over several generations, due to a correlation between the quality of rearing conditions of parents and their offspring.
   Long-term effects of early conditions contributed more to overall fitness differences as short-term consequences, contrary to common conceptions on this issue.
   This study illustrates that investigating only short-term effects of early conditions can lead to the large underestimation of fitness consequences. We discuss how long-term consequences of early conditions may affect settlement decisions and source-sink population interactions.

AB In nature, plant biomass is not evenly distributed across species, and naturally uncommon species may differ from common species in the probability of loss from the community. Understanding relationships between evenness and productivity is therefore critical to understanding changes in ecosystem functioning as species are lost from communities. We examined data from a large multi-site grassland experiment (BIODEPTH) for relationships between evenness of species composition (proportional abundance of biomass) and total biomass of communities. For plots which started with the same and even species composition, but which diverged in evenness over time, those with lower evenness had a significantly greater biomass. The relationship between evenness and biomass across all plots was also negative. However, for communities where the most common species represented one of the three largest species in monoculture at that site (inclusion of a large dominant species), the relationship was neutral. Path analyses indicated that three paths contributed to this negative relationship. First, higher species richness decreased evenness, but increased biomass (primarily through an increase in maximum plant size). Contrary to predictions, maximum plant size had either no effect on evenness, or a positive effect (in year 3 plots with a large dominant species), thereby reducing this relationship. In year 2, large variation among species in plant size (as measured in monoculture) both decreased evenness and increased biomass, thus increasing the strength of the negative relationship between evenness and biomass. However, the former effect was only found in plots with a large dominant species, the latter only in plots without a large dominant species. When species richness, maximum plant size, and variation in size were accounted for, in year 2 evenness positively affected biomass in plots that included a large dominant species. Our results are consistent with the view that naturally uncommon species may be unaffected by (or even benefit from) the presence of a large naturally common species, and that uncommon plants may have little ability to increase productivity in the absence of such a species. We conclude that the observed negative relationship between evenness and biomass resulted from multiple direct and indirect effects, the relative strength of which depended in part on the presence of large dominant species.

AB Nutrient uptake by forest trees is dependent on ectomycorrhizal (EM) mycelia that grow out into the soil from the mycorrhizal root tips. We estimated the production of EM mycelia in root free samples of pure spruce and mixed spruce-oak stands in southern Sweden as mycelia grown into sand-filled mesh bags placed at three different soil depths (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm). The mesh bags were collected after 12 months and we found that 590+/-70 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of pure mycelia was produced in spruce stands and 420+/-160 kg ha(-1) year(-1) in mixed stands. The production of EM mycelia in the mesh bags decreased with soil depth in both stand types but tended to be more concentrated in the top soil in the mixed stands compared to the spruce stands. The fungal biomass was also determined in soil samples taken from different depths by using phospholipid fatty acids as markers for fungal biomass. Subsamples were incubated at 20degreesC for 5 months and the amount of fungal biomass that degraded during the incubation period was used as an estimate of EM fungal biomass. The EM biomass in the soil profile decreased with soil depth and did not differ significantly between the two stand types. The total EM biomass in the pure spruce stands was estimated to be 4.8+/-0.9x10(3) kg ha(-1) and in the mixed stands 5.8+/-1.1x10(3) kg ha(-1) down to 70 cm depth. The biomass and production estimates of EM mycelia suggest a very long turnover time or that necromass has been included in the biomass estimates. The amount of N present in EM mycelia was estimated to be 121 kg N ha(-1) in spruce stands and 187 kg N ha(-1) in mixed stands. The delta(13)C value for mycelia in mesh bags was not influenced by soil depth, indicating that the fungi obtained all their carbon from the tree roots. The delta(13)C values in mycelia collected from mixed stands were intermediate to values from pure spruce and pure oak stands suggesting that the EM mycelia received carbon from both spruce and oak trees in the mixed stands. The delta(15)N value for the EM mycelia and the surrounding soil increased with soil depth suggesting that they obtained their entire N from the surrounding soil.

AB Despite their promise for simulating natural complexity, individual-based models (IBMs) are rarely used for ecological research or resource management. Few IBMs have been shown to reproduce realistic patterns of behavior by individual organisms. To test our IBM of stream salmonids and draw conclusions about foraging theory, we analyzed the IBM's ability to reproduce six patterns of habitat selection by real trout in simulations contrasting three alternative habitat-selection objectives: maximizing current growth rate, Current probability, or "expected maturity" (EM). EM is the product of (1) predicted survival of starvation and other mortality risks over a future time horizon, and (2) the fraction of reproductive size attained over the time horizon. Minimizing the ratio of mortality risk to growth rate was not tested as a habitat-selection rule because it produces nonsensical results when any habitat yields negative growth rates. The IBM simulates habitat selection in response to spatial and temporal variation in mortality risks and food availability as fish compete for food. The model fish move each daily time step to maximize their habitat-selection objective with no other restrictions (e.g., territoriality) imposed.
   Simulations with habitat selected to maximize growth reproduced three of the six habitat-selection patterns; maximizing survival reproduced two patterns; and maximizing EM reproduced all six patterns. Two patterns (shifts in habitat with Changes in temperature and food availability) were not reproduced by the objectives that consider only current growth and risk but were explained by the EM objective that considers how future starvation risk depends on current energy reserves and energy intake. In 75-d simulations, population-level survival and biomass accumulation were hi-hest for fish moving to maximize EM. These results support the basic assumptions of state-based dynamic-model in g approaches to habitat selection. Our IBM appears successful because it avoids restrictive assumptions, incorporates competition for food, assumes salmonids make good habitat-selection decisions at a daily time step, and uses a habitat objective (EM) that provides reasonable trade-offs between growth and mortality risks.

AB Nitrogen (N) limitation significantly increased the sensitivity of photosynthesis to inhibition by ultraviolet radiation (UV) in two estuarine dinoflagellates. Akashiwo sanguinea (= Gymnodinium sanguineum) and Gymnodinium (= Gyrodinium) cf. instriatum. Biological weighting functions (BWFs) and the kinetics of photosynthetic response to UV indicated that the train mechanism for the increase in sensitivity was less efficient repair. A decrease in cell size and in the concentration of the photoprotective mycosporine-like amino acids also elevated sensitivity. The BWFs predict that increased UV-B due to ozone depletion would cause a more than 1.5-fold greater additional inhibition of N-limited compared to nutrient-sufficient dinoflagellates. The BWFs of the N-limited cultures are similar to those measured for natural assemblages of phytoplankton in the Chesapeake Bay under low N availability.

AB Knowledge of regional-scale patterns of ecological community structure, and of factors that control them, is largely conceptual. Regional- and local-scale factors associated with regional variation in community composition have not been quantified. We analyzed data on woody plant species abundance from 2443 field plots across natural and seminatural forests and woodlands of Oregon to identify and quantify environmental, biotic, and disturbance factors associated with regional gradients of woody species composition; to examine how these factors change with scale (geographic extent) and location; and to characterize and map geographic patterns of species and environmental gradients.
   Environmental correlates of species gradients, species diversity patterns, and the spatial patterning of woody plant communities varied with geographic extent and location. Total variation explained (TVE) by canonical correspondence analyses (CCAs) was 9-15% at three hierarchical geographic extents: the entire state, two half-states, and five subregions. Our high level of unexplained species variation is typical of vegetation gradient analyses, which has been attributed to landscape effects, stochastic processes, and unpredictable historical events. In addition, we found that TVE in canonical correspondence analysis is confounded by sample size. Large numbers of plots and species, as in our study, are associated with lower TVEs, and we propose a mechanism for this phenomenon.
   Climate contributed most to TVE (46-60%) at all locations and extents, followed by geology (11-19%), disturbance (6-12%), and topography (4-8%). Seasonal variability and extremes in climate were more important in explaining species gradients than were mean annual climatic conditions. In addition, species gradients were more strongly associated with climatic conditions during the growing season than in winter. The dominant gradient at the state scale was from the lower elevation, moderate, maritime climate along the coast to the higher elevation, drier, continental climate of eastern Oregon. The second canonical axis followed a gradient from the warm, dry, growing seasons of the western interior valleys and eastern Cascade Range to the cooler, wetter mountainous areas. Geologic variables were most strongly correlated with axis 3, and measures of local site and disturbance with axis 4. For most of the state, our findings on the associations of disturbance factors with species gradients were inconclusive due to confounding of land ownership patterns, disturbance histories, and elevation in our sample. Near the coast, where gradients were not confounded, clear-cutting and stand age accounted for only 2 and 1% of TVE, respectively, in partial CCA. Ordinations of our long, regional gradients were influenced more by species presence than by abundance, and few woody species have been totally eliminated from sites by clear-cutting.
   Within Oregon and for the range of geographic extents we examined, variation in the environmental correlates of species gradients was more strongly associated with geographic location than with geographic extent, although topographic factors explained slightly more variation at smaller geographic extents. The greatest subregional contrast in vegetation character was between eastern and northwestern Oregon, and the Klamath subregion was intermediate. In the drier climate of eastern Oregon, community structure varied at a finer spatial scale, and climatic and topographic moisture were more strongly associated with species gradients than in the moister areas of western Oregon. Topographic effects were weakest and climatic effects strongest near the coast, where climate is moderate. Alpha and gamma diversity were greater in western Oregon, but beta diversity was greater in eastern Oregon and greater for shrubs than for trees.
   Our findings supported a conceptual model of multiscaled controls on vegetation distribution, and the related notion that local community structure is the result of both regional and local-scale processes. Despite strong ecological contrasts within the region, we were able to synthesize species-environment relations at the regional level. This suggests that apparent conflicts among local vegetation studies can be explained by real ecological differences among places.

AB The Paris Agreement introduced an ambitious goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. Here we combine a review of modelled pathways and literature on mitigation strategies, and develop a land-sector roadmap of priority measures and regions that can help to achieve the 1.5 degrees C temperature goal. Transforming the land sector and deploying measures in agriculture, forestry, wetlands and bioenergy could feasibly and sustainably contribute about 30%, or 15 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO(2)e) per year, of the global mitigation needed in 2050 to deliver on the 1.5 degrees C target, but it will require substantially more effort than the 2 degrees C target. Risks and barriers must be addressed and incentives will be necessary to scale up mitigation while maximizing sustainable development, food security and environmental co-benefits.

AB The global distribution of the optimum air temperature for ecosystem-level gross primary productivity (T-opt(eco))is poorly understood, despite its importance for ecosystem carbon uptake under future warming. We provide empirical evidence for the existence of such an optimum, using measurements of in situ eddy covariance and satellite-derived proxies, and report its global distribution. T-opt(eco) is consistently lower than the physiological optimum temperature of leaf-level photosynthetic capacity, which typically exceeds 30 degrees C. The global average T-opt(eco) is estimated to be 23 +/- 6 degrees C, with warmer regions having higher T-opt(eco) values than colder regions. In tropical forests in particular, T-opt(eco) is close to growing-season air temperature and is projected to fall below it under all scenarios of future climate, suggesting a limited safe operating space for these ecosystems under future warming.

AB Biological nitrogen fixation contributes to the pool of plant-available N in both bulk soil and the rhizosphere. Here we investigated the co-association and assemblage process of diazotrophic community members in both rhizosphere and bulk soil of wheat fields. The diazotrophic community structure in the rhizosphere was significantly different and comprised a less competitive and more stable network structure when compared with that of the bulk soil. Deterministic versus stochastic community assemblage processes were quantified using betaNTl scores, demonstrating that deterministic processes decreased in importance with distance from plant roots. Soil pH was correlated with diazotrophic community structure and diversity, and community structure showed greater connectivity and stability in soils with neutral pH relative to those in acidic or alkaline soils. Stochastic processes dominated the assemblage of the diazotrophic community in soils with neutral pH, while deterministic processes dominated in acidic or alkaline soils. These results suggest that soil pH may play an essential role in the interaction and assemblage processes of the diazotrophic community in the rhizosphere and bulk soils, which could enhance our understanding of biological nitrogen fixation in agricultural soils.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Given the substantial contributions of forest biodiversity and ecosystem services to society, forest sciences have a large potential to contribute to the integrity and sustainability of our future. This is especially true when the roles of biodiversity for sustaining ecosystem services are considered. The rapid expansion of sustainable forest management (SFM) has resulted in the adoption of various forest management frameworks intended to safeguard biodiversity. Concurrently, the importance of forest ecosystem services has been increasingly recognized. Although some initiatives aimed at conserving both biodiversity and ecosystem services are emerging, knowledge gaps still exist about their relationships and potential trade-offs in forests. Given recent advancements, increasing opportunities and some lags in forest ecology, further research on biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services will play substantial roles in the development of SFM practices. Here, we identified key issues including (i) relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function as a foundation of ecological integrity, (ii) resilience thinking to better prepare for and adapt to environmental changes, (iii) social-ecological perspectives that facilitate real-world conservation and management and (iv) theory-driven restoration that bridges science and practice. Thus, we illustrate priorities and future possibilities in applied ecology studies in forests, which will help society and ecosystems to build capacity and resilience to face uncertainty in the changing environment.Synthesis and applications. Under substantial human influences, forests are highly likely to be largely altered, potentially leading to the emergence of novel ecosystems or alternative stable states. Management thus needs more flexible, novel measures to address the significant uncertainty this generates. Resilience-based approaches are important to respond adaptively to future changes and cope with surprises, potentially providing multiple options. Although challenges exist, theory should play an important role in managing, conserving and restoring forest ecosystems. The issues discussed here should receive further attention in the context of the multiple goals of sustainable forest management.

AB Predator-prey interactions, including between large mammalian wildlife species, can be represented as a "space race'', where prey try to minimize and predators maximize spatial overlap. Human activity can also influence the distribution of wildlife species. In particular, high-human disturbance can displace large carnivore predators, a trait-mediated direct effect. Predator displacement by humans could then indirectly benefit prey species by reducing predation risk, a trait-mediated indirect effect of humans that spatially decouples predators from prey. The purpose of this research was to test the hypothesis that high-human activity was displacing predators and thus indirectly creating spatial refuge for prey species, helping prey win the "space race''. We measured the occurrence of eleven large mammal species (including humans and cattle) at 43 camera traps deployed on roads and trails in southwest Alberta, Canada. We tested species co-occurrence at camera sites using hierarchical cluster and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) analyses; and tested whether human activity, food and/or habitat influenced predator and prey species counts at camera sites using regression tree analysis. Cluster and NMS analysis indicated that at camera sites humans co-occurred with prey species more than predator species and predator species had relatively low co-occurrence with prey species. Regression tree analysis indicated that prey species were three times more abundant on roads and trails with > 32 humans/day. However, predators were less abundant on roads and trails that exceeded 18 humans/day. Our results support the hypothesis that high-human activity displaced predators but not prey species, creating spatial refuge from predation. High-human activity on roads and trails (i.e., > 18 humans/day) has the potential to interfere with predator-prey interactions via trait-mediated direct and indirect effects. We urge scientist and managers to carefully consider and quantify the trait-mediated indirect effects of humans, in addition to direct effects, when assessing human impacts on wildlife and ecosystems.

AB Adaptive divergence among populations can result in local adaptation, whereby genotypes in native environments exhibit greater fitness than genotypes in novel environments. A body of theory has developed that predicts how different species traits, such as rates of gene flow and generation times, influence local adaptation in coevolutionary species interactions. We used a meta-analysis of local-adaptation studies across a broad range of host-parasite interactions to evaluate predictions about the effect of species traits on local adaptation. We also evaluated how experimental design influences the outcome of local adaptation experiments. In reciprocally designed experiments, the relative gene flow rate of hosts versus parasites was the strongest predictor of local adaptation, with significant parasite local adaptation only in the studies in which parasites had greater gene flow rates than their hosts. When nonreciprocal studies were included in analyses, species traits did not explain significant variation in local adaptation, although the overall level of local adaptation observed was lower in the nonreciprocal than in the reciprocal studies. This formal meta-analysis across a diversity of host-parasite systems lends insight into the role of both biology (species traits) and biologists (experimental design) in detecting local adaptation in coevolving species interactions.

AB Remote sensing represents a powerful tool to derive quantitative and qualitative information about ecosystem biodiversity. In particular, since plant species richness is a fundamental indicator of biodiversity at the community and regional scales, attempts were made to predict species richness (spatial heterogeneity) by means of spectral heterogeneity. The possibility of using spectral variance of satellite images for predicting species richness is known as Spectral Variation Hypothesis. However, when using remotely sensed data, researchers are limited to specific scales of investigation. This paper aims to investigate the effects of scale (both as spatial and spectral resolution) when searching for a relation between spectral and spatial (related to plant species richness) heterogeneity, by using satellite data with different spatial and spectral resolution. Species composition was sampled within square plots of 100 m(2) nested in macroplots of 10,000 m(2). Spectral heterogeneity of each macroplot was calculated using satellite images with different spatial and spectral resolution: a Quickbird multispectral image (4 bands, spatial resolution of 3 m), an Aster multispectral image (first 9 bands used, spatial resolution of 15 m for bands 1 to 3 and 30 m for bands 4 to 9), an ortho-Landsat ETM+ multispectral image (bands 1 to 5 and band 7 used; spatial resolution, 30 m), a resampled 60 m Landsat ETM+ image. Quickbird image heterogeneity showed a statistically highly significant correlation with species richness (r=0.69) while coarse resolution images showed contrasting results (r=0.43, r=0.67, and r=0.69 considering the Aster, Landsat ETM+, and the resampled 60 m Landsat ETM+ images respectively). It should be stressed that spectral variability is scene and sensor dependent. Considering coarser spatial resolution images, in such a case even using SWIR Aster bands (i.e. the additional spectral information with respect to Quickbird image) such an image showed a very low power in catching spectral and thus spatial variability with respect to Landsat ETM+ imagery. Obviously coarser resolution data tend to have mixed pixel problems and hence less sensitive to spatial complexity. Thus, one might argue that using a finer pixel dimension should inevitably result in a higher level of detail. On the other hand, the spectral response from different land-cover features (and thus different species) in images with higher spectral resolution should exhibit higher complexity. Spectral Variation Hypothesis could be a basis for improving sampling designs and strategies for species inventory fieldwork. However, researchers must be aware on scale effects when measuring spectral (and thus spatial) heterogeneity and relating it to field data, hence considering the concept of scale not only related to a spatial framework but even to a spectral one.

AB Aim Niche theory emphasizes the importance of environmental conditions for the distribution and abundance of species. Using a macroecological approach our study aimed at identifying the important environmental gradients for spiders. We generated numerical values of niche position and niche width. We also investigated relationships between these niche properties as well as the degree of phylogenetic conservatism in order to draw conclusions about the evolution of the habitat niche.
   Location Central Europe: lowlands of Austria, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
   Methods We analysed 244 published spider communities from 70 habitat types by correspondence analysis. The resulting community scores were used to test for correlations with habitat characteristics. Species scores were used to derive niche position (mean scores) and niche width (standard deviation of scores). To test for niche conservatism we estimated variance components across the taxonomic hierarchy.
   Results The first two axes of the correspondence analysis were correlated with shading and moisture, respectively. Niche width had a hump-shaped relationship to both environmental gradients. beta-diversity was strikingly higher in open habitats than in forests. Habitat niche conservatism was lower than phylogenetic conservatism in body size.
   Main conclusions Environmental factors are important drivers for the beta-diversity of spiders, especially across open habitats. This underlines the importance of preserving the whole range of moisture conditions in open habitats. Narrow niches of species occurring at the ends of both environmental gradients indicate that adaptations to extreme habitats lead to constraints in ecological flexibility. Nevertheless, the habitat niche of species seems to evolve much faster than morphological or physiological traits.

AB Spotted hyaenas Crocuta crocuta were once considered mere scavengers; however, detailed research revealed that they are very efficient predators. Information on what spotted hyaenas actually prefer to prey on and what they avoid is lacking, as well as the factors that influence prey selection. Data from 14 published and one unpublished study from six countries throughout the distribution of the spotted hyaena were used to determine which prey species were preferred and which were avoided using Jacobs' index. The mean of these values for each species was used as the dependent variable in multiple regression, with prey abundance and prey body mass as predictive variables. In stark contrast to the rest of Africa's large predator guild, spotted hyaenas do not preferentially prey on any species. Also surprisingly, only buffalo, giraffe and plains zebra are significantly avoided. Spotted hyaena most prefer prey within a body mass range of 56-182 kg, with a mode of 102 kg. The dietary niche breadth of the spotted hyaena is similar to that of the lion Panthera leo, and the two species have a 58.6% actual prey species overlap and a 68.8% preferred prey species overlap. These results highlight the flexible and unselective nature of spotted hyaena predation and are probably a reason for the species' success throughout its range, despite a large degree of dietary overlap with lions.

AB Understanding the influence of environmental variation on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is of theoretical and practical interest. We predicted that the strength of this relationship should increase with available biotope space (the physical space associated with a species' niche) due to increased niche complementarity between species. In this study, biotope space specifically refers to soil volume which is associated with the niche dimension of nutrient acquisition. We tested our prediction by growing plant communities on a gradient of increasing soil depth and volume, offering increased rooting space to species. Our results provide support for a linear increase of the magnitude of positive biodiversity effects on above- and belowground community biomass with increasing biotope space. This increase was caused by complementarity effects between species. Soil erosion may thus reduce intercropping benefits.

AB We used the stalk-eyed fly Cyrtodiopsis dalmanni to examine predictions made by condition-dependent handicap models of sexual selection. Condition was experimentally varied by manipulation of larval food availability. Cyrtodiopsis dalmanni is a highly dimorphic species exhibiting strong sexual selection, and the male sexual ornament (exaggerated eyespan) showed strong condition-dependent expression relative to the homologous trait in females and nonsexual traits. Male eyespan also showed a great increase in standardized variance under stress, unlike nonsexual traits. The inflated variance of the male ornament was primarily attributable to condition-dependent (but body-size-independent) increase in variance. Thus, evaluation of male eyespan allows females to gain additional information about male condition over and above that given by body size. These findings accord well with condition-dependent handicap models of sexual selection.

AB The relative roles of natural selection and direct environmental induction, as well as of natural selection and genetic drift, in creating clinal latitudinal variation in quantitative traits have seldom been assessed in vertebrates. To address these issues, we compared molecular and quantitative genetic differentiation between six common frog (Rana temporaria) populations along an approximately 1600 km long latitudinal gradient across Scandinavia. The degree of population differentiation (Q(ST) approximate to 0.81) in three heritable quantitative traits (age and size at metamorphosis, growth rate) exceeded that in eight (neutral) microsatellite loci (F-ST = 0.24). Isolation by distance was clear for both neutral markers and quantitative traits, but considerably stronger for one of the three quantitative traits than for neutral markers. Q(ST) estimates obtained using animals subjected to different rearing conditions (temperature and food treatments) revealed some environmental dependency in patterns of population divergence in quantitative traits, but in general, these effects were weak in comparison to overall patterns. Pairwise comparisons of F-ST and Q(ST) estimates across populations and treatments revealed that the degree of quantitative trait differentiation was not generally predictable from knowledge of that in molecular markers. In fact, both positive and negative correlations were observed depending on conditions where the quantitative genetic variability had been measured. All in all, the results suggest a very high degree of genetic subdivision both in neutral marker genes and genes coding quantitative traits across a relatively recently (< 9000 years) colonized environmental gradient. In particular, they give evidence for natural selection being the primary agent behind the observed latitudinal differentiation in quantitative traits.

ID COOPERATIVE MONGOOSE; FOOD ALLOCATION; GROUP-SIZE; BEHAVIOR; DYNAMICS
AB Although breeding success is known to increase with group size in several cooperative mammals, the mechanisms underlying these relationships are uncertain. We show that in wild groups of cooperative meerkats, Suricata suricatta, reductions in the ratio of helpers to pups depress the daily weight gain and growth of pups and the daily weight gain of helpers. Increases in the daily weight gain of pups are associated with heavier weights at independence and at 1 year of age, as well as with improved foraging success as juveniles and higher survival rates through the first year of life. These results suggest that the effects of helpers on the fitness of pups extend beyond weaning and that helpers may gain direct as well as indirect benefits by feeding pups.

AB 1. We explored whether the independent evolutionary history of extratropical forests in the southern and northern hemispheres affects the temperature-elevation relationship of mountain forest lines. We compiled 115 forest line descriptions from the literature, covering the major extratropical mountain ranges of the world. We related forest line elevation to thermal regimes using mean annual temperature adjusted to sea level (MAT) and seasonal thermal amplitude (STA, mean of the warmest month minus the mean of the coldest) obtained from a global climate database.
   2. Thermal variables explained 79% of the global variability of forest line elevation, which increased approximately 130 m for every 1 K of MAT and for every 2 K of STA. After considering STA, there was no significant effect of 'hemisphere' on forest line elevation. MAT-elevation relationships for sites with STA < 15 K were the same between hemispheres.
   3. Sites dominated by different tree life forms had similar mean temperatures for the warmest month (differences < 3 K), but contrasting mean temperatures for the coldest (differences > 30 K). Along a gradient of increasing STA and decreasing winter temperatures, forest lines were first dominated by evergreen broadleaf trees, followed by deciduous broadleaf species, evergreen conifers, and finally deciduous conifers.
   4. Our results suggest that temperatures during the warm part of the year are the main control of forest line elevation in extratropical regions while temperatures during the cold part of the year affect the dominant life form of trees. There is a high degree of convergence in adaptation to mountain climates between trees species of both hemispheres. This convergence suggests that there is not a wide vacant altitudinal belt for introduced forest line species of the northern hemisphere into the southern hemisphere.

AB We present evidence that land use practices in the plains of Colorado influence regional climate and vegetation in adjacent natural areas in the Rocky Mountains in predictable ways. Mesoscale climate model simulations using the Colorado State University Regional Atmospheric Modelling System (RAMS) projected that modifications to natural vegetation in the plains, primarily due to agriculture and urbanization, could produce lower summer temperatures in the mountains. We corroborate the RAMS simulations with three independent sets of data: (i) climate records from 16 weather stations, which showed significant trends of decreasing July temperatures in recent decades; (ii) the distribution of seedlings of five dominant conifer species in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, which suggested that cooler, wetter conditions occurred over roughly the same time period; and (iii) increased stream flow, normalized for changes in precipitation, during the summer months in four river basins, which also indicates cooler summer temperatures and lower transpiration at landscape scales. Combined, the mesoscale atmospheric/land-surface model, short-term trends in regional temperatures, forest distribution changes, and hydrology data indicate that the effects of land use practices on regional climate may overshadow larger-scale temperature changes commonly associated with observed increases in CO2 and other greenhouse gases.

AB As habitats become more fragmented, understanding landscape-level effects on habitat quality becomes increasingly important. These effects include factors intrinsic to the habitat fragments, such as vegetation cover and structure, and extrinsic factors, such as the modifying influences of surrounding (matrix) habitats. We develop a spatial model, the Effective Area Model (EAM), that predicts the effects of matrix habitats on species abundances in habitat patches. Model predictions are based on two sets of parameters: measures of species abundances at various distances from habitat edges (''edge responses'') and measures of the size and shape of the habitat fragments. We test model predictions for bird assemblages occupying fragmented habitats in central coastal California. Predictions of the relative abundances of birds, based on results from previous studies at nearby sites, are made for six small (<3 ha) patches of oak woodland habitat, three surrounded by grassland and three surrounded by chaparral. Results from field studies of these patches show significant differences between the two groups, indicating that the type of habitat surrounding a patch influences the composition and structure of the bird assemblage it supports. The rank order of species abundances correlated more closely with predictions of the EAM than with those of a null model that did not account for edge and matrix effects. The EAM is an improvement over models that do not account for the influence of surrounding habitats on the distribution and abundance of animals in small habitat patches, and over those that assume a consistent response, for a given species or taxon, at all types of edges. This approach may prove useful in attempts to understand and predict the effects of habitat fragmentation and restoration on the organization of animal assemblages.

AB Mapping of biodiversity elements to expose gaps in conservation networks has become a common strategy in nature-reserve design. We review a set of critical assumptions and issues that influence the interpretation and implementation of gap analysis, including: (1) the assumption that a subset of taxa can be used to indicate overall diversity patterns, and (2) the impact of uncertainty and error propagation in reserve design. We focus our review on species diversity patterns and use data from peer-reviewed literature or extant state-level databases to test specific predictions implied by these assumptions. Support for the biodiversity indicator assumption was varied. Patterns of diversity as reflected in species counts, coincidence of hot spots, and representativeness were not generally concordant among different taxa, with the degree of concordance depending on the measure of diversity used, the taxa examined, and the scale of analysis. Simulated errors in predicting the occurrence of individual species indicated that substantial differences in reserve-boundary recommendations could occur when uncertainty is incorporated into the analysis. Furthermore, focusing exclusively on vegetation and species distribution patterns in conservation planning will contribute to reserve-design uncertainty unless the processes behind the patterns are understood. To deal with these issues, reserve planners should base reserve design on the best available, albeit incomplete, data; should attempt to define those ecological circumstances when the indicator assumption is defensible; should incorporate uncertainty explicitly in mapped displays of biodiversity elements; and should simultaneously consider pattern and process in reserve-design problems.

AB Flow in nine streams was examined in relation to refugia for invertebrates. Areas of bed maintaining low hydraulic stress throughout the discharge hydrograph could provide flow refugia for animals during spates. In one stream, near-bed shear stress and velocity were repeatedly measured in discrete patches. Three types were identified: ''fast'' patches maintained high hydraulic stress, ''variable'' patches showed the greatest change in stress, and ''slow'' patches maintained low stress and thus were potential refugia. Average stress increased with discharge, but potential refugia were prominent throughout and could be important for invertebrates. Abundances of refugia in eight comparison streams were characterized by changes in the frequency distribution of flow forces with discharge. Three stream types were identified that did not simply reflect channel size or morphology. Such stream-specific flow patterns could affect the structure of comunities through the differing provision of refugia. Longitudinal transport processes in these streams were investigated by solute dilution experiments and by the application of a model to measure an aggregated ''dead zone''. Transport (and dead zone volume) varied among streams and further reflected their refuge potential. Clearly, flow habitat features could intervene in population and community dynamics by providing refuge from spates.

AB 1.  Juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) that do not migrate to sea within the next year spend the winter under stones in the stream bed.  In a laboratory study, we show that this coincides with a loss of appetite even in the presence of excess food:  an index of appetite dropped by an average of 96% between early September and late December.
   2.  This period of anorexia leads to the virtual cessation of growth under environmental conditions that would otherwise allow growth to occur.
   3.  Juvenile salmon normally exhibit a gradual loss of fat reserves during the winter.  This depletion was experimentally accelerated by depriving fish of food for 3 weeks.  The fish responded by increasing their appetite; appetite was negatively correlated with the estimated energy reserves of individual fish.
   4.  Those fish previously deprived of food regained their appetite and made up their lost fat within 4 weeks of resuming feeding; their appetite then decreased to the level of control fish.
   5.  The parallel changes in habitat choice and appetite in autumn may be a consequence of the decreased profitability and increased predation risk when feeding in winter.  The degree and duration of anorexia in overwintering salmon is not pre-programmed but is regulated by energy reserves, the salmon effectively having a 'defended energy level' below which appetite is increased until lost energy reserves have been restored.

AB Rarity has been a central topic for conservation and evolutionary biologists aiming to determine the species characteristics that cause extinction risk. More recently, beyond the rarity of species, the rarity of functions or functional traits, called functional rarity, has gained momentum in helping to understand the impact of biodiversity decline on ecosystem functioning. However, a conceptual framework for defining and quantifying functional rarity is still lacking. We introduce 12 different forms of functional rarity along gradients of species scarcity and trait distinctiveness. We then highlight the potential key role of functional rarity in the long-term and large-scale maintenance of ecosystem processes, as well as the necessary linkage between functional and evolutionary rarity.

AB Experiences of nature provide many mental-health benefits, particularly for people living in urban areas. The natural characteristics of city residents' neighborhoods are likely to be crucial determinants of the daily nature dose that they receive; however, which characteristics are important remains unclear. One possibility is that the greatest benefits are provided by characteristics that are most visible during the day and so most likely to be experienced by people. We demonstrate that of five neighborhood nature characteristics tested, vegetation cover and afternoon bird abundances were positively associated with a lower prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress. Furthermore, dose-response modeling shows a threshold response at which the population prevalence of mental-health issues is significantly lower beyond minimum limits of neighborhood vegetation cover (depression more than 20% cover, anxiety more than 30% cover, stress more than 20% cover). Our findings demonstrate quantifiable associations of mental health with the characteristics of nearby nature that people actually experience.

AB It has been suggested that the widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides threatens bees, but research on this topic has been surrounded by controversy. In order to synthesize which research approaches have been used to examine the effect of neonicotinoids on bees and to identify knowledge gaps, we systematically reviewed research on this subject that was available on the Web of Science and PubMed in June 2015. Most of the 216 primary research studies were conducted in Europe or North America (82%), involved the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (78%), and concerned the western honey bee Apis mellifera (75%). Thus, little seems to be known about neonicotinoids and bees in areas outside Europe and North America. Furthermore, because there is considerable variation in ecological traits among bee taxa, studies on honey bees are not likely to fully predict impacts of neonicotinoids on other species. Studies on crops were dominated by seed-treated maize, oilseed rape (canola) and sunflower, whereas less is known about potential side effects on bees from the use of other application methods on insect pollinated fruit and vegetable crops, or on lawns and ornamental plants. Laboratory approaches were most common, and we suggest that their capability to infer real-world consequences are improved when combined with information from field studies about realistic exposures to neonicotinoids. Studies using field approaches often examined only bee exposure to neonicotinoids and more field studies are needed that measure impacts of exposure. Most studies measured effects on individual bees. We suggest that effects on the individual bee should be linked to both mechanisms at the sub-individual level and also to the consequences for the colony and wider bee populations. As bees are increasingly facing multiple interacting pressures future research needs to clarify the role of neonicotinoids in relative to other drivers of bee declines.

AB The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) accident in the northern Gulf of Mexico occurred on April 20, 2010 at a water depth of 1525 meters, and a deep-sea plume was detected within one month. Oil contacted and persisted in parts of the bottom of the deep-sea in the Gulf of Mexico. As part of the response to the accident, monitoring cruises were deployed in fall 2010 to measure potential impacts on the two main soft-bottom benthic invertebrate groups: macrofauna and meiofauna. Sediment was collected using a multicorer so that samples for chemical, physical and biological analyses could be taken simultaneously and analyzed using multivariate methods. The footprint of the oil spill was identified by creating a new variable with principal components analysis where the first factor was indicative of the oil spill impacts and this new variable mapped in a geographic information system to identify the area of the oil spill footprint. The most severe relative reduction of faunal abundance and diversity extended to 3 km from the wellhead in all directions covering an area about 24 km(2). Moderate impacts were observed up to 17 km towards the southwest and 8.5 km towards the northeast of the wellhead, covering an area 148 km(2). Benthic effects were correlated to total petroleum hydrocarbon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and barium concentrations, and distance to the wellhead; but not distance to hydrocarbon seeps. Thus, benthic effects are more likely due to the oil spill, and not natural hydrocarbon seepage. Recovery rates in the deep sea are likely to be slow, on the order of decades or longer.

AB 1. The need to understand the processes shaping population distributions has resulted in a vast increase in the diversity of spatial wildlife data, leading to the development of many novel analytical techniques that are fit-for-purpose. One may aggregate location data into spatial units (e.g. grid cells) and model the resulting counts or presenceabsences as a function of environmental covariates. Alternatively, the point data may be modelled directly, by combining the individual observations with a set of random or regular points reflecting habitat availability, a method known as a use-availability design (or, alternatively a presence pseudo-absence or casecontrol design).
   2. Although these spatial point, count and presence-absence methods are widely used, the ecological literature is not explicit about their connections and how their parameter estimates and predictions should be interpreted. The objective of this study is to recapitulate some recent statistical results and illustrate that under certain assumptions, each method can be motivated by the same underlying spatial inhomogeneous Poisson point process (IPP) model in which the intensity function is modelled as a log-linear function of covariates.
   3. The Poisson likelihood used for count data is a discrete approximation of the IPP likelihood. Similarly, the presence-absence design will approximate the IPP likelihood, but only when spatial units (i.e. pixels) are extremely small (Electric Journal of Statistics, 2010, 4, 1151-1201). For larger pixel sizes, presence-absence designs do not differentiate between one or multiple observations within each pixel, hence leading to information loss.
   4. Logistic regression is often used to estimate the parameters of the IPP model using point data. Although the response variable is defined as 0 for the availability points, these zeros do not serve as true absences as is often assumed; rather, their role is to approximate the integral of the denominator in the IPP likelihood (The Annals of Applied Statistics, 2010, 4, 1383-1402). Because of this common misconception, the estimated exponential function of the linear predictor (i.e. the resource selection function) is often assumed to be proportional to occupancy. Like IPP and count models, this function is proportional to the expected density of observations.
   5. Understanding these (dis-)similarities between different species distribution modelling techniques should improve biological interpretation of spatial models and therefore advance ecological and methodological cross-fertilization.

AB How numerous tree species can coexist in diverse forest communities is a key question in community ecology. Whereas neutral theory assumes that species are adapted to common field conditions and coexist by chance, niche theory predicts that species are functionally different and coexist because they are specialized for different niches. We integrated biophysical principles into a mathematical plant model to determine whether and how functional plant traits and trade-offs may cause functional divergence and niche separation of tree species. We used this model to compare the carbon budget of saplings across 13 co-occurring dry-forest tree species along gradients of light and water availability. We found that species ranged in strategy, from acquisitive species with high carbon budgets at highest resource levels to more conservative species with high tolerances for both shade and drought. The crown leaf area index and nitrogen mass per leaf area drove the functional divergence along the simulated light gradient, which was consistent with observed species distributions along light gradients in the forest. Stomatal coordination to avoid low water potentials or hydraulic failure caused functional divergence along the simulated water gradient, but was not correlated to observed species distributions along the water gradient in the forest. The trait-based biophysical model thus explains how functional traits cause functional divergence across species and whether such divergence contributes to niche separation along resource gradients.

AB P>Relatively little is known about diversity or structure of tropical ectomycorrhizal communities or their roles in tropical ecosystem dynamics. In this study, we present one of the largest molecular studies to date of an ectomycorrhizal community in lowland dipterocarp rainforest.
   We sampled roots from two 0.4 ha sites located across an ecotone within a 52 ha forest dynamics plot. Our plots contained > 500 tree species and > 40 species of ectomycorrhizal host plants. Fungi were identified by sequencing ribosomal RNA genes.
   The community was dominated by the Russulales (30 species), Boletales (17), Agaricales (18), Thelephorales (13) and Cantharellales (12). Total species richness appeared comparable to molecular studies of temperate forests. Community structure changed across the ecotone, although it was not possible to separate the role of environmental factors vs host plant preferences. Phylogenetic analyses were consistent with a model of community assembly where habitat associations are influenced by evolutionary conservatism of functional traits within ectomycorrhizal lineages.
   Because changes in the ectomycorrhizal fungal community parallel those of the tree community at this site, this study demonstrates the potential link between the distribution of tropical tree diversity and the distribution of tropical ectomycorrhizal diversity in relation to local-scale edaphic variation.

AB Although silica (Si) is not an essential element for plant growth in the classical sense, evidence points towards its functionality for a better resistance against (a) biotic stress. Recently, it was shown that wetland vegetation has a considerable impact on silica biogeochemistry. However, detailed information on Si uptake in aquatic macrophytes is lacking.
   We investigated the biogenic silica (BSi), cellulose and lignin content of 16 aquatic/wetland species along the Biebrza river (Poland) in June 2006 and 2007. The BSi data were correlated with cellulose and lignin concentrations.
   Our results show that macrophytes contain significant amounts of BSi: between 2 and 28 mg BSi g(-1). This is in the same order of magnitude as wetland species (especially grasses). Significant antagonistic correlations were found between lignin, cellulose and BSi content. Interestingly, observed patterns were opposite for wetland macrophytes and true aquatic macrophytes.
   We conclude that macrophytes have an overlooked but potentially vast storage capacity for Si. Study of their role as temporal silica sinks along the land-ocean continuum is needed. This will further understanding of the role of ecosystems on land ocean transport of this essential nutrient.

AB Conventional approaches to population biology emphasise the roles of climatic conditions, nutrient flow and predation as constraints on population dynamics. We argue here that this focus has obscured the role of time as a crucial constraint on species' abilities to survive in some habitats. Time constraints may be particularly intrusive both for species that live in intensely bonded groups (where the need to devote time to social interaction may ultimately limit the size of group that a species can maintain in a particular habitat) and for taxa that face constraints on the length of the active day. We use a linear programming approach that allows us to specify both how time allocations to different activities are influenced by local environmental and climatic variables and how these in turn limit group size and population density. The linear programming approach identifies the realizable niche space within which a species can maintain coherent groups that are larger than the minimum viable group size (or density). This approach thus allow us to understand better why a given taxon can survive in some habitats but not others, as well as the demographic stress that a population may face. In addition, they also allow us to evaluate the implications of both past and future climate change for a taxon's ability to cope with particular habitats.

AB The biodiversity scaling metrics widely studied in macroecology include the species-area relationship (SAR), the scale-dependent species-abundance distribution (SAD), the distribution of masses or metabolic energies of individuals within and across species, the abundance-energy or abundance-mass relationship across species, and the species-level occupancy distributions across space. We propose a theoretical framework for predicting the scaling forms of these and other metrics based on the state-variable concept and an analytical method derived from information theory. In statistical physics, a method of inference based on information entropy results in a complete macro-scale description of classical thermodynamic systems in terms of the state variables volume, temperature, and number of molecules. In analogy, we take the state variables of an ecosystem to be its total area, the total number of species within any specified taxonomic group in that area, the total number of individuals across those species, and the summed metabolic energy rate for all those individuals. In terms solely of ratios of those state variables, and without invoking any specific ecological mechanisms, we show that realistic functional forms for the macroecological metrics listed above are inferred based on information entropy. The Fisher log series SAD emerges naturally from the theory. The SAR is predicted to have negative curvature on a log-log plot, but as the ratio of the number of species to the number of individuals decreases, the SAR becomes better and better approximated by a power law, with the predicted slope z in the range of 0.14-0.20. Using the 3/4 power mass-metabolism scaling relation to relate energy requirements and measured body sizes, the Damuth scaling rule relating mass and abundance is also predicted by the theory. We argue that the predicted forms of the macroecological metrics are in reasonable agreement with the patterns observed from plant census data across habitats and spatial scales. While this is encouraging, given the absence of adjustable fitting parameters in the theory, we further argue that even small discrepancies between data and predictions can help identify ecological mechanisms that influence macroecological patterns.

AB Complex population structure can result from either sex-biased gene flow or population overlap during migrations. Loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) have both traits, providing an instructive case history for wildlife management. Based on surveys of maternally inherited mtDNA, pelagic post-hatchlings show no population structure across the northern Atlantic (phi(ST) < 0.001, P = 0.919), subadults in coastal habitat show low structure among locations (phi(ST) = 0.01, P < 0.005), and nesting colonies along the southeastern coast of the United States have strong structure (phi(ST) = 0.42, P < 0.001). Thus the level of population structure increases through progressive life history stages. In contrast, a survey of biparentally inherited microsatellite DNA shows no significant population structure: R-ST < 0.001; F-ST = 0.002 (P > 0.05) across the same nesting colonies. These results indicate that loggerhead females home faithfully to their natal nesting colony, but males provide an avenue of gene flow between regional nesting colonies, probably via opportunistic mating in migratory corridors. As a result, all breeding populations in the southeastern United States have similar levels of microsatellite diversity (H-E = 0.70-0.89), whereas mtDNA haplotype diversity varies dramatically (h = 0.00-0.66). Under a conventional interpretation of the nuclear DNA data, the entire southeastern United States would be regarded as a single management unit, yet the mtDNA data indicate multiple isolated populations. This complex population structure mandates a different management strategy at each life stage. Perturbations to pelagic juveniles will have a diffuse impact on Atlantic nesting colonies, mortality of subadults will have a more focused impact on nearby breeding populations, and disturbances to adults will have pinpoint impact on corresponding breeding populations. These findings demonstrate that surveys of multiple life stages are desirable to resolve management units in migratory marine species.

AB This paper presents a new approach to spatially explicit modelling that enables the influence of neighbourhood effects on the dynamics of forests and plant communities to be analysed. We refer to this approach as 'field of neighbourhood' (FON). It combines the 'neighbourhood philosophy' of grid-based models with the description of individual spacing in the 'zone of influence' (ZOI) approach. The novel feature of FON is that modelling of local competition between neighbouring trees is based on the notion of a field of neighbourhood exerted by each tree. This field is defined only on the ZOI of a tree and depends on the distance to the stemming point. For the demonstration of FON's power, a simulation model (KiWi) was implemented that focuses on the dynamic of mangrove forests. The realistic self-thinning behaviour of modelled stands of Avicennia germinans and Rhizophora mangle confirms the suitability of the FON approach for the description of intra- and inter-specific competition. In KiWi, mortality is modelled in terms of a 'memory function', i.e. the yearly stem increment of each tree is stored in its 'memory' over a certain time period and determines - as a sign of vitality - tree mortality. The results of KiWi demonstrate that this description is sufficient to keep the maximum age of the trees within a reasonable limit. The model thus manages without a description of individual tree age. This is an important feature considering the fact that a direct relationship between tree age and mortality is questioned and there is no established method as yet for determining the age of mangrove trees.

Plants operate on a continuum of xylem and stomatal regulation strategies from very isohydric (strict regulation) to very anisohydric. Coexisting species may display a variety of isohydricity behaviors. As such, it can be difficult to predict how to model the degree of isohydricity at the ecosystem scale by aggregating studies of individual species. This is nonetheless essential for accurate prediction of ecosystem drought resilience. In this study, we define a metric for the degree of isohydricity at the ecosystem scale in analogy with a recent metric introduced at the species level. Using data from the AMSR-E satellite, this metric is evaluated globally based on diurnal variations in microwave vegetation optical depth (VOD), which is directly related to leaf water potential. Areas with low annual mean radiation are found to be more anisohydric. Except for evergreen broadleaf forests in the tropics, which are very isohydric, and croplands, which are very anisohydric, land cover type is a poor predictor of ecosystem isohydricity, in accordance with previous species-scale observations. It is therefore also a poor basis for parameterizing water stress response in land-surface models. For taller ecosystems, canopy height is correlated with higher isohydricity (so that rainforests are mostly isohydric). Highly anisohydric areas show either high or low underlying water use efficiency. In seasonally dry locations, most ecosystems display a more isohydric response (increased stomatal regulation) during the dry season. In several seasonally dry tropical forests, this trend is reversed, as dry-season leaf-out appears to coincide with a shift toward more anisohydric strategies. The metric developed in this study allows for detailed investigations of spatial and temporal variations in plant water behavior.

AB Effective conservation requires knowledge exchange among scientists and decision-makers to enable learning and support evidence-based decision-making. Efforts to improve knowledge exchange have been hindered by a paucity of empirically-grounded guidance to help scientists and practitioners design and implement research programs that actively facilitate knowledge exchange. To address this, we evaluated the Ningaloo Research Program (NRP), which was designed to generate new scientific knowledge to support evidence-based decisions about the management of the Ningaloo Marine Park in north-western Australia. Specifically, we evaluated (1) outcomes of the NRP, including the extent to which new knowledge informed management decisions; (2) the barriers that prevented knowledge exchange among scientists and managers; (3) the key requirements for improving knowledge exchange processes in the future; and (4) the core capacities that are required to support knowledge exchange processes. While the NRP generated expansive and multidisciplinary science outputs directly relevant to the management of the Ningaloo Marine Park, decision-makers are largely unaware of this knowledge and little has been integrated into decision-making processes. A range of barriers prevented efficient and effective knowledge exchange among scientists and decision-makers including cultural differences among the groups, institutional barriers within decision-making agencies, scientific outputs that were not translated for decision-makers and poor alignment between research design and actual knowledge needs. We identify a set of principles to be implemented routinely as part of any applied research program, including; (i) stakeholder mapping prior to the commencement of research programs to identify all stakeholders, (ii) research questions to be co-developed with stakeholders, (iii) implementation of participatory research approaches, (iv) use of a knowledge broker, and (v) tailored knowledge management systems. Finally, we articulate the individual, institutional and financial capacities that must be developed to underpin successful knowledge exchange strategies. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB The leopard's (Panthera pardus) broad geographic range, remarkable adaptability, and secretive nature have contributed to a misconception that this species might not be severely threatened across its range. We find that not only are several subspecies and regional populations critically endangered but also the overall range loss is greater than the average for terrestrial large carnivores. To assess the leopard's status, we compile 6,000 records at 2,500 locations from over 1,300 sources on its historic (post 1750) and current distribution. We map the species across Africa and Asia, delineating areas where the species is confirmed present, is possibly present, is possibly extinct or is almost certainly extinct. The leopard now occupies 25-37% of its historic range, but this obscures important differences between subspecies. Of the nine recognized subspecies, three (P. p. pardus, fusca, and saxicolor) account for 97% of the leopard's extant range while another three (P. p. orientalis, nimr, and japonensis) have each lost as much as 98% of their historic range. Isolation, small patch sizes, and few remaining patches further threaten the six subspecies that each have less than 100,000 km 2 of extant range. Approximately 17% of extant leopard range is protected, although some endangered subspecies have far less. We found that while leopard research was increasing, research effort was primarily on the subspecies with the most remaining range whereas subspecies that are most in need of urgent attention were neglected.

AB Pseudoreplication is defined as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects where treatments are not replicated and/or replicates are not statistically independent. It is a genuine but controversial issue in ecology particularly in the case of costly landscape-scale manipulations, behavioral studies where ethics or other concerns may limit sample sizes, ad hoc monitoring data, and the analysis of natural experiments where chance events occur at a single site. Here key publications on the topic are reviewed to illustrate the debate that exists about the conceptual validity of pseudoreplication. A survey of ecologists and case studies of experimental design and publication issues are used to explore the extent of the problem, ecologists' solutions, reviewers' attitudes, and the fate of submitted manuscripts. Scientists working across a range of ecological disciplines regularly come across the problem of pseudoreplication and build solutions into their designs and analyses. These include carefully defining hypotheses and the population of interest, acknowledging the limits of statistical inference and using statistical approaches including nesting and random effects. Many ecologists face considerable challenges getting their work published if accusations of pseudoreplication are made - even if the problem has been dealt with. Many reviewers reject papers for pseudoreplication, and this occurs more often if they haven't experienced the issue themselves. The concept of pseudoreplication is being applied too dogmatically and often leads to rejection during review. There is insufficient consideration of the associated philosophical issues and potential statistical solutions. By stopping the publication of ecological studies, reviewers are slowing the pace of ecological research and limiting the scope of management case studies, natural events studies, and valuable data available to form evidence-based solutions. Recommendations for fair and consistent treatment of pseudoreplication during writing and review are given for authors, reviewers, and editors.

AB This paper is the result of an international initiative and is a first attempt to develop guidelines for the care and welfare of cephalopods (i.e. nautilus, cuttlefish, squid and octopus) following the inclusion of this Class of approximate to 700 known living invertebrate species in Directive 2010/63/EU. It aims to provide information for investigators, animal care committees, facility managers and animal care staff which will assist in improving both the care given to cephalopods, and the manner in which experimental procedures are carried out. Topics covered include: implications of the Directive for cephalopod research; project application requirements and the authorisation process; the application of the 3Rs principles; the need for harm-benefit assessment and severity classification. Guidelines and species-specific requirements are provided on: i. supply, capture and transport; ii. environmental characteristics and design of facilities (e.g. water quality control, lighting requirements, vibration/noise sensitivity); iii. accommodation and care (including tank design), animal handling, feeding and environmental enrichment; iv. assessment of health and welfare (e.g. monitoring biomarkers, physical and behavioural signs); v. approaches to severity assessment; vi. disease (causes, prevention and treatment); vii. scientific procedures, general anaesthesia and analgesia, methods of humane killing and confirmation of death. Sections covering risk assessment for operators and education and training requirements for carers, researchers and veterinarians are also included. Detailed aspects of care and welfare requirements for the main laboratory species currently used are summarised in Appendices. Knowledge gaps are highlighted to prompt research to enhance the evidence base for future revision of these guidelines.

AB Estimating the rate of exchange of individuals among populations is a central concern to evolutionary ecology and its applications to conservation and management. For instance, the efficiency of protected areas in sustaining locally endangered populations and ecosystems depends on reserve network connectivity. The population genetics theory offers a powerful framework for estimating dispersal distances and migration rates from molecular data. In the marine realm, however, decades of molecular studies have met limited success in inferring genetic connectivity, due to the frequent lack of spatial genetic structure in species exhibiting high fecundity and dispersal capabilities. This is especially true within biogeographic regions bounded by well-known hotspots of genetic differentiation. Here, we provide an overview of the current methods for estimating genetic connectivity using molecular markers and propose several directions for improving existing approaches using large population genomic datasets. We highlight several issues that limit the effectiveness of methods based on neutral markers when there is virtually no genetic differentiation among samples. We then focus on alternative methods based on markers influenced by selection. Although some of these methodologies are still underexplored, our aim was to stimulate new research to test how broadly they are applicable to nonmodel marine species. We argue that the increased ability to apply the concepts of cline analyses will improve dispersal inferences across physical and ecological barriers that reduce connectivity locally. We finally present how neutral markers hitchhiking with selected loci can also provide information about connectivity patterns within apparently well-mixed biogeographic regions. We contend that one of the most promising applications of population genomics is the use of outlier loci to delineate relevant conservation units and related eco-geographic features across which connectivity can be measured.

AB Nitrogen isotope values (delta N-15) are higher in ectomycorrhizal fungi than in their plant hosts but the wide variability in delta N-15 among sporocarps of different fungal taxa is unexplained. We propose that fungal delta N-15 reflects sequestration of fungal nitrogen to build fungal biomass, and should accordingly reflect fungal exploration strategies and hyphal properties. To test this, we compared delta N-15 to exploration types, hyphal hydrophobicity, and the presence of rhizomorphs in ectomycorrhizal species from surveys at four sites in temperate and boreal coniferous forests. Fungi with exploration types of high biomass, such as long-distance (e.g., Suillus), medium-distance mat (e.g., Hydnellum), and medium-distance fringe (e.g., Cortinarius) were 4-7aEuro degrees more enriched in N-15 than fungi with exploration types of low biomass [medium-distance smooth (e.g., Amanita), short-distance (e.g., Inocybe), and contact (e.g., Hygrophorus)]. High biomass types comprised 79% (heden, northern Sweden), 65% (Deer Park, Pacific Northwest, USA), 45% (Stadsskogen, central Sweden), and 39% (Hoh, Pacific Northwest, USA) of ectomycorrhizal species, with these types more prevalent at sites of lower nitrogen availability. Species with hydrophobic hyphae or with rhizomorphs were 3-4aEuro degrees more enriched in N-15 than taxa with hydrophilic hyphae or without rhizomorphs. The consistency of these patterns suggest that delta N-15 measurements could provide insights into belowground functioning of poorly known taxa of ectomycorrhizal fungi and into relative fungal biomass across ectomycorrhizal communities.

AB In the course of the 20th century, migratory birds have shown rapid phenological changes in response to climate change. However, the spatial variability of phenological changes, as well as their intraspecific consistency, remains largely unexplored. Here we analysed 672 estimates of change in first arrival dates of migratory birds and 289 estimates of mean/median arrival dates, based on time series with a minimum duration of 15 yr, collected across Europe from 1960 to 2006. There were highly significant advances in arrival date, significantly more so for first than mean arrival date. Change in arrival dates significantly varied among species, implying that response to climate change is a species-specific feature, and showed substantial phylogenetic effects, since ca. 50% of the variation in the observed trends was attributable to differences among species. The advance in first arrival date was weaker at extreme latitudes and stronger at intermediate latitudes, while geographic variation in mean arrival dates was less pronounced. Both first and mean arrival dates advanced the most for short-compared to long-distance migrants. These findings emphasize the reliability of estimates of phenological trends of avian species, which are therefore suitable to be included in comparative analyses aimed at identifying species-specific traits that favour adaptation to climatic changes. In addition, our results suggest that analyses of factors that have affected phenological responses to climate change should take into account spatial variation in the response, which could be due to spatial differences in the strength of climate change.

AB The debate about the value of the allometric scaling exponent (b) relating metabolic rate to body mass ( metabolic rate a x mass b) is ongoing, with published evidence both for and against a 3/4-power scaling law continuing to accumulate. However, this debate often revolves around a dichotomous distinction between the 3/4-power exponent predicted by recent models of nutrient distribution networks and a 2/3 exponent predicted by Euclidean surface-area-to-volume considerations. Such an approach does not allow for the possibility that there is no single "true'' exponent. In the present study, we conduct a meta-analysis of 127 interspecific allometric exponents to determine whether there is a universal metabolic allometry or if there are systematic differences between taxa or between metabolic states. This analysis shows that the effect size of mass on metabolic rate is significantly heterogeneous and that, on average, the effect of mass on metabolic rate is stronger for endotherms than for ectotherms. Significant differences between scaling exponents were also identified between ectotherms and endotherms, as well as between metabolic states (e.g., rest, field, and exercise), a result that applies to b values estimated by ordinary least squares, reduced major axis, and phylogenetically correct regression models. The lack of support for a single exponent model suggests that there is no universal metabolic allometry and represents a significant challenge to any model that predicts only a single value of b.

AB The central highlands of Mexico are considered to be a center of genetic diversity for both the potato late blight pathogen and for tuber-bearing Solanum spp. Recent work conducted in Mexico and South America sheds new light on the biology and evolution of Phytophthora infestans and other related Phytophthora pathogens. It now appears that Mexican Solanum species, which coevolved with P. infestans and were previously known for providing a source of R-genes, also provide a source of quantitative, rate-reducing resistance that is highly effective, stable, and durable. It is now apparent that Mexico is the center of origin not only of the potato late blight pathogen P. infestans, but also of several related Phytophthora species including R mirabilis, P ipomoeae, and possibly P phaseoli. We close with the hypothesis that these Phytophthora species evolved sympatrically from one ancestral host through adaptive radiation onto their respective four host families.

AB We examined the responses of a beetle assemblage to habitat complexity differences within a single habitat type, Sydney sandstone ridgetop woodland, using pitfall and flight-intercept trapping. Six habitat characters (tree canopy cover, shrub canopy cover, ground herb cover, soil moisture, amount of leaf litter, and amount of logs, rocks and debris) were scored between 0 and 3 using ordinal scales to reflect habitat complexity at survey sites. Pitfall trapped beetles were more species rich and of different composition in high complexity sites, compared with low complexity sites. Species from the Staphylinidae (Aleocharinae sp. 1 and sp. 2), Carabidae (Pamborus alternans Latreille), Corticariidae (Cartodere Thomson sp. 1) and Anobiidae (Mysticephala Ford sp. 1) were most clearly responsible for the compositional differences, preferring high complexity habitat. Affinities between general functional groupings of pitfall-trapped beetles and habitat variables were not clear at a low taxonomic resolution (family level). The composition and species richness of flight-intercept-trapped beetles were similar in high and low complexity sites. Our study demonstrates that discrete responses of the various functional groups of beetles are strongly associated with their feeding habits, indicated by differing habitat components from within overall composite habitat complexity measures. Although habitat preferences by beetle species may often reflect their foraging habits, clarification of the causal mechanisms underpinning the relationships between habitat complexity and beetles are critical for the development of general principles linking habitat, functional roles and diversity.

AB Benthic foraminifera are increasingly used as environmental bio-indicators, especially in polluted environments where their sensitivity to Pollutants may be expressed by a modification of the assemblages. Eighteen sediment samples were collected in September 2000 in five harbors located in moderately polluted estuaries on the coast of Vendee (France) for the study of foraminiferal assemblages. Ten heavy metals and 13 PAH have been analyzed from the sediments. The marine to continental estuarine gradient has a prevalent influence on the foraminiferal distribution. However, the results show that foraminiferal density and species richness of the assemblages decrease with an increase in heavy metal and PAH concentration, and therefore may be used as pollution indicators. Moreover. the more polluted areas are dominated by the tolerant pioneer species Haynesina germanica that may be used as bio-indicator of pollution, mainly in the uppermost areas.

AB Chironomid-temperature inference models based on an expanded data set of surface-sediment and limnological data from 53 Subarctic lakes in northern Fennoscandia have been developed using eight different numerical techniques, each based on slightly different underlying statistical models or ecological assumptions. The study sites are mostly small, shallow, bathymetrically simple, oligotrophic lakes, with a pH range from 5.0 to 7.8, a total organic carbon range from 2.5 to 12.6 mg l(-1), a mean July lakewater temperature ranging from 6.1 to 15.4 degrees C, and a mean July air temperature ranging from 8.5 to 14.9 degrees C. A series of redundancy analyses (RDA) identified sediment organic content, maximum lake depth, and lakewater temperature as being the most important explanatory Variables. Variance partitioning by partial RDAs further suggested that each of these Variables accounted for a significant fraction of variance independent from each other. Different call models were assessed on the basis of their statistical performance, with particular reference to prediction errors and the amount of bias along the temperature gradient. Of the eight calibration models, modem analogue techniques, weighted averaging partial least squares, simple weighted averaging with an 'inverse' deshrinking regression, and linear partial least squares consistently performed best. These methods can all be used to develop transfer functions for surface-water and air July temperatures with a root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) of about 1.5-1.6 degrees C (water temperature) and 0.8-1.1 degrees C (air temperature), as assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation. The resulting models do, however, have relatively high maximum biases (up to 3.9 degrees C) in the lowest segments of the air and water temperature gradients, highlighting the need for enlarging and expanding the calibration data set to include lower temperatures.

TI Predicting the distribution of tsetse flies in West Africa using

ID CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE-ANALYSIS; DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX; GLOSSINA
AB An example is given of the application of remotely-sensed, satellite data to the problems of predicting the distribution and abundance of tsetse flies in West Africa. The distributions of eight species of tsetse, Glossina morsitans, C. longipalpis, G. palpalis, G. tachinoides, G. pallicera, G. fusca, C. nigrofusca and G. medicorum in Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso, were analysed using discriminant analysis applied to temporal Fourier-processed surrogates for vegetation, temperature and rainfall derived from meteorological satellites. The vegetation and temperature surrogates were the normalized difference vegetation index and channel-4-brightness temperature, respectively, from the advanced, very-high-resolution radiometers on board the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's polar-orbiting, meteorological satellites. For rainfall the surrogate was the Cold-Cloud-Duration (CCD) index derived from the geostationary, Meteosat satellite series. The presence or absence of tsetse was predicted with accuracies ranging from 67%100% (mean=82.3%). A further data-set, for the abundance of five tsetse species across the northern part of Gate d'Ivoire (an area of about 140 000 km(2)), was analysed in the same way, and fly-abundance categories predicted with accuracies of 30%-100% (mean=73.0%). The thermal data appeared to be the most useful of the predictor variables, followed by vegetation and rainfall indices. Refinements of the analytical technique and the problems oi extending the predictions through space and time are discussed.

AB Many studies report that mountain plant species are shifting upward in elevation. However, the majority of these reports focus on shifts of upper limits. Here, we expand the focus and simultaneously analyze changes of both range limits, optima, and abundances of 183 mountain plant species. We therefore resurveyed 1,576 vegetation plots first recorded before 1970 in the European Alps. We found that both range limits and optima shifted upward in elevation, but the most pronounced trend was a mean increase in species abundance. Despite huge species-specific variation, range dynamics showed a consistent trend along the elevational gradient: Both range limits and optima shifted upslope faster the lower they were situated historically, and species' abundance increased more for species from lower elevations. Traits affecting the species' dispersal and persistence capacity were not related to their range dynamics. Using indicator values to stratify species by their thermal and nutrient demands revealed that elevational ranges of thermophilic species tended to expand, while those of cold-adapted species tended to contract. Abundance increases were strongest for nutriphilous species. These results suggest that recent climate warming interacted with airborne nitrogen deposition in driving the observed dynamics. So far, the majority of species appear as "winners" of recent changes, yet "losers" are overrepresented among high-elevation, cold-adapted species with low nutrient demands. In the decades to come, high-alpine species may hence face the double pressure of climatic changes and novel, superior competitors that move up faster than they themselves can escape to even higher elevations.

AB The factors determining gradients of biodiversity are a fundamental yet unresolved topic in ecology. While diversity gradients have been analysed for numerous single taxa, progress towards general explanatory models has been hampered by limitations in the phylogenetic coverage of past studies. By parallel sampling of 25 major plant and animal taxa along a 3.7 km elevational gradient on Mt. Kilimanjaro, we quantify cross-taxon consensus in diversity gradients and evaluate predictors of diversity from single taxa to a multi-taxa community level. While single taxa show complex distribution patterns and respond to different environmental factors, scaling up diversity to the community level leads to an unambiguous support for temperature as the main predictor of species richness in both plants and animals. Our findings illuminate the influence of taxonomic coverage for models of diversity gradients and point to the importance of temperature for diversification and species coexistence in plant and animal communities.

AB The reliable assessment of water quality through water quality monitoring programs (WQMPs) is crucial in order for decision-makers to understand, interpret and use this information in support of their management activities aiming at protecting the resource. The challenge of water quality monitoring has been widely addressed in the literature since the 1940s. However, there is still no generally accepted, holistic and practical strategy to support all phases of WQMPs. The purpose of this paper is to report on the use cases a watershed manager has to address to plan or optimize a WQMP from the challenge of identifying monitoring objectives; selecting sampling sites and water quality parameters; identifying sampling frequencies; considering logistics and resources to the implementation of actions based on information acquired through the WQMP. An inventory and critique of the information, approaches and tools placed at the disposal of watershed managers was proposed to evaluate how the existing information could be integrated in a holistic, user-friendly and evolvable solution. Given the differences in regulatory requirements, water quality standards, geographical and geological differences, land-use variations, and other site specificities, a one-in-all solution is not possible. However, we advance that an intelligent decision support system (IDSS) based on expert knowledge that integrates existing approaches and past research can guide a watershed manager through the process according to his/her site-specific requirements. It is also necessary to tap into local knowledge and to identify the knowledge needs of all the stakeholders through participative approaches based on geographical information systems and adaptive survey-based questionnaires. We believe that future research should focus on developing such participative approaches and further investigate the benefits of IDSS's that can be updated quickly and make it possible for a watershed manager to obtain a timely, holistic view and support for every aspect of planning and optimizing a WQMP.

AB Mid-to-high latitude forests play an important role in the terrestrial carbon cycle, but the representation of photosynthesis in boreal forests by current modelling and observational methods is still challenging. In particular, the applicability of existing satellite-based proxies of greenness to indicate photosynthetic activity is hindered by small annual changes in green biomass of the often evergreen tree population and by the confounding effects of background materials such as snow. As an alternative, satellite measurements of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) can be used as a direct proxy of photosynthetic activity. In this study, the start and end of the photosynthetically active season of the main boreal forests are analysed using spaceborne SIF measurements retrieved from the GOME-2 instrument and compared to that of green biomass, proxied by vegetation indices including the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from MODIS data. We find that photosynthesis and greenness show a similar seasonality in deciduous forests. In high-latitude evergreen needleleaf forests, however, the length of the photosynthetically active period indicated by SIF is up to 6weeks longer than the green biomass changing period proxied by EVI, with SIF showing a start-of-season of approximately 1month earlier than EVI. On average, the photosynthetic spring recovery as signalled by SIF occurs as soon as air temperatures exceed the freezing point (2-3 degrees C) and when the snow on the ground has not yet completely melted. These findings are supported by model data of gross primary production and a number of other studies which evaluated insitu observations of CO2 fluxes, meteorology and the physiological state of the needles. Our results demonstrate the sensitivity of space-based SIF measurements to light-use efficiency of boreal forests and their potential for an unbiased detection of photosynthetic activity even under the challenging conditions interposed by evergreen boreal ecosystems.

AB Aims: Stakeholder engagement is fundamental to comparative effectiveness research (CER), but lacks consistent terminology. This paper aims to define stakeholder engagement and present a conceptual model for involving stakeholders in CER. Materials & methods: The definitions and model were developed from a literature search, expert input and experience with the Center for Comparative Effectiveness Research in Cancer Genomics, a proof-of-concept platform for stakeholder involvement in priority setting and CER study design. Results: Definitions for stakeholder and stakeholder engagement reflect the target constituencies and their role in CER. The 'analytic-deliberative' conceptual model for stakeholder engagement illustrates the inputs, methods and outputs relevant to CER. The model differentiates methods at each stage of the project; depicts the relationship between components; and identifies outcome measures for evaluation of the process. Conclusion: While the definitions and model require testing before being broadly adopted, they are an important foundational step and will be useful for investigators, funders and stakeholder groups interested in contributing to CER.

AB P>1. Understanding the processes by which species sort themselves into communities remains a central puzzle for attempts to maintain biodiversity. It remains unclear whether any single assembly process is generally dominant or whether the influence of contrasting processes varies in a predictable way relative to biotic and abiotic gradients. Abundance-weighted niche overlap between species provides a powerful means of contrasting two major assembly processes - niche complementarity and environmental filtering.
   2. We examined mean overlap for four vegetative functional traits, relative to that expected when abundances were randomly allocated to species co-occurring in experimental plots in a wet meadow. This provided a test of whether any single assembly process prevailed for the meadow as a whole and across all traits. The effects of mowing, fertilization and dominant species removal, and associated gradients of Simpson's dominance and biomass on the niche overlap of plots, were also examined.
   3. Niche overlap was higher than expected at random for three of the four traits studied (height, leaf and stem dry matter content, leaf C:N ratio). However, niche overlap was lower than expected for specific leaf area.
   4. Mowing was the treatment with the greatest effect on both niche overlap and biomass, with overlap significantly lower in the absence of mowing for three of the traits, while biomass was lower in mown plots. For three of the traits there was evidence of a significant decrease in overlap with increasing biomass, but not increasing dominance. None of the significant mowing effects on overlap remained when the effect of biomass had been removed.
   5. Synthesis: These results suggest that the importance of niche differences between species in structuring grassland communities should increase with increasing biomass and decrease with disturbance in grassland communities. They also emphasize that contrasting community assembly processes may occur for different niche axes, even within a single community.

AB DNA barcoding is a technique for identifying organisms based on a short, standardized fragment of genomic DNA. The standardized sequence region is called a DNA barcode because it is like a barcode tag for each taxon. Since the proposition of this concept and the launch of a large project named the Barcode of Life, this simple technique has attracted attention from taxonomists, ecologists, conservation biologists, agriculturists, plant-quarantine officers and others, and the number of studies using the DNA barcode has rapidly increased. The extreme diversity of insects and their economical, epidemiological and agricultural importance have made this group a major target of DNA barcoding. However, there is some controversy about the utility of DNA barcoding. In this review, we present an overview of DNA barcoding and its application to entomology. We also introduce current advances and future implications of this promising technique.

AB Many species are currently experiencing anthropogenically driven environmental changes. Among these changes, increasing noise levels are specifically a problem for species relying on acoustic communication. Recent evidence suggests that some species adjust their acoustic signals to man-made noise. However, it is unknown whether these changes occur through short-term and reversible adjustments by behavioral plasticity or through long-term adaptations by evolutionary change. Using behavioral observations and playback experiments, we show that male reed buntings (Emberiza schoeniclus) adjusted their songs immediately, singing at a higher minimum frequency and at a lower rate when noise levels were high. Our data showed that these changes in singing behavior were short-term adjustments of signal characteristics resulting from behavioral plasticity, rather than a long-term adaptation. However, more males remained unpaired at a noisy location than at a quiet location throughout the breeding season. Thus, phenotypic plasticity enables individuals to respond to environmental changes, but whether these short-term adjustments are beneficial remains to be seen.

AB Carnivores have been used as a model to understand the effects of competition in community structure Behavioral mechanisms that facilitate species coexistence have been poorly explored and may explain the lack of community-wide morphological character displacement in some carnivore assemblages. We use the results of large-scale and intensive camera-trap surveys conducted in the Atlantic Forest of NE Argentina between 2003 and 2008 to describe the spatial patterns of detection and the daily pattern of records of the six wild cat species present in the region (jaguar Panthera onca, puma Puma concolor, ocelot Leopardus pardalis, jaguarundi Puma yagouaroundi, margay Leopardus wiedii, and oncilla Leopardus trigrinus) We use these patterns to generate hypotheses about behavioral differences that may facilitate species coexistence. The larger species were more frequently recorded in the better-protected areas, probably as a result of anthropogenic effects (poaching of cats and their prey). Competitive release from ocelots and jaguarundis may explain why the oncilla and the margay showed the opposite pattern Morphologically similar species had the most contrasting activity patterns, the margay was exclusively nocturnal and the jaguarundi diurnal The other species were cathemeral, but alternated their peaks of activity in relation to the relative order of their body weights The contrasting temporal patterns observed and the ability of pumas and oncillas to adjust their activity patterns to local conditions may facilitate the coexistence of these cat species and explain the lack of character displacement in this assemblage (c) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Background: Subtilisin-like serine proteases play an important role in pathogenic fungi during the penetration and colonization of their hosts. In this study, we perform an evolutionary analysis of the subtilisin-like serine protease genes of subphylum Pezizomycotina to find if there are similar pathogenic mechanisms among the pathogenic fungi with different life styles, which utilize subtilisin-like serine proteases as virulence factors. Within Pezizomycotina, nematode-trapping fungi are unique because they capture soil nematodes using specialized trapping devices. Increasing evidence suggests subtilisin-like serine proteases from nematode-trapping fungi are involved in the penetration and digestion of nematode cuticles. Here we also conduct positive selection analysis on the subtilisin-like serine protease genes from nematode-trapping fungi.
   Results: Phylogenetic analysis of 189 subtilisin-like serine protease genes from Pezizomycotina suggests five strongly-supported monophyletic clades. The subtilisin-like serine protease genes previously identified or presumed as endocellular proteases were clustered into one clade and diverged the earliest in the phylogeny. In addition, the cuticle-degrading protease genes from entomopathogenic and nematode-parasitic fungi were clustered together, indicating that they might have overlapping pathogenic mechanisms against insects and nematodes. Our experimental bioassays supported this conclusion. Interestingly, although they both function as cuticle-degrading proteases, the subtilisin-like serine protease genes from nematode-trapping fungi and nematode-parasitic fungi were not grouped together in the phylogenetic tree. Our evolutionary analysis revealed evidence for positive selection on the subtilisin-like serine protease genes of the nematode-trapping fungi.
   Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the evolution of subtilisin-like serine protease genes in Pezizomycotina. Pezizomycotina subtilisins most likely evolved from endocellular to extracellular proteases. The entomopathogenic and nematode-parasitic fungi likely share similar properties in parasitism. In addition, our data provided better understanding about the duplications and subsequent functional divergence of subtilisin-like serine protease genes in Pezizomycotina. The evidence of positive selection detected in the subtilisin-like serine protease genes of nematode-trapping fungi in the present study suggests that the subtilisin-like serine proteases may have played important roles during the evolution of pathogenicity of nematode-trapping fungi against nematodes.

AB Recent developments have highlighted the importance of forest amount at large spatial scales and of matrix quality for ecological processes in remnants. These developments, in turn, suggest the potential for reducing biodiversity loss through the maintenance of a high percentage of forest combined with sensitive management of anthropogenic areas. We conducted a multi-taxa survey to evaluate the potential for biodiversity maintenance in an Atlantic forest landscape that presented a favorable context from a theoretical perspective (high proportion of mature forest partly surrounded by structurally complex matrices). We sampled ferns, butterflies, frogs, lizards, bats, small mammals and birds in interiors and edges of large and small mature forest remnants and two matrices (second-growth forests and shade cacao plantations), as well as trees in interiors of small and large remnants. By considering richness, abundance and composition of forest specialists and generalists, we investigated the biodiversity value of matrix habitats (comparing them with interiors of large remnants for all groups except tree), and evaluated area (for all groups) and edge effects (for all groups except trees) in mature forest remnants. our results suggest that in landscapes comprising high amounts of mature forest and low contrasting matrices: (1) shade cacao plantations and second-growth forests harbor an appreciable number of forest specialists; (2) most forest specialist assemblages are not affected by area or edge effects, while most generalist assemblages proliferate at edges of small remnants. Nevertheless, differences in tree assemblages, especially among smaller trees, Suggest that observed patterns are unlikely to be stable over time. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO BIOLOGY LETTERS

DT Article
DE global climate models; grid size sensitivity analysis; species range
ID RESOLUTION; IMPROVE; SHIFTS
AB Predictions of future species' ranges under climate change are needed for conservation planning, for which species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used. However, global climate model-based (GCM) output grids can bias the area identified as suitable when these are used as SDM predictor variables, because GCM outputs, typically at least 50X50 km, are biologically coarse. We tested the assumption that species ranges can be equally well portrayed in SDMs operating on base data of different grid sizes by comparing SDM performance statistics and area selected by four SDMs run at seven grid sizes, for nine species of contrasting range size. Area selected was disproportionately larger for SDMs run on larger grid sizes, indicating a cut-off point above which model results were less reliable. Up to 2.89 times more species range area was selected by SDMs operating on grids above 50X50 km, compared to SDMs operating at 1 km(2). Spatial congruence between areas selected as range also diverged as grid size increased, particularly for species with ranges between 20 000 and 90 000 km(2). These results indicate the need for caution when using such data to plan future protected areas, because an overly large predicted range could lead to inappropriate reserve location selection.

AB Stream invertebrate communities are the product of multiple-scale habitat filters, and a major goal in community ecology is to determine which scales most influence the relationships between habitat and community structure. We analyzed the relationships between habitat and the functional structure of invertebrate communities at 3 spatial scales (microhabitat, stream reach, basin), using 264 samples collected from 38 stream reaches in 2 basins in France. The habitat was described in terms of hydraulic conditions (Froude number), substrate size, and benthic particulate organic matter. The functional structure of the invertebrate communities was described using 60 categories of 12 biological traits. Relationships between habitat and traits were significant for 96 of 180 tests (r(2) less than or equal to 26%) at the microhabitat scale (within reaches). Relationships between habitat and traits were significant for 46 of 180 tests (r(2) less than or equal to 34%) at the reach scale (within basins), and the effects of habitat variables on traits did not differ between the 2 basins. Invertebrate traits differed between basins in 34 of 60 trait categories (r(2) less than or equal to 62%). Relationships between habitat and traits were consistent between the microhabitat and reach scales for all traits except body flexibility, number of reproductive cycles/y, and respiration patterns. At both scales, maximum size, body form, mode of attachment to the substrate, feeding habits, reproduction, lifespan, and strategies of dissemination were significantly correlated with habitat variables, especially hydraulics. These results illustrate adaptation to habitat characteristics in terms of resistance to drag and foraging strategies. However, overall differences between basins were inconsistent with patterns observed at smaller scales. In summary, the functional variability of invertebrate communities in stream reaches depended largely on microhabitat filters but also on other filters prevailing at the reach or larger scales.

AB Several recent studies have claimed to present experimental evidence from synthesised plant communities in which diversity was varied as a treatment that diversity reduces community invasibility by other plant species. This type of result contrasts from that of many observational studies which find diversity and invasibility to be positively correlated in nature, but some recent literature has claimed that these observational studies are confounded by extrinsic covarying factors while experimental studies are not. In this article I evaluate each of eight experiments from six recent publications in which the effect of varying plant diversity on the success of invasive species was investigated. In each ca se that invasibility was identified by the authors as being adversely affected by plant species richness, the result can be explained by factors that covaried with diversity in the experiment, most notably as a consequence of "sampling effect" (in which the most competitive species or species combination in the total species pool has a greater probability of occurring as species richness is increased), or through the incorrect use of statistical techniques. It is proposed that the apparent discrepancy between the results of many observational and experimental studies at least in grasslands is because: (1) in observational studies competitive dominant species are often associated with the most productive plots, and these dominants both reduce diversity through competitive exclusion of subordinates and competitively suppress invasive species; and (2) in recent experimental studies "sampling effect" results in the most competitive species (and therefore those most likely to suppress the invader) occurring with greater frequency as diversity is increased. Both observational and experimental studies therefore point to the role of competitive dominants in reducing invasibility, and in both situations species richness of the plant community need not be invoked as an explanation for the results.

AB Annual cropping systems consist of a shifting mosaic of habitats that vary through time in their availability and suitability to insect pests. Agroecosystem instability results from changes that occur within a season with crop planting, development, and harvest. Further instability results from continuous alterations in biotic and abiotic insect life system components and from agricultural inputs. Changes to agroecosystems occur across seasons with changing agricultural practices, changing cropping patterns, and technological innovations. Much of this instability is a result of events unconnected with pest management.
   The abilities of polyphagous pest species to move among and utilize different habitat patches in response to changes in suitability enable the pests to exploit unstable cropping systems. These pest characteristics determine the location and timing of damaging populations. Habitat suitability is influenced by plant species and cultivar, crop phenology, and agricultural inputs. Pest movement is affected by a suite of intrinsic factors, such as population age structure and mobility, and extrinsic factors, including weather systems and habitat distribution.
   The life systems of three selected polyphagous pests are presented to demonstrate how an understanding of such systems in agricultural ecosystems improves our ability to predict and hence manage these populations.

AB Hybridization is an evolutionary phenomenon that has fascinated biologists for centuries. Prior to the advent of whole-genome sequencing, it was clear that hybridization had played a role in the evolutionary history of many extant taxa, particularly plants. The extent to which hybridization has contributed to the evolution of Earth's biodiversity has, however, been the topic of much debate. Analyses of whole genomes are providing further insight into this evolutionary problem. Recent studies have documented ancient hybridization in a diverse array of taxa including mammals, birds, fish, fungi, and insects. Evidence for adaptive introgression is being documented in an increasing number of systems, though demonstrating the adaptive function of introgressed genomic regions remains difficult. And finally, several new homoploid hybrid speciation events have been reported. Here we review the current state of the field and specifically evaluate the additional insights gained from having access to whole-genome data and the challenges that remain with respect to understanding the evolutionary relevance and frequency of ancient hybridization, adaptive introgression, and hybrid speciation in nature.

AB The majority of the world's terrestrial large carnivores have undergone substantial range contractions and many of these species are currently threatened with extinction. However, there has been little effort to fully quantify the extent of large carnivore range contractions, which hinders our ability to understand the roles and relative drivers of such trends. Here we present and analyse a newly constructed and comprehensive set of large carnivore range contraction maps. We reveal the extent to which ranges have contracted since historical times and identify regions and biomes where range contractions have been particularly large. In summary, large carnivores that have experienced the greatest range contractions include the red wolf (Canis rufus) (greater than 99%), Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis) (99%), tiger (Panthera tigris) (95%) and lion (Panthera leo) (94%). In general, the greatest range contractions occurred in Southeastern Asia and Africa. Motivated by the ecological importance of intact large carnivore guilds, we also examined the spatial extent of intact large carnivore guilds both for the entire world and regionally. We found that intact carnivore guilds occupy just 34% of the world's land area. This compares to 96% in historic times. Spatial modelling of range contractions showed that contractions were significantly more likely in regions with high rural human population density, cattle density or cropland. Our results offer new insights into how best to prevent further range contractions for the world's largest carnivores, which will assist efforts to conserve these species and their important ecological effects.

AB Temporal environmental fluctuations, such as seasonality, exert strong controls on biodiversity. While the effects of seasonality are well known, the predictability of fluctuations across years may influence seasonality in ways that are less well understood. The ability of a habitat to support unique, non-nested assemblages of species at different times of the year should depend on both seasonality (occurrence of events at specific periods of the year) and predictability (the reliability of event recurrence) of characteristic ecological conditions. Drawing on tools from wavelet analysis and information theory, we developed a framework for quantifying both seasonality and predictability of habitats, and applied this using global long-term rainfall data. Our analysis predicted that temporal beta diversity should be maximized in highly predictable and highly seasonal climates, and that low degrees of seasonality, predictability, or both would lower diversity in characteristic ways. Using stream invertebrate communities as a case study, we demonstrated that temporal species diversity, as exhibited by community turnover, was determined by a balance between temporal environmental variability (seasonality) and the reliability of this variability (predictability). Communities in highly seasonal mediterranean environments exhibited strong oscillations in community structure, with turnover from one unique community type to another across seasons, whereas communities in aseasonal New Zealand environments fluctuated randomly. Understanding the influence of seasonal and other temporal scales of environmental oscillations on diversity is not complete without a clear understanding of their predictability, and our framework provides tools for examining these trends at a variety of temporal scales, seasonal and beyond. Given the uncertainty of future climates, seasonality and predictability are critical considerations for both basic science and management of ecosystems (e.g., dam operations, bioassessment) spanning gradients of climatic variability.

AB Biochar can increase the stable C content of soil. However, studies on the longer-term role of plant-soil-biochar interactions and the consequent changes to native soil organic carbon (SOC) are lacking. Periodic (CO2)-C-13 pulse labelling of ryegrass was used to monitor belowground C allocation, SOC priming, and stabilization of root-derived C for a 15-month period-commencing 8.2 years after biochar (Eucalyptus saligna, 550 degrees C) was amended into a subtropical ferralsol. We found that field-aged biochar enhanced the belowground recovery of new root-derived C (C-13) by 20%, and facilitated negative rhizosphere priming (it slowed SOC mineralization by 5.5%, that is, 46 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)). Retention of root-derived 13C in the stable organo-mineral fraction (<53 mu m) was also increased (6%, P < 0.05). Through synchrotron-based spectroscopic analysis of bulk soil, field-aged biochar and microaggregates (< 250 mu m), we demonstrate that biochar accelerates the formation of microaggregates via organo-mineral interactions, resulting in the stabilization and accumulation of SOC in a rhodic ferralsol.

AB Oil palm, currently the world's main vegetable oil crop, is characterised by a large productivity and a long life span (>= 25 years). Peak oil yields of 12tha(-1) yr(-1) have been achieved in small plantations, and maximum theoretical yields as calculated with simulation models are 18.5 t oil ha(-1) yr(-1), yet average productivity worldwide has stagnated around 3 t oil ha(-1) yr(-1). Considering the threat of expansion into valuable rainforests, it is important that the factors underlying these existing yield gaps are understood and, where feasible, addressed. In this review, we present an overview of the available data on yield determining, yield-limiting, and yield-reducing factors in oil palm; the effects of these factors on yield, as measured in case studies or calculated using computer models; and the underlying plant-physiological mechanisms. We distinguish four production levels: the potential, water-limited, nutrient-limited, and the actual yield. The potential yield over a plantation lifetime is determined by incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), temperature, atmospheric CO2 concentration and planting material, assuming optimum plantation establishment, planting density (120-150 palms per hectares), canopy management (30-60 leaves depending on palm age), pollination, and harvesting. Water-limited yields in environments with water deficits >400 mm year(-1) can be less than one-third of the potential yield, depending on additional factors such as temperature, wind speed, soil texture, and soil depth. Nutrient limited yields of less than 50% of the potential yield have been recorded when nitrogen or potassium were not applied. Actual yields are influenced by yield-reducing factors such as unsuitable ground vegetation, pests, and diseases, and may be close to zero in case of severe infestations. Smallholders face particular constraints such as the use of counterfeit seed and insufficient fertiliser application. Closing yield gaps in existing plantations could increase global production by 15-20 Mt oil yr(-1), which would limit the drive for further area expansion at a global scale. To increase yields in existing and future plantations in a sustainable way, all production factors mentioned need to be understood and addressed. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB For quantifying and modelling of landscape patterns, the patch matrix model (PMM) and the gradient model (GM) are fundamental concepts of landscape ecology. While the PMM model has been the backbone for our advances in landscape ecology, it may also hamper truly universal insights into process-pattern relationships.
   The PMM describes landscape structures as a mosaic of discretely delineated homogenous areas. This requires simplifications and assumptions which may even result in errors which propagate through subsequent analyses and may reduce our ability to understand effects of landscape structure on ecological processes. Alternative approaches to represent landscape structure should therefore be evaluated. The GM represents continuous surface characteristics without arbitrary vegetation or land-use classification and therefore does not require delineation of discrete areas with sharp boundaries. The GM therefore lends itself to be a more realistic representation of a particular surface characteristic. In the paper PMM and GM are compared regarding their prospects and limitations. Suggestions are made regarding the potential use and implementation of both approaches for process-pattern analysis.
   The ecological and anthropogenic process itself and its characteristics under investigation is decisive for: (i) the selection of discrete and/or continuous indicators, (ii) the type of the quantitative pattern analysis approach to be used (PMM/GM) and (iii) the data and the scale required in the analysis. Process characteristics and their effects on pattern characteristics in space and time are decisive for the applicability of the PMM or of the GM approach. A low hemeroby (high naturalness and low human pressure on landscapes) allows for high internal-heterogeneity in space and over time within patterns. Such landscapes can be captured with the GM approach. A high hemeroby reduces heterogeneity in space and time within patterns. For such landscapes we recommend the PMM model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB We present Procrustean Approach to Cophylogeny (PACo), a novel statistical tool to test for congruence between phylogenetic trees, or between phylogenetic distance matrices of associated taxa. Unlike previous tests, PACo evaluates the dependence of one phylogeny upon the other. This makes it especially appropriate to test the classical coevolutionary model that assumes that parasites that spend part of their life in or on their hosts track the phylogeny of their hosts. The new method does not require fully resolved phylogenies and allows for multiple host-parasite associations. PACo produces a Procrustes superimposition plot enabling a graphical assessment of the fit of the parasite phylogeny onto the host phylogeny and a goodness-of-fit statistic, whose significance is established by randomization of the host-parasite association data. The contribution of each individual host-parasite association to the global fit is measured by means of jackknife estimation of their respective squared residuals and confidence intervals associated to each host-parasite link. We carried out different simulations to evaluate the performance of PACo in terms of Type I and Type II errors with respect to two similar published tests. In most instances, PACo performed at least as well as the other tests and showed higher overall statistical power. In addition, the jackknife estimation of squared residuals enabled more elaborate validations about the nature of individual links than the ParaFitLink1 test of the program ParaFit. In order to demonstrate how it can be used in real biological situations, we applied PACo to two published studies using a script written in the public-domain statistical software R.

Here, we present results on the physiological response of young Norway spruce trees exposed to lethal drought stress. We applied three levels of drought treatment (control, dryingrewetting, complete drought) and monitored relevant physiological functions and processes of carbon and water relations at high temporal resolution until tree death occurred. Only trees subjected to continuous drought died in our experiment. Trees subjected to dryingrewetting cycles consistently recovered in their ability to transport water, indicating that these trees do not suffer permanent damage to the hydraulic system. In all cases, drought reduced carbon assimilation, caused changes in carbon allocation and appeared to have severely reduced phloem functioning and carbon translocation. Structural growth was sacrificed for carbon investment in maintenance respiration and osmoprotection. Severe drought caused trees to rely on stored carbon reserves but, in contrast to above-ground tissues, only root carbon pools were strongly reduced when trees died. Our results indicate that drought-induced changes in carbon allocation, use and transport differ between above- and below-ground tissues in trees. While root death may have been caused by carbon depletion, this was definitely not the case in above-ground tissues. Our findings indicate that mortality mechanisms are not defined at the organism level but rather within tree compartments.

AB Aim Elevational gradients offer an outstanding opportunity to assess factors determining patterns of species richness, but along single transects potential explanatory factors often covary, making it difficult to distinguish between competing hypotheses. Many previous studies on plants have interpreted their results as supporting the mid-domain effect (MDE) as a major determinant of species richness, even when climatic factors showed similarly high explanatory power. We compared fern species richness along 20 elevational transects to quantify the relative contribution of climate and MDE as drivers of elevational richness patterns.
   Location Twenty transects world-wide.
   Methods Ferns were sampled in 1039 plots of 400-2500 m(2) each. Mean annual precipitation and temperature, epiphytic bryophyte cover (as a proxy for air humidity) and MDE predictions were included as independent variables. For each transect, we calculated multiple linear models and partitioned the variance to assess the relative contribution of the independent variables, selecting the most parsimonious models based on Akaike weights and multi-model inference.
   Results Along most individual gradients, nearly all variance of fern species richness that could be attributed to either space or MDEs was collinear with climatic factors. Yet, the comparison across transects showed that elevational richness patterns are most parsimoniously accounted for by climatic conditions, especially by low water availability at low elevations and in dry regions in general, and by low temperatures at high elevations and in extra-tropical regions.
   Main conclusions Fern species richness is most closely related to climatic factors, and while MDE, surface area and metapopulation processes may somewhat modify the patterns, their importance has been overstated in the past. Future research challenges include determining whether the richness-climate relationship reflects: (1) a direct relationship through the physiological tolerance of the plants, (2) an indirect influence of climate on ecosystem productivity, or (3) an evolutionary legacy of longer or faster diversification processes under certain climatic conditions.

AB There has been considerable recent interest concerning the impact of climate change on a wide range of taxa. However, little is known about how the biogeographic affinities of taxa may affect their responses to these impacts. Our main aim was to study how predicted climate change will affect the distribution of 28 European bat species grouped by their biogeographic patterns as determined by a spatial Principal Component Analysis. Using presence-only modelling techniques and climatic data (minimum temperature, average temperature, precipitation, humidity and daily temperature range) for four different climate change scenarios (IPCC scenarios ranging from the most extreme A1FI, A2, B2 to the least severe, B1), we predict the potential geographic distribution of bat species in Europe grouped according to their biogeographic patterns for the years 2020-2030, 2050-2060 and 2090-2100. Biogeographic patterns exert a great influence on a species' response to climate change. Bat species more associated with colder climates, hence northern latitudes, could be more severely affected with some extinctions predicted by the end of the century. The Mediterranean and Temperate groups seem to be more tolerant of temperature increases, however, their projections varied considerably under different climate change scenarios. Scenario A1FI was clearly the most detrimental for European bat diversity, with several extinctions and declines in occupied area predicted for several species. The B scenarios were less damaging and even predicted that some species could increase their geographical ranges. However, all models only took into account climatic envelopes whereas available habitat and species interactions will also probably play an important role in delimiting future distribution patterns. The models may therefore generate 'best case' predictions about future changes in the distribution of European bats.

AB The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a method of biological control whereby millions of factory reared sterile male insects are released into the field. This technique is commonly used to combat the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata, Diptera: Tephritidae). Sterile medfly males are less competent in attracting and mating with wild females, a property commonly linked to the irradiation process responsible for the sterilization. As bacteria are important partners in the fly's life cycle, we used molecular analytical methods to study the community structure of the gut microbiota in irradiated male medflies. We find that the sterilizing irradiation procedure affects the gut bacterial community structure of the Mediterranean fruit fly. Although the Enterobacteriaceae family remains the dominant bacterial group present in the gut, the levels of Klebsiella species decreases significantly in the days after sterilization. In addition, we detected substantial differences in some bacterial species between the mass rearing strain Vienna 8 and the wild strain. Most notable among these are the increased levels of the potentially pathogenic species Pseudomonas in the industrial strain. Testing the hypothesis that regenerating the original microbiota community could result in enhanced competitiveness of the sterile flies, we found that the addition of the bacterial species Klebsiella oxytoca to the postirradiation diet enables colonization of these bacteria in the gut while resulting in decreased levels of the Pseudomonas sp. Feeding on diets containing bacteria significantly improved sterile male performance in copulatory tests. Further studies will determine the feasibility of bacterial amelioration in SIT operations.

AB The principal goal in early missions of satellite-borne visible spectral radiometry (ocean colour) was to create synoptic fields of phytoplankton biomass indexed as concentration of chlorophyll-a. In the context of climate change, a major application of the results has been in the modelling of primary production and the ocean carbon cycle. It is now recognised that a partition of the marine autotrophic pool into a suite of phytoplankton functional types, each type having a characteristic role in the biogeochemical cycle of the ocean, would increase our understanding of the role of phytoplankton in the global carbon cycle. At the same time, new methods have been emerging that use visible spectral radiometry to map some of the phytoplankton functional types.

TI Short- and long-term changes in right whale calling behavior: The

AB The impact of anthropogenic noise on marine mammals has been an area of increasing concern over the past two decades. Most low-frequency anthropogenic noise in the ocean comes from commercial shipping which has contributed to an increase in ocean background noise over the past 150 years. The long-term impacts of these changes on marine mammals are not well understood. This paper describes both short- and long-term behavioral changes in calls produced by the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) and South Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena australis) in the presence of increased low-frequency noise. Right whales produce calls with a higher average fundamental frequency and they call at a lower rate in high noise conditions, possibly in response to masking from low-frequency noise. The long-term changes have occurred within the known lifespan of individual whales, indicating that a behavioral change, rather than selective pressure, has resulted in the observed differences. This study provides evidence of a behavioral change in sound production of right whales that is correlated with increased noise levels and indicates that right whales may shift call frequency to compensate for increased band-limited background noise.

AB Migration tends to oppose the effects of divergent natural selection among populations. Numerous theoretical and empirical studies have demonstrated that this migration-selection balance constrains genetic divergence among populations. In contrast, relatively few studies have examined immigration's effects on fitness and natural selection within recipient populations. By constraining local adaptation, migration can lead to reduced fitness, known as a "migration load," which in turn causes persistent natural selection. We develop a simple two-island model of migration-selection balance that, although very general, also reflects the natural history of Timema cristinae walking-stick insects that inhabit two host plant species that favor different cryptic color patterns. We derive theoretical predictions about how migration rates affect the level of maladaptation within populations (measured as the frequency of less-cryptic color-pattern morphs), which in turn determines the selection differential (the within-generation morph frequency change). Using data on color morph frequencies from 25 natural populations, we confirm previous results showing that maladaptation is higher in populations receiving more immigrants. We then present novel evidence that this increased maladaptation leads to larger selection differentials, consistent with our model. Our results provide comparative evidence that immigration elevates the variance in fitness, which in turn leads to larger selection differentials, consistent with Fisher's Theorem of Natural Selection. However, we also find evidence that recurrent adult migration between parapatric populations may tend to obscure the effects of selection.

AB We measured net ecosystem CO, exchange (NEE) using the eddy covariance (EC) technique for 4 years at adjoining old field (OF), planted pine (PP) and hardwood forest (HW) ecosystems in the Duke Forest, NC. To compute annual sums of NEE and its components - gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (RE) - different 'flux partitioning' models (FPMs) were tested and the resulting C flux estimates were compared against published estimates from C budgeting approaches, inverse models, physiology-based forward models, chamber respiration measurements, and constraints on assimilation based on sapflux and evapotranspiration measurements. Our analyses demonstrate that the more complex FPMs, particularly the 'non-rectangular hyperbolic method', consistently produced the most reasonable C flux estimates. Of the FPMs that use nighttime data to estimate RE, one that parameterized an exponential model over short time periods generated predictions that were closer to expected flux values. To explore how much 'new information' was injected into the data by the FPMs, we used formal information theory methods and computed the Shannon entropy for: (I) the probability density, to assess alterations to the flux measurement distributions, and (2) the wavelet energy spectra, to assess alterations to the internal autocorrelation within the NEE time series. Based on this joint analysis, gap-filling had little impact on the IC of daytime data, but gap-filling significantly altered nighttime data in both the probability and wavelet spectral domains.

AB Using a spatially explicit cellular automaton model with local competition, we investigate the potential for varied levels of competitive intransitivity (i.e., nonhierarchical competition) to promote species coexistence. As predicted, on average, increased levels of intransitivity result in more sustained coexistence within simulated communities, although the outcome of competition also becomes increasingly unpredictable. Interestingly, even a moderate degree of intransitivity within a community can promote coexistence, in terms of both the length of time until the first competitive exclusion and the number of species remaining in the community after 500 simulated generations. These results suggest that modest levels of intransitivity in nature, such as those that are thought to be characteristic of plant communities, can contribute to coexistence and, therefore, community-scale biodiversity. We explore a potential connection between competitive intransitivity and neutral theory, whereby competitive intransitivity may represent an important mechanism for "ecological equivalence."

   MIST-NETS; RESPONSES
AB 1. There is an urgent need to understand the impacts of anthropogenic habitat disturbance on biodiversity in tropical forests, but no consensus has yet emerged. We reviewed the literature for the most frequently studied taxon (birds, 37 studies) and found that increased and decreased diversity in response to disturbance (selective logging and shifting agriculture) were reported with approximately equal frequency.
   2. The spatial scale at which studies were carried out significantly affected the reported response to disturbance: studies where disturbed and undisturbed habitats were sampled at large spatial scales were more likely to report increased diversity following disturbance, whereas studies that sampled habitats at small spatial scales were more likely to report decreased diversity. These results were not a consequence of sampling method: we divided the studies into those using capture methods and those using observation methods and the same result was obtained when the analysis was restricted to only those studies using observation methods.
   3. Previously, we have shown that reported impacts of disturbance on Lepidoptera are also affected by the spatial scale of study. We reviewed the Lepidoptera literature published since then and showed that all 12 new studies conformed to the predicted pattern.
   4. While sampling scale significantly affected the reported responses of both birds and Lepidoptera, there were opposite effects of scale in the two taxa: large-scale bird studies and small-scale Lepidoptera studies were more likely to report increased diversity following disturbance. Bird studies were generally carried out at larger spatial scales than those of Lepidoptera and these opposite impacts of scale were probably due to a non-linear effect of habitat disturbance on habitat heterogeneity at different spatial scales.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The rapid loss and degradation of tropical forests means that an understanding of the general patterns of responses of species to habitat disturbance is urgently needed. However, there has been little discussion of the most appropriate methods to ensure comparability of results between studies. Data presented here indicate that the spatial scale of sampling chosen in studies has a marked effect on the results obtained, and future studies need to account for this by examining explicitly the effects of disturbance at different spatial scales. The effect of spatial scale differs between taxa, and this may explain why the search for indicator taxa of disturbance effects has so far proved elusive.

   FUNCTION
AB 1. Here we classify selected European hydrophytes into 'attribute groups' based on the possession of homogenous sets of characteristics, and explore the correspondence between these attribute groups, or individual attributes, and habitat use.
   2. Non-hierarchical clustering was used to assign 120 species to twenty groups based on a matrix of categorical scores for literature- and field-derived information covering seventeen intrinsic morphological and life-history traits. Subdivision of some of these traits produced a total of 58 attributes (i.e. modalities). The robustness of this classification was confirmed by a high rate of reclassification (92%) under multiple discriminant analysis (MDA). The phylogenetic contribution was explored using ordination methods with taxonomy at family level acting as a covariable.
   3. Our approach differed from earlier classifications based on growth or life form because we regarded growth form plasticity as a property of the species and its range of growing conditions, rather than of each individual population, and we considered additional (e.g. regenerative) traits. However, some conventional life form groups were preserved (i.e. utricularids, isoetids, hydrocharids and lemnids).
   4. Some parallels existed with established theory on terrestrial plant growth strategies, but we used strictly intrinsic attributes relevant specifically to hydrophytes and our groups could not be decomposed into three or four primary strategies. Only finer levels of partitioning appear to be of fundamental and applied ecological relevance in hydrophytes.
   5. A principal components analysis ordination based on 26 attributes related to physical habitat utilization separated species and their attribute groups along axes relating to: (a) flow, substratum grade and organic matter content, scour frequency, and sedimentation; and Cb) depth, water level stability and biotic disturbance. A MDA applied to species ordination scores indicated only a modest overall correspondence between attribute groups and habitat use (54% correct reclassification). Poor reclassification was the result of intergroup overlap (indicating alternative sets of attributes for a given habitat) or high intragroup variance in habitat utilization (indicating commonality of attributes between different habitats). These results are interpreted in terms of trade-offs between resistance and resilience traits,'functional plasticity' in traits, phylogenetic dependence in some groups and methodological constraints. The predictive potential of hydrophyte groups and their limitations are discussed.
   6. Redundancy analysis revealed a highly significant correlation between traits and habitat use (P < 0.01). Our attribute matrix explained 72% of variation in physical habitat use with eight attributes (i.e. turions, anchored emergent leaves, high or low body flexibility, high root:shoot biomass ratio, free-floating surface or free-floating submerged growth form, and annual life history) explaining half of this variation.
   7. Most attributes were mapped in accordance with habitat template predictions, although tests were confounded by the underlying correlation between spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The main features were: (a) a trade-off between resistance-type traits (related to stream Lining, flexibility and anchorage) in more spatially heterogenous riverine and littoral zone habitats, and resilience type traits (i.e. turions, very small body size and free-floating growth forms) in spatially simple, rarely disturbed habitats, such as backwaters and canals; and (b) a shift from high investment competitive traits with a low reproductive output in deep stable habitats to classically ruderal and desiccation resistance traits in shallow fluctuating habitats.

AB A review is given of recent work on latitudinal gradients in species diversity and their explanations, including Rapoport's rule. Energy input. measured by temperature or potential evapotranspiration, correlates best with the gradients. However, such a correlation does not "explain" them. It merely suggests explanations. which may be either different ceilings to diversity set by different energy levels under equilibrium conditions. recent historical events, or a gradient in effective evolutionary time (determined by speed of evolution directly driven by temperature, and by relative constancy of conditions over evolutionary time) under non-equilibrium conditions. Marine parasites are used to show that equilibrium conditions are the exception rather than the rule among animals. It is concluded that latitudinal gradients in species diversity result from a gradient in effective evolutionary time modulated by several other factors. Dispersal abilities of many marine invertebrates are likely to be greater at low than at high latitudes, suggesting an opposite Rappoport effect.

AB 1. We explored the mechanisms determining age and size at juvenile migration in brown trout Salmo trutta L. A Cs-133 tracer methodology was used to estimate food consumption of juvenile brown trout in a Norwegian stream, and the energy budgets of early migrants and stream residents were compared.
   2. Fast-growing brown trout migrated to the lake earlier and at a smaller body size than slower-growing individuals. The 2+ migrants were significantly larger than those that remained 1 or more years longer in the stream. The 3+ migrants were significantly larger than the 2+ migrants. Some fast-growing males matured in the stream, whereas all females left the stream before maturing sexually.
   3. The food consumption and the energy budgets for 2+ migrants were more than four times higher than those of the resident 2+ fish. Total energy allocated to growth was also higher among migrants, and the total metabolic costs were five times higher among migrants than among resident fish.
   4. The proportional energy allocation to growth among the 2+ migrants was much lower (about half) than that of those remaining longer in the stream. The reduction in the proportion of energy available for growth from age 1+ to 2+ was larger among migrants (88%) than among resident fish (68%). Reduction in the proportion of energy available for growth is a probable explanation for why migrations are initiated at age 2.
   5. Our study supports the hypothesis that fast-growing individuals shift their niche earlier and at a smaller body size than slower-growing individuals because they maintain higher metabolic rates and are energetically constrained at a younger age by limited food resources than slow growers.

AB 1. Patterns of macroinvertebrate community composition were examined in         streams within a 40000-kM2   catchment in central Michigan, U.S.A., to identify the major environmental gradients influencing community variation. Agriculture and associated clay and sandy soils predominated in much of the region.
   2. Eighty macroinvertebrate taxa were collected from stream surveys conducted during May and August 1990. Community composition varied primarily by the proportions of Plecoptera and Ephemeroptera. Benthic communities from the heaviest agricultural zones were most different from those at other sites.
   3. Chemical composition among the sites varied most in relation to nutrients (NH3, NO3, PO4). Other parameters were relatively similar. Physical characteristics of the sites were scored in six habitat categories: (i) substrate characteristics, (ii) instream cover, (iii) channel morphology, (iv) riparian zone and stream-bank conditions, (v) riffle/run quality, (vi) pool quality. Most physical habitat scores were lowest in the intense agriculture zones.
   4. The relative importance of physical and chemical variables in explaining variation in macroinvertebrate communities was quantified using canonical correspondence analysis. Substrate characteristics were most important in both surveys. Significant correlations (P < 0.05 and P < 0. 10) were observed between substrate quality and total numbers of Ephemeropteran, Plecopteran, and Trichopteran taxa. These relationships reflected correlations from sites in the clay soil-type region (P < 0.01 and P < 0. 10) which contrasted with non-significant results from the less impacted, sandy soil-type region.
   5. Effective stream restoration efforts in this region will require the alteration of local land-use activities that influence the physical habitat. Further development of empirical relationships between catchment activities and substrate and channel characteristics within natural geomorphic regions is essential for the evaluation of restoration projects.

AB 1. Nine metapopulations of the butterfly Plebejus argus were mapped in North Wales in 1983 and 1990. The metapopulations occurred in three biotopes; five were in heathland, one in mossland and three in limestone grassland.
   2. Within metapopulations, local distributions of the butterfly corresponded to the spatial distributions of suitable habitat: P. argus was able to colonize virtually all suitable habitat patches that were less than 1 km from existing, populated patches.
   3. In contrast, the regional distribution was constrained by the inability of the butterfly to colonize suitable habitat that was further than a few kilometres from existing metapopulations; some of these sites are now populated by P. argus following successful introductions.
   4. Turnover (extinctions and colonizations) of patches within metapopulations was relatively high in small patches. Turnover was also greater in heathland than in limestone: the principal reason for this was that patches of habitat were usually smaller in heathland, and small patches had high turnover in both biotopes.
   5. Some patches changed in shape and size. Turnover of area was greater in heathland, where the butterfly occupies relatively transient successional habitats, than in limestone grassland where the habitat can be maintained in a suitable condition for longer periods.
   6. The persistence of this spatially dynamic species depends on some suitable habitat being continuously available within relatively large areas of biotope. If the continuity is broken and a whole metapopulation becomes extinct, natural recolonization is unlikely to occur if the nearest P. argus source is more than a few kilometres away.

AB Numerous biases are believed to affect the scientific literature, but their actual prevalence across disciplines is unknown. To gain a comprehensive picture of the potential imprint of bias in science, we probed for the most commonly postulated bias-related patterns and risk factors, in a large random sample of meta-analyses taken from all disciplines. The magnitude of these biases varied widely across fields and was overall relatively small. However, we consistently observed a significant risk of small, early, and highly cited studies to overestimate effects and of studies not published in peer-reviewed journals to underestimate them. We also found at least partial confirmation of previous evidence suggesting that US studies and early studies might report more extreme effects, although these effects were smaller and more heterogeneously distributed across meta-analyses and disciplines. Authors publishing at high rates and receiving many citations were, overall, not at greater risk of bias. However, effect sizes were likely to be overestimated by early-career researchers, those working in small or long-distance collaborations, and those responsible for scientific misconduct, supporting hypotheses that connect bias to situational factors, lack of mutual control, and individual integrity. Some of these patterns and risk factors might have modestly increased in intensity over time, particularly in the social sciences. Our findings suggest that, besides one being routinely cautious that published small, highly-cited, and earlier studies may yield inflated results, the feasibility and costs of interventions to attenuate biases in the literature might need to be discussed on a discipline-specific and topic-specific basis.

   FRAMEWORK; DESIGN; SYSTEM; CHAINS
AB Supplier selection is an important strategic decision in the context of supply chain management. Existing literature on the subject of supplier selection is focused on evaluating primary (e.g., cost, quality, lead time) and green (e.g., CO2 emission, environmental practices) criteria. However, the concept of supplier resilience has recently emerged due to advent of competitive and global supply chains (and the operational and disruptive risks to which they are exposed). Several resilience-based supplier selection criteria are developed with respect to absorptive, adaptive, and restorative capacities. This paper further proposes a Bayesian network (BN), a paradigm that effectively models the causal relationships among variables but that has not been used in the context of supplier evaluation and selection, to quantify the appropriateness of suppliers across primary, green, and resilience criteria. Some benefits of the BN paradigm, including an ability to handle expert evidence and to perform sensitivity and propagation analyses, are demonstrated with an initial illustrative example of three suppliers.

AB In a rapidly changing world, ecology has the potential to move from empirical and conceptual stages to application and management issues. It is now possible to make large-scale predictions up to continental or global scales, ranging from the future distribution of biological diversity to changes in ecosystem functioning and services. With these recent developments, ecology has a historical opportunity to become a major actor in the development of a sustainable human society. With this opportunity, however, also comes an important responsibility in developing appropriate predictive models, correctly interpreting their outcomes and communicating their limitations. There is also a danger that predictions grow faster than our understanding of ecological systems, resulting in a gap between the scientists generating the predictions and stakeholders using them (conservation biologists, environmental managers, journalists, policymakers).
   Here, we use the context provided by the current surge of ecological predictions on the future of biodiversity to clarify what prediction means, and to pinpoint the challenges that should be addressed in order to improve predictive ecological models and the way they are understood and used.
   Synthesis and applications. Ecologists face several challenges to ensure the healthy development of an operational predictive ecological science: (i) clarity on the distinction between explanatory and anticipatory predictions; (ii) developing new theories at the interface between explanatory and anticipatory predictions; (iii) open data to test and validate predictions; (iv) making predictions operational; and (v) developing a genuine ethics of prediction.

AB Anthropogenic global changes in biodiversity are generally portrayed in terms of massive native species losses or invasions caused by recent human disturbance. Yet these biodiversity changes and others caused directly by human populations and their use of land tend to co-occur as long-term biodiversity change processes in the Anthropocene. Here we explore contemporary anthropogenic global patterns in vascular plant species richness at regional landscape scales by combining spatially explicit models and estimates for native species loss together with gains in exotics caused by species invasions and the introduction of agricultural domesticates and ornamental exotic plants. The patterns thus derived confirm that while native losses are likely significant across at least half of Earth's ice-free land, model predictions indicate that plant species richness has increased overall in most regional landscapes, mostly because species invasions tend to exceed native losses. While global observing systems and models that integrate anthropogenic species loss, introduction and invasion at regional landscape scales remain at an early stage of development, integrating predictions from existing models within a single assessment confirms their vast global extent and significance while revealing novel patterns and their potential drivers. Effective global stewardship of plant biodiversity in the Anthropocene will require integrated frameworks for observing, modeling and forecasting the different forms of anthropogenic biodiversity change processes at regional landscape scales, towards conserving biodiversity within the novel plant communities created and sustained by human systems.

AB More diverse communities have been shown to have higher and more temporally stable ecosystem functioning than less diverse ones, suggesting they should also have a consistently higher level of functioning over time. Diverse communities could maintain consistently high function because the species driving function change over time (functional turnover) or because they are more likely to contain key species with temporally stable functioning. Across 7 y in a large biodiversity experiment, we show that more diverse plant communities had consistently higher productivity, that is, a higher level of functioning over time. We identify the mechanism for this as turnover in the species driving biomass production; this was substantial, and species that were rare in some years became dominant and drove function in other years. Such high turnover allowed functionally more diverse communities to maintain high biomass over time and was associated with higher levels of complementarity effects in these communities. In contrast, turnover in communities composed of functionally similar species did not promote high biomass production over time. Thus, turnover in species promotes consistently high ecosystem function when it sustains functionally complementary interactions between species. Our results strongly reinforce the argument for conservation of high biodiversity.

AB One potential contributor to the worldwide decline of bird populations is the increasing prevalence of roads, which have several negative effects on birds and other vertebrates. We synthesized the results of studies and reviews that explore the effects of roads on birds with an emphasis on paved roads. The well-known direct effects of roads on birds include habitat loss and fragmentation, vehicle-caused mortality, pollution, and poisoning. Nevertheless, indirect effects may exert a greater influence on bird populations. These effects include noise, artificial light, barriers to movement, and edges associated with roads. Moreover, indirect and direct effects may act synergistically to cause decreases in population density and species richness. Of the many effects of roads, it appears that road mortality and traffic noise may have the most substantial effects on birds relative to other effects and taxonomic groups. Potential measures for mitigating the detrimental effects of roads include noise-reduction strategies and changes to roadway lighting and vegetation and traffic flow. Road networks and traffic volumes are projected to increase in many countries around the world. Increasing habitat loss and fragmentation and predicted species distribution shifts due to climate change are likely to compound the overall effects of roads on birds.

AB Short-sequence fragments ('DNA barcodes') used widely for plant identification and inventorying remain to be applied to complex biological problems. Host-herbivore interactions are fundamental to coevolutionary relationships of a large proportion of species on the Earth, but their study is frequently hampered by limited or unreliable host records. Here we demonstrate that DNA barcodes can greatly improve this situation as they (i) provide a secure identification of host plant species and (ii) establish the authenticity of the trophic association. Host plants of leaf beetles (subfamily Chrysomelinae) from Australia were identified using the chloroplast trnL(UAA) intron as barcode amplified from beetle DNA extracts. Sequence similarity and phylogenetic analyses provided precise identifications of each host species at tribal, generic and specific levels, depending on the available database coverage in various plant lineages. The 76 species of Chrysomelinae included-more than 10 per cent of the known Australian fauna-feed on 13 plant families, with preference for Australian radiations of Myrtaceae (eucalypts) and Fabaceae (acacias). Phylogenetic analysis of beetles shows general conservation of host association but with rare host shifts between distant plant lineages, including a few cases where barcodes supported two phylogenetically distant host plants. The study demonstrates that plant barcoding is already feasible with the current publicly available data. By sequencing plant barcodes directly from DNA extractions made from herbivorous beetles, strong physical evidence for the host association is provided. Thus, molecular identification using short DNA fragments brings together the detection of species and the analysis of their interactions.

AB Despite considerable effort from the systematics community, delimiting species boundaries in recent radiations remains a daunting challenge. We argue that genealogical approaches, although sometimes useful, may not solve this important problem, because recently derived species often have not had sufficient time to achieve monophyly. Instead, we suggest that population genetic approaches that rely on large sets of informative markers like single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) provide an alternative framework for delimiting very recently derived species. We address two major challenges in applying such markers to species delimitation: discovering markers in nonmodel systems and using them to delimit recently derived species. Using turtles as a test case, we explore the utility of a single, relatively low-coverage genomic resource as an aid in gene and marker discovery. We exploit an end-sequenced bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library from an individual painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) and outline a novel protocol that efficiently identifies primer pairs that amplify homologous sequences across the tree of living turtles. Preliminary data using this library to discover SNPs in Emydnra macquarii, a species that diverged from C. picta similar to 210 million years ago, indicate that sequences identified from the Chrysemys BAC library provide useful SNPs even in this very distantly related taxon. Several recent methods in wide use in the population genetics literature allow one to discover potential species, or test existing species hypotheses, with SNP data and may be particularly informative for very recently derived species. As BAC and other genomic resources become increasingly available for scattered taxa across the tree of life, we are optimistic that these resources will provide abundant, inexpensive markers that will help delimit boundaries in problematic, recent species radiations.

AB Background Broad scaling relationships between leaf size and function do not take into account that leaves of different size may contain different fractions of support in petiole and mid-rib.
   Methods The fractions of leaf biomass in petiole, mid-rib and lamina, and the differences in chemistry and structure among mid-ribs, petioles and laminas were investigated in 122 species of contrasting leaf size, life form and climatic distribution to determine the extent to which differences in support modify whole-lamina and whole-leaf structural and chemical characteristics, and the extent to which size-dependent support investments are affected by plant life form and site climate.
   Key Results For the entire data set, leaf fresh mass varied over five orders of magnitude. The percentage of dry mass in mid-rib increased strongly with lamina size, reaching more than 40 % in the largest laminas. The whole-leaf percentage of mid-rib and petiole increased with leaf size, and the overall support investment was more than 60 % in the largest leaves. Fractional support investments were generally larger in herbaceous than in woody species and tended to be lower in Mediterranean than in cool temperate and tropical plants. Mid-ribs and petioles had lower N and C percentages, and lower dry to fresh mass ratio, but greater density (mass per unit volume) than laminas. N percentage of lamina without mid-rib was up to 40 % higher in the largest leaves than the total-lamina (lamina and mid-rib) N percentage, and up to 60 % higher than whole-leaf N percentage, while lamina density calculated without mid-rib was up to 80 % less than that with the mid-rib. For all leaf compartments, N percentage was negatively associated with density and dry to fresh mass ratio, while C percentage was positively linked to these characteristics, reflecting the overall inverse scaling between structural and physiological characteristics. However, the correlations between N and C percentages and structural characteristics differed among mid-ribs, petioles and laminas, implying that the mass-weighted average leaf N and C percentage, density, and dry to fresh mass ratio can have different functional values depending on the importance of within-leaf support investments.
   Conclusions These data demonstrate that variation in leaf size is associated with major changes in within-leaf support investments and in large modifications in integrated leaf chemical and structural characteristics. These size-dependent alterations can importantly affect general leaf structure vs. function scaling relationships. These data further demonstrate important life-form effects on and climatic differentiation in foliage support costs.

AB Human recreation has immediate and long-term impacts on wildlife, and exposure to recreational activities might be particularly high in urban systems. We investigated the relationship between human recreation and the spatial and temporal activity patterns of large mammals in an urban nature reserve. Data from remotely triggered infra-red cameras (1999-2001) were used to assess activity for bobcat, coyote, mule deer, humans, and domestic dogs along paths in the Nature Reserve of Orange County (NROC), California. Forty-nine camera sites established across the NROC yielded 16,722 images of humans, dogs, and our three target large mammal species during 4232 observation nights. Results suggest that bobcats, and to a lesser degree coyotes, exhibited both spatial and temporal displacement in response to human recreation. Bobcats were not only detected less frequently along trails with higher human activity; but also appeared to shift their daily activity patterns to become more nocturnal in high human use areas; negative associations between bobcat and human activity were particularly evident for bikers, hikers, and domestic dogs. in general, both bobcats and coyotes displayed a relatively wide range of activity levels at sites with low human use, but a lower and markedly restricted range of activity at those sites with the highest levels of recreation. Although we did not find a clear and consistent pattern of avoidance of human recreation by deer, the probability of detecting deer during the day was lower with increasing levels of human recreation. Future studies that experimentally investigate the impacts of recreationists on wildlife, as well as relate behavioral responses to survival and reproduction, will allow further insight of the effects of urban recreation on large mammal populations.

AB Forest landscape dynamics result from the complex interaction of driving forces and ecological processes operating on various scales. Projected climate change for the 21st century will alter climate-sensitive processes, causing shifts in species composition and also bringing about changes in disturbance regimes, particularly regarding wildfires. Previous studies of the impact of climate change on forests have focused mainly on the direct effects of climate. In the present study, we assessed the interactions among forest dynamics, climate change and large-scale disturbances such as fire, wind and forest management. We used the LANDCLIM model to investigate the influence, interactions and the relative importance of these different drivers of landscape dynamics in two case study areas of the European Alps. The simulations revealed that projected future climate change would cause extensive forest cover changes, beginning in the coming decades. Fire is likely to become almost as important for shaping the landscape as the direct effects of climate change, even in areas where major wildfires do not occur under current climatic conditions. The effects of variable wind disturbances and harvesting regimes, however, are less likely to have a considerable impact on forest development compared with the direct effects of climate change coupled with the indirect effects of increased fire activity. We conclude that the joint direct and indirect effects of climate change are likely to have major consequences for mountain forests in the European Alps, including their ability to provide protection against natural hazards.

AB Non-native (alien, exotic) plant invasions are affecting ecological processes and threatening biodiversity worldwide. Patterns of plant invasions, and the ecological processes which generate these patterns, vary across spatial scales. Thus, consideration of spatial scale may help to illuminate the mechanisms driving biological invasions, and offer insight into potential management strategies. We review the processes driving movement of non-native plants to new locations, and the patterns and processes at the new locations, as they are variously affected by spatial scale. Dispersal is greatly influenced by scale, with different mechanisms controlling global, regional and local dispersal. Patterns of invasion are rarely documented across multiple spatial scales, but research using multi-scale approaches has generated interesting new insights into the invasion process. The ecological effects of plant invasions are also scale-dependent, ranging from altered local community diversity and homogenization of the global flora, to modified biogeochemical cycles and disturbance regimes at regional or global scales. Therefore, the study and control of invasions would benefit from documenting invasion processes at multiple scales.

AB Recent global warming threatens many species and has already caused population- and species-level extinctions. In particular, high risks of extinction are expected for isolated populations of species with low dispersal abilities. These predictions rely on widely used 'climatic envelope' models, while individual responses, the ultimate driver of a species response to climate change, have been most often neglected. Here, we report on some changes in life-history traits of a dispersal-limited reptile species (a poorly studied taxa) living in isolated populations. Using long-term data on common lizards collected in southern France, we show that individual body size dramatically increased in all the four populations studied over the past 18 years. This increase in body size in all age classes appeared related to a concomitant increase in temperature experienced during the first month of life (August). Daily maximum temperature in August increased by 2.2 degrees C and yearling snout-vent-length increased by about 28%. As a result, adult female body size increased markedly, and, as fecundity is strongly dependent on female body size, clutch size and total reproductive output also increased. For one population where capture-recapture data were available, adult survival was positively related to May temperature. All fitness components investigated therefore responded positively to the increase in temperature, such that it might be concluded that the common lizard has been advantaged by the shift in temperature. We contrast these short-term results with the long-term habitat-based prediction that these populations located close to mountain tops on the southern margin of the species range should be unable to cope with the alteration of their habitat. To achieve a better prediction of a species persistence, one will probably need to combine both habitat and individual-based approaches.

AB 1. In Fennoscandia during winter small rodents spend most of their time in the subnivean space, between the snow cover and the ground. The subnivean space is probably not a uniform habitat, but broken into accessible and inaccessible patches by ice covering the vegetation. This might reduce access to otherwise available food resources.
   2. To test whether ice formations reduce access to food and thus limit winter survival of small rodents, we conducted an experiment where we increased subnivean space by adding corrugated aluminium sheets on the ground before onset of winter. The sheets prevented ice formation, thus mimicking natural occurring subnivean space, and providing more room for animals living in the subnivean space to forage.
   3. During the experiment 142 Microtus oeconomus were passive induced transponder (PIT)-tagged, and a system consisting of fixed tube-shaped antennas and PIT-tag readers were used to provide data to analyse winter survival and individual subnivean space use. The extent of winter grazing was measured after snow melt by examining percentage area grazed.
   4. The treatment resulted in increased survival which corresponded well with significantly higher space use and more grazing under the sheets.
   5. Females showed a positive correlation between probability of survival and body mass while no such effect was observed in males.
   6. The results suggest that the snow cover reduces survival in winter by physically enclosing the vegetation in ice and thus reducing access to otherwise available food resources. The amount of ice and its configuration might vary between years due to changing weather patterns. Our results offer a mechanistic explanation for variations in winter survival and suggest incorporating climate variables in future small rodent models.
   7. Directional and long-term changes in climate might result in increased ice formation in the subnivean system. Such deterioration may lead to reduced winter survival and act by stabilizing population dynamics and dampening vole cyclicity.

AB Background and Aims Monsi and Saeki (1953) published the first mathematical model of canopy photosynthesis that was based on the light attenuation within a canopy and a light response of leaf photosynthesis. This paper reviews the evolution and development of their theory.
   Scope Monsi and Saeki showed that under full light conditions, canopy photosynthesis is maximized at a high leaf area index (LAI, total leaf area per unit ground area) with vertically inclined leaves, while under low light conditions, it is at a low LAI with horizontal leaves. They suggested that actual plants develop a stand structure to maximize canopy photosynthesis. Combination of the Monsi-Saeki model with the cost-benefit hypothesis in resource use led to a new canopy photosynthesis model, where leaf nitrogen distribution and associated photosynthetic capacity were taken into account. The gradient of leaf nitrogen in a canopy was shown to be a direct response to the gradient of light. This response enables plants to use light and nitrogen efficiently, two resources whose supply is limited in the natural environment.
   Conclusion The canopy photosynthesis model stimulated studies to scale-up from chloroplast biochemistry to canopy carbon gain and to analyse the resource-use strategy of species and individuals growing at different light and nitrogen availabilities. Canopy photosynthesis models are useful to analyse the size structure of populations in plant communities and to predict the structure and function of future terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Metacommunity theories, which consider communities as interacting species assemblages connected by dispersal, differ in their assumptions about the importance of interspecific adaptations and environmental heterogeneity as controls of assemblage composition. I assess the relative importance of regional (dispersal) and local (abiotic and biotic environmental variation) processes in explaining the structure of a freshwater pond metacommunity. Results did not support the hypothesis that dispersal was limited by interpatch distance. Instead, community diversity, composition, and trophic structure were best explained by local environmental variation associated with pond permanence. Many taxa were restricted either to temporary or semipermanent ponds, an outcome that suggests species trade off adaptations to disturbance with those to biotic interactions (species-sorting model) and that refutes the neutral model of interspecific equivalence. However, evidence for high dispersal rates, low-fitness habitats, and high temporal environmental variability indicated that interpatch dispersal also may influence local dynamics through mass effects. These results suggest that integrating the species-sorting and mass-effect niche assembly frameworks will provide a necessary step in the successful application of metacommunity theory.

AB The Quaternary was a time of extensive evolution among mammals. Most living species arose at this time, and many of them show adaptations to peculiarly Quaternary environments. The latter include continental northern steppe and tundra, and the formation of lakes and offshore islands. Although some species evolved fixed adaptations to specialist habitats, others developed flexible adaptations enabling them to inhabit broad niches and to survive major environmental changes. Adaptation to short-term (migratory and seasonal) habitat change probably played a part in pre-adapting mammal species to the longer-term cyclical changes of the Quaternary. Fossil evidence indicates that environmental changes of the order of thousands of years have been sufficient to produce subspeciation, but speciation has typically required one hundred thousand to a few hundred thousand years, although there are both shorter and longer exceptions. The persistence of taxa in environments imposing strong selective regimes may have been important in forcing major adaptive change. Individual Milankovitch cycles are not necessarily implicated in this process, but nor did they generally inhibit evolutionary change among mammals: many evolutionary divergences built over multiple climatic cycles. Deduction of speciation timing requires input from fossils and modern phenotypic and breeding data, to complement and constrain mitochondrial DNA coalescence dates which appear commonly to overestimate taxic divergence dates and durations of speciation. Migrational and evolutionary responses to climate change are not mutually exclusive but, on the contrary, may be synergistic. Finally, preliminary analysis suggests that faunal turnover, including an important element of speciation, was elevated in the Quaternary compared with the Neogene, at least in some biomes. Macroevolutionary species selection or sorting has apparently resulted in a modern mammalian fauna enriched with fast-reproducing and/or adaptively generalist species.

AB The relationship between community diversity and invasion resistance in a grassland was examined using experimental plant assemblages that varied in species richness and composition. The assemblages were weeded for three seasons to remove unsown species and we used the number of weeded seedlings, their total biomass and the number of species removed as indicators of community resistance and susceptibility to invasion. In general, we found a positive relationship between invasion resistance and increasing community diversity. Similar patterns of establishment were observed at the end of the fourth field season after several months without weeding. Increased invasion resistance with higher diversity appears to come through reduced levels of several above- and below-ground resources, although these did not fully explain the effects of species richness in the study's analyses. Experimental increases and reductions of litter biomass within the study's experimental plant assemblages did not modify these patterns significantly. A review of comparable studies of invasion across directly manipulated diversity gradients revealed similar patterns. Positive effects of species diversity on invasion resistance were found in experimental manipulations of plant diversity conducted in the field and in the glasshouse, from studies with aquatic microcosms and in a marine system. Although some exceptions to this pattern were found in both terrestrial plant systems and aquatic microcosms, it was concluded that in biodiversity manipulation experiments more diverse communities are generally more resistant to invasion.

AB An individual-based model named OSMOSE (Object-oriented Simulator of Marine Ecosystems Exploitation) is used to investigate the dynamics of exploited marine fish communities. It allows the representation of age- and size-structured populations comprised of groups of individuals that interact within a spatialized food web. Within each group, which constitutes the basic interaction entity (the 'super-individual' in individual-based modelling terminology), fish belong to the same species, have similar biological parameters and behaviour rules. Somatic growth, reproduction, predation and starvation processes are modelled. Two rules apply for the predation process: for a given fish group, prey selection depends both on the spatial and temporal co-occurrence of the predator and its prey, and on the respective lengths of the prey versus the predator. Thus, fish feed regardless of the taxonomy of their prey. The strength of both predation and competition relationships therefore vary according to changes in relative species abundance. Preliminary investigations are conducted on a theoretical community comprising seven interacting species. The simulation results show how community stability can emerge from variability in species biomass. It is thus suggested that size-based trophic interactions, along with the existence of multiple weak links and species redundancy, favour community persistence and stability.

AB The disturbance spectrum consists of disturbance patterns differing in type, size, intensity, and frequency. It is proposed that tree life-history traits are adaptations to particular disturbance regimes. Four independent axes are proposed to define the dominant dimensions of tree strategy space: shade tolerance, tree height, capacity fur vegetative reproduction, and seed dispersal distance. A fitness model was developed to elucidate interactions between the proposed life-history traits. The model shows how alternate life history sets can coexist when disturbance patterns fluctuate in space and time. Variable disturbance regimes were shown, based on data and simulation results, to enhance species coexistence, as predicted. The strategy space model accurately predicts the number of common tree species for the eastern United States, boreal Canada, and southwestern pinon-juniper woodlands. The model also provides an explanation for latitudinal gradients in tree species richness in North America. and Europe. The proposed model predicts a relationship between disturbance characteristics and the species composition of a forest that allows for the coexistence of large numbers of species. The life-history traits of size, growth rate, life span, shade tolerance, age of reproduction, seed dispersal distance, and vegetative reproduction are all incorporated into the model.

AB Microsatellite DNA markers were applied for the first time in a population genetic study of a cephalopod and compared with previous estimates of genetic differentiation obtained using allozyme and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers. Levels of genetic variation detected with microsatellites were much higher than found with previous markers (mean number of alleles per locus = 10.6, mean expected heterozygosity (H-E) = 0.79; allozyme H-E = 0.08; mtDNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) H-E = 0.16). In agreement with previous studies, microsatellites demonstrated genetic uniformity across the population occupying the European shelf seas of the North East Atlantic, and extreme genetic differentiation of the Azores population (R-ST/F-ST = 0.252/0.245; allozyme F-ST = 0.536; mtDNA F-ST = 0.789). In contrast to other markers, microsatellites detected more subtle, and significant, levels of differentiation between the populations of the North East Atlantic offshore banks (Rockall and Faroes) and the shelf population (R-ST = 0.048 and 0.057). Breakdown of extensive gene flow among these populations is indicated, with hydrographic (water depth) and hydrodynamic (isolating current regimes) factors suggested as possible barriers to migration. The demonstration of genetic subdivision in an abundant, highly mobile marine invertebrate has implications for the interpretation of dispersal and population dynamics, and consequent management, of such a commercially exploited species. Relative levels of differentiation indicated by the three different marker systems, and the use of measures of differentiation (assuming different mutation models), are discussed.

AB In order to develop a model of the carbon cycle for mature slash pine (Pinus elliottii) stands in north Florida, we studied seasonal variation in leaf area index (LAI, all-sided), aboveground biomass increment and litterfall, and light penetration through the forest canopy, over a 3-yr period. The primary approach to establishing monthly LAI included annual destructive analyses and monthly measurements of needle fall and elongation. Imagery from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and patterns of light penetration were also used in attempts to derive less arduous estimates; the TM imagery was most promising.
   LAIs ranged from 3.0 to 6.5 on control plots over the 3 yr, with repeated fertilization increasing maximum LAI by > 40%. Seasonal variation was high (40%), as was variation from year to year. An average of 31% of the incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) penetrated the canopies annually, ranging from 18 to 42% seasonally. Seasonal light penetration could not be described using a simple application of the Beer-Lambert law, perhaps due to the highly aggregated nature of the canopies. Models incorporating more information on canopy structure are necessary to predict light penetration through slash pine stands accurately.
   A model of needle litterfall was derived that could account for much of the seasonal and annual variation using stand basal area and climate conditions from the spring of the previous year; this model may be useful for developing climate-driven predictions of LAI. Efficiencies of use of incoming and intercepted PAR were low compared to other forest types. Low light interception and high nutrient-use efficiencies (demonstrated in earlier studies) are important adaptive characteristics of slash pine stands to these relatively warm and nutrient-poor sites.

AB Version 5 of the Community Land Model (CLM5) introduces the plant hydraulic stress (PHS) configuration of vegetation water use, which is described and compared with the corresponding parameterization from CLM4.5. PHS updates vegetation water stress and root water uptake to better reflect plant hydraulic theory, advancing the physical basis of the model. The new configuration introduces prognostic vegetation water potential, modeled at the root, stem, and leaf levels. Leaf water potential replaces soil potential as the basis for stomatal conductance water stress, and root water potential is used to implement hydraulic root water uptake, replacing a transpiration partitioning function. Point simulations of a tropical forest site (Caxiuana, Brazil) under ambient conditions and partial precipitation exclusion highlight the differences between PHS and the previous CLM implementation. Model description and simulation results are contextualized with a list of benefits and limitations of the new model formulation, including hypotheses that were not testable in previous versions of the model. Key results include reductions in transpiration and soil moisture biases relative to a control model under both ambient and exclusion conditions, correcting excessive dry season soil moisture stress in the control model. PHS implements hydraulic gradient root water uptake, which allows hydraulic redistribution and compensatory root water uptake and results in PHS utilizing a larger portion of the soil column to buffer shortfalls in precipitation. The new model structure, which bases water stress on leaf water potential, could have significant implications for vegetation-climate feedbacks, including increased sensitivity of photosynthesis to atmospheric vapor pressure deficit.

AB We evaluated the "4 per 1000" initiative for increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) by analysing rates of SOC increase in treatments in 16 long-term experiments in southeast United Kingdom. The initiative sets a goal for SOC stock to increase by 4 parts per thousand per year in the 0-40 cm soil depth, continued over 20 years. Our experiments, on three soil types, provided 114 treatment comparisons over 7-157 years. Treatments included organic additions (incorporated by inversion ploughing), N fertilizers, introducing pasture leys into continuous arable systems, and converting arable land to woodland. In 65% of cases, SOC increases occurred at > 7 parts per thousand per year in the 0-23 cm depth, approximately equivalent to 4 parts per thousand per year in the 0-40 cm depth. In the two longest running experiments (>150 years), annual farmyard manure (FYM) applications at 35 t fresh material per hectare (equivalent to approx. 3.2 t organic C/ha/year) gave SOC increases of 18 parts per thousand and 43 parts per thousand per year in the 23 cm depth during the first 20 years. Increases exceeding 7 parts per thousand per year continued for 40-60 years. In other experiments, with FYM applied at lower rates or not every year, there were increases of 3 parts per thousand-8 parts per thousand per year over several decades. Other treatments gave increases between zero and 19 parts per thousand per year over various periods. We conclude that there are severe limitations to achieving the "4 per 1000" goal in practical agriculture over large areas. The reasons include (1) farmers not having the necessary resources (e.g. insufficient manure); (2) some, though not all, practices favouring SOC already widely adopted; (3) practices uneconomic for farmers-potentially overcome by changes in regulations or subsidies; (4) practices undesirable for global food security. We suggest it is more realistic to promote practices for increasing SOC based on improving soil quality and functioning as small increases can have disproportionately large beneficial impacts, though not necessarily translating into increased crop yield.

AB Integrated assessment and its inherent platform, integrated modelling, present an opportunity to synthesize diverse knowledge, data, methods and perspectives into an overarching framework to address complex environmental problems. However to be successful for assessment or decision making purposes, all salient dimensions of integrated modelling must be addressed with respect to its purpose and context. The key dimensions include: issues of concern; management options and governance arrangements; stakeholders; natural systems; human systems; spatial scales; temporal scales; disciplines; methods, models, tools and data; and sources and types of uncertainty. This paper aims to shed light on these ten dimensions, and how integration of the dimensions fits in the four main phases in the integrated assessment process: scoping, problem framing and formulation, assessing options, and communicating findings. We provide examples of participatory processes and modelling tools that can be used to achieve integration. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 1Spatial variation in filters imposed by the abiotic environment causes variation in functional traits within and among plant species. This is abundantly clear for plant species along elevational gradients, where parallel abiotic selection pressures give rise to predictable variation in leaf phenotypes among ecosystems. Understanding the factors responsible for such patterns may provide insight into the current and future drivers of biodiversity, local community structure and ecosystem function. In order to explore patterns in trait variation along elevational gradients, we conducted a meta-analysis of published observational studies that measured three key leaf functional traits that are associated with axes of variation in both resource competition and stress tolerance: leaf mass:area ratio (LMA), leaf nitrogen content per unit mass (N-mass) and N content per unit area (N-area). To examine whether there may be evidence for a genetic basis underlying the trait variation, we conducted a review of published results from common garden experiments that measured the same leaf traits. Within studies, LMA and N-area tended to decrease with mean annual temperature (MAT) along elevational gradients, while N-mass did not vary systematically with MAT. Correlations among pairs of traits varied significantly with MAT: LMA was most strongly correlated with N-mass and N-area at high-elevation sites with relatively lower MAT. The strengths of the relationships were equal or greater within species relative to the relationships among species, suggesting parallel evolutionary dynamics along elevational gradients among disparate biomes. Evidence from common garden studies further suggests that there is an underlying genetic basis to the functional trait variation that we documented along elevational gradients. Taken together, these results indicate that environmental filtering both selects locally adapted genotypes within plant species and constrains species to elevational ranges based on their ranges of potential leaf trait values. If individual phenotypes are filtered from populations in the same way that species are filtered from regional species pools, changing climate may affect both the species and functional trait composition of plant communities.

AB Adaptive radiations are an important source of biodiversity and are often characterized by many speciation events in very short succession. It has been proposed that the high speciation rates in these radiations may be fuelled by novel genetic combinations produced in episodes of hybridization among the young species. The role of such hybridization events in the evolutionary history of a group can be investigated by comparing the genealogical relationships inferred from different subsets of loci, but such studies have thus far often been hampered by shallow genetic divergences, especially in young adaptive radiations, and the lack of genome-scale molecular data. Here, we use a genome-wide sampling of SNPs identified within restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) tags to investigate the genomic consistency of patterns of shared ancestry and adaptive divergence among five sympatric cichlid species of two genera, Pundamilia and Mbipia, which form part of the massive adaptive radiation of cichlids in the East African Lake Victoria. Species pairs differ along several axes: male nuptial colouration, feeding ecology, depth distribution, as well as the morphological traits that distinguish the two genera and more subtle morphological differences. Using outlier scan approaches, we identify signals of divergent selection between all species pairs with a number of loci showing parallel patterns in replicated contrasts either between genera or between male colour types. We then create SNP subsets that we expect to be characterized to different extents by selection history and neutral processes and describe phylogenetic and population genetic patterns across these subsets. These analyses reveal very different evolutionary histories for different regions of the genome. To explain these results, we propose at least two intergeneric hybridization events (between Mbipia spp. and Pundamilia spp.) in the evolutionary history of these five species that would have lead to the evolution of novel trait combinations and new species.

AB Functional trait differences among species are increasingly used to infer the effects of biotic and abiotic processes on species coexistence. Commonly, the trait diversity observed within communities is compared to patterns simulated in randomly generated communities based on sampling within a region. The resulting patterns of trait convergence and divergence are assumed to reveal abiotic and biotic processes, respectively. However, biotic processes such as competition can produce both trait divergence and convergence, through either excluding similar species (niche differences, divergence) or excluding dissimilar species (weaker competitor exclusion, convergence). Hence, separating biotic and abiotic processes that can produce identical patterns of trait diversity, or even patterns that neutralize each other, is not feasible with previous methods. We propose an operational framework in which the functional trait dissimilarity within communities (FDcomm) is compared to the corresponding trait dissimilarity expected from the species pool (i.e., functional species pool diversity, FDpool). FDpool includes the set of potential species for a site delimited by the operating environmental and dispersal limitation filters. By applying these filters, the resulting pattern of trait diversity is consistent with biotic processes, i.e., trait divergence (FDcomm > FDpool) indicates niche differentiation, while trait convergence (FDcomm < FDpool) indicates weaker competitor exclusion. To illustrate this framework, with its potential application and constraints, we analyzed both simulated and field data. The functional species pool framework more consistently detected the simulated trait diversity patterns than previous approaches. In the field, using data from plant communities of typical Northern European habitats in Estonia, we found that both niche-based and weaker competitor exclusion influenced community assembly, depending on the traits and community considered. In both simulated and field data, we demonstrated that only by estimating the species pool of a site is it possible to differentiate the patterns of trait dissimilarity produced by operating biotic processes. The framework, which can be applied with both functional and phylogenetic diversity, enables a reinterpretation of community assembly processes. Solving the challenge of defining an appropriate reference species pool for a site can provide a better understanding of community assembly.

AB There is growing concern that biodiversity loss in European agricultural landscapes is having negative effects on functional trait diversity. Long-term studies examining vegetation changes from the period before agricultural industrialisation are however rare. Here, we ask how management intensification and increased nutrient input initiated in the 1950/1960s have altered grassland plant community composition, species diversity and functional trait composition using comprehensive datasets from five floodplain regions (plus one protected reference region) in northern Germany. Sites with available historical releves and vegetation maps (1950/1960s, 19905) were resampled in 2008 to facilitate the analysis of a period spanning four to five decades.
   Plant community composition changed tremendously in all study regions during the 50 year period, which was related to increasing Ellenberg indicator values for nutrient availability. Species richness at the plot-level fell by 30-50% over the period, and losses in functional diversity were equally large. A non-formal comparison with the results from the protected reference study region indicates that the changes may mostly be attributable to local nutrient input rather than to supra-regional climate change. Our results indicate a consistent trend towards much more species-poor communities dominated by mow-tolerant, N-demanding competitive grasses, whereas species with more ruderal strategies, species flowering early in the season and, in particular, insect-pollinated herbs have all decreased. The substantial loss of nectar-producing grassland herbs is likely to have negative effects on the abundance of pollinating insects, with consequences for the grassland animal communities. This highlights the growing need for adequate grassland management schemes with low N input to preserve high-nature-value grassland. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A citation-based indicator for interdisciplinarity has been missing hitherto among the set of available journal indicators. In this study, we investigate network indicators (betweenness centrality), unevenness indicators (Shannon entropy, the Gini coefficient), and more recently proposed Rao-Stirling measures for "interdisciplinarity." The latter index combines the statistics of both citation distributions of journals (vector-based) and distances in citation networks among journals (matrix-based). The effects of various normalizations are specified and measured using the matrix of 8207 journals contained in the Journal Citation Reports of the (Social) Science Citation Index 2008. Betweenness centrality in symmetrical (1-mode) cosine-normalized networks provides an indicator outperforming betweenness in the asymmetrical (2-mode) citation network. Among the vector-based indicators, Shannon entropy performs better than the Gini coefficient, but is sensitive to size. Science and Nature, for example, are indicated at the top of the list. The new diversity measure provides reasonable results when (1 - cosine) is assumed as a measure for the distance, but results using Euclidean distances were difficult to interpret.

AB Aim Although parameter estimates are not as affected by spatial autocorrelation as Type I errors, the change from classical null hypothesis significance testing to model selection under an information theoretic approach does not completely avoid problems caused by spatial autocorrelation. Here we briefly review the model selection approach based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and present a new routine for Spatial Analysis in Macroecology (SAM) software that helps establishing minimum adequate models in the presence of spatial autocorrelation.
   Innovation We illustrate how a model selection approach based on the AIC can be used in geographical data by modelling patterns of mammal species in South America represented in a grid system (n = 383) with 2 degrees of resolution, as a function of five environmental explanatory variables, performing an exhaustive search of minimum adequate models considering three regression methods: non-spatial ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial eigenvector mapping and the autoregressive (lagged-response) model. The models selected by spatial methods included a smaller number of explanatory variables than the one selected by OLS, and minimum adequate models contain different explanatory variables, although model averaging revealed a similar rank of explanatory variables.
   Main consclusions We stress that the AIC is sensitive to the presence of spatial autocorrelation, generating unstable and overfitted minimum adequate models to describe macroecological data based on non-spatial OLS regression. Alternative regression techniques provided different minimum adequate models and have different uncertainty levels. Despite this, the averaged model based on Akaike weights generates consistent and robust results across different methods and may be the best approach for understanding of macroecological patterns.

AB We analyzed growth responses to climate of 24 tree-ring width and four maximum latewood density chronologies from the greater Tatra region in Poland and Slovakia. This network comprises 1183 ring-width and 153 density measurement series from four conifer species (Picea abies (L.) Karst., Larix decidua Mill., Abies alba (L.) Karst., and Pinus mugo (L.)) between 800 and 1550 m a.s.l. Individual spline detrending was used to retain annual to multi-decadal scale climate information in the data. Twentieth century temperature and precipitation data frorn 16 grid-boxes covering the 48-50 degrees N and 19-21 degrees E region were used for comparison. The network was analyzed to assess growth responses to climate as a function of species, elevation, parameter, frequency and site ecology. Twenty ring-width chronologies significantly correlated (P < 0.05) with June-July temperatures, whereas the latewood density chronologies were correlated with the April-September temperatures. Climatic effects of the previous-year summer generally did not significantly influence ring formation, whereas site elevation and frequency of growth variations (i.e., inter-annual and decadal) were significant variables in explaining growth response to climate. Response to precipitation increased with decreasing elevation. Correlations between summer temperatures and annual growth rates were lower for Larix decidua than for Picea abies. Principal component analysis identified five dominant eigenvectors that express somewhat contrasting climatic signals. The first principal component contained highest loadings from I I Picea abies ring-width chronologies and one Pinus mugo ring-width chronology and explained 42% of the network's variance. The mean of these 12 high-elevation chronologies was significantly correlated at 0.62 with June-July temperatures, whereas the mean of three latewood density chronologies, which loaded most strongly on the fourth principal component, significantly correlated at 0.69 with April-September temperatures (P < 0.001 over the 1901-2002 period in both cases). These groupings allow for a robust estimation of June-July (1661-2004) and April-September (1709-2004) temperatures, respectively. Comparison with reconstructions from the Alps and Central Europe supports the general rule of the dominant influence of growing season temperature on high-elevation forest growth.

AB Genetic information is used extensively to reconstruct the evolutionary and demographic history of organisms. Recently, it has been suggested that genetic information from some parasites can complement genetic data from their hosts. This approach relies upon the hypothesis that such parasites share a common history with their host. In some cases, parasites provide an additional source of information because parasite data can better reconstruct the common history. Here, we discuss which parasite traits are important in determining their usefulness for analysing host history. The key is the matching of the traits of the parasite (e.g. effective population size, generation time, mutation rate and level of host specificity) with the timescales (phylogenetic, phylogeographic and demographic) that are relevant to the issues of concern in host history.

AB Aim We explored the effects of prevalence, latitudinal range and spatial autocorrelation of species distribution patterns on the accuracy of bioclimate envelope models of butterflies.
   Location Finland, northern Europe.
   Methods The data of a national butterfly atlas survey (NAFI) carried out in 1991-2003 with a resolution of 10 x 10 km were used in the analyses. Generalized additive models (GAM) were constructed, for each of 98 species, to estimate the probability of occurrence as a function of climate variables. Model performance was measured using the area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot. Observed differences in modelling accuracy among species were related to the species' geographical attributes using multivariate GAM.
   Results Accuracies of the climate-butterfly models varied from low to very high (AUC values 0.59-0.99), with a mean of 0.79. The modelling performance was related negatively to the latitudinal range and prevalence, and positively to the spatial autocorrelation of the species distribution. These three factors accounted for 75.2% of the variation in the modelling accuracy. Species at the margin of their range or with low prevalence were better predicted than widespread species, and species with clumped distributions better than scattered dispersed species.
   Main conclusions The results from this study indicate that species' geographical attributes highly influence the behaviour and uncertainty of species-climate models, which should be taken into account in biogeographical modelling studies and assessments of climate change impacts.

AB Shortening of telomeres, specific nucleotide repeats that cap eukaryotic chromosomes, is thought to play an important role in cellular and organismal senescence. We examined telomere dynamics in two long-lived seabirds, the European shag and the wandering albatross. Telomere length in blood cells declines between the chick stage and adulthood in both species. However, among adults, telomere length is not related to age. This is consistent with reports of most telomere loss occurring early in life in other vertebrates. Thus, caution must be used in estimating annual rates of telomere loss, as these are probably not constant with age. We also measured changes within individuals in the wild, using repeat samples taken from individual shags as chicks and adults. We found high inter-individual variation in the magnitude of telomere loss, much of which was explained by circumstances during growth. Individuals laying down high tissue mass for their size showed greater telomere shortening. Independently of this, individuals born late in the season showed more telomere loss. Early conditions, possibly through their effects on oxidative stress, appear to play an important role in telomere attrition and thus potentially in the longevity of individuals.

AB We studied the role of bacterial secondary metabolites in the context of grazing protection against protozoans. A model system was used to examine the impact of violacein-producing bacteria on feeding rates, growth, and survival of three common bacterivorous nanoflagellates. Freshwater isolates of Janthinobacterium lividum and Chromobacterium violaceum produced the purple pigment violacein and exhibited acute toxicity to the nanoflagellates tested. High-resolution video microscopy revealed that these bacteria were ingested by the flagellates at high rates. The uptake of less than three bacteria resulted in rapid flagellate cell death after about 20 min and cell lysis within 1 to 2 h. In selectivity experiments with nontoxic Pseudomonas putida MM1, flagellates did not discriminate against pigmented strains. Purified violacein from cell extracts of C violaceum showed high toxicity to nanoflagellates. In addition, antiprotozoal activity was found to positively correlate with the violacein content of the bacterial strains. Pigment synthesis in C violaceum is regulated by an N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL)-dependent quorum-sensing system. An AHL-deficient, nonpigmented mutant provided high flagellate growth rates, while the addition of the natural C violaceum AHL could restore toxicity. Moreover, it was shown that the presence of violacein-producing bacteria in an otherwise nontoxic bacterial diet considerably inhibited flagellate population growth. Our results suggest that violacein-producing bacteria possess a highly effective survival mechanism which may exemplify the potential of some bacterial secondary metabolites to undermine protozoan grazing pressure and population dynamics.

AB Carotenoids are critical to embryonic development, immunity and protection from oxidative stress. Transmission of carotenoids to the eggs may affect development and maturation of immunity in offspring, but carotenoids may be available to females in limiting amounts. Females may thus transfer carotenoids to the eggs differentially in relation to the reproductive value of the offspring as affected by sexual ornamentation of their father. In this study of maternal allocation of carotenoids to the eggs in the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), females whose immune system had been experimentally challenged with an antigen had smaller lutein concentrations in their eggs than controls. We manipulated the size of a secondary sexual character (tail length) of males, and analysed the effect of manipulation on allocation of lutein to eggs by their vaccinated mates. Contrary to our prediction based on parental allocation theory, mates of tail-shortened males had a larger lutein concentration in their eggs compared with those of control and tail-elongated males. According to previous studies, offspring of short-tailed males have larger exposure and/or susceptibility to parasites. A larger lutein concentration in the eggs of females mated to males with experimentally reduced ornaments may thus reflect adaptive maternal strategies to enhance offspring viability.

AB Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a statistical innovation that allows researchers to fit far more complex models to data than is feasible using conventional methods. Despite its widespread use in a variety of scientific fields, MCMC appears to be underutilized. in wildlife applications. This may be due to a misconception that MCMC requires the adoption of a subjective Bayesian analysis, or perhaps simply to its lack of familiarity among, wildlife researchers. We introduce the basic ideas of MCMC and software BUGS (Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling), stressing that a simple and satisfactory intuition for MCMC does not require extraordinary mathematical sophistication. We illustrate the use of MCMC with an analysis of the association between latent factors governing individual heterogeneity in breeding and survival rates of kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). We conclude with a discussion of the importance of individual heterogeneity for understanding population dynamics and designing management plans.

AB This paper stresses that the mechanism of coexistence is the key to understanding the relationship between species richness and community productivity. Using model plant communities, we explored two general kinds of mechanisms based on resource heterogeneity and recruitment limitation, with and without any trade-off between reproductive and competitive abilities. We generated different levels of species richness by changing model parameters, in particular the number of species in the regional pool, the degree of recruitment limitation, and the level of heterogeneity. Different diversity-productivity patterns are obtained with different coexistence mechanisms, indicating there is no reason to expect any general relationship between species richness and productivity. We discuss these results in the context of the within-site and across-site aspects of the relationship between species richness and productivity. Furthermore, we extend these results to hypothesize the relationship between species richness and productivity for other coexistence mechanisms not explicitly considered here.

AB Benthic particle feeders are exposed to a food supply varying in both quantity and quality. Previous studies have shown that bivalve molluscs deal with such fluctuating particle regimes in a variety of ways, including adjustments in pumping and ingestion rates, and selective rejection of non-nutritive particles as pseudofeces. The actual site of particle selection within the pallial cavity, however, has remained a topic of speculation. During August 1995 and January and August 1996, we exposed the oysters Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin) and C. gigas (Thunberg), and the mussel Mytilus trossulus Gould to a mixture of ground, aged Spartina alterniflora Loisel and similar-sized phytoplankton at three concentrations (10(3), 10(4), 10(5) particles ml(-1)). We then examined the ctenidia and labial palps by means of endoscopy and sampled, in vivo, the particulate material from various ciliated tracts, and analyzed the samples with a flow cytometer. We found that in oysters, the ctenidia are responsible for particle sorting, whereas the labial palps play an accessory role in particle selection, or function to control the volume of material to be ingested. In mussels, however, the ctenidia play little role in particle selection and simply transport particulate matter to the palps for further processing. We suggest that selection by the ctenidia of oysters is a function of their architecture (plicate, heterorhabdic).

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of changes in landscape pattern on generalist and specialist insects. We did this by comparing the species richness and abundance of generalist and specialist herbivorous insects in alfalfa (Medicago sativa, L.) fields on 26 agricultural landscapes that differed in spatial structure. The insects were from the families Curculionidae (Coleoptera), weevils, and Cicadellidae (Auchennorhyncha), leafhoppers.
   We hypothesized that: (1) generalist richness and abundance would be highest in landscapes with high diversity (Shannon-Wiener); (2) specialist richness and abundance would be highest in landscapes with (i) high percent cover alfalfa and (ii) low mean inter-patch distance. We tested for these effects after controlling for the patch-level effects of field size, field age, frequency of disturbance and vegetation texture.
   The important findings of the study are: (1) generalist richness and abundance increased with increasing landscape diversity and (2) isolation (percent cover alfalfa in the landscape and/or mean inter-patch distance) does not affect specialist insects. These results are significant because they indicate that both generalist and specialist insects may move over much larger distances than previously thought. This is one of the first studies to demonstrate a large scale effect of spatial structure on insects across a broad range of landscapes.

Over this range, r(m) increased from 0.46 to 1.72 d-1 in Urotricha furcata, from 0.03 to 0.90 d-1 in Pelagostrombidium fallax, and from 0.43 to 1.42 d-1 in Strobilidium lacustris. The influence of temperature (T) and cell volume M on ciliate maximum growth rates was tested by multiple regression analysis using our own data and data from various references (n = 102). The two independent variables T and V explained together 63 % of the total variance of observed ciliate r(m) values.

AB We examined effects of differing levels of physical belowground space on the performance of several colonizing annual species in two experiments.  Individual plants were grown in controlled greenhouse conditions under an experimental regime that independently varied nutrient addition rates and the physical space available for the deployment of roots while maintaining water supply at adequate rates.  When equal amounts of nutrients were given, plants grown in greater volumes had greater vegetative growth and often higher reproductive output.  Species differed in patterns of response to physical space in both vegetative and reproductive parameters.  Abutilon theophrasti given larger soil volumes increased allocation to reproductive tissues relative to vegetative tissues.  Setaria faberii, however, responded through a phenological shift:  earlier flowering and greater reproductive output in smaller volumes.  These results indicate that physical underground space, released in the formation of certain types of gaps, may influence the performance of colonizing annuals beyond providing access to other soil resources, such as nutrients and water.

AB Biochar application has multiple benefits for soil fertility improvement and climate change mitigation. Biochar can act as a source of nutrients and sequester carbon (C) in the soil. The nutrient release capacity of biochar once applied to the soil varies with the composition of the biochar, which is a function of the feedstock type and pyrolysis condition used for biochar production. Biochar has a crucial influence on soil C mineralization, including its positive or negative priming of microorganisms involved in soil C cycling. However, in various cases, biochar application to the soil may cause negative effects in the soil and the wider environment. For instance, biochar may suppress soil nutrient availability and crop productivity due to the reduction in plant nutrient uptake or reduction in soil C mineralization. Biochar application may also negatively affect environmental quality and human health because of harmful compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, and dibenzofurans (PCDD/DF). In this review, we discuss the linkage between biochar composition and function, evaluate the role biochar plays in soil fertility improvement and C sequestration, and discuss regulations and concerns regarding biochar's negative environmental impact. We also summarize advancements in biochar production technologies and discuss future challenges and priorities in biochar research.

AB How ecological niche breadth evolves is central to adaptation and speciation and has been a topic of perennial interest. Niche breadth evolution research has occurred within environmental, ecological, evolutionary, and biogeographical contexts, and although some generalities have emerged, critical knowledge gaps exist. Performance breadth trade-offs, although long invoked, may not be common determinants of niche breadth evolution or limits. Niche breadth can expand or contract from specialist or generalist lineages, and so specialization need not be an evolutionary dead end. Whether niche breadth determines diversification and distribution breadth and how niche breadth is partitioned among individuals and populations within a species are important but particularly understudied topics. Molecular genetic and phylogenetic techniques have greatly expanded understanding of niche breadth evolution, but field studies of how niche breadth evolves are essential for providing mechanistic details and allowing the development of comprehensive theory and improved prediction of biological responses under global change.

AB Ongoing shifts in the species composition of Eastern US forests necessitate the development of frameworks to explore how species-specific water-use strategies influence ecosystem-scale carbon (C) cycling during drought. Here, we develop a diagnostic framework to classify plant drought-response strategies along a continuum of isohydric to anisohydric regulation of leaf water potential (I (L)). The framework is applied to a 3-year record of weekly leaf-level gas exchange and I measurements collected in the Morgan-Monroe State Forest (Indiana, USA), where continuous observations of the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) have been ongoing since 1999. A severe drought that occurred in the middle of the study period reduced the absolute magnitude of NEE by 55 %, though species-specific responses to drought conditions varied. Oak species were characterized by anisohydric regulation of I (L) that promoted static gas exchange throughout the study period. In contrast, I (L) of the other canopy dominant species was more isohydric, which limited gas exchange during the drought. Ecosystem-scale estimates of NEE and gross ecosystem productivity derived by upscaling the leaf-level data agreed well with tower-based observations, and highlight how the fraction of isohydric and anisohydric species in forests can mediate net ecosystem C balance.

AB Soybean (Glycine max Merr.) is the world's most widely grown leguminous crop and an important source of protein and oil for food and feed. Soybean yields have increased substantially throughout the past century, with yield gains widely attributed to genetic advances and improved cultivars as well as advances in farming technology and practice. Yet, the physiological mechanisms underlying the historical improvements in soybean yield have not been studied rigorously. In this 2-year experiment, 24 soybean cultivars released between 1923 and 2007 were grown in field trials. Physiological improvements in the efficiencies by which soybean canopies intercepted light (epsilon(i)), converted light energy into biomass (epsilon(c)), and partitioned biomass into seed (epsilon(p)) were examined. Seed yield increased by 26.5 kg ha(-1) year(-1), and the increase in seed yield was driven by improvements in all three efficiencies. Although the time to canopy closure did not change in historical soybean cultivars, extended growing seasons and decreased lodging in more modern lines drove improvements in epsilon(i). Greater biomass production per unit of absorbed light resulted in improvements in epsilon(c). Over 84 years of breeding, soybean seed biomass increased at a rate greater than total aboveground biomass, resulting in an increase in epsilon(p). A better understanding of the physiological basis for yield gains will help to identify targets for soybean improvement in the future.

AB Objective
   To test the hypothesis that peripheral C nociceptor function may be abnormal in fibromyalgia and that C nociceptor dysfunction may contribute to the symptoms reported by these patients.
   Methods
   Microneurography was used to record C nociceptors of 30 female patients meeting criteria for fibromyalgia and compared with recordings from 17 female patients with small-fiber neuropathy and 9 female controls.
   Results
   We obtained stable recordings of 186 C nociceptors in the fibromyalgia group, 114 from small-fiber neuropathy patients, and 66 from controls. The mechanosensitive nociceptors in the fibromyalgia patients behaved normally, but the silent nociceptors in 76.6% of fibromyalgia patients exhibited abnormalities. Spontaneous activity was detected in 31% of silent nociceptors in fibromyalgia, 34% in small-fiber neuropathy, and 2.2% in controls. Sensitization to mechanical stimulation was found in 24.2% of silent nociceptors in fibromyalgia, 22.7% in small-fiber neuropathy, and 3.7% in controls. Abnormally high slowing of conduction velocity when first stimulated at 0.25Hz was more common in fibromyalgia.
   Interpretation
   We show for the first time that the majority of fibromyalgia patients have abnormal C nociceptors. Many silent nociceptors exhibit hyperexcitability resembling that in small-fiber neuropathy, but high activity-dependent slowing of conduction velocity is more common in fibromyalgia patients, and may constitute a distinguishing feature. We infer that abnormal peripheral C nociceptor ongoing activity and increased mechanical sensitivity could contribute to the pain and tenderness suffered by patients with fibromyalgia.

AB 1. In riverine ecosystems, streamflow determines the physical template upon which the life history strategies of biota are forged. Human freshwater needs and activities have resulted in widespread alteration of the variability, predictability and timing of streamflow, and anticipating the biotic consequences of anthropogenic streamflow alteration is critical for successful environmental flow management. In this study, we examined relationships between dam characteristics, metrics of flow alteration and fish functional community composition according to life history strategies by coupling stream flow records and fish survey data in paired flow-regulated and free-flowing rivers across the conterminous United States. 2. Dam operations have generally reduced flow variability and increased flow constancy based on a comparison of pre- and post-dam flow records (respective mean record lengths 26.2 and 43.1 years). In agreement with ecological theory, fish assemblages downstream of dams were characterised by a lower proportion of opportunistic species (a strategy favoured in environmental settings dominated by unpredictable environmental change) and a higher proportion of equilibrium species (a strategy favoured in more stable, predictable environments) compared to free-flowing, neighbouring locations. 3. Multiple linear regression models provided modest support for links between alteration of specific flow attributes and differential life history representation below dams, and they provided strong support for life history associations with dam attributes (age and release type). We also found support for a relationship of both reduced flow variability and dam age with higher representation of non-native species below dams. 4. Our study demonstrated that river regulation by large dams has significant hydrological and biological consequences across the United States. We showed that on ecological time scales (i.e. the order of years to decades), dams are effectively changing the functional composition of communities that have established over millennia. Furthermore, the changes are directional and indicate a filtering by dams for some life histories (equilibrium strategists) and against other life histories (opportunists). Finally, our study highlights that dependence upon long-term flow records and availability of biotic surveys extracted from national survey efforts limit our ability to guide environmental flow standards particularly in data-poor regions.

AB The identification of distinctive patterns in species x site presence-absence matrices is important for understanding meta-community organisation. We compared the performance of a suite of null models and metrics that have been proposed to measure patterns of segregation, aggregation, nestedness, coherence, and species turnover. We found that any matrix with segregated species pairs can be re-ordered to highlight aggregated pairs, indicating that these seemingly opposite patterns are closely related. Recently proposed classification schemes failed to correctly classify realistic matrices that included multiple co-occurrence structures. We propose using a combination of metrics and decomposing matrix-wide patterns into those of individual pairs of species and sites to pinpoint sources of non-randomness.

AB Due to past and current climatic changes, range contractions and range shifts are essential stages in the history of a species. However, unlike range expansions, the molecular consequences of these processes have been little investigated. In order to fill this gap, we simulated patterns of molecular diversity within and between populations for various types of range contractions and range shifts. We show that range contractions tend to decrease genetic diversity as compared with population with stable ranges but quite counterintuitively fast range contractions preserve higher levels of diversity and induce lower levels of genetic differentiation among refuge areas than slow contractions. Contrastingly, fast range shifts lead to lower levels of diversity than slow range shifts. At odds with our expectations, we find that species actively migrating toward refuge areas can only preserve higher levels of diversity in refugia if the contraction is rapid. Under slow range contraction or slow range shift, active migration toward refugia lead to a larger loss of diversity as compared with scenarios with isotropic migration and may thus not be a good evolutionary strategy. These results suggest that the levels of diversity preserved after a climate change both within and between refuge areas will not only depend on the dispersal abilities of a species but also on the speed of the change. It also implies that a given episode of climatic change will impact differently species with different generation times.

AB In order to understand the population structure and dynamics of bacterial microorganisms, typing systems that accurately reflect the phylogenetic and evolutionary relationship of the agents are required. Over the past 15 years multilocus sequence typing schemes have replaced single locus approaches, giving novel insights into phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships of many bacterial species and facilitating taxonomy. Since 2004, several schemes using multiple loci have been developed to better understand the taxonomy, phylogeny and evolution of Lyme borreliosis spirochetes and in this paper we have reviewed and summarized the progress that has been made for this important group of vector-borne zoonotic bacteria.

AB Assessing the potential future of current forest stands is a key to design conservation strategies and understanding potential future impacts to ecosystem service supplies. This is particularly true in the Mediterranean basin, where important future climatic changes are expected. Here, we assess and compare two commonly used modeling approaches (niche- and process-based models) to project the future of current stands of three forest species with contrasting distributions, using regionalized climate for continental Spain. Results highlight variability in model ability to estimate current distributions, and the inherent large uncertainty involved in making projections into the future. CO2 fertilization through projected increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations is shown to increase forest productivity in the mechanistic process-based model (despite increased drought stress) by up to three times that of the non-CO2 fertilization scenario by the period 2050-2080, which is in stark contrast to projections of reduced habitat suitability from the niche-based models by the same period. This highlights the importance of introducing aspects of plant biogeochemistry into current niche-based models for a realistic projection of future species distributions. We conclude that the future of current Mediterranean forest stands is highly uncertain and suggest that a new synergy between niche- and process-based models is urgently needed in order to improve our predictive ability.

AB The form of the species richness-productivity relationship (SRPR) is both theoretically important and contentious. In an effort to distill general patterns, ecologists have undertaken meta-analyses, within which each SRPR data set is first classified into one of five alternative forms: positive, humped (unimodal), negative, U-shaped (unimodal), and no relationship. Herein, I first provide a critique of this approach, based on 68 plant data sets/studies used in three meta-analyses published in Ecology. The meta-analyses are shown to have resulted in highly divergent outcomes, inconsistent and often highly inappropriate classification of data sets, and the introduction and multiplication of errors from one meta-analysis to the next. I therefore call on the ecological community at large to adopt a far more rigorous and critical attitude to the use of meta-analysis. Second, I develop the argument that the literature on the SRPR continues to be bedeviled by a common failing to appreciate the fundamental importance of the scale of analysis, beginning with the confusion evident between concepts of grain, focus, and extent. I postulate that variation in the form of the SRPR at fine scales of analysis owes much to artifacts of the sampling regime adopted. An improved understanding may emerge from combining sampling theory with an understanding of the factors controlling the form of species abundance distributions and species accumulation curves.

AB A simulation model based on satellite observations of monthly vegetation cover was used to estimate monthly carbon fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems from 1982 to 1998. The NASA-CASA model was driven by vegetation properties derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and radiative transfer algorithms that were developed for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). For the terrestrial biosphere, predicted net ecosystem production (NEP) flux for atmospheric CO2 has varied widely between an annual source of -0.9 Pg C per year and a sink of +2.1 Pg C per year. The southern hemisphere tropical zones (SHT, between 0degrees and 30degreesS) have a major influence over the predicted global trends in interannual variability of NEP. In contrast, the terrestrial NEP sink for atmospheric CO2 on the North American (NA) continent has been fairly consistent between +0.2 and +0.3 Pg C per year, except during relatively cool annual periods when continental NEP fluxes are predicted to total to nearly zero. The predicted NEP sink for atmospheric CO2 over Eurasia (EA) increased notably in the late 1980s and has been fairly consistent between +0.3 and +0.55 Pg C per year since 1988. High correlations can be detected between the El Ni (n) over tildeo Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and predicted NEP fluxes on the EA continent and for the SHT latitude zones, whereas NEP fluxes for the North American continent as a whole do not correlate strongly with ENSO events over the same time series since 1982. These observations support the hypothesis that regional climate warming has had notable but relatively small-scale impacts on high latitude ecosystem (tundra and boreal) sinks for atmospheric CO2.

AB Separating the mechanisms that influence ecosystem functioning has been a goal of recent high profile experiments. Integrating the various experimental and analytical methods that attempt this goal across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, as well as careful definition of 'complementarity', produces novel insights and valuable lessons about new directions for research. (1) Experimental designs differ in temporal scale and whether standing stock or another ecosystem process was the response variable. (2) Mathematically identical variables in different designs have contrasting ecological interpretations. For example, different sets of ecological processes can contribute to different variables in different experimental designs. (3) The frequency of transgressive overyielding of standing stock (e.g. total above ground biomass) in polycultures implies little about the prevalence of transgressive overyielding in other ecosystem processes. (4) Measuring the contribution to ecosystem functioning of individual species, rather than just total ecosystem functioning of a polyculture, is not essential for estimating effects of complementarity. (5) Further research will profit from distinguishing standing stock from all other ecosystem functions. (6) None of the analytic methods can distinguish the effects of individual processes or mechanisms such as resource use differentiation, facilitation, or allelopathy, for which additional experimental treatments are required.

AB This study explores the consequences of predator-mediated coexistence among competitors for patterns of incidence and diversity at local and regional scales. We develop a model that draws on elements of metapopulation models of competitors and food chains by allowing competitors to coexist locally in the presence of predators but not in their absence. The model predicts that predators promote regional coexistence by greatly expanding the range of conditions under which two competitors persist at equilibrium. Predators could have positive or negative effects on mean local diversity within the region depending on their dispersal rates, those of the prey, and their effects on prey extinction rates. The presence of predators increased the abundance of inferior competitors, thereby expanding the conditions for positive relationships between local and regional diversity. The model also predicted positive correlations between local diversity of predators and prey. These predictions were supported by patterns of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish species richness among lakes. The model may help to resolve the apparent contrast between linear patterns of local and regional richness and experimental evidence for strong invasion resistance and rapid dispersal in zooplankton.

AB 1. Despite great concern about the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity, quantitative studies are still scarce with respect to many major groups and important environments. Well-studied natural reference sites are few.
   2. Extensive light trapping surveys for moths were thus carried out in both dry and wet seasons in nine remnants of complex notophyll vine forest on basalt on the Atherton Tablelands in tropical north Queensland, Australia. Three sites had never been cleared, three secondary sites had substantial regrowth, and three sites were newly cleared.
   3. A total of 15 632 moths of 835 species was collected, counted and identified. These represent more than 17% of the named Australian fauna of our target families.
   4. A principal components analysis (PCA) indicated clear discrimination among assemblages based on forest type. This discrimination did not differ qualitatively between seasons (although abundance levels of moths did) but the pattern was most evident in the smaller dry season samples.
   5. Taxa, the relative abundance of which increased significantly with disturbance, were the Arctiinae, Amphipyrinae, Catocalinae, Hadeninae, Heliothinae, Hypeninae, Noctuinae, Plusiinae, Hermeniidae and Phycitinae. In contrast, a number of subfamilies showed a marked decrease in relative abundance with increased disturbance, namely Ennominae, Geometrinae, Larentiinae, Oenochrominae, Epipaschiinae, Lymantriidae and Anthelidae.
   6. A weighted sum with importance values based on the eigenvalues associated with each of these taxa derived from the PCA is a powerful predictor set of forest quality.
   7. These differential responses may be explained on the basis of broad known and expected host-plant patterns. The results show how moth assemblages are powerful indicators of forest disturbance, and should prompt parallel studies elsewhere in the world.

AB 1. The abundance and species richness of butterflies on expanded-width uncropped arable field edges, which were subject to 10 contrasting, experimental management regimes, were measured using transects in 1989, 1990 and 1991. The effects of the management regimes on a number of botanical variables, likely to be of importance to butterflies, were measured.
   2. On the experimental field edges, butterfly abundance and species richness fluctuated between years and peaked at different times each year.
   3. Butterfly abundance and species richness differed between experimental treatments. Plots which were either cut in the spring and autumn, or not cut at all, attracted more individuals and species of butterfly than did plots cut in the summer. Sowing with a grass and wild flower seed mixture increased butterfly abundance. Butterfly abundance declined on swards sprayed once annually with herbicide.
   4. Mowing, sowing and spraying had significant effects on mean flower abundance, on the annual and perennial components flowering in the sward, and on the abundance of commonly used nectar sources and larval host-plants.
   5. Stepwise multiple regression analyses on butterfly and plant data showed that the abundance of adults of most butterfly species was most closely associated with the abundance of flowers of key nectar source species.
   6. The results are discussed in relation to resource provision for larval and adult butterfly stages. Recommendations (emboldened in the text) are made for the conservation management of butterflies on arable farmland.

AB 1. The physical characteristics of two contrasting streams, and habitat types within these streams, are described in terms of a two-dimensional physical habitat templet in which disturbance frequency and the availability of spatial refugia are the temporal and spatial axes.
   2. It is predicted that habitats experiencing a high disturbance frequency and low refuge availability will be characterized by a low invertebrate species diversity, a low biomass of epilithic algae and particulate organic matter and a community made up of mobile, weedy species. Habitats having a low disturbance frequency and high refuge availability will be characterized by a diverse community containing sedentary and specialist species, with high algal and particulate organic matter levels.
   3. A lower median substrate particle size and higher shear stress regime in Timber Creek were indicative of a higher disturbance frequency than in the Kyeburn. Substrate diversity was lower in Timber Creek than in the Kyeburn and indicated that the availability of refugia was lower in Timber Creek. In both streams, pools were found to have a higher disturbance frequency and lower availability of refugia than riffles.
   4. Invertebrate species diversity, the biomass of epilithic algae and particulate organic matter and the representation of sedentary species, filter feeders and shredders were higher in the more temporally stable and spatially heterogeneous Kyeburn. The community of Timber Creek, frequently disturbed and having low refuge availability, had a high proportion of mobile and weedy species, with the highly mobile, generalist-feeding Deleatidium spp. (Ephemeroptera; Leptophlebiidae) being the most dominant organisms.
   5. The predictions made about stream community structure and species characteristics in relation to disturbance frequency and the availability of spatial refugia are generally supported. Now a larger scale investigation is required to test the generality of the predictions. We conclude that the habitat templet approach offers a sound framework within which to pose questions in stream ecology.

AB In recent decades, an increasing persistence of atmospheric circulation patterns has been observed. In the course of the associated long-lasting anticyclonic summer circulations, heatwaves and drought spells often coincide, leading to so-called hotter droughts. Previous hotter droughts caused a decrease in agricultural yields and an increase in tree mortality. Thus, they had a remarkable effect on carbon budgets and negative economic impacts. Consequently, a quantification of ecosystem responses to hotter droughts and a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms are crucial. In this context, the European hotter drought of the year 2018 may be considered a key event. As a first step towards the quantification of its causes and consequences, we here assess anomalies of atmospheric circulation patterns, maximum temperature, and climatic water balance as potential drivers of ecosystem responses which are quantified by remote sensing using the MODIS vegetation indices (VIs) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI). To place the drought of 2018 within a climatological context, we compare its climatic features and remotely sensed ecosystem response with the extreme hot drought of 2003. The year 2018 was characterized by a climatic dipole, featuring extremely hot and dry weather conditions north of the Alps but comparably cool and moist conditions across large parts of the Mediterranean. Analysing the ecosystem response of five dominant land cover classes, we found significant positive effects of climatic water balance on ecosystem VI response. Negative drought impacts appeared to affect an area 1.5 times larger and to be significantly stronger in July 2018 compared to August 2003, i.e. at the respective peak of drought. Moreover, we found a significantly higher sensitivity of pastures and arable land to climatic water balance compared to forests in both years. We explain the stronger coupling and higher sensitivity of ecosystem response in 2018 by the prevailing climatic dipole: while the generally water-limited ecosystems of the Mediterranean experienced above-average climatic water balance, the less drought-adapted ecosystems of central and northern Europe experienced a record hot drought. In conclusion, this study quantifies the drought of 2018 as a yet unprecedented event, outlines hotspots of drought-impacted areas in 2018 which should be given particular attention in follow-up studies, and provides valuable insights into the heterogeneous responses of the dominant European ecosystems to hotter drought.

AB This study aims at developing a robust and generic methodology, based on the use of high resolution remote sensing data to provide accurate estimates of maize biomass and yield over large areas (i.e. at regional scale). We propose here a strategy of calibration and spatialization independent as much as possible of in situ measurements and reliable over large areas and under various climatic conditions. For this purpose, we combine the Simple Algorithm For Yield estimates (SAFY) model with high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data from several sensors: Formosat-2, SPOT4-Take5, Landsat-8 and Deimos-1. SPOT4-Take5 experiment conducted in 2013 was designed to simulate the temporal sampling of ESA's Sentinel-2 mission. This study led to a new version of the SAFY model that takes into account the seasonal variation of specific leaf area (SLA) and effective light use efficiency (ELUE). The study takes place in a temperate agrosystem located in the south west of France. The SAFY outputs were validated with local measurements of biomass and yield estimates at both local and regional scales using a multiannual dataset. Good results were obtained for both local biomass (R = 0.98; RRMSE = 14%) and yield (R = 0.81; RRMSE = 8.9%), and for yield estimations at regional scale (R = 0.96; RRMSE = 4.6%). Results also showed that the use of a double logistic function to interpolate Green Area Index (GAI) time series permits to improve the estimations of biomass and yield when remote sensing data are missing. This work demonstrates the potential of high resolution remote sensing data to calibrate a simple crop model without resorting to in situ data and thus foreshadows the future applications using Sentinel-2 data.

AB Seascape genetics, a term coined in 2006, is a fast growing area of population genetics that draws on ecology, oceanography and geography to address challenges in basic understanding of marine connectivity and applications to management. We provide an accessible overview of the latest developments in seascape genetics that merge exciting new ideas from the field of marine population connectivity with statistical and technical advances in population genetics. After summarizing the historical context leading to the emergence of seascape genetics, we detail questions and methodological approaches that are evolving the discipline, highlight applications to conservation and management, and conclude with a summary of the field's transition to seascape genomics. From 100 seascape genetic studies, we assess trends in taxonomic and geographic coverage, sampling and statistical design, and dominant seascape drivers. Notably, temperature, oceanography and geography show equal prevalence of influence on spatial genetic patterns, and tests of over 20 other seascape factors suggest that a variety of forces impact connectivity at distinct spatio-temporal scales. A new level of rigor in statistical analysis is critical for disentangling multiple drivers and spurious effects. Coupled with GIS data and genomic scale sequencing methods, this rigor is taking seascape genetics beyond an initial focus on identifying correlations to hypothesis-driven insights into patterns and processes of population connectivity and adaptation. The latest studies are illuminating differences between demographic, functional and neutral genetic connectivity, and informing applications to marine reserve design, fisheries science and strategies to assess resilience to climate change and other anthropogenic impacts.

AB Maritime accidents involving ships carrying passengers may pose a high risk with respect to human casualties. For effective risk mitigation, an insight into the process of risk escalation is needed. This requires a proactive approach when it comes to risk modelling for maritime transportation systems. Most of the existing models are based on historical data on maritime accidents, and thus they can be considered reactive instead of proactive.
   This paper introduces a systematic, transferable and proactive framework estimating the risk for maritime transportation systems, meeting the requirements stemming from the adopted formal definition of risk. The framework focuses on ship-ship collisions in the open sea, with a RoRo/Passenger ship (RoPax) being considered as the struck ship. First, it covers an identification of the events that follow a collision between two ships in the open sea, and, second, it evaluates the probabilities of these events, concluding by determining the severity of a collision. The risk framework is developed with the use of Bayesian Belief Networks and utilizes a set of analytical methods for the estimation of the risk model parameters.
   Finally, a case study is presented, in which the risk framework developed here is applied to a maritime transportation system operating in the Gulf of Finland (GoF). The results obtained are compared to the historical data and available models, in which a RoPax was involved in a collision, and good agreement with the available records is found.

AB Delineating regions is an important first step in understanding the evolution and biogeography of faunas. However, quantitative approaches are often limited at a global scale, particularly in the marine realm. Reef fishes are the most diversified group of marine fishes, and compared to most other phyla, their taxonomy and geographical distributions are relatively well known. Based on 169 checklists spread across all tropical oceans, the present work aims to quantitatively delineate biogeographical entities for reef fishes at a global scale. Four different classifications were used to account for uncertainty related to species identification and the quality of checklists. The four classifications delivered converging results, with biogeographical entities that can be hierarchically delineated into realms, regions and provinces. All classifications indicated that the Indo-Pacific has a weak internal structure, with a high similarity from east to west. In contrast, the Atlantic and the Eastern Tropical Pacific were more strongly structured, which may be related to the higher levels of endemism in these two realms. The "Coral Triangle'', an area of the Indo-Pacific which contains the highest species diversity for reef fishes, was not clearly delineated by its species composition. Our results show a global concordance with recent works based upon endemism, environmental factors, expert knowledge, or their combination. Our quantitative delineation of biogeographical entities, however, tests the robustness of the results and yields easily replicated patterns. The similarity between our results and those from other phyla, such as corals, suggests that our approach may be of broad utility in describing and understanding global marine biodiversity patterns.

AB Adaptive evolution is currently accepted as playing a significant role in biological invasions. Adaptations relevant to invasions are typically thought to occur either recently within the introduced range, as an evolutionary response to novel selection regimes, or within the native range, because of long-term adaptation to the local environment. We propose that recent adaptation within the native range, in particular adaptations to human-altered habitat, could also contribute to the evolution of invasive populations. Populations adapted to human-altered habitats in the native range are likely to increase in abundance within areas frequented by humans and associated with human transport mechanisms, thus enhancing the likelihood of transport to a novel range. Given that habitats are altered by humans in similar ways worldwide, as evidenced by global environmental homogenization, propagules from populations adapted to human-altered habitats in the native range should perform well within similarly human-altered habitats in the novel range. We label this scenario Anthropogenically Induced Adaptation to Invade. We illustrate how it differs from other evolutionary processes that may occur during invasions, and how it can help explain accelerating rates of invasions.

AB Aim This study compares the direct, macroecological approach (MEM) for modelling species richness (SR) with the more recent approach of stacking predictions from individual species distributions (S-SDM). We implemented both approaches on the same dataset and discuss their respective theoretical assumptions, strengths and drawbacks. We also tested how both approaches performed in reproducing observed patterns of SR along an elevational gradient.
   Location Two study areas in the Alps of Switzerland.
   Methods We implemented MEM by relating the species counts to environmental predictors with statistical models, assuming a Poisson distribution. S-SDM was implemented by modelling each species distribution individually and then stacking the obtained prediction maps in three different ways - summing binary predictions, summing random draws of binomial trials and summing predicted probabilities - to obtain a final species count.
   Results The direct MEM approach yields nearly unbiased predictions centred around the observed mean values, but with a lower correlation between predictions and observations, than that achieved by the S-SDM approaches. This method also cannot provide any information on species identity and, thus, community composition. It does, however, accurately reproduce the hump-shaped pattern of SR observed along the elevational gradient. The S-SDM approach summing binary maps can predict individual species and thus communities, but tends to overpredict SR. The two other S-SDM approaches the summed binomial trials based on predicted probabilities and summed predicted probabilities - do not overpredict richness, but they predict many competing end points of assembly or they lose the individual species predictions, respectively. Furthermore, all S-SDM approaches fail to appropriately reproduce the observed hump-shaped patterns of SR along the elevational gradient.
   Main conclusions Macroecological approach and S-SDM have complementary strengths. We suggest that both could be used in combination to obtain better SR predictions by following the suggestion of constraining S-SDM by MEM predictions.

AB Aim Species distribution modelling is commonly used to guide future conservation policies in the light of potential climate change. However, arbitrary decisions during the model-building process can affect predictions and contribute to uncertainty about where suitable climate space will exist. For many species, the key climatic factors limiting distributions are unknown. This paper assesses the uncertainty generated by using different climate predictor variable sets for modelling the impacts of climate change.
   Location Europe, 10 degrees W to 50 degrees E and 30 degrees N to 60 degrees N.
   Methods Using 1453 presence pixels at 30 arcsec resolution for the great bustard (Otis tarda), predictions of future distribution were made based on two emissions scenarios, three general climate models and 26 sets of predictor variables. Twenty-six current models were created, and 156 for both 2050 and 2080. Map comparison techniques were used to compare predictions in terms of the quantity and the location of presences (map comparison kappa, MCK) and using a range change index (RCI). Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to partition explained deviance in MCK and RCI among sources of uncertainty.
   Results The 26 different variable sets achieved high values of AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and yet introduced substantial variation into maps of current distribution. Differences between maps were even greater when distributions were projected into the future. Some 64-78% of the variation between future maps was attributable to choice of predictor variable set alone. Choice of general climate model and emissions scenario contributed a maximum of 15% variation and their order of importance differed for MCK and RCI.
   Main conclusions Generalized variable sets produce an unmanageable level of uncertainty in species distribution models which cannot be ignored. The use of sound ecological theory and statistical methods to check predictor variables can reduce this uncertainty, but our knowledge of species may be too limited to make more than arbitrary choices. When all sources of modelling uncertainty are considered together, it is doubtful whether ensemble methods offer an adequate solution. Future studies should explicitly acknowledge uncertainty due to arbitrary choices in the model-building process and develop ways to convey the results to decision-makers.

AB Noise pollution from human traffic networks and industrial activity impacts vast areas of our planet. While anthropogenic noise effects on animal communication are well documented, we have very limited understanding of noise impact on more complex ecosystem processes, such as predator-prey interactions, albeit urgently needed to devise mitigation measures. Here, we show that traffic noise decreases the foraging efficiency of an acoustic predator, the greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis). These bats feed on large, ground-running arthropods that they find by listening to their faint rustling sounds. We measured the bats' foraging performance on a continuous scale of acoustically simulated highway distances in a behavioural experiment, designed to rule out confounding factors such as general noise avoidance. Successful foraging bouts decreased and search time drastically increased with proximity to the highway. At 7.5 m to the road, search time was increased by a factor of five. From this increase, we predict a 25-fold decrease in surveyed ground area and thus in foraging efficiency for a wild bat. As most of the bats' prey are predators themselves, the noise impact on the bats' foraging performance will have complex effects on the food web and ultimately on the ecosystem stability. Similar scenarios apply to other ecologically important and highly protected acoustic predators, e. g. owls. Our study provides the empirical basis for quantitative predictions of anthropogenic noise impacts on ecosystem processes. It highlights that an understanding of the effects of noise emissions and other forms of 'sensory pollution' are crucially important for the assessment of environmental impact of human activities.

AB We present a method to test the statistical significance of a quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstruction inferred from biotic assemblages with a transfer function. A reconstruction is considered statistically significant if it explains more of the variance in the fossil data than most reconstructions derived from transfer functions trained on random environmental data. Given reconstructions of several environmental variables from the same fossil proxy, the method can determine which is the best reconstruction, and if there is sufficient information in the proxy data to support multiple independent reconstructions. Reconstructions that fail this test have limited credibility and should be interpreted with considerable caution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Mediterranean Sea is a hotspot of biodiversity, and climate warming is expected to have a significant influence on its endemic fish species. However, no previous studies have predicted whether fish species will experience geographic range extensions or contractions as a consequence of warming. Here, we projected the potential future climatic niches of 75 Mediterranean Sea endemic fish species based on a global warming scenario implemented with the Mediterranean model OPAMED8 and a multimodel inference, which included uncertainty. By 2070-2099, the average surface temperature of the Mediterranean Sea was projected to warm by 3.1 degrees C. Projections for 2041-2060 are that 25 species would qualify for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List, and six species would become extinct. By 2070-2099, 45 species were expected to qualify for the IUCN Red List whereas 14 were expected to become extinct. By the middle of the 21st century, the coldest areas of the Mediterranean Sea (Adriatic Sea and Gulf of Lion) would act as a refuge for cold-water species, but by the end of the century, those areas were projected to become a 'cul-de-sac' that would drive those species towards extinction. In addition, the range size of endemic species was projected to undergo extensive fragmentation, which is a potentially aggravating factor. Since a majority of endemic fishes are specialists, regarding substratum and diet, we may expect a reduced ability to track projected climatic niches. As a whole, 25% of the Mediterranean Sea continental shelf was predicted to experience a total modification of endemic species assemblages by the end of the 21st century. This expected turnover rate could be mitigated by marine protected areas or accelerated by fishing pressure or competition from exotic fishes. It remains a challenge to predict how these assemblage modifications might affect ecosystem function.

AB The pea aphid genome includes 66 genes contributing to amino acid biosynthesis and 93 genes to amino acid degradation. In several respects, the pea aphid gene inventory complements that of its symbiotic bacterium, Buchnera aphidicola (Buchnera APS). Unlike other insects with completely sequenced genomes, the pea aphid lacks the capacity to synthesize arginine, which is produced by Buchnera APS. However, consistent with other insects, it has genes coding for individual reactions in essential amino acid biosynthesis, including threonine dehydratase and branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase, which are not coded in the Buchnera APS genome. Overall the genome data suggest that the biosynthesis of certain essential amino acids is shared between the pea aphid and Buchnera APS, providing the opportunity for precise aphid control over Buchnera metabolism.

TI Lag-phases in alien plant invasions: separating the facts from the

SO OIKOS

AB Temporal trends in biological invasions are often described by a lag-phase of little or no increase in species occurrence followed by an increase-phase in which species occurrence rises rapidly. While several biological and environmental mechanisms may underlie lag-phases, they may also represent statistical artefacts or temporal changes in sampling effort. To date, distinguishing the facts from these artefacts has not been possible. Here we describe a method for estimating the lag-phase in Cumulative records of species occurrence, using a piecewise regression model that explicitly differentiates the lag and increase phases. We used the von Bertalanffy, logistic, linear and exponential functions to model the increase phase, and identified the best-fitting function using model selection techniques. We confirmed the accuracy of our method using simulated data and then estimated the length of the lag-phase (t(lag)), the maximum collection rate (r) and the projected asymptotic number of records (K) using herbarium records for 105 weed species in New Zealand, while accounting for changes in sampling effort. Nearly all the New Zealand weed species had a lag-phase, which averaged around 20-30 years, with 4% of species having a lag-phase greater than 40 years. In more than two thirds of the cases, the accumulation of records was best modelled with the decelerating von Bertalanffy function, despite the tendency for temporal variation in sampling effort to force cumulative herbarium records to follow the sigmoidal shape of a logistic curve. A positive correlation between r and K is consistent with the assumption that the Final distribution of an alien plant species reflects its rate of spread. Seemingly rare but fast-spreading aliens may thus become tomorrow's noxious weeds. A positive correlation between inflection year and r warns that the weeds that have only begun to spread relatively recently may spread faster than previously known invaders.

AB Mate choice studies routinely assume female preferences for indicators of high quality in males but rarely consider developmental causes of within-population variation in mating preferences. By contrast, recent mate choice models assume that costs and benefits of searching or competing for high-quality males depend on females' phenotypic quality. A prediction following from these models is that manipulation of female quality should alter her choosiness or even the direction of her mating preferences. We here provide (to our knowledge) the first example where an experimental manipulation of female quality induced a mating preference for low-quality males. Zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) reared in small or large experimental broods became high-or low-quality adults, respectively. Only high-quality females preferred high-quality males' mate-advertising songs, while all low-quality females preferred low-quality males' song. Subsequent breeding trials confirmed this pattern: latency until egg laying was shortest in quality-matched pairs, indicating that quality-matched birds were accepted faster as partners. Females produced larger eggs when mated with high-quality males, regardless of their own quality, indicating consensus regarding male quality despite the expression of different choices. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering the development of mating preferences to understand their within-population variation and environmentally induced change.

AB Alien predators can have catastrophic effects on ecosystems and are thought to be much more harmful to biodiversity than their native counterparts. However, trophic cascade theory and the mesopredator release hypothesis predict that the removal of top predators will result in the reorganization of trophic webs and loss of biodiversity. Using field data collected throughout arid Australia, we provide evidence that removal of an alien top-predator, the dingo, has cascading effects through lower trophic levels. Dingo removal was linked to increased activity of herbivores and an invasive mesopredator, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and to the loss of grass cover and native species of small mammals. Using species distribution data, we predict that reintroducing or maintaining dingo populations would produce a net benefit for the conservation of threatened native mammals across greater than 2.42 x 10(6) km(2) of Australia. Our study provides evidence that an alien top predator can assume a keystone role and be beneficial for biodiversity conservation, and also that mammalian carnivores more generally can generate strong trophic cascades in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Since the first Butterfly Monitoring Scheme in the UK started in the mid-1970s, butterfly monitoring in Europe has developed in more than ten European countries. These schemes are aimed to assess regional and national trends in butterfly abundance per species. We discuss strengths and weaknesses of methods used in these schemes and give examples of applications of the data. A new development is to establish supra-national trends per species and multispecies indicators. Such indicators enable to report against the target to halt biodiversity loss by 2010. Our preliminary European Grassland Butterfly Indicator shows a decline of 50% between 1990 and 2005. We expect to develop a Grassland Butterfly Indicator with an improved coverage across European countries. We see also good perspectives to develop a supra-national indicator for climate change as well as an indicator for woodland butterflies.

   FLAGELLAR PROPULSION; LEPOMIS-MACROCHIRUS; PASSERINE BIRDS
AB Background: Using information from physics, biomechanics and evolutionary biology, we explore the implications of physical constraints on sperm performance, and review empirical evidence for links between sperm length and sperm competition (where two or more males compete to fertilise a female's eggs). A common theme in the literature on sperm competition is that selection for increased sperm performance in polyandrous species will favour the evolution of longer, and therefore faster swimming, sperm. This argument is based on the common assumption that sperm swimming velocity is directly related to sperm length, due to the increased thrust produced by longer flagella.
   Results: We critically evaluate the evidence for links between sperm morphology and swimming speed, and draw on cross-disciplinary studies to show that the assumption that velocity is directly related to sperm length will rarely be satisfied in the microscopic world in which sperm operate.
   Conclusion: We show that increased sperm length is unlikely to be driven by selection for increased swimming speed, and that the relative lengths of a sperm's constituent parts, rather than their absolute lengths, are likely to be the target of selection. All else being equal, we suggest that a simple measure of the ratio of head to tail length should be used to assess the possible link between morphology and speed. However, this is most likely to be the case for external fertilizers in which females have relatively limited opportunity to influence a sperm's motility.

Hence, new approaches to O-3 risk assessment and their validation are required, although appropriate databases for adult trees are scant. Approaches based on external O-3 exposure are presently being evaluated against the ones on O-3 flux into leaves, as the cumulative uptake has the capacity for deriving O-3 risk from cause-effect relationships. The effective dose, however, needs to account for the trees' O-3 defence and tolerance in addition to O-3 uptake. The current status of promoting the preferable mechanistic O-3 flux concept is highlighted for major regions of Europe, addressing refinements and simplifications needed for routine use. At the pan-European scale, however, the flux-based concept is ready for use in O-3 risk assessment and has the potential of meso-scale application at the forest ecosystem level.

AB The relationships between ecosystem-level light use efficiency (LUE) obtained from an eddy covariance flux tower and MODIS-derived values of a scaled Photochemical Reflectance Index (sPRI) were investigated for a boreal aspen stand (Populus tremuloides Michx.) in Saskatchewan, Canada. Using MODIS ocean band 11 at 531 nm, we tried to detect variations in canopy reflectance related to the xanthophyll cycle. We tested several other MODIS bands as the reference band because the 570 nm reference band that had been determined to be optimum for calculating PRI in earlier studies is not available on MODIS.
   While LUE varied greatly within the 2001, 2002, and 2003 growing seasons, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from tower sensors remained stable. LUE had a negative exponential relationship with vapor pressure deficit and air temperature, and was at a maximum when absorbed PAR was <200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The range and magnitude of tower-based LUE values were smaller on clear days, when MODIS acquisitions were possible, than they were overall. Furthermore, the orbital parameters of the Terra and Aqua satellites restricted MODIS acquisitions to a 2.5-h period in early afternoon at out study site when LUE values were typically lower than they were earlier in the day.
   Strong correlations between MODIS-sPRI and LUE were found only for backscatter reflectance scenes when band 13 (667 nm) was used as the reference band. The correlations were higher for sPRI calculated from top of atmosphere reflectances than for surface reflectances (r(2) = 0.76 and 0.53, respectively). The absolute backscatter reflectance of bands 11, 12 (551 nm), and 13 all decreased with increasing LUE. The decrease in band 13 suggests that the correlation between sPRI and LUE that we observed was caused by reductions in canopy chlorophyll content from 2001 to 2003 and/or by increased visibility of brighter non-photosynthetic material. Regional values of sPRI from 260 deciduous forest pixels in the 10,000 km(2) Vicinity of the tower for two contrasting days, one in 2001 and one in 2003, were consistent with that observed for the flux tower footprint.

AB Between 1973 and 2003 mean morphological features of the cactus finch, Geospiza scandens, and the medium ground finch, G. fortis, populations on the Galapagos island of Daphne Major were subject to fluctuating directional selection. An increase in bluntness or robustness in the beak of G. scandens after 1990 can only partly be explained by selection. We use 16 microsatellite loci to test predictions of the previously proposed hypothesis that introgressive hybridization contributed to the trend, resulting in genes flowing predominantly from G. fortis to G. scandens. To identify F-1 hybrids and backcrosses we use pedigrees where known, supplemented by the results of assignment tests based on 14 autosomal loci when parents were not known. We analyze changes in morphology and allelic composition in the two populations over a period of 15-20 years. With samples that included F-1 hybrids and backcrosses, the G. scandens population became more similar to the G. fortis population both genetically and morphologically. Gene flow between species was estimated to be three times greater from G. fortis to G. scandens than in the opposite direction, resulting in a 20% reduction in the genetic difference between the species. Nevertheless, removing identified F-1 hybrids and backcrosses from the total sample and reanalyzing the traits did not eliminate the convergence. The two species also converged in beak shape by 22.2% and in body size by 45.5%. A combination of introgressive hybridization and selection jointly provide the best explanation of convergence in morphology and genetic constitution under the changed ecological conditions following a major El Nino event in 1983. The study illustrates how species without postmating barriers to gene exchange can alternate between convergence and divergence when environmental conditions oscillate.

AB Although the design of participatory processes to manage social-ecological systems needs to be adapted to local contexts, it is unclear which elements of process design might be universal. We use empirical evidence to analyze the extent to which context and process design can enable or impede stakeholder participation and facilitate beneficial environmental and social outcomes. To explore the role of design and minor variations in local context on the outcomes of participatory processes, we interviewed participants and facilitators from 11 case studies in which different process designs were used to select sustainable land management options in Spain and Portugal. We analyzed interview data using quantitative and qualitative approaches. Results showed that although some aspects of local context affected process outcomes, factors associated with process design were more significant. Processes leading to more beneficial environmental and social outcomes included the following: the legitimate representation of stakeholders; professional facilitation including structured methods for aggregating information and balancing power dynamics among participants; and provision of information and decision-making power to all participants. Although processes initiated or facilitated by government bodies led to significantly less trust, information gain, and learning, decisions in these processes were more likely to be accepted and implemented. To further test the role of context in determining the outcomes of participation, we interviewed facilitators from a process that was replicated across 13 dryland study sites around the world, reflecting much greater national variations in context. The similarity of outcomes across these sites suggested that the socio-cultural context in which the process was replicated had little impact on its outcomes, as long as certain design principles were fulfilled. Overall, our findings provide a solid empirical basis for good practice in the design of participatory processes in the management of social-ecological systems.

AB Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in plant tissue are frequently quantified to make inferences about plant responses to environmental conditions. Laboratories publishing estimates of NSC of woody plants use many different methods to evaluate NSC. We asked whether NSC estimates in the recent literature could be quantitatively compared among studies. We also asked whether any differences among laboratories were related to the extraction and quantification methods used to determine starch and sugar concentrations. These questions were addressed by sending sub-samples collected from five woody plant tissues, which varied in NSC content and chemical composition, to 29 laboratories. Each laboratory analyzed the samples with their laboratory-specific protocols, based on recent publications, to determine concentrations of soluble sugars, starch and their sum, total NSC. Laboratory estimates differed substantially for all samples. For example, estimates for Eucalyptus globulus leaves (EGL) varied from 23 to 116 (mean = 56) mg g(-1) for soluble sugars, 6-533 (mean = 94) mg g-1 for starch and 53-649 (mean = 153) mg g-1 for total NSC. Mixed model analysis of variance showed that much of the variability among laboratories was unrelated to the categories we used for extraction and quantification methods (method category R-2 = 0.05-0.12 for soluble sugars, 0.10-0.33 for starch and 0.01-0.09 for total NSC). For EGL, the difference between the highest and lowest least squares means for categories in the mixed model analysis was 33 mg g-1 for total NSC, compared with the range of laboratory estimates of 596 mg g-1. Laboratories were reasonably consistent in their ranks of estimates among tissues for starch (r = 0.41-0.91), but less so for total NSC (r = 0.45-0.84) and soluble sugars (r = 0.11-0.83). Our results show that NSC estimates for woody plant tissues cannot be compared among laboratories. The relative changes in NSC between treatments measured within a laboratory may be comparable within and between laboratories, especially for starch. To obtain comparable NSC estimates, we suggest that users can either adopt the reference method given in this publication, or report estimates for a portion of samples using the reference method, and report estimates for a standard reference material. Researchers interested in NSC estimates should work to identify and adopt standard methods.

AB A common suggestion to support ecosystem services to agriculture provided by mobile organisms is to increase the amount of natural and seminatural habitat in the landscape. This might, however, be inefficient, and demands for agricultural products limit the feasibility of converting arable land into natural habitat. To develop more targeted means to promote ecosystem services, we need a solid understanding of the limitations to population growth for service-providing organisms. We propose a research agenda that identifies resource bottlenecks and interruptions over time to key beneficial organisms, emphasising their resulting population dynamics. Targeted measures that secure the continuity of resources throughout the life cycle of service-providing organisms are likely to effectively increase the stock, flow, and stability of ecosystem services.

AB Minimum energy (as photon) costs are predicted for core reactions of photosynthesis, for photorespiratory metabolism in algae lacking CO2 concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) and for various types of CCMs; in algae, with CCMs; allowance was made for leakage of CO2 from the internal pool. These predicted values are just compatible with the minimum measured photon costs of photosynthesis in microalgae and macroalgae lacking or expressing CCMs. More energy-expensive photorespiration, for example for organisms using Rubiscos with lower CO2-O-2 selectivity coefficients, would be less readily accommodated within the lowest measured photon costs of photosynthesis by algae lacking CCMs. The same applies to the cases of CCMs with higher energy costs of active transport of protons or inorganic carbon species, or greater allowance for significant leakage from the accumulated intracellular pool of CO2. High energetic efficiency can involve a higher concentration of catalyst to achieve a given rate of reaction, adding to the resource costs of growth. There are no obvious mechanistic interpretations of the occurrence of CCMs algae adapted to low light and low temperatures using the rationales adopted for the occurrence of C-4 photosynthesis in terrestrial flowering plants. There is an exception for cyanobacteria with low-selectivity Form IA or IB Rubiscos, and those dinoflagellates with low-selectivity Form II Rubiscos, for which very few natural environments have high enough CO2:O-2 ratios to allow photosynthesis in the absence of CCMs.

AB Close hydraulic connection between the xylem and the phloem challenges phloem transport during drought. Current theories suggest that the cause of phloem transport failure during drought depends on the hydraulic permeability of phloem conduit walls.Drought challenges plant water uptake and the vascular system. In the xylem it causes embolism that impairs water transport from the soil to the leaves and, if uncontrolled, may even lead to plant mortality via hydraulic failure. What happens in the phloem, however, is less clear because measuring phloem transport is still a significant challenge to plant science. In all vascular plants, phloem and xylem tissues are located next to each other, and there is clear evidence that these tissues exchange water. Therefore, drought should also lead to water shortage in the phloem. In this review, theories used in phloem transport models have been applied to drought conditions, with the goal of shedding light on how phloem transport failure might occur. The review revealed that phloem failure could occur either because of viscosity build-up at the source sites or by a failure to maintain phloem water status and cell turgor. Which one of these dominates depends on the hydraulic permeability of phloem conduit walls. Impermeable walls will lead to viscosity build-up affecting flow rates, while permeable walls make the plant more susceptible to phloem turgor failure. Current empirical evidence suggests that phloem failure resulting from phloem turgor collapse is the more likely mechanism at least in relatively isohydric plants.

AB Recent studies from mountainous areas of small spatial extent (<2500km2) suggest that fine-grained thermal variability over tens or hundreds of metres exceeds much of the climate warming expected for the coming decades. Such variability in temperature provides buffering to mitigate climate-change impacts. Is this local spatial buffering restricted to topographically complex terrains? To answer this, we here study fine-grained thermal variability across a 2500-km wide latitudinal gradient in Northern Europe encompassing a large array of topographic complexities. We first combined plant community data, Ellenberg temperature indicator values, locally measured temperatures (LmT) and globally interpolated temperatures (GiT) in a modelling framework to infer biologically relevant temperature conditions from plant assemblages within <1000-m2 units (community-inferred temperatures: CiT). We then assessed: (1) CiT range (thermal variability) within 1-km2 units; (2) the relationship between CiT range and topographically and geographically derived predictors at 1-km resolution; and (3) whether spatial turnover in CiT is greater than spatial turnover in GiT within 100-km2 units. Ellenberg temperature indicator values in combination with plant assemblages explained 4672% of variation in LmT and 9296% of variation in GiT during the growing season (June, July, August). Growing-season CiT range within 1-km2 units peaked at 6065 degrees N and increased with terrain roughness, averaging 1.97 degrees C (SD=0.84 degrees C) and 2.68 degrees C (SD=1.26 degrees C) within the flattest and roughest units respectively. Complex interactions between topography-related variables and latitude explained 35% of variation in growing-season CiT range when accounting for sampling effort and residual spatial autocorrelation. Spatial turnover in growing-season CiT within 100-km2 units was, on average, 1.8 times greater (0.32 degrees Ckm1) than spatial turnover in growing-season GiT (0.18 degrees Ckm1). We conclude that thermal variability within 1-km2 units strongly increases local spatial buffering of future climate warming across Northern Europe, even in the flattest terrains.

AB 1. Functional trait diversity can reveal mechanisms of species coexistence in plant communities. Few studies have tested whether functional diversity for foliar traits related to resource-use strategy increases or decreases with declining soil phosphorus (P) in forest communities.
   2. We quantified tree basal area and four foliar functional traits (i.e. nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), thickness and tissue density) for all woody species along the c. 120 000 year Franz Josef soil chronosequence in cool temperate rain forest, where strong shifts occur in light and soil nutrient availability (i.e. total soil P declines from 805 to 100 mg kg(-1)). We combined the abundance and trait data in functional diversity indices to quantify trait convergence and divergence, in an effort to determine whether mechanisms of coexistence change with soil fertility.
   3. Relationships between species trait means and total soil N and P were examined using multiple regression, with and without weighting of species abundances. We used Rao's quadratic entropy to quantify functional diversity at the plot scale, then compared this with random expectation, using a null model that randomizes abundances across species within plots. Taxonomic diversity was measured using Simpson's Diversity. Relationships between functional and taxonomic diversity and total soil P were examined using jackknife linear regression.
   4. Leaf N and P declined and leaf thickness and density increased monotonically with declining total soil P along the sequence; these relationships were unaffected by abundance weighting of species in the analyses. Inclusion of total soil N did not improve predictions of trait means. All measures of diversity calculated from presence/absence data were unrelated to total soil N and P. There was no evidence for a relationship between Rao values using quantitative abundances and total soil P. However, there was a strong positive relationship between Rao, expressed relative to random expectation, and total soil P, indicating trait convergence of dominant species as soil P declined.
   5. Synthesis: Our results demonstrate that at high fertility locally dominant species differ in resource-use strategy, but as soil fertility declines over the long term, dominant species increasingly converge on a resource-retentive strategy. This suggests that differentiation in resource-use strategy is required for coexistence at high-fertility but not in low-fertility ecosystems.

AB P>Ecologists still puzzle over how plant species manage to coexist with one another while competing for the same essential resources. The classic answer for animal communities is that species occupy different niches, but how plants do this is more difficult to determine. We previously found niche segregation along fine-scale hydrological gradients in European wet meadows and proposed that the mechanism might be a general one, especially in communities that experience seasonal saturation.
   We quantified the hydrological niches of 96 species from eight fynbos communities in the biodiversity hotspot of the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa and 99 species from 18 lowland wet meadow communities in the UK. Niche overlap was computed for all combinations of species.
   Despite the extreme functional and phylogenetic differences between the fynbos and wet meadow communities, an identical trade-off (i.e. specialization of species towards tolerance of aeration and/or drying stress) was found to cause segregation along fine-scale hydrological gradients.
   This study not only confirms the predicted generality of hydrological niche segregation, but also emphasizes its importance for structuring plant communities. Eco-hydrological niche segregation will have implications for conservation in habitats that face changing hydrology caused by water abstraction and climate change.

AB An understanding of how top mammalian carnivores respond to urbanization is important for conservation and management of human-wildlife conflicts. Coyotes (Canis latrans) have recently become more prevalent in many metropolitan areas; however, their apparent success is poorly understood. We estimated home-range size and selection of land-use types for coyotes in a heavily urbanized landscape, with a particular focus on responses of coyotes to those parts of the urban landscape with high levels of human development or activity. Mean (+/- SE) annual home ranges of transient coyotes ((X) over bar = 26.80 +/- 2.95 km(2)) were larger than those of resident coyotes ((X) over bar = 4.95 +/- 0.34 km(2).), and home-range size for resisdent coyotes did not vary among seasons or between age and sex classes. Although most home ranges were associated with natural patches of habitat, there was considerable variation among coyotes, with some home ranges entirely lacking patches of natural habitat. Within home ranges, coyotes typically avoided land-use types associated with human activity (i.e., Residential, Urban Grass, and Urban Land) regardless of coyote characteristics, seasons, and activity periods. Few coyotes were nuisances, and conflicts occurred when coyotes were sick or exposed to wildlife feeding by humans. We found little evidence that coyotes were attracted to areas associated with hurnan activity, despite at times having home ranges located in heavily developed areas.

AB Almost half a century after Whittaker (Ecol Monogr 30:279-338, 1960) proposed his influential diversity concept, it is time for a critical reappraisal. Although the terms alpha, beta and gamma diversity introduced by Whittaker have become general textbook knowledge, the concept suffers from several drawbacks. First, alpha and gamma diversity share the same characteristics and are differentiated only by the scale at which they are applied. However, as scale is relative--depending on the organism(s) or ecosystems investigated--this is not a meaningful ecological criterion. Alpha and gamma diversity can instead be grouped together under the term "inventory diversity." Out of the three levels proposed by Whittaker, beta diversity is the one which receives the most contradictory comments regarding its usefulness ("key concept" vs. "abstruse concept"). Obviously beta diversity means different things to different people. Apart from the large variety of methods used to investigate it, the main reason for this may be different underlying data characteristics. A literature review reveals that the multitude of measures used to assess beta diversity can be sorted into two conceptually different groups. The first group directly takes species distinction into account and compares the similarity of sites (similarity indices, slope of the distance decay relationship, length of the ordination axis, and sum of squares of a species matrix). The second group relates species richness (or other summary diversity measures) of two (or more) different scales to each other (additive and multiplicative partitioning). Due to that important distinction, we suggest that beta diversity should be split into two levels, "differentiation diversity" (first group) and "proportional diversity" (second group). Thus, we propose to use the terms "inventory diversity" for within-sample diversity, "differentiation diversity" for compositional similarity between samples, and "proportional diversity" for the comparison of inventory diversity across spatial and temporal scales.

AB The application of phylogenetic inference methods, to data for a set of independent genes sampled randomly throughout the genome, often results in substantial incongruence in the single-gene phylogenetic estimates. Among the processes known to produce discord between single-gene phylogenies, two of the best studied in a phylogenetic context are hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting. Much recent attention has focused on the development of methods for estimating species phylogenies in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting, but phylogenetic models that allow for hybridization have been more limited. Here we propose a model that allows incongruence in single-gene phylogenies to be due to both hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting, with the goal of determining the contribution of hybridization to observed gene tree incongruence in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting. Using our model, we propose methods for estimating the extent of the role of hybridization in both a likelihood and a Bayesian framework. The performance of our methods is examined using both simulated and empirical data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of irradiance on leaf construction costs, chemical composition, and on the payback time of leaves was investigated. To enable more generalized conclusions, three different systems were studied: top and the most-shaded leaves of 10 adult tree species in a European mixed forest, top leaves of sub-dominant trees of two evergreen species growing in small gaps or below the canopy in an Amazonian rainforest, and plants of six herbaceous and four woody species grown hydroponically at low or high irradiance in growth cabinets. Daily photon irradiance varied 3-6-fold between low- and high-light leaves. Specific leaf area (SLA) was 30-130% higher at low light. Construction costs, on the other hand, were 1-5% lower for low-irradiance leaves, mainly because low-irradiance leaves had lower concentrations of soluble phenolics. Photosynthetic capacity and respiration, expressed per unit leaf mass, were hardly different for the low- and high-light leaves. Estimates of payback times of the high-irradiance leaves ranged from 2-4 d in the growth cabinets, to 15-20 d for the adult tree species in the European forest. Low-irradiance leaves had payback times that were 2-3 times larger, ranging from 4 d in the growth cabinets to 20-80 d at the most shaded part of the canopy of the mixed forest. In all cases, estimated payback times were less than half the life span of the leaves, suggesting that even at time-integrated irradiances lower than 5% of the total seasonal value, investment in leaves is still fruitful from a carbon-economy point of view. A sensitivity analysis showed that increased SLA of low-irradiance leaves was the main factor constraining payback times. Acclimation in the other five factors determining payback time, namely construction costs, photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf mass, respiration per unit leaf mass, apparent quantum yield, and curvature of the photosynthetic light-response-curve, were unimportant when the observed variation in each factor was examined.

AB The nature of the landscape matrix can control the capacity of forest organisms to move among forest patches. Some matrices may constitute foraging or breeding habitat and, as a result, could influence the local abundance of forest organisms and their persistence in fragmented landscapes. This study represents a first approach to examining the effect of natural vs. anthropogenic landscape matrices on the abundance of neotropical birds in forest sites. The influence of three contrasting matrices on the relative abundance of 113 bird species in a subandean region was evaluated. Species were grouped into categories showing the same response to the matrix, and these groups were then examined to determine whether ecological characteristics or taxonomic affinities were associated with responses to surrounding matrices. The abundance of individual species in forest plots within a continuous forest matrix was compared with their abundance in forest fragments embedded in pastures or exotic-tree plantations. The matrix surrounding forest areas was a major factor influencing bird abundance: 65.5% of the species showed significant differences in abundance among sites surrounded by different matrices. The most important explanatory factors in the variation in: abundance within fragments were: abundance within continuous forest, presence in the anthropogenic matrices, migratory strategy, and habitat association. Species with small geographic ranges and species of terrestrial insectivores had low tolerance to fragmentation. Responses were highly species specific and largely independent of foraging strata, trophic group, and taxonomic affinities. Several lines of evidence indicate an increased connectivity among forest remnants surrounded by exotic-tree plantations compared to pastures. Landscape supplementation by the exotic-tree plantation matrix was observed for a hummingbird species. These results suggest that structurally complex anthropogenic matrices have potential as management tools for bird conservation by complementing habitat protection and restoration.

AB Previous studies of cod Gadus morhua population structure in European continental waters using molecular genetic markers have indicated high dispersal and limited structuring, in contrast to many tagging studies. More sensitive genetic techniques, in the form of microsatellite analysis, were used to reanalyse the population structure through the specific targeting of mature fish on spawning grounds. Significantly greater levels of differentiation were found than in previous studies, supporting the presence of 4 genetically distinct populations within the North Sea: Bergen Bank, Moray Firth, Flamborough Head and Southern Bight. Gene flow between the southern North Sea and eastern English Channel is largely restricted to populations within the Southern Bight (southern North Sea) and Beachy Head (eastern English Channel). The spawning stock in the central English Channel (Start Point) remains distinct from those in the Celtic Sea, Outer Hebrides, and central and northern North Sea. No evidence of sub-structuring within the Irish and Celtic Seas was found, in contrast to previous genetic studies, although the populations remained divergent from that of the Outer Hebrides. All European populations were significantly divergent from Canadian Scotian Shelf and Barents Sea (Bear Island) populations. The study indicates that the current fishery monitoring systems may need to be reassessed, particularly with respect to the North Sea, and highlights the value of using microsatellites combined with the targeting of spawning stocks to investigate subtle population structuring.

AB Umbrella species, species whose protection serves to protect many cooccurring species, have been proposed as a shortcut for conservation planning. Potential criteria for selection of umbrella species include rarity, sensitivity to human disturbance, and mean percentage of co-occurring species. Using butterflies in montane canyons in the Great Basin (USA) as a case study, we examined correlations among those three selection methods. We also developed a new index that specifically ranks species according to their potential to serve as umbrellas for their taxonomic group. Different methods for prioritizing species generally produced divergent rankings. Although rare butterflies tended to co-occur with more species than widespread butterflies, rare species may be poor umbrellas because their distributions are too highly restricted and often cannot be influenced by managers. Umbrella species are useful in meeting certain conservation challenges, particularly prioritization of habitat remnants for conservation or other land uses. Our work demonstrates that a subset of a fauna may serve as an effective umbrella for a larger ecological community, and therefore play an important role in contemporary management planning.

AB A study was carried out to determine the effect of feeding level and water temperature on growth and feed efficiency, nutrient and energy utilization and waste outputs of rainbow trout. A practical diet was fed to near-satiation to groups of fish reared at 6, 9, 12 and 15 degrees C. At each temperature, the feed intake of other groups of fish was restricted to about 85 % or 70 % of the amount of feed consumed in the previous week by the fish fed to near-satiation. Total feed intakes over 12 weeks were, on average, 76 % and 65 % of total feed intake of the near-satiety group for R1 and R2, respectively. Reducing the feed allocation resulted in significantly (P < 0.05) lower weight gains compared to feeding to near-satiation regardless of the rearing temperature. Feeding level and water temperature had no significant (P > 0.05) effect on feed efficiency, carcass composition or efficiencies of digestible nitrogen and digestible energy retention. Increasing temperature resulted in an increase in the apparent digestibility of dietary dry matter, nitrogen and energy (P < 0.05). The increase in digestibility of dry matter and nitrogen with increasing temperature resulted in higher estimated total solid and solid nitrogen waste outputs per kg fish produced (P < 0.05) at lower water temperatures. Estimated dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus waste outputs (g/kg fish produced) were not affected by the feeding level or water temperature. A highly significant (P < 0.01) linear relationship was observed between metabolizable energy (ME) intake above basal metabolism and recovered energy. The efficiency of ME utilization for growth (K-pf) was 0.61 and this coefficient was not affected by feed intake or water temperature. Protein and lipid were deposited in a constant ratio (1 kJ protein gain:1.4 kJ lipid gain) regardless of ME intake or water temperature. (C) Ifremer/Elsevier, Paris.

AB Because of their rapid mutation rate and resulting large number of alleles, microsatellite DNA are well suited to examine the genetic or demographic structure of fish populations. However, the large number of alleles imply that large sample sizes are required for accurate reflection of genotypic frequencies. Estimates of genetic distance are often biased at small sample sizes, and biases and sampling variances can be affected by the number of, and distances between, alleles. Using data from a large collection of larval cod (Gadus morhua) from a single area, I examined the effect of sample size on seven genetic distance and two structure metrics. Pairs of samples (equal or unequal) of various sizes were drawn at random from a pool of 856 individuals scored for six microsatellite loci. (delta mu)(2), D-SW, R-ST and F-ST were the best performers in terms of bias and variance. Sample sizes of 50 less than or equal to N less than or equal to 100 individuals were generally necessary for precise estimation of genetic distances and this value depended on number of loci, number of alleles, and range in allele size. (delta mu)(2) and D-SW were biased at small sample sizes.

AB Marine biogeographic realms have been inferred from small groups of species in particular environments (e.g., coastal, pelagic), without a global map of realms based on statistical analysis of species across all higher taxa. Here we analyze the distribution of 65,000 species of marine animals and plants, and distinguish 30 distinct marine realms, a similar proportion per area as found for land. On average, 42% of species are unique to the realms. We reveal 18 continental-shelf and 12 offshore deep-sea realms, reflecting the wider ranges of species in the pelagic and deep-sea compared to coastal areas. The most widespread species are pelagic microscopic plankton and megafauna. Analysis of pelagic species recognizes five realms within which other realms are nested. These maps integrate the biogeography of coastal and deep-sea, pelagic and benthic environments, and show how land-barriers, salinity, depth, and environmental heterogeneity relate to the evolution of biota. The realms have applications for marine reserves, biodiversity assessments, and as an evolution relevant context for climate change studies.

As with all high-throughput technologies, analytic strategies require critical validation to ensure precise and unbiased interpretation.
   2. To test the impact of bioinformatic data processing on downstream population genetic inferences, we analysed mammalian RAD-seq data (>100 individuals) with 312 combinations of methodology (de novo vs. mapping to references of increasing divergence) and filtering criteria (missing data, HWE, F-IS, coverage, mapping and genotype quality). In an effort to identify commonalities and biases in all pipelines, we computed summary statistics (nr. loci, nr. SNP, pi, Het(obs), F-IS, F-ST, N-e and m) and compared the results to independent null expectations (isolation-by-distance correlation, expected transition-to-transversion ratio T-s/T-v and Mendelian mismatch rates of known parent-offspring trios).
   3. We observed large differences between reference-based and de novo approaches, the former generally calling more SNPs and reducing F-IS and T-s/T-v. Data completion levels showed little impact on most summary statistics, and FST estimates were robust across all pipelines. The site frequency spectrum was highly sensitive to the chosen approach as reflected in large variance of parameter estimates across demographic scenarios (single-population bottlenecks and isolation-with-migration model). Null expectations were best met by reference-based approaches, although contingent on the specific criteria.
   4. We recommend that RAD-seq studies employ reference-based approaches to a closely related genome, and due to the high stochasticity associated with the pipeline advocate the use of multiple pipelines to ensure robust population genetic and demographic inferences.

AB Modeling the distributions of species, especially of invasive species in non-native ranges, involves multiple challenges. Here, we developed some novel approaches to species distribution modeling aimed at reducing the influences of such challenges and improving the realism of projections. We estimated species-environment relationships for Parthenium hysterophorus L. (Asteraceae) with four modeling methods run with multiple scenarios of (i) sources of occurrences and geographically isolated background ranges for absences, (ii) approaches to drawing background (absence) points, and (iii) alternate sets of predictor variables. We further tested various quantitative metrics of model evaluation against biological insight. Model projections were very sensitive to the choice of training dataset. Model accuracy was much improved using a global dataset for model training, rather than restricting data input to the species' native range. AUC score was a poor metric for model evaluation and, if used alone, was not a useful criterion for assessing model performance. Projections away from the sampled space (i.e., into areas of potential future invasion) were very different depending on the modeling methods used, raising questions about the reliability of ensemble projections. Generalized linear models gave very unrealistic projections far away from the training region. Models that efficiently fit the dominant pattern, but exclude highly local patterns in the dataset and capture interactions as they appear in data (e.g., boosted regression trees), improved generalization of the models. Biological knowledge of the species and its distribution was important in refining choices about the best set of projections. A post hoc test conducted on a new Parthenium dataset from Nepal validated excellent predictive performance of our 'best' model. We showed that vast stretches of currently uninvaded geographic areas on multiple continents harbor highly suitable habitats for parthenium. However, discrepancies between model predictions and parthenium invasion in Australia indicate successful management for this globally significant weed.

AB Correlative species distribution models are becoming commonplace in the scientific literature and public out-reach products, displaying locations, abundance, or suitable environmental conditions for harmful invasive species, threatened and endangered species, or species of special concern. Accurate species distribution models are useful for efficient and adaptive management and conservation, research, and ecological forecasting. Yet, these models are often presented without fully examining or explaining the caveats for their proper use and interpretation and are often implemented without understanding the limitations and assumptions of the model being used. We describe common pitfalls, assumptions, and caveats of correlative species distribution models to help novice users and end users better interpret these models. Four primary caveats corresponding to different phases of the modeling process, each with supporting documentation and examples, include: (1) all sampling data are incomplete and potentially biased; (2) predictor variables must capture distribution constraints; (3) no single model works best for all species, in all areas, at all spatial scales, and over time; and (4) the results of species distribution models should be treated like a hypothesis to be tested and validated with additional sampling and modeling in an iterative process.

AB The leaf economics spectrum is a general concept describing coordinated variation in foliage structural, chemical and physiological traits across resource gradients. Yet, within this concept, the role of within-species variation, including ecotypic and plastic variation components, has been largely neglected. This study hypothesized that there is a within-species economics spectrum within the general spectrum in the evergreen sclerophyll Quercus ilex which dominates low resource ecosystems over an exceptionally wide range. An extensive database of foliage traits covering the full species range was constructed, and improved filtering algorithms were developed. Standardized data filtering was deemed absolutely essential as additional variation sources can result in trait variation of 10-300%, blurring the broad relationships. Strong trait variation, c. two-fold for most traits to up to almost an order of magnitude, was uncovered. Although the Q.ilex spectrum is part of the general spectrum, within-species trait and climatic relationships in this species partly differed from the overall spectrum. Contrary to world-wide trends, Q.ilex does not necessarily have a low nitrogen content per mass and can increase photosynthetic capacity with increasing foliage robustness. This study argues that the within-species economics spectrum needs to be considered in regional- to biome-level analyses.

AB The limited understanding of how ecosystem service knowledge (ESK) is used in decision making constrains our ability to learn from, replicate, and convey success stories. We explore use of ESK in decision making in three international cases: national coastal planning in Belize; regional marine spatial planning on Vancouver Island, Canada; and regional land- use planning on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. Decision makers, scientists, and stakeholders collaborated in each case to use a standardized ecosystem service accounting tool to inform spatial planning. We evaluate interview, survey, and observation data to assess evidence of `conceptual', `strategic', and `instrumental' use of ESK. We find evidence of all modes: conceptual use dominates early planning, while strategic and instrumental uses occur iteratively in middle and late stages. Conceptual and strategic uses of ESK build understanding and compromise that facilitate instrumental use. We highlight attributes of ESK, characteristics of the process, and general conditions that appear to affect how knowledge is used. Meaningful participation, scenario development, and integration of local and traditional knowledge emerge as important for particular uses.

AB Climate gradients shape spatial variation in the richness and composition of plant communities. Given future predicted changes in climate means and variability, and likely regional variation in the magnitudes of these changes, it is important to determine how temporal variation in climate influences temporal variation in plant community structure. Here, we evaluated how species richness, turnover, and composition of grassland plant communities responded to interannual variation in precipitation by synthesizing long-term data from grasslands across the United States. We found that mean annual precipitation (MAP) was a positive predictor of species richness across sites, but a positive temporal relationship between annual precipitation and richness was only evident within two sites with low MAP. We also found higher average rates of species turnover in dry sites that in turn had a high proportion of annual species, although interannual rates of species turnover were surprisingly high across all locations. Annual species were less abundant than perennial species at nearly all sites, and our analysis showed that the probability of a species being lost or gained from one year to the next increased with decreasing species abundance. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity from one year to the next, a measure of species composition change that is influenced mainly by abundant species, was insensitive to precipitation at all sites. These results suggest that the richness and turnover patterns we observed were driven primarily by rare species, which comprise the majority of the local species pools at these grassland sites. These findings are consistent with the idea that short-lived and less abundant species are more sensitive to interannual climate variability than longer-lived and more abundant species. We conclude that, among grassland ecosystems, xeric grasslands are likely to exhibit the greatest responsiveness of community composition (richness and turnover) to predicted future increases in interannual precipitation variability. Over the long term, species composition may shift to reflect spatial patterns of mean precipitation; however, perennial-dominated systems will be buffered against rising interannual variation, while systems that have a large number of rare, annual species will show the greatest temporal variability in species composition in response to rising interannual variability in precipitation.

AB Individuals have difficulty controlling their food consumption, which is due in part to the ubiquity of tempting food cues in the environment. Individual differences in the propensity to attribute incentive (motivational) salience to and act on these cues may explain why some individuals eat more than others. Using fMRI in healthy women, we found that food cue related activity in the nucleus accumbens, a key brain region for food motivation and reward, was related to subsequent snack food consumption. However, both nucleus accumbens activation and snack food consumption were unrelated to self-reported hunger, or explicit wanting and liking for the snack. In contrast, food cue reactivity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was associated with subjective hunger/appetite, but not with consumption. Whilst the food cue reactivity in the nucleus accumbens that predicted snack consumption was not directly related to body mass index (BMI), it was associated with increased BMI in individuals reporting low self-control. Our findings reveal a neural substrate underpinning automatic environmental influences on consumption in humans and demonstrate how self-control interacts with this response to predict BMI. Our data provide support for theoretical models that advocate a 'dual hit' of increased incentive salience attribution to food cues and poor self-control in determining vulnerability to overeating and overweight.

AB P>1. Most studies of intraspecific variation in home range size have investigated only a single or a few factors and often at one specific scale. However, considering multiple spatial and temporal scales when defining a home range is important as mechanisms that affect variation in home range size may differ depending on the scale under investigation.
   2. We aim to quantify the relative effect of various individual, forage and climatic determinants of variation in home range size across multiple spatiotemporal scales in a large browsing herbivore, the moose (Alces alces), living at the southern limit of its distribution in Norway.
   3. Total home range size and core home range areas were estimated for daily to monthly scales in summer and winter using both local convex hull (LoCoH) and fixed kernel home range methods. Variance in home range size was analysed using linear mixed-effects models for repeated measurements.
   4. Reproductive status was the most influential individual-level factor explaining variance in moose home range size, with females accompanied by a calf having smaller summer ranges across all scales. Variation in home range size was strongly correlated with spatiotemporal changes in quantity and quality of natural food resources. Home range size decreased with increasing browse density at daily scales, but the relationship changed to positive at longer temporal scales. In contrast, browse quality was consistently negatively correlated with home range size except at the monthly scale during winter when depletion of high-quality forage occurs. Local climate affected total home range size more than core areas. Temperature, precipitation and snow depth influenced home range size directly at short temporal scales.
   5. The relative effects of intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of variation in home range size differed with spatiotemporal scale, providing clear evidence that home range size is scale dependent in this large browser. Insight into the behavioural responses of populations to climatic stochasticity and forage variability is essential in view of current and future climate change, especially for populations with thermoregulatory restrictions living at the southern limit of their distribution.

AB In 1967, Daniel Janzen proposed the influential, but largely untested hypothesis, that tropical mountain passes are physiologically higher than temperate mountains. I test his key prediction, the one upon which all the others rely: namely, that elevational range sizes of organisms get larger on mountains at increasing latitudes. My analyses use 170 montane gradients spanning 36.5 degrees S to 48.2 degrees N latitude compiled from over 80 years of research and 16 500 species of rodents, bats, birds, lizards, snakes, salamanders, and frogs. In support of Janzen's prediction, I find that elevational range size increases with increasing latitude for all vertebrate groups except rodents. I document additional lines of evidence for temperature variability as a plausible mechanism for trends in vertebrate range size, including strong effects of thermoregulation and daily temperature variability, and a weak effect of precipitation.

AB What factors shape the evolution of invasive populations? Recent theoretical and empirical studies suggest that an evolutionary history of disturbance might be an important factor. This perspective presents hypotheses regarding the impact of disturbance on the evolution of invasive populations, based on a synthesis of the existing literature. Disturbance might select for life-history traits that are favorable for colonizing novel habitats, such as rapid population growth and persistence. Theoretical results suggest that disturbance in the form of fluctuating environments might select for organismal flexibility, or alternatively, the evolution of evolvability. Rapidly fluctuating environments might favor organismal flexibility, such as broad tolerance or plasticity. Alternatively, longer fluctuations or environmental stress might lead to the evolution of evolvability by acting on features of the mutation matrix. Once genetic variance is generated via mutations, temporally fluctuating selection across generations might promote the accumulation and maintenance of genetic variation. Deeper insights into how disturbance in native habitats affects evolutionary and physiological responses of populations would give us greater capacity to predict the populations that are most likely to tolerate or adapt to novel environments during habitat invasions. Moreover, we would gain fundamental insights into the evolutionary origins of invasive populations.

AB The causes of variation in animal species richness at large spatial scales are intensively debated. Here, we examine whether the diversity of food plants, contemporary climate and energy, or habitat heterogeneity determine species richness patterns of avian frugivores across sub-Saharan Africa. Path models indicate that species richness of Ficus (their fruits being one of the major food resources for frugivores in the tropics) has the strongest direct effect on richness of avian frugivores, whereas the influences of variables related to water-energy and habitat heterogeneity are mainly indirect. The importance of Ficus richness for richness of avian frugivores diminishes with decreasing specialization of birds on fruit eating, but is retained when accounting for spatial autocorrelation. We suggest that a positive relationship between food plant and frugivore species richness could result from niche assembly mechanisms (e.g. coevolutionary adaptations to fruit size, fruit colour or vertical stratification of fruit presentation) or, alternatively, from stochastic speciation-extinction processes. In any case, the close relationship between species richness of Ficus and avian frugivores suggests that figs are keystone resources for animal consumers, even at continental scales.

AB Aim The biodiversity of geometrid moths (Lepidoptera) along a complete tropical elevational gradient was studied for the first time. The patterns are described, and the role of geometric constraints and environmental factors is explored.
   Location The study was carried out along the Barva Transect (10 degrees N, 84 degrees W), a complete elevational gradient ranging from 40 to 2730 m a.s.l. in Braulio Carrillo National Park, Costa Rica, and adjacent areas.
   Methods Moths were sampled manually in 2003 and 2004 at 12 rain forest sites using light 'towers', each with two 15 W ultraviolet fluorescent tubes. We used abundance-based rarefaction, statistical estimation of true richness (Chao 1), geographically interpolated observed richness and Fisher's alpha as measures of local diversity.
   Results A total of 13,765 specimens representing 739 species were analysed. All four measures showed a hump-shaped pattern with maxima between 500 and 2100 m elevation. The two subfamilies showed richness and diversity maxima at either lower (Ennominae) or higher (Larentiinae) elevation than Geometridae as a whole. Among the four environmental factors tested, relative humidity yielded the highest correlation over the transect with the rarefaction-based richness estimates as well as with estimated true species richness of Geometridae as a whole and of Larentiinae, while rainfall explained the greatest variation of Ennominae richness. The elevational pattern of moth richness was discordant with both temperature and with tree species richness. A combination of all environmental factors in a stepwise multiple regression produced high values of r(2) in Geometridae. The potential effects of geometric constraints (mid-domain effect, MDE) were investigated by comparing them with observed, interpolated richness. Overall, models fitted very well for Geometridae as a whole and for Ennominae, but less well for Larentiinae. Small-ranged species showed stronger deviations from model predictions than large-ranged species, and differed strikingly between the two subfamilies, suggesting that environmental factors play a more pronounced role for small-ranged species. We hypothesize that small-ranged species (at least of the Ennominae) may tend to be host specialists, whereas large-ranged species tend to be polyphagous. Based on interpolated ranges, mean elevational range for these moths was larger with increasing elevation, in accordance with Rapoport's elevational rule, although sampling effects may have exaggerated this pattern. The underlying mechanism remains unknown because Rapoport's 'rescue' hypothesis could not explain the observed pattern.
   Conclusions The results clearly show that moth diversity shows a hump-shaped pattern. However, remarkable variation exists with regard to taxon and range size. Both environmental and geometric factors are likely to contribute to the observed patterns.

AB Countless numbers of insects migrate within and between continents every year, and yet we know very little about the ultimate reasons and proximate mechanisms that would explain these mass movements. Here we suggest that perhaps the most important reason for insects to migrate is to hedge their reproductive bets. By spreading their breeding efforts in space and time, insects distribute their offspring over a range of environmental conditions. We show how the study of individual long-distance movements of insects may contribute to a better understanding of migration. In the future, advances in tracking methods may enable the global surveillance of large insects such as desert locusts.

AB Chironomid subfossil assemblages from six low-alpine and sub-alpine Holocene stratigraphies are presented and compared. They are from five lakes in mid-southern and western Norway and one in central Sweden. When comparing the chironomid-inferred July air temperatures, there are many time segments with a poor among-lake fit in inferred temperatures. Possible environmental variables influencing the fossil chironomid assemblages are discussed using a modern Norwegian calibration data set to indicate taxon-environment relationships. These analyses indicate that local changes in pH, water chemistry, and productivity at times may have overridden the regional temperature signal. In addition, other causes of poor among-site temperature fit are discussed, in particular those related to chronological uncertainties. Holocene temperature inferences from single cores based on chironomids may not always be able to provide a reliable regional temperature signal, but can act as a guide from which hypotheses about past environmental conditions can be tested with the aid of chironomid-inferred temperatures from several sites and from other environmental proxies. We have obtained a regional picture of Holocene summer temperature change by developing a consensus reconstruction based on the overall temperature signal from all six sites. This consensus is developed by fitting a smoother through all 330 site-specific temperature-deviations from the Holocene mean. The consensus temperature deviations vary from -0.8 degrees C at 8800 cal years BP to +0.8 degrees C at 6500 cal years BP. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of matrix habitats on the occurrence of seven understory insectivorous bird species in forest fragments was examined at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, Manaus. Amazonia. Playback techniques were used to detect individuals in the continuous primary forest, fragments of 1, 10 and 100 ha, and in two matrix habitat of secondary forest dominated by Vismia spp. and Cecropia spp. Sampling points in secondary forest areas were distributed at 50, 250 and 500 in from the continuous forest. Using G-tests of frequency distribution, species occurrences were compared in the following ways: (a) continuous forest vs. fragments; (b) continuous forest vs. second growth forest; (c) in second growth at different distance, from continuous forest. Species were divided into three categories according to their sensitivity to the fragmentation process. Highly sensitive species (Cyphorhinus arada, Hylophilus ochraceiceps and Thamnomanes ardesiacus) did not occur in small fragments or in matrix habitats. Moderately sensitive species (Formicarius colma and T. caesius) occurred in small fragments and utilized infrequently matrix habitats. Positively affected species (Percnostola rufifrons and Hypocnemis canator) were frequently detected in small fragments and all matrix habitats. Distances from the continuous forest did not influence the frequency of species occurrences in the secondary forest areas. Species were more frequent in small fragments surrounded by Cecropia spp. than by Vismia spp. Our results support the idea that the maintenance of species in small fragments may depend on their ability to use the matrix, and that increasing the permeability of the matrix may be an option to lessen the effects of forest fragmentation.

AB To understand how tree growth has responded to recent climate warming, an understanding of the tree-climate-site complex is necessary. To achieve this, radial growth variability among 204 trees established before 1850 was studied in relation to both climatic and site factors. Seventeen forest stands. were sampled in the Spanish Central Pyrenees. Three species were studied: Pinus uncinata, Abies alba, and Pinus sylvestris. For each tree, a ring-width residual chronology was built. All trees cross-dated well, indicating a common influence of the regional climate. For the 1952-1993 period, the radial growth of all species, especially P. uncinata, was positively correlated with warm Novembers during the year before ring formation and warm Mays of the year the annual ring formed. Differences in species-stand elevation modulated the growth-climate associations. Radial growth in P. uncinata at high elevation sites was reduced when May temperatures were colder and May precipitation more abundant. In the 20th century, two contrasting periods in radial growth were observed: one (1900-1949) with low frequency of narrow and wide rings, low mean annual sensitivity, and low common growth variation; and another (1950-1994) with the reverse characteristics. The increased variability in radial growth since the 1950s was observed for all species and sites, which suggests a climatic cause. The low shared variance among tree chronologies during the first half of the 20th century may result from a "relaxation" of the elevation gradient, allowing local site conditions to dominate macroclimatic influence. These temporal trends may be related to the recently reported increase of climatic variability and warmer conditions. This study emphasizes the need to carefully assess the relationships between radial growth and site conditions along ecological gradients to improve dendroclimatic reconstructions.

AB Ecologists have proposed hundreds of quantitative indicators of the status of ecosystems for evaluation of and reporting on the status of marine ecosystems. The talk applies a common approach to classifying indicators, summarises the main properties of each class of indicator, and provides some illustrations.
   Indicators of ecosystem status have roles in both communication and decision support. For both roles, strengths. and weaknesses of indicators are usually only partially known. Few have been tested systematically for sensitivity and robustness across, a range of contexts... However, to determine best practices for selecting indicators for specific uses, one must have a fairly complete understanding of the information content of the various indicators. The paper explores some alternative approaches to documenting the information content of various indicators of ecosystem status.
   As the Precautionary Approach becomes broadly used as the basis for management decision-making, the role of indicators of ecosystem status,becomes central. The PA is made operational in decision-making through use of indicators and reference points. This means that it is necessary to identify values of an ecosystem indicator associated with harm to the environment that is serious or difficult to reverse. Methods for identifying and justifying reference points for ecosystem indicators are being developed and tested, but the task is turning out to be complex. Alternative strategies for identifying reference points are reviewed.
   When choices must be made from a suite of candidate indicators, it is desirable make the selection on objective grounds. This requires explicit a priori criteria, on which there is not yet scientific consensus. Recent developments in this area are reviewed, and again a way forward proposed.

AB 1. Three separate experiments were conducted, involving 27 herbaceous species and 14 woody species aged 15-30 days, in order to determine the relative importance of net assimilation rate (NAR), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf weight ratio (LWR) in explaining interspecific variations in relative growth rate.
   2. Daily quantum inputs were 31.12 mol m(-2) day(-1) in the first experiment and 33.17 mol m(-2) day(-1) in the second and third experiments. This is about twice the typical irradiance of most other experiments in this area, but only about 85% of the daily photon flux in nature. Plants were cultivated in hydroponic sand culture in a solution containing 5.8 mm nitrogen.
   3. RGR was strongly and positively correlated with NAR in all three experiments. RGR was weakly and negatively correlated with SLA, while the correlation between RGR and LWR was weak and variable.
   4. These results are compared to those already published in the literature: the commonly reported result that interspecific variation in RGR is determined primarily by SLA is partly due to the low irradiance used in most experiments, and the relative importance of SLA and NAR changes depending on irradiance.
   5. A hypothesis is proposed in which direct and indirect effects of SLA on each of NAR and RGR are decomposed, and which leads to a trade-off between SLA and NAR as a function of daily irradiance.

AB The purpose of this paper is to upscale tower measurements of net primary productivity (NPP) to the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) study region by means of remote sensing and modeling. The Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) with a new daily canopy photosynthesis model was first tested in one coniferous and one deciduous site. The simultaneous CO2 flux measurements above and below the tree canopy made it possible to isolate daily net primary productivity of the tree canopy for model validation. Soil water holding capacity and gridded daily meteorological data for the region were used as inputs to BEPS, in addition to I km resolution land cover and leaf area index (LAI) maps derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data. NPP statistics for the various cover types in the BOREAS region and in the southern study area (SSA) and the northern study area (NSA) are presented. Strong dependence of NPP on LAI was found for the three major cover types: coniferous forest, deciduous forest and cropland. Since BEPS can compute total photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy in each pixel, light use efficiencies for NPP and gross primary productivity could also be analyzed. From the model results, the following area-averaged statistics were obtained for 1994: (1) mean NPP for the BOREAS region of 217 g C m(-2) yr(-1); (2) mean NPP of forests (excluding burnt areas in the region) equal to 234 g C m(-2) yr(-1); (3) mean NPP for the SSA and the NSA of 297 and 238 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively; and (4) mean light use efficiency for NPP equal to 0.40, 0.20, and 0.33 g C (MJ APAR)(-1) for deciduous forest, coniferous forest, and crops, respectively.

AB Aim The idea of combining predictions from different models into an ensemble has gained considerable popularity in species distribution modelling, partly due to free and comprehensive software such as the R package BIOMOD. However, despite proliferation of ensemble models, we lack oversight of how and where they are used for modelling distributions, and how well they perform. Here, we present such an overview. Location Global. Methods Since BIOMOD is freely available and widely used by ensemble species distribution modellers, we focused on articles that apply BIOMOD, filtering the initial 852 papers identified in our structured literature search to a relevant final subset of 224 eligible peer-reviewed journal articles. Results BIOMOD-based ensembles are used across many taxa and locations, with terrestrial plants being the most represented group of species (n = 72) and Europe being the most represented continent (n = 106). These studies often focus on forecasting distributions in the future (n = 109), and commonly use presence-only species data (n = 139) and climatic environmental predictors (n = 219). An average of six models are used in ensembles, and approximately half of ensembles weight contributions of models by their cross-validation performance. However, discussion about choices made in the modelling process and unambiguous information on the performance of ensemble models versus individual models are limited. The use of independent data to validate model performance is particularly uncommon. Main conclusions We document the breadth of ensemble applications, but could not draw strong quantitative conclusions about the predictive performance of ensemble models, due to lack of unambiguous information reported. Understanding how and where ensembles are best used when modelling species distributions is important for enabling best choices for different applications. To enable this objective to be achieved, we provide recommendations for thorough reporting practices in a BIOMOD-based ensemble workflow.

AB The multispecies coalescent provides a natural framework for accommodating ancestral genetic polymorphism and coalescent processes that can cause different genomic regions to have different genealogical histories. The Bayesian program BPP includes a full-likelihood implementation of the multispecies coalescent, using transmodel Markov chain Monte Carlo to calculate the posterior probabilities of different species trees. BPP is suitable for analyzing multilocus sequence data sets and it accommodates the heterogeneity of gene trees (both the topology and branch lengths) among loci and gene tree uncertainties due to limited phylogenetic information at each locus. Here, we provide a practical guide to the use of BPP in species tree estimation. BPP is a command-line program that runs on LINUX, MACOSX, and WINDOWS. This protocol shows how to use both BPP 3.4 (http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/) and BPP 4.0 (https://github.com/bpp/).

AB There has been increasing attention to and investment in local environmental stewardship in conservation and environmental management policies and programs globally. Yet environmental stewardship has not received adequate conceptual attention. Establishing a clear definition and comprehensive analytical framework could strengthen our ability to understand the factors that lead to the success or failure of environmental stewardship in different contexts and how to most effectively support and enable local efforts. Here we propose such a definition and framework. First, we define local environmental stewardship as the actions taken by individuals, groups or networks of actors, with various motivations and levels of capacity, to protect, care for or responsibly use the environment in pursuit of environmental and/or social outcomes in diverse social-ecological contexts. Next, drawing from a review of the environmental stewardship, management and governance literatures, we unpack the elements of this definition to develop an analytical framework that can facilitate research on local environmental stewardship. Finally, we discuss potential interventions and leverage points for promoting or supporting local stewardship and future applications of the framework to guide descriptive, evaluative, prescriptive or systematic analysis of environmental stewardship. Further application of this framework in diverse environmental and social contexts is recommended to refine the elements and develop insights that will guide and improve the outcomes of environmental stewardship initiatives and investments. Ultimately, our aim is to raise the profile of environmental stewardship as a valuable and holistic concept for guiding productive and sustained relationships with the environment.

AB While average temperature is likely to increase in most locations on Earth, many places will simultaneously experience higher variability in temperature, precipitation, and other climate variables. Although ecologists and evolutionary biologists widely recognize the potential impacts of changes in average climatic conditions, relatively little attention has been paid to the potential impacts of changes in climatic variability and extremes. We review the evidence on the impacts of increased climatic variability and extremes on physiological, ecological and evolutionary processes at multiple levels of biological organization, from individuals to populations and communities. Our review indicates that climatic variability can have profound influences on biological processes at multiple scales of organization. Responses to increased climatic variability and extremes are likely to be complex and cannot always be generalized, although our conceptual and methodological toolboxes allow us to make informed predictions about the likely consequences of such climatic changes. We conclude that climatic variability represents an important component of climate that deserves further attention.

AB Forest ecosystem models based on heuristic water stress functions poorly predict tropical forest response to drought partly because they do not capture the diversity of hydraulic traits (including variation in tree size) observed in tropical forests. We developed a continuous porous media approach to modeling plant hydraulics in which all parameters of the constitutive equations are biologically interpretable and measurable plant hydraulic traits (e.g., turgor loss point pi(tlp), bulk elastic modulus epsilon, hydraulic capacitance C-ft, xylem hydraulic conductivity k(s,max), water potential at 50% loss of conductivity for both xylem (P-50,P-x) and stomata (P-50,P-gs), and the leaf : sapwood area ratio Lambda(l) : Lambda(s)). We embedded this plant hydraulics model within a trait forest simulator (TFS) that models light environments of individual trees and their upper boundary conditions (transpiration), as well as providing a means for parameterizing variation in hydraulic traits among individuals. We synthesized literature and existing databases to parameterize all hydraulic traits as a function of stem and leaf traits, including wood density (WD), leaf mass per area (LMA), and photosynthetic capacity (A(max)), and evaluated the coupled model (called TFS v.1-Hydro) predictions, against observed diurnal and seasonal variability in stem and leaf water potential as well as stand-scaled sap flux.
   Our hydraulic trait synthesis revealed coordination among leaf and xylem hydraulic traits and statistically significant relationships of most hydraulic traits with more easily measured plant traits. Using the most informative empirical trait-trait relationships derived from this synthesis, TFS v.1-Hydro successfully captured individual variation in leaf and stem water potential due to increasing tree size and light environment, with model representation of hydraulic architecture and plant traits exerting primary and secondary controls, respectively, on the fidelity of model predictions. The plant hydraulics model made substantial improvements to simulations of total ecosystem transpiration. Remaining uncertainties and limitations of the trait paradigm for plant hydraulics modeling are highlighted.

AB Participatory approaches can be seen as a requirement, but also as a benefit to the overall paradigm change towards sustainable development and contribute towards the integration of sustainability concept into the university culture. So far, there have been comparatively few research studies on participation within sustainability implementation at university level, and a more differentiated understanding of these processes is still missing, both in the practice of conducting a participatory process and in the sustainability assessment. This paper addresses some of the failures and successes experienced within participatory approaches in campus sustainability initiatives, and deduces a set of critical success factors and emergent clusters that can help to integrate the dimensions of participation more inclusively into sustainability assessment. Following a qualitative approach and inspired by the Delphi-method, semi-structured expert interviews (N = 15) and four focus group discussions (N = 36), with participants coming from twenty different countries in total, were conducted and compared according to qualitative content analysis. Findings give empirical evidence to some of the characteristics related to stakeholder engagement, and associate higher education for sustainable development to empowerment and capacity building, shifting away from a previous focus on environmental sustainability. The success of participatory approaches is interdependent with structural institutional conditions and the persons engaged, highlighting the importance of specific skills and participatory competencies. A better integration of the dimensions of participation into sustainability assessment practices can help in defining and establishing participatory approaches on institutional level and fostering a culture of participation in the transition to sustainable universities.

AB Local adaptation, adaptive population divergence and speciation are often expected to result from populations evolving in response to spatial variation in selection. Yet, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the major features that characterise the spatial patterns of selection, namely the extent of variation among populations in the strength and direction of selection. Here, we analyse a data set of spatially replicated studies of directional phenotypic selection from natural populations. The data set includes 60 studies, consisting of 3937 estimates of selection across an average of five populations. We performed meta-analyses to explore features characterising spatial variation in directional selection. We found that selection tends to vary mainly in strength and less in direction among populations. Although differences in the direction of selection occur among populations they do so where selection is often weakest, which may limit the potential for ongoing adaptive population divergence. Overall, we also found that spatial variation in selection appears comparable to temporal (annual) variation in selection within populations; however, several deficiencies in available data currently complicate this comparison. We discuss future research needs to further advance our understanding of spatial variation in selection.

AB Suboptimal availability of water and nutrients is a primary limitation to plant growth in terrestrial ecosystems. The acquisition of soil resources by plant roots is therefore an important component of plant fitness and agricultural productivity. Plant root systems comprise a set of phenes, or traits, that interact. Phenes are the units of the plant phenotype, and phene states represent the variation in form and function a particular phene may take. Root phenes can be classified as affecting resource acquisition or utilization, influencing acquisition through exploration or exploitation, and in being metabolically influential or neutral. These classifications determine how one phene will interact with another phene, whether through foraging mechanisms or metabolic economics. Phenes that influence one another through foraging mechanisms are likely to operate within a phene module, a group of interacting phenes, that may be co-selected. Examples of root phene interactions discussed are: (1) root hair length x root hair density, (2) lateral branching x root cortical aerenchyma (RCA), (3) adventitious root number x adventitious root respiration and basal root growth angle (BRGA), (4) nodal root number x RCA, and (5) BRGA x root hair length and density. Progress in the study of phenes and phene interactions will be facilitated by employing simulation modeling and near-isophenic lines that allow the study of specific phenes and phene combinations within a common phenotypic background. Developing a robust understanding of the phenome at the organismal level will require new lines of inquiry into how phenotypic integration influences plant function in diverse environments. A better understanding of how root phenes interact to affect soil resource acquisition will be an important tool in the breeding of crops with superior stress tolerance and reduced dependence on intensive use of inputs.

AB The demand for projections of the future distribution of biodiversity has triggered an upsurge in modelling at the crossroads between ecology and evolution. Despite the enthusiasm around these so-called biodiversity models, most approaches are still criticised for not integrating key processes known to shape species ranges and community structure. Developing an integrative modelling framework for biodiversity distribution promises to improve the reliability of predictions and to give a better understanding of the eco-evolutionary dynamics of species and communities under changing environments. In this article, we briefly review some eco-evolutionary processes and interplays among them, which are essential to provide reliable projections of species distributions and community structure. We identify gaps in theory, quantitative knowledge and data availability hampering the development of an integrated modelling framework. We argue that model development relying on a strong theoretical foundation is essential to inspire new models, manage complexity and maintain tractability. We support our argument with an example of a novel integrated model for species distribution modelling, derived from metapopulation theory, which accounts for abiotic constraints, dispersal, biotic interactions and evolution under changing environmental conditions. We hope such a perspective will motivate exciting and novel research, and challenge others to improve on our proposed approach.

AB Despite its importance to the host, the flower microbiome is poorly understood. We report a culture-independent, community-level assessment of apple flower microbial diversity and dynamics. We collected flowers from six apple trees at five time points, starting before flowers opened and ending at petal fall. We applied streptomycin to half of the trees when flowers opened. Assessment of microbial diversity using tag pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed that the apple flower communities were rich and diverse and dominated by members of TM7 and Deinococcus-Thermus, phyla about which relatively little is known. From thousands of taxa, we identified six successional groups with coherent dynamics whose abundances peaked at different times before and after bud opening. We designated the groups Pioneer, Early, Mid, Late, Climax, and Generalist communities. The successional pattern was attributed to a set of prevalent taxa that were persistent and gradually changing in abundance. These taxa had significant associations with other community members, as demonstrated with a cooccurrence network based on local similarity analysis. We also detected a set of less-abundant, transient taxa that contributed to general tree-to-tree variability but not to the successional pattern. Communities on trees sprayed with streptomycin had slightly lower phylogenetic diversity than those on unsprayed trees but did not differ in structure or succession. Our results suggest that changes in apple flower microbial community structure are predictable over the life of the flower, providing a basis for ecological understanding and disease management.
   IMPORTANCE Flowering plants (angiosperms) represent a diverse group of an estimated 400,000 species, and their successful cultivation is essential to agriculture. Yet fundamental knowledge of flower-associated microbiota remains largely unknown. Even less well understood are the changes that flower microbial communities experience through time. Flowers are particularly conducive to comprehensive temporal studies because they are, by nature, ephemeral organs. Here, we present the first culture-independent time series of bacterial and archaeal communities associated with the flowers of apple, an economically important crop. We found unexpected diversity on apple flowers, including a preponderance of taxa affiliated with Deinococcus-Thermus and TM7, phyla that are understudied but thought to be tolerant of an array of environmental stresses. Our results also suggest that changes in microbial community structure on the apple flower may be predictable over the life of the flower, providing the basis for ecological understanding and disease management.

AB We explored the main factors affecting the global distribution of tree cavities - a habitat component of mostly biotic origin that is crucial for many animal species. We considered the influence of eight environmental variables (ranging from the single-tree to the biogeographic-region scale) on cavity density in a meta-analysis of 103 published studies. The global median density of cavities was 16 ha(-1), with densities highest in Australasia and lowest in the Palaearctic region. Two major factors influencing density were identified: cavity density was positively related to the amount of precipitation, and was higher in natural than in managed forests. These effects suggest that the distribution of tree cavities largely reflects the incidence of fungal heart-rot in trees, and that forest management, by affecting wood decay processes, can have a broad-scale impact on tree microhabitat availability. Although air temperature, forest composition and wood hardness had suggestive univariate effects, neither these variables nor biogeographic region explained any additional variation in multifactor models. In regions where woodpeckers are present there was an upper limit to the density of woodpecker-excavated cavities (approximately 10-20 cavities ha(-1)) that was considerably lower than the highest total cavity densities encountered (up to 140 ha(-1)). This indicates that primary cavity-nesters are particularly important keystone species in cavity-poor forests where wood decay processes are suppressed either climatically or by forest management.

AB The extent to which resource subsidies affect food web dynamics is poorly understood in anthropogenic landscapes. To better understand how species interactions are influenced by subsidies, we studied breeding birds and nest predators along a rural-to-urban landscape gradient that varied in subsidies provided to generalist predators. We hypothesized that resource subsidies in urban landscapes would decouple predator-prey relationships, as predators switch from natural to anthropogenic foods. From 2004 to 2009, we surveyed nest predators and monitored 2942 nests of five songbird species breeding in 19 mature forest stands in Ohio, USA. Eighteen species were video-recorded depredating nests. Numbers of avian and mammalian nest predators were positively associated with the amount of urban development surrounding forests, with the exception of Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater). Although nest survival strongly declined with detections of nest predators in rural landscapes, nest survival and predator numbers were unrelated in urban landscapes. Thus, the strength of interaction between breeding birds and nest predators diminished as landscapes surrounding forested parks became more urbanized. Our work suggests that decoupling of predator-prey relationships can arise when synanthropic predators are heavily subsidized by anthropogenic resources. In this way, human drivers can alter, and completely disarticulate, relationships among species that are well established in more natural systems.

AB Aim
   We used a landscape-scale study of birch invasion onto heather moorland to determine the consistency of changes in vegetation type and soil properties and in the community composition of five soil organism groups. Our aim was to determine whether the degree to which soil organisms respond to natural changes and/or induced changes (e.g. changes in land-use type and climate) in habitat is consistent across trophic and taxonomic groups in the context of conservation policies for birch woodland and heather moorland.
   Location
   Mainland Scotland.
   Methods
   We sampled mesostigmatid mites, oribatid mites, fungi, bacteria and archaea in adjacent patches of birch woodland (dominated by Betula pubescens) and heather moorland (dominated by Calluna vulgaris) at 12 sites for which annual rainfall ranged between 713 and 2251 mm. Differences in community composition were visualized using non-metric multidimensional scaling based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities. The factors contributing to differences between habitats within sites were explored using general linear models and those among sites using redundancy analysis.
   Results
   The communities of all groups differed between habitats within sites, but only the oribatid mites and fungi differed consistently between habitats across sites. Within sites, dissimilarity in fungal communities was positively related to the difference in C. vulgaris cover between habitats, whereas dissimilarities in bacteria and archaea were positively related to differences in soil pH and C:N ratio between habitats, respectively.
   Main conclusions
   The influence of vegetation type and soil properties differed between groups of soil organisms, albeit in a predictable manner, across the 12 sites. Organisms directly associated with plants (fungi), and organisms with microhabitat and resource preferences (Oribatida) were strongly responsive to changes in habitat type. The response of organisms not directly associated with plants (bacteria, archaea) depended on differences in soil properties, while organisms with less clear microhabitat and resource preferences (Mesostigmata) were not strongly responsive to either vegetation type or soil properties. These results show that it is possible to predict the impact of habitat change on specific soil organisms depending on their ecology. Moreover, the community composition of all groups was related to variation in precipitation within the study area, which shows that external factors, such as those caused by climate change, can have a direct effect on belowground communities.

AB Aim
   To examine the impacts of climate change on endemic birds, which are of global significance for conservation, on a continent with few such assessments. We specifically assess projected range changes in relation to the Important Bird Areas (IBAs) network and assess the possible consequences for conservation.
   Location
   South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland.
   Methods
   The newly emerging ensemble modelling approach is used with 50 species, four climate change models for the period 2070-2100 and eight bioclimatic niche models in the statistical package biomod. Model evaluation is done using the receiver operating characteristic and the recently introduced true skill statistic. Future projections are made considering two extreme assumptions: species have full dispersal ability and species have no dispersal ability. A consensus forecast is identified using principal components analysis. This forecast is interpreted in terms of the IBA network. An irreplaceability analysis is used to highlight priority IBAs for conservation attention in terms of climate change.
   Results
   The majority of species (62%) are predicted to lose climatically suitable space. Five species lose at least 85% of their climatically suitable space. Many IBAs lose species (41%; 47 IBAs) and show high rates of species turnover of more than 50% (77%; 95 IBAs). Highly irreplaceable regions for endemic species become highly localized under climate change, meaning that the endemic species analysed here experience similar range contractions to maintain climate niches.
   Main conclusions
   The South African IBAs network is likely to become less effective for conserving endemic birds under climate change. The irreplaceability analysis identified key refugia for endemic species under climate change, but many of these areas are not currently IBAs. In addition, many of these high-priority areas that are IBAs fall outside the current formal protected areas network.

AB Using coalescent simulations, we study the impact. of three different sampling schemes on patterns of neutral diversity in structured populations. Specifically, we are interested in two summary statistics based on the site frequency spectrum as a function of migration rate, demographic history of the entire substructured population (including timing and magnitude of specieswide expansions), and the sampling scheme. Using Simulations implementing both finite-island and two-dimensional stepping-stone spatial Structure, we demonstrate strong effects of the sampling scheme on Tajima's D (D-T) and Fu and Li's D (D-FL) statistics, particularly Under specieswide (range) expansions. Pooled samples yield average D-T and D-FL values that are generally intermediate between those of local and scattered samples. Local samples (and to a lesser extent, pooled samples) are influenced by local, rapid coalescence events in the underlying coalescent process. These processes result in lower proportions of external branch lengths and hence lower proportions of singletons, explaining our finding that the sampling scheme affects DFL More than it does D-T. Under specieswide expansion scenarios, these effects of spatial sampling may persist up to very high levels of gene How (Nm > 25), implying that local samples cannot be regarded as being drawn from a panmictic Population. Importantly, many data sets on humans, Drosophila, and plants contain signatures of specieswide expansions and effects of sampling scheme that are predicted by our simulation results. This suggests that validating the assumption of panmixia is crucial if robust demographic inferences are to be made from local or pooled samples. However, future studies should consider adopting a framework that explicitly accounts for the genealogical effects of population subdivision and empirical sampling schemes.

AB Benthic soft-sediment organisms generally show strong relationships with the grain-size characteristics of the sediments they inhabit. These relationships, when characterised from field data, tend to be asymmetrical, non-linear and heteroscedastic, due to the existence of multiple other potentially important and interacting factors, some of which are inevitably unmeasured. For multivariate data, canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) can be used to isolate particular gradients of interest, despite the presence of other potentially important factors. For univariate abundance data, models focusing on upper quantiles of species' distributions can ameliorate the problem of heterogeneity induced by other variables. Here, a multivariate model of the relationship between benthic inter-tidal estuarine soft-sediment assemblages (sampled over a period of 3 years from 70 sites across the Auckland region) and the percentage of mud in the sediments was generated using CAP. To characterise changes in assemblage structure, quantile regression splines (of the 0.95 quantile) were used to model each of the twenty most abundant individual taxa along the gradient in percentage mud. This approach provided an effective instrumental quantitative predictive model of species' turnover, while allowing for the asymmetric, non-linear animal-sediment relationships and heterogeneous scatter observed in species' abundances along the mud gradient.

AB Covering < 0.1% of the ocean's surface, coral reefs harbour about one-third of all marine fishes or c. 5000 species. Allopatry (geographic isolation) is believed to be the primary mode of speciation, yet few biogeographic barriers exist between reefs, and most reef fishes have a pelagic larval stage capable of extensive dispersal. Under these circumstances, why are there so many species of reef fishes? Since most biogeographic barriers in the oceans are either spatially or temporally permeable on a relatively short time frame, the requirement of isolation during allopatric speciation is hard to satisfy. Evidence from empirical and theoretical studies, the biological characteristics of coral reefs, and a reanalysis of biogeographic barriers indicate that sympatric speciation is possible but not common at small spatial scales and that parapatric speciation is a common (and probably the prevalent) mode of diversification in coral-reef fishes. Regardless of the speciation mode, previous hypotheses of accelerated diversification in the Pleistocene due to sea level fluctuations are not supported by phylogenetic analyses. Recent developments in the area of comparative genomics can fuel a new revolution in the way marine speciation is studied.

AB Tree radial growth and seedling establishment of Nothofagus pumilio at alpine treeline near 40degrees S latitude in Chile and Argentina show time- and site-dependent relationships to interannual- and decadal-scale climate variation. Six treelines were sampled at two spatial scales corresponding to regional and local climates. A shift in climate from cool-wet to warm-dry conditions facilitated comparison of climate-vegetation relationships during two distinct periods: 1957-1976 and 1977-1996. For each treeline, tree radial growth and seedling establishment were correlated against monthly and seasonal temperature, precipitation, moisture availability, and two indices of El Ni (n) over tildeo-Southern Oscillation (ENSO): southern oscillation index (SOI) and sea surface temperature (SST). Four key aspects of climatic influences on N. pumilio radial growth and seedling establishment were as follows. (1) The relationship between krummholz radial growth and temperature variation was nonlinear. (2) Moisture availability was the dominant climatic factor influencing seedling establishment, although temperature-precipitation interactions resulted in variability among study areas. (3) Climate conditions that facilitated Nothofagus pumilio seedling establishment were distinct, and often opposite, from those that enhanced radial growth. (4) The relationships of radial growth and seedling demography with climate and ENSO differed among study areas and have been unstable over the past 40 years. Observed spatial and temporal instabilities in vegetation-climate relationships demonstrate the complexity of treeline dynamics in northern Patagonia under a changing climate. We conclude that a directional increase in temperature, as predicted by current global climate scenarios, will not necessarily result in an upslope expansion of the N. pumilio forests growing at altitudinal treeline in northern Patagonia.

AB Development of suitable approaches to the analysis of genetic diversity in a spatial context, where factors such as pollination, seed dispersal, breeding system, habitat heterogeneity and human influence are appropriately integrated, can provide new insights in the understanding of the mechanisms of maintenance and dynamics of populations. In this sense, it is important to recognise that, P patterns and processes may take place at different scales at the same time, and that the scales of a study must be chosen in accordance with the objectives pursued. Apart from conventional approaches to genetic structure, spatial autocorrelation and related techniques, such as Mantel test, correlograms, Mantel correlograms, join-counts, variograms and point pattern analysis, can detect and characterise the existence of spatial genetic structures and lead the way to discussing the environmental and biological factors responsible for them. An alternative way of including spatial variability in modelling approaches that deal with genetic patterns or processes is through the use of constrained ordinations. Although scarcely used at present, these methodologies have great applicability in conservation biology and can lead a way to an effective integration of genetic, demographic and ecological perspectives.

AB After more than a century of being regarded as botanical oddities, carnivorous plants have emerged as model systems that are appropriate for addressing a wide array of ecological and evolutionary questions. Now that reliable molecular phylogenies are available for many carnivorous plants, they can be used to study convergences and divergences in ecophysiology and life-history strategies. Cost-benefit models and demographic analysis can provide insight into the selective forces promoting carnivory. Important areas for future research include the assessment of the interaction between nutrient availability and drought tolerance among carnivorous plants, as well as measurements of spatial and temporal variability in microhabitat characteristics that might constrain plant growth and fitness. In addition to addressing evolutionary convergence, such studies must take into account the evolutionary diversity of carnivorous plants and their wide variety of life forms and habitats. Finally, carnivorous plants have suffered from historical overcollection, and their habitats are vanishing rapidly. A major focus of future research on this exciting group of plants should be directed towards strategies for their conservation and management.

AB Odonata species are particularly sensitive to human disturbances. Their diversity relative to four landscape types (plantation forest, parkland, residential area, industrial area) along a small river (the Dorpspruit) that runs through Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, is described. Individual species-environment relations were investigated using the multivariate analysis package CANOCO. Four biotope types were identified and characterised. The analysis also illustrated the extent to which the urban, suburban and forestry environments affected the Odonata species. Multispecies assemblages were good environmental indicators. Individual indicator species included Chlorolestes tessellatus and Crocothemis erythraea. Chlorolestes tessellatus is a good indicator of the minimal width (> 30 m) of the indigenous strip of riparian vegetation between the stream edge and commercial plantations. This study suggests that there should be a riparian strip between the water's edge and plantation trees of at least 20 m (preferably 30 m), This finding is integrated with earlier ones to arrive at a general conservation management recommendation, at least for dragonflies, for rivers in South Africa.

ID TERRESTRIAL VEGETATION; MODEL
AB THE Cretaceous period was a time of global warmth(1-4). MidCretaceous equatorial temperatures were similar to today's(5), but the equator-to-pole temperature gradient is the subject of some controversy(5-7). Although it is unlikely that the poles were ice-frees(8-10), fossil evidence(3-5,11,12) indicates that near-polar temperatures were much higher than they are today. Little is known, moreover, about oceanic poleward heat transport, and this makes it hard to model the Cretaceous climate or to evaluate the extent to which it provides an analogue for a 'greenhouse' world warmed by increased atmospheric CO2 alone. Here we use relationships between leaf physiognomy (such as shape and size) and modern climate to determine Cretaceous climate conditions in the Arctic region from fossil leaves. We find that the Arctic Ocean was relatively warm, remaining above 0 degrees C even during the winter months. This implies that there was significant poleward heat transport during all seasons.

AB The biomass density of aquatic ecosystems can be expressed as an allometric function of organism body size. The log-log plot of this relation, termed the biomass spectrum, is used to compare aquatic ecosystems in various parts of the world. We develop a standardized presentation for several example environments where detailed data on biomass density by body size in the trophic positions, phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthos, and fish, make it possible to establish overall or primary spectral slopes. The basic methodology is adapted for application to other ecosystems where less detailed data are available. Spectra from all the different environments exhibit a uniform low slope, but with different intercepts that appear to reflect ecosystem differences in nutrient circulation and availability. Detail on the secondary structuring at various positions in the trophic system appears to provide information useful for distinguishing between long-term changes in productivity and short-term perturbations in biomass or abundance.

AB Aim To use global databases to (1) provide a visualization of global geographical patterns of species invasions, origins and pathways and (2) depict the international uptake of legislative and policy responses to invasive alien species (IAS).
   Location Global.
   Methods Patterns of recorded species invasions and pathways of introduction were mapped and visualized using data from the Global Invasive Species Database (GISD) and the CABI Invasive Species Compendium (CABI ISC), along with associated legal instruments relevant to IAS compiled from the ECOLEX database. A novel indicator of the asymmetry between each country's 'ingress/egress' of IAS (kappa, K), was developed to further explore spatial patterns.
   Results Substantial variation in the spatial patterns of invasion was determined, with the Global North, some newly industrialized countries and small tropical islands being the main recipients of IAS and asymmetry (K) being highest in New World countries and small islands. Of the 1517 recorded IAS, 39% were introduced only intentionally and 26% only unintentionally, 22% both intentionally and unintentionally, while 13% had no information available. The dominant pathway for species invasions was horticulture and the nursery trade, with 31% of the species introduced outside of their natural geographical range. Large increases in legislation on IAS have occurred since the 1990s, particularly for those countries that have high numbers of species invasions.
   Main conclusions Clear global patterns in the distributions of IAS are determined, supporting arguments emphasizing the role of colonial history, economic development and trade in driving the human-mediated movement of species. Dominant pathways for species invasions are similar across different regions. Policy responses towards IAS show an increasing desire from the international community to act on species invasions. Current patterns suggest that Africa and Central Asia are priority areas for future IAS research and control.

TI Diversity of plant nutrient-acquisition strategies increases during

SO NATURE PLANTS

DT Article
ID PHOSPHORUS LIMITATION; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; SOIL CHRONOSEQUENCE;
   BIODIVERSITY; COEXISTENCE; TRAITS
AB Plant species diversity increases as soil phosphorus availability declines during long-term ecosystem development(1,2). The increase in plant species diversity is associated with a decline in above-ground functional diversity, because leaf traits converge on a high phosphorus-use efficiency strategy on old and infertile soils(3,4). In contrast, the response of below-ground traits that directly influence nutrient acquisition remains poorly understood(3,5); yet it might be key to understanding how soil fertility drives patterns of plant species diversity(1). Here we show a marked increase in the richness and diversity of plant nutrient-acquisition strategies with declining soil phosphorus availability during long-term ecosystem development in a global biodiversity hotspot. Almost all nutrient-acquisition strategies currently known were found in plants from the most infertile soils, despite these being some of the most phosphorus-impoverished soils on Earth. Mycorrhizal plants declined in relative abundance by >30%, although the decline was compensated by an increase in non-mycorrhizal, carboxylate-exuding species that 'mine' phosphorus from the soil using different strategies. Plant species richness within individual nutrient-acquisition strategies also increased dramatically, with the species richness of many strategies more than doubling between the youngest and oldest soils. These results reveal increasing functional diversity of below-ground traits related to nutrient acquisition during ecosystem development, suggesting that no single combination of traits, including those related to nutrient-acquisition strategies, is superior to all others at extremely low soil fertility. Furthermore, the increasing diversity of nutrient-acquisition strategies with declining soil fertility, despite functional convergence of above-ground traits(4,6), suggests that fundamentally different plant community assembly processes operate above-and below-ground.

AB Anthropogenic (man-made) noise has changed the acoustic environment both on land and underwater and is now recognized as a pollutant of international concern. Increasing numbers of studies are assessing how noise pollution affects animals across a range of scales, from individuals to communities, but the topic receiving the most research attention has been acoustic communication. Although there is now an extensive literature on how signalers might avoid potential masking from anthropogenic noise, the vast majority of the work has been conducted on birds and marine mammals. Fish represent more than half of all vertebrate species, are a valuable and increasingly utilized model taxa for understanding behavior, and provide the primary source of protein for >1 billion people and the principal livelihoods for hunderds of millions. Assessing the impacts of noise on fish is therefore of clear biological, ecological, and societal importance. Here, we begin by indicating why acoustic communication in fish is likely to be impacted by anthropogenic noise. We then use studies from other taxa to outline 5 main ways in which animals can alter their acoustic signaling behavior when there is potential masking due to anthropogenic noise and assess evidence of evolutionary adaptation and behavioral plasticity in response to abiotic and biotic noise sources to consider whether such changes are feasible in fish. Finally, we suggest directions for future study of fish acoustic behavior in this context and highlight why such research may allow important advances in our general understanding of the impact of this global pollutant.

AB Citizen science can make major contributions to informal science education by targeting participants' attitudes and knowledge about science while changing human behavior towards the environment. We examined how training associated with an invasive species citizen science program affected participants in these areas. We found no changes in science literacy or overall attitudes between tests administered just before and after a one-day training program, matching results from other studies. However, we found improvements in science literacy and knowledge using context-specific measures and in self-reported intention to engage in pro-environmental activities. While we noted modest change in knowledge and attitudes, we found comparison and interpretation of these data difficult in the absence of other studies using similar measures. We suggest that alternative survey instruments are needed and should be calibrated appropriately to the pre-existing attitudes, behavior, and levels of knowledge in these relatively sophisticated target groups.

AB Rising temperatures and declining water availability have influenced the ecological function of mountain forests over the past half-century. For instance, warming in spring and summer and shifts towards earlier snowmelt are associated with an increase in wildfire activity and tree mortality in mountain forests in the western United States(1,2). Temperature increases are expected to continue during the twenty-first century in mountain ecosystems across the globe(3,4), with uncertain consequences. Here, we examine the influence of interannual variations in snowpack accumulation on forest greenness in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, between 1982 and 2006. Using observational records of snow accumulation and satellite data on vegetation greenness we show that vegetation greenness increases with snow accumulation. Indeed, we show that variations in maximum snow accumulation explain over 50% of the interannual variability in peak forest greenness across the Sierra Nevada region. The extent to which snow accumulation can explain variations in greenness varies with elevation, reaching a maximum in the water-limited mid-elevations, between 2,000 and 2,600 m. In situ measurements of carbon uptake and snow accumulation along an elevational transect in the region confirm the elevation dependence of this relationship. We suggest that mid-elevation mountain forest ecosystems could prove particularly sensitive to future increases in temperature and concurrent changes in snow accumulation and melt.

AB Ecology Letters (2012) Abstract Model-based projections of shifts in tree species range due to climate change are becoming an important decision support tool for forest management. However, poorly evaluated sources of uncertainty require more scrutiny before relying heavily on models for decision-making. We evaluated uncertainty arising from differences in model formulations of tree response to climate change based on a rigorous intercomparison of projections of tree distributions in France. We compared eight models ranging from niche-based to process-based models. On average, models project large range contractions of temperate tree species in lowlands due to climate change. There was substantial disagreement between models for temperate broadleaf deciduous tree species, but differences in the capacity of models to account for rising CO2 impacts explained much of the disagreement. There was good quantitative agreement among models concerning the range contractions for Scots pine.

AB Popular pastoral species, Buffet grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) is receiving long overdue attention as an invasive weed that poses serious threats to biodiversity conservation worldwide. Most research focuses on the species as forage plant and is largely published in agricultural and grey literature. Meanwhile, there is a dearth of information about the species ecology in natural landscapes despite strong evidence from field workers and managers that the species is an aggressive invader and threat to biodiversity in many environments. We present a comprehensive review of the ecology, distribution and biodiversity impacts of Buffel grass when behaving as an invasive species. Foundations are laid for research intc localised habitat requirements of the species that will aid in the management of Buffel grass invasions now and into the future. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A central focus of ecology and biogeography is to determine the factors that govern spatial variation in biodiversity. Here, we examined patterns of ant diversity along climatic gradients in three temperate montane systems: Great Smoky Mountains National Park (USA), Chiricahua Mountains (USA), and Vorarlberg (Austria). To identify the factors which potentially shape these elevational diversity gradients, we analyzed patterns of community phylogenetic structure (i.e. the evolutionary relationships among species coexisting in local communities). We found that species at low-elevation sites tended to be evenly dispersed across phylogeny, suggesting that these communities are structured by interspecific competition. In contrast, species occurring at high-elevation sites tended to be more closely related than expected by chance, implying that these communities are structured primarily by environmental filtering caused by low temperatures. Taken together, the results of our study highlight the potential role of niche constraints, environmental temperature, and competition in shaping broad-scale diversity gradients. We conclude that phylogenetic structure indeed accounts for some variation in species density, yet it does not entirely explain why temperature and species density are correlated.

AB There is increasing concern over the impact of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition on forest ecosystems in the tropical and subtropical areas. In this study, we quantified atmospheric N deposition and revealed current plant and soil N status in 14 forests along a 150 km urban to rural transect in southern China, with an emphasis on examining whether foliar delta 15N can be used as an indicator of N saturation. Bulk deposition ranged from 16.2 to 38.2 kg N ha-1 yr-1, while the throughfall covered a larger range of 11.7-65.1 kg N ha-1 yr-1. Foliar N concentration, NO3- leaching to stream, and soil NO3- concentration were low and NO3- production was negligible in some rural forests, indicating that primary production in these forests may be limited by N supply. But all these N variables were enhanced in suburban and urban forests. Across the study transect, throughfall N input was correlated positively with soil nitrification and NO3- leaching to stream, and negatively with pH values in soil and stream water. Foliar delta 15N was between -6.6 parts per thousand and 0.7 parts per thousand, and was negatively correlated with soil NO3- concentration and NO3- leaching to stream across the entire transect, demonstrating that an increased N supply does not necessarily increase forest delta 15N values. We proposed several potential mechanism that could contribute to the delta 15N pattern, including (1) increased plant uptake of 15N-depleted soil NO3-, (2) foliage uptake of 15N-depleted NH4+, (3) increased utilization of soil inorganic N relative to dissolved organic N, and (4) increased fractionation during plant N uptake under higher soil N availability.

AB When animals colonize cities they often have to adapt their physiology, life history and behaviour to the novel environment. Songbirds rely on acoustic communication for reproduction, and recent studies indicate that songs vary between urban and nonurban habitats. In cities, birds sing louder or use higher frequencies compared to their conspecifics in forests. These habitat-specific differences in song have been interpreted as an adaptation of the city birds to mitigate acoustic masking by low-frequency traffic noise. We compared the songs of blackbirds, Turdus merula, from the city centre of Vienna and the Vienna Woods and found that forest birds sang at lower frequencies and with longer intervals between songs. This difference in song pitch might reflect an adaptation to urban ambient noise. However, the song divergence could also be the result of more intense vocal interaction in the more densely populated city areas or a side-effect of physiological adaptation to urban habitats. We emphasize the need for experimental studies in blackbirds, but also in other species, to clarify a possible causal link between urban acoustics and song characteristics of city birds.

AB Our research takes advantage of a historical trend in natural reforestation of abandoned tropical pastures to examine changes in soil carbon (C) during 80 years of secondary forest regrowth. We combined a chronosequence approach with differences in the natural abundance of C-13 between C3 (forest) and C4 (pasture) plants to estimate turnover times of C in the bulk soil and in density fractions. Overall, gains in secondary forest C were compensated for by the loss of residual pasture-derived soil C, resulting in no net change in bulk soil C stocks down to 1 m depth over the chronosequence. The free light fraction (LF), representing physically unprotected particulate organic matter, was most sensitive to land-use change. Reforestation replenished C in the free LF that had been depleted during conversion to pastures. Turnover times varied with model choice, but in general, soil C cycling rates were rapid for the 0-10 cm depth, with even the heavy fraction (HF) containing C cycling in decadal time scales. Turnover times of C in the free LF from the 0-10 cm depth were shorter than for the occluded and HFs, highlighting the importance of physical location in the soil matrix for residence time in the soil. The majority of the soil C pool (82 +/- 21%) was recovered in the mineral-associated density fraction. Carbon-to-nitrogen ratios and differences in natural abundance N-15 of soil organic matter (SOM) showed an increasing degree of decomposition across density fractions with increasing mineral association. Our data show that the physical distribution of C in the soil has a large impact on soil C turnover and the ability of soils to maintain SOM stocks during land-use and land-cover change.

AB N saturation induced by atmospheric N deposition can have serious consequences for forest health in many regions. In order to evaluate whether foliar delta N-15 may be a robust, regional-scale measure of the onset of N saturation in forest ecosystems, we assembled a large dataset on atmospheric N deposition, foliar and root delta N-15 and N concentration, soil C:N, mineralization and nitrification. The dataset included sites in northeastern North America, Colorado, Alaska, southern Chile and Europe. Local drivers of N cycling (net nitrification and mineralization, and forest floor and soil C: N) were more closely coupled with foliar delta N-15 than the regional driver of N deposition. Foliar delta N-15 increased non-linearly with nitrification: mineralization ratio and decreased with forest floor C: N. Foliar delta N-15 was more strongly related to nitrification rates than was foliar N concentration, but concentration was more strongly correlated with N deposition. Root delta N-15 was more tightly coupled to forest floor properties than was foliar delta N-15. We observed a pattern of decreasing foliar delta N-15 values across the following species: American beech > yellow birch > sugar maple. Other factors that affected foliar delta N-15 included species composition and climate. Relationships between foliar delta N-15 and soil variables were stronger when analyzed on a species by species basis than when many species were lumped. European sites showed distinct patterns of lower foliar delta N-15, due to the importance of ammonium deposition in this region. Our results suggest that examining delta N-15 values of foliage may improve understanding of how forests respond to the cascading effects of N deposition.

AB We assessed the digestibility and utilization of ice algae and phytoplankton by the shallow, subtidal benthos in Ny angstrom lesund (Kongsfjord) on Svalbard (79 degrees N, 12 degrees E) using chlorophyll a (chl a), essential fatty acids (EFAs) and stable isotopes as tracers of food consumption and assimilation. Intact benthic communities in sediment cores and individuals of dominant benthic taxa were given ice algae, phytoplankton, C-13-enriched ice algae or a no food addition control for 19 to 32 d. Ice algae and phytoplankton had significantly different isotopic signatures and relative concentrations of fatty acids. In the food addition cores, sediment concentrations of chl a and the EFA C20:5(n-3) were elevated by 80 and 93 %, respectively, compared to the control after 12 h, but decreased to background levels by 19 d, suggesting that both ice algae and phytoplankton were rapidly consumed. Whole core respiration rates in the ice algae treatments were 1.4 times greater than in the other treatments within 12 h of food addition. In the ice algae treatment, both suspension and deposit feeding taxa from 3 different phyla (Mollusca, Annelida and Sipuncula) exhibited significant enrichment in delta C-13 values compared to the control. Deposit feeders (15 % uptake), however, exhibited significantly greater uptake of the 13C-enriched ice algae tracer than suspension feeders (3 % uptake). Our study demonstrates that ice algae are readily consumed and assimilated by the Arctic benthos, and may be preferentially selected by some benthic species (i.e. deposit feeders) due to their elevated EFA content, thus serving as an important component of the Arctic benthic food web.

AB Species diversity and genetic diversity may be correlated as a result of processes acting in parallel at the two levels. However, no theories predict the conditions under which different relationships between species diversity and genetic diversity might arise and therefore when one level of diversity may be predicted using the other. I used simulation models to investigate the parallel influence of locality area, immigration rate, and environmental heterogeneity on species diversity and genetic diversity. The most common pattern was moderate to strong positive species-genetic diversity correlations (SGDCs). Such correlations may be driven by any one of the three locality characteristics examined, but important exceptions and patterns emerged. Genetic diversity and species diversity were more weakly correlated when genetic diversity was measured for rare versus common species. Environmental heterogeneity not only imposes spatially varying selection on populations and communities but also causes changes in species' population sizes and therefore genetic diversity; these interacting processes can create positive, negative, or unimodal relationships of genetic diversity with species diversity. When species are considered as part of multispecies communities, predictions from single-species models of genetic diversity apply in some instances (effects of area and immigration) but often not in others (effects of environmental heterogeneity).

AB Nutrient supply and herbivore presence can regulate plant biomass. The relative impact of both of these factors, and their interactions, on periphyton biomass were examined in a quantitative meta-analysis. A literature survey revealed 85 experiments with factorial and replicated manipulation of grazer access and nutrient supply. Two measures of effect sizes were calculated for each experiment, one based on final biomass yields (Hedges' d) and the other on rates (Deltar). Grazers significantly reduced periphyton biomass across all experiments, whereas nutrient addition significantly increased periphyton biomass. Effect sizes were very large for both factors. Thus, periphyton can be viewed as highly controlled by top-down and bottom-up mechanisms. Grazer effects were greater than nutrient effects. This result would be expected because nutrient enrichment represents a relative relief from nutrient limitation, whereas grazer exclusion represents a categorical removal of grazing pressure. Moreover, nutrient uptake and growth response are time-lagged, whereas grazer effects are more immediate. The assembled data set was used to test for significant impacts of the habitat and of the experimental design on the importance of grazers and nutrients. Both factors had consistent effects in streams, lakes, and coastal environments, although some variation in effect strength was found. Background productivity levels also did not affect the main effects, but increases in periphyton biomass led to increasing grazer effects and decreasing nutrient effects. The interaction between grazing and nutrients differed between habitats from different aquatic realms and with different productivity. The interaction metric for Hedges' d was significantly positive for lakes and coasts, indicating a greater impact of nutrients in the absence of herbivores than in their presence. No such interaction was found for streams or for mesotrophic habitats. Similar trends were evident for Deltar The experimental design profoundly affected the effects of grazers and nutrients on periphyton biomass, with regard to type of grazer manipulation, type of nutrient enrichment, and duration of the experiment. This outcome indicated the crucial role of a careful experimental design.

AB Although there are a number of single system and regional studies on the importance of picophytoplankton (PP: 0.2-2 mum), there has been little effort to quantify their importance on a larger scale and to integrate marine and freshwater studies. We developed empirical models from data in the literature to assess the absolute and relative importance of PP in marine and freshwater The PP biomass (chlorophyll a [Chl a]) increases with trophic status, here represented by the total Chl a. in both marine and freshwater systems. In addition, PP abundance in freshwater and primary production in marine waters, increases with trophic status. Even so, the relative importance of the PP biomass and primary production declines systematically with increasing trophic status in both marine and freshwater systems. Both the absolute biomass of PP and the relative contribution of PP biomass to the total phytoplankton community biomass are larger in freshwater at any particular value of total Chl a. In eutrophic lakes, which are typically shallow and particularly susceptible to the greatest phytoplankton resuspension and sediment recruitment, the on average small relative contribution of PP biomass appears affected by a relatively high but variable contribution of resuspended microplankton.

AB Very old, undisturbed forest stands may be important for biodiversity through their content of microhabitats or for the long periods available for colonisation, or for both. The term Ecological Continuity (EC) has been used to ascribe value to old forest stands. The relative importance of microhabitat and time for colonisation are usually not kept apart when EC is used as a conservation criterium. EC is broadly applied but poorly defined. Use of EC may lead to underestimation of the importance of forest dynamics and dispersal, and to overestimation of the importance of local land use history. If bioindicators of long-term habitat persistence are to be used, species with low dispersal capacity should be chosen. However, many lichens and other fungi, bryophytes and insects cited as indicators of EC, seem to have a patch-tracking lifestyle. They are 'colonists' according to life history strategy classification, and rather seem to indicate specific microhabitats. Terrestrial molluscs, some vascular forest plants, and those bryophytes and lichenized fungi classified as 'perennial stayers' in life history strategy classification, might be used to indicate long-term habitat persistence in forests, but more research is needed to evaluate such indicators.

AB This study examined predator faunas of artificial ground and shrub nests and whether nest predation risk was influenced by nest site, proximity to forest edge, and habitat structure in 38 grassland plots in southcentral Sweden. There was a clear separation of predator faunas between shrub and ground nests as identified from marks in plasticine eggs. Corvids accounted for almost all predation on shrub nests whereas mammals mainly depredated ground nests. Nest predation risk was significantly greater for shrub than for ground nests at all distances (i.e. 0, 15 and 30 m) from the forest edge. However, nest predation risk was not significantly related to distance to forest edge, but: significantly increased with decreasing distance to the nearest tree. Different corvid species robbed nests at different distances from the forest edge, with jays robbing nests closest to edges. We conclude that the relationship between the predation risk of grassland bird nests and distance to the forest edge mainly depends on the relative importance of different nest predator species and on the structure of the forest edge zone. A review of published articles on artificial shrub and ground nest predation in the temperate zone corroborated the results of our own study, namely that shrub nests experienced higher rates of depredation in open habitats close to the forest edge and that avian predators predominantly robbed shrub nests. Furthermore, the review results showed that predation rates on nests in general are highest <50 m inside the forest and lower in open as well as forest interior habitats (greater than or equal to 50 m from the edge).

AB The relative influence of local versus landscape heterogeneity on species abundance is an important consideration in the design and management of nature reserves in heterogeneous landscapes. We described the spatial patterns of resident breeding bird abundance at a landscape scale in an urbanizing landscape gradient in coastal San Diego County, California (USA). The gradient spanned approximately 260 km(2) and included a large, mostly contiguous block of undeveloped shrub habitat mosaic which graded into an area of internally fragmented habitat and finally into an area characterized by discrete patches of habitat in an urban matrix. We quantified the distribution of resident bird species in this landscape with point counts and used stepwise logistic regression and canonical correspondence analysis to explore the relative strengths of association between bird abundance and local habitat variation versus landscape variation for the 20 most common bird species. We measured local habitat variation versus landscape variation for the 20 most common bird species. We measured local habitat conditions in a 100-m radius around each point count station. Landscape variables were extracted from a GIS database of this region and included habitat patch size, distance to developed edge, and two indices of urban exposure. The addition of landscape variables to stepwise logistic regression analyses substatially improved the predictive power of the resulting models in 14 of 20 species. Model concordance (the ability of the model to correctly classify all pairs of divergent sites) increased from a mean of 56% without landscape variables to 76% when one or more landscape variables were selected for inclusion in the final model. Response of the 20 focal species to the landscape gradient differed markedly among species. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to rank species along a landscape response gradient from edge/fragmentation reduced species to edge/fragmentation enhanced species. The four species exhibiting the most edge/fragmentation reduced pattern were sparrows: Sage (Amphispiza belli), Rufous-crowned (Aimophila ruficeps), Lark (Chondestes grammacus), and Black-chinned sparrows (Spizella atrogularis). Costa's Hummingbird (Calypte costae) also showed a pattern of edge/fragmentation reduction. The opposite end of the gradient was occupied by species whose densities are elevated near edges and in fragmented areas. The middle of the gradient was occupied by species that were abundant, widely distributed, and showed no sensitivity to landscape position or shrub habitat type. The abundance of edge/fragmentation reduced species appears to be depressed within 200 to 500 m of an edge and the abundance of the edge/fragmentation enhanced species is elevated up to 1000 m from an edge, depending on the species. Conservation analyses, including GAP analysis, often assume that the relationship between species abundance and habitat is invariant with landscape position. In heterogeneous landscapes these analyses may underestimate the conservation risk to species in the edge/fragmentation sensitive category because their abundance varies strongly with landscape location.

AB There is growing international interest in better managing soils to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) content to contribute to climate change mitigation, to enhance resilience to climate change and to underpin food security, through initiatives such as international '4p1000' initiative and the FAO's Global assessment of SOC sequestration potential (GSOCseq) programme. Since SOC content of soils cannot be easily measured, a key barrier to implementing programmes to increase SOC at large scale, is the need for credible and reliable measurement/monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) platforms, both for national reporting and for emissions trading. Without such platforms, investments could be considered risky. In this paper, we review methods and challenges of measuring SOC change directly in soils, before examining some recent novel developments that show promise for quantifying SOC. We describe how repeat soil surveys are used to estimate changes in SOC over time, and how long-term experiments and space-for-time substitution sites can serve as sources of knowledge and can be used to test models, and as potential benchmark sites in global frameworks to estimate SOC change. We briefly consider models that can be used to simulate and project change in SOC and examine the MRV platforms for SOC change already in use in various countries/regions. In the final section, we bring together the various components described in this review, to describe a new vision for a global framework for MRV of SOC change, to support national and international initiatives seeking to effect change in the way we manage our soils.

AB A central challenge in ecology is to understand the relative importance of processes that shape diversity patterns. Compared with aboveground biota, little is known about spatial patterns and processes in soil organisms. Here we examine the spatial structure of communities of small soil eukaryotes to elucidate the underlying stochastic and deterministic processes in the absence of environmental gradients at a local scale. Specifically, we focus on the fine-scale spatial autocorrelation of prominent taxonomic and functional groups of eukaryotic microbes. We collected 123 soil samples in a nested design at distances ranging from 0.01 to 64m from three boreal forest sites and used 454 pyrosequencing analysis of Internal Transcribed Spacer for detecting Operational Taxonomic Units of major eukaryotic groups simultaneously. Among the main taxonomic groups, we found significant but weak spatial variability only in the communities of Fungi and Rhizaria. Within Fungi, ectomycorrhizas and pathogens exhibited stronger spatial structure compared with saprotrophs and corresponded to vegetation. For the groups with significant spatial structure, autocorrelation occurred at a very fine scale (< 2m). Both dispersal limitation and environmental selection had a weak effect on communities as reflected in negative or null deviation of communities, which was also supported by multivariate analysis, that is, environment, spatial processes and their shared effects explained on average < 10% of variance. Taken together, these results indicate a random distribution of soil eukaryotes with respect to space and environment in the absence of environmental gradients at the local scale, reflecting the dominant role of drift and homogenizing dispersal.

AB In the last decade, bacterial symbionts have been shown to play an important role in protecting hosts against pathogens. Wolbachia, a widespread symbiont in arthropods, can protect Drosophila and mosquito species against viral infections. We have investigated antiviral protection in 19 Wolbachia strains originating from 16 Drosophila species after transfer into the same genotype of Drosophila simulans. We found that approximately half of the strains protected against two RNA viruses. Given that 40% of terrestrial arthropod species are estimated to harbour Wolbachia, as many as a fifth of all arthropods species may benefit from Wolbachia-mediated protection. The level of protection against two distantly related RNA viruses -DCV and FHV-was strongly genetically correlated, which suggests that there is a single mechanism of protection with broad specificity. Furthermore, Wolbachia is making flies resistant to viruses, as increases in survival can be largely explained by reductions in viral titer. Variation in the level of antiviral protection provided by different Wolbachia strains is strongly genetically correlated to the density of the bacteria strains in host tissues. We found no support for two previously proposed mechanisms of Wolbachia-mediated protection-activation of the immune system and upregulation of the methyltransferase Dnmt2. The large variation in Wolbachia's antiviral properties highlights the need to carefully select Wolbachia strains introduced into mosquito populations to prevent the transmission of arboviruses.

TI Environmental DNA surveillance for invertebrate species: advantages and
   technical limitations to detect invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii in
   freshwater ponds

AB 1. The introduction of non-native species is a major threat to biodiversity. While eradication programs of well-established invaders are costly and hazardous for non-target species, the early detection of a non-native species at low density is critical for preventing biological invasions in recipient ecosystems. Recent studies reveal that environmental DNA (eDNA) is a powerful tool for detecting target species in aquatic ecosystems, but these studies focus mostly on fish and amphibians.
   2. We examine the reliability of using eDNA to detect the presence of an invasive freshwater crustacean species, the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii. Species-specific primers and probes were designed; their specificity was tested using in silico PCR simulations and against tissues of other crayfish species. Limits of detection and quantification were specified for the target DNA sequence by means of quantitative PCR amplifications on dilution series of known amount of P. clarkii DNA.
   3. The method was applied to water samples collected in 158 ponds in a French Nature Park, and results were compared to a traditional method using food-baited funnel traps. Environmental DNA had a better detection efficiency but predominantly led to divergent results compared with the trapping method. While habitat features partly explained the failure of crayfish detection by trapping, detection by eDNA was problematic at low crayfish abundances. When P. clarkii was detected, the estimated concentrations of crayfish DNA in water samples were always below the limit of quantification for the target DNA sequence.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The combination of environmental DNA (eDNA) and conventional trapping methods is recommended to monitor the invasion by P. clarkii in small water-bodies such as ponds. However, the risk of mortality for non-target species, notably amphibians, has to be carefully evaluated before large-scale deployment of traps. Contrary to fish and amphibians, a low amount of extracellular DNA in water is suspected to be the major limitation for crayfish detection by molecular approaches. Current advancements in PCR technology, together with optimization of the water sampling method, promise upcoming developments of eDNA detection for aquatic invertebrate species.

AB Thermal preference and performance provide the physiological frame within which fish species seek strategies to cope with the challenges raised by the low temperatures and low levels of oxygen and food that characterize winter. There are two common coping strategies: active utilization of winter conditions or simple toleration of winter conditions. The former is typical of winter specialist species with low preferred temperatures, and the latter is typical of species with higher preferred temperatures. Reproductive strategies are embodied in the phenology of spawning: the approach of winter conditions cues reproductive activity in many coldwater fish species, while the departure of winter conditions cues reproduction in many cool and warmwater fish species. This cuing system promotes temporal partitioning of the food resources available to young-of-year fish and thus supports high diversity in freshwater fish communities. If the zoogeographic distribution of a species covers a broad range of winter conditions, local populations may exhibit differences in their winter survival strategies that reflect adaptation to local conditions. Extreme winter specialists are found in shallow eutrophic lakes where long periods of ice cover cause winter oxygen levels to drop to levels that are lethal to many fish. The fish communities of these lakes are simple and composed of species that exhibit specialized adaptations for extended tolerance of very low temperatures and oxygen levels. Zoogeographic boundaries for some species may be positioned at points on the landscape where the severity of winter overwhelms the species' repertoire of winter survival strategies. Freshwater fish communities are vulnerable to many of the shifts in environmental conditions expected with climate change. Temperate and northern communities are particularly vulnerable since the repertoires of physiological and behavioural strategies that characterize many of their members have been shaped by the adverse environmental conditions (e.g. cool short summers, long cold winters) that climate change is expected to mitigate. The responses of these strategies to the rapid relaxation of the adversities that shaped them will play a significant role in the overall responses of these fish populations and their communities to climate change.

AB The smallest marine phytoplankton, collectively termed picophytoplankton, have been routinely enumerated by flow cytometry since the late 1980s during cruises throughout most of the world ocean. We compiled a database of 40 946 data points, with separate abundance entries for Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes. We use average conversion factors for each of the three groups to convert the abundance data to carbon biomass. After gridding with 1 degrees spacing, the database covers 2.4% of the ocean surface area, with the best data coverage in the North Atlantic, the South Pacific and North Indian basins, and at least some data in all other basins. The average picophytoplankton biomass is 12 +/- 22 mu g Cl-1 or 1.9 g C m(-2). We estimate a total global picophytoplankton biomass of 0.53-1.32 Pg C (17-39% Prochlorococcus, 12-15% Synechococcus and 49-69% picoeukaryotes), with an intermediate/best estimate of 0.74 Pg C. Future efforts in this area of research should focus on reporting calibrated cell size and collecting data in undersampled regions. http://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.777385

AB Current climate and Pleistocene climatic changes are both known to be associated with geographical patterns of diversity. We assess their associations with the European Scarabaeinae dung beetles, a group with high dispersal ability and well-known adaptations to warm environments. By assessing spatial stationarity in climate variability since the last glacial maximum (LGM), we find that current scarab richness is related to the location of their limits of thermal tolerance during the LGM. These limits mark a strong change in their current species richness-environment relationships. Furthermore, northern scarab assemblages are nested and composed of a phylogenetically clustered subset of large-range sized generalist species, whereas southern ones are diverse and variable in composition. Our results show that species responses to current climate are limited by the evolution of assemblages that occupied relatively climatically stable areas during the Pleistocene, and by post-glacial dispersal in those that were strongly affected by glaciations.

AB This paper presents a multi-site (>20) analysis of the relative and absolute energy balance (EB) closure at European FLUXNET sites, as a function of the stability parameter xi, the friction velocity u., thermally-induced turbulence, and the time of the day. A focus of the analysis is the magnitude of EB deficits for very unstable conditions. A univariate analysis of the relative EB deficit as function of xi alone (both for individual sites and a synthesis for all sites), reveals that the relative EB deficit is larger for very unstable conditions (xi < -1.0) than for less unstable conditions (-0.02 > xi >= -1.0). A bivariate analysis of the relative EB deficit as function of both xi and u., however, indicates that for situations with comparable u. the closure is better for very unstable conditions than for less unstable conditions. Our results suggest that the poorer closure for very unstable conditions identified from the univariate analysis is due to reduced u. under these conditions. In addition, we identify that the conditions characterized by smallest relative EB deficits (elevated overall turbulence, mostly during day time) correspond to cases with the largest absolute EB deficits. Thus, the total EB deficit at the sites is induced mostly under these conditions, which is particularly relevant for evapotranspiration estimates. Further, situations with the largest relative EB deficits are generally characterized by small absolute EB deficits. We also find that the relative EB deficit does generally not correspond to the regression line of absolute EB deficit with the net radiation because there is a (positive or negative) offset. This can be understood from theoretical considerations. Finally, we find that storage effects explain a considerable fraction of the large relative (but small absolute) nocturnal EB deficits, and only a limited fraction of the overall relative and absolute EB deficits.

AB Soils are extremely rich in biodiversity, and soil organisms play pivotal roles in supporting terrestrial life, but the role that individual plants and plant communities play in influencing the diversity and functioning of soil food webs remains highly debated. Plants, as primary producers and providers of resources to the soil food web, are of vital importance for the composition, structure, and functioning of soil communities. However, whether natural soil food webs that are completely open to immigration and emigration differ underneath individual plants remains unknown. In a biodiversity restoration experiment we first compared the soil nematode communities of 228 individual plants belonging to eight herbaceous species. We included grass, leguminous, and non-leguminous species. Each individual plant grew intermingled with other species, but all plant species had a different nematode community. Moreover, nematode communities were more similar when plant individuals were growing in the same as compared to different plant communities, and these effects were most apparent for the groups of bacterivorous, carnivorous, and omnivorous nematodes. Subsequently, we analyzed the composition, structure, and functioning of the complete soil food webs of 58 individual plants, belonging to two of the plant species, Lotus corniculatus (Fabaceae) and Plantago lanceolata (Plantaginaceae). We isolated and identified more than 150 taxa/groups of soil organisms. The soil community composition and structure of the entire food webs were influenced both by the species identity of the plant individual and the surrounding plant community. Unexpectedly, plant identity had the strongest effects on decomposing soil organisms, widely believed to be generalist feeders. In contrast, quantitative food web modeling showed that the composition of the plant community influenced nitrogen mineralization under individual plants, but that plant species identity did not affect nitrogen or carbon mineralization or food web stability. Hence, the composition and structure of entire soil food webs vary at the scale of individual plants and are strongly influenced by the species identity of the plant. However, the ecosystem functions these food webs provide are determined by the identity of the entire plant community.

AB The positive relationship between spatial environmental heterogeneity and species diversity is a widely accepted concept, generally associated with niche limitation. However, niche limitation cannot account for negative heterogeneity-diversity relationships (HDR) revealed in several case studies. Here we explore how HDR varies at different spatial scales and provide novel theories for small-scale species co-existence that explain both positive and negative HDR. At large spatial scales of heterogeneity (e.g. landscape level), different communities co-exist, promoting large regional species pool size and resulting in positive HDR. At smaller scales within communities, species co-existence can be enhanced by increasing the number of different patches, as predicted by the niche limitation theory, or alternatively, restrained by heterogeneity. We conducted meta-regressions for experimental and observational HDR studies, and found that negative HDRs are significantly more common at smaller spatial scales. We propose three theories to account for niche limitation at small spatial scales. (1) Microfragmentation theory: with increasing spatial heterogeneity, large homogeneous patches lose area and become isolated, which in turn restrains the establishment of new plant individuals and populations, thus reducing species richness. (2) Heterogeneity confounded by mean: when heterogeneity occurs at spatial scales smaller than the size of individual plants, which forage through the patches, species diversity can be either positively or negatively affected by a change in the mean of an environmental factor. (3) Heterogeneity as a separate niche axis: the ability of species to tolerate heterogeneity at spatial scales smaller than plant size varies, affecting HDR. We conclude that processes other than niche limitation can affect the relationship between heterogeneity and diversity.

AB In this study, we examined the bacterial endophyte community of potato (Solanum tuberosum) cultivar/clones using two different molecular-based techniques (bacterial automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (B-ARISA) and pyrosequencing). B-ARISA profiles revealed a significant difference in the endophytic community between cultivars (perMANOVA, p < 0.001), and canonical correspondence analysis showed a significant correlation between the community structure and plant biomass (p = 0.001). Pyrosequencing detected, on average, 477 +/- 71 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs, 97% genetic similarity) residing within the roots of each cultivar, with a Chao estimated total OTU richness of 1,265 +/- 313. Across all cultivars, a total of 238 known genera from 15 phyla were identified. Interestingly, five of the ten most common genera (Rheinheimera, Dyadobacter, Devosia, Pedobacter, and Pseudoxanthomonas) have not, to our knowledge, been previously reported as endophytes of potato. Like the B-ARISA analysis, the endophytic communities differed between cultivar/clones (a <<-libshuff, p < 0.001) and exhibited low similarities on both a presence/absence (0.145 +/- 0.019) and abundance (0.420 +/- 0.081) basis. Seventeen OTUs showed a strong positive (r > 0.600) or negative (r < -0.600) correlation with plant biomass, suggesting a possible link between plant production and endophyte abundance. This study represents one of the most comprehensive assessments of the bacterial endophytic communities to date, and similar analyses in other plant species, cultivars, or tissues could be utilized to further elucidate the potential contribution(s) of endophytic communities to plant physiology and production.

AB The role of ecology in the origin of species has been the subject of long-standing interest to evolutionary biologists. New sources of spatially explicit ecological data allow for large-scale tests of whether speciation is associated with niche divergence or whether closely related species tend to be similar ecologically (niche conservatism). Because of the confounding effects of spatial autocorrelation of environmental variables, we generate null expectations for niche divergence for both an ecological-niche modeling and a multivariate approach to address the question: do allopatrically distributed taxa occupy similar niches? In a classic system for the study of niche evolution the Aphelocoma jays we show that there is little evidence for niche divergence among Mexican Jay (A. ultramarina) lineages in the process of speciation, contrary to previous results. In contrast, Aphelocoma species that exist in partial sympatry in some regions show evidence for niche divergence. Our approach is widely applicable to the many cases of allopatric lineages in the beginning stages of speciation. These results do not support an ecological speciation model for Mexican Jay lineages because, in most cases, the allopatric environments they occupy are not significantly more divergent than expected under a null model.

AB Degradation of soil properties following deforestation and long-term soil cultivation may lead to decreases in soil microbial diversity and functional stability. In this study, we investigated the differences in the stability (resistance and resilience) of microbial community composition and enzyme activities in adjacent soils under either native tropical forest (FST) or in agricultural cropping use for 14 years (AGR). Mineral soil samples (0 to 5 cm) from both areas were incubated at 40A degrees C, 50A degrees C, 60A degrees C, or 70A degrees C for 15 min in order to successively reduce the microbial biomass. Three and 30 days after the heat shocks, fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis, cellulase and laccase activities, and phospholipid-derived fatty acids-based microbial community composition were measured. Microbial biomass was reduced up to 25% in both soils 3 days after the heat shocks. The higher initial values of microbial biomass, enzyme activity, total and particulate soil organic carbon, and aggregate stability in the FST soil coincided with higher enzymatic stability after heat shocks. FDA hydrolysis activity was less affected (more resistance) and cellulase and laccase activities recovered more rapidly (more resilience) in the FST soil relative to the AGR counterpart. In the AGR soil, laccase activity did not show resilience to any heat shock level up to 30 days after the disturbance. Within each soil type, the microbial community composition did not differ between heat shock and control samples at day 3. However, at day 30, FST soil samples treated at 60A degrees C and 70A degrees C contained a microbial community significantly different from the control and with lower biomass regardless of high enzyme resilience. Results of this study show that deforestation followed by long-term cultivation changed microbial community composition and had differential effects on microbial functional stability. Both soils displayed similar resilience to FDA hydrolysis, a composite measure of a broad range of hydrolases, supporting the concept of high functional redundancy in soil microbial communities. In contrast, the resilience of the substrate-specific activities of laccase and cellulase were lower in AGR soils, indicating a less diverse community of microorganisms capable of producing these enzymes and confirming that specific microbial functions are more sensitive measurements for evaluating change in the ecological stability of soils.

AB Sophisticated statistical analyses are common in ecological research, particularly in species distribution modeling. The effects of sometimes arbitrary decisions during the modeling procedure on the final outcome are difficult to assess, and to date are largely unexplored. We conducted an analysis quantifying the contribution of uncertainty in each step during the model-building sequence to variation in model validity and climate change projection uncertainty. Our study system was the distribution of the Great Grey Shrike in the German federal state of Saxony. For each of four steps (data quality, collinearity method, model type, and variable selection), we ran three different options in a factorial experiment, leading to 81 different model approaches. Each was subjected to a fivefold cross-validation, measuring area under curve (AUC) to assess model quality. Next, we used three climate change scenarios times three precipitation realizations to project future distributions from each model, yielding 729 projections. Again, we analyzed which step introduced most variability (the four model-building steps plus the two scenario steps) into predicted species prevalences by the year 2050. Predicted prevalences ranged from a factor of 0.2 to a factor of 10 of present prevalence, with the majority of predictions between 1.1 and 4.2 (inter-quartile range). We found that model type and data quality dominated this analysis. In particular, artificial neural networks yielded low cross-validation robustness and gave very conservative climate change predictions. Generalized linear and additive models were very similar in quality and predictions, and superior to neural networks. Variations in scenarios and realizations had very little effect, due to the small spatial extent of the study region and its relatively small range of climatic conditions. We conclude that, for climate projections, model type and data quality were the most influential factors. Since comparison of model types has received good coverage in the ecological literature, effects of data quality should now come under more scrutiny.

AB Since the time of Charles Darwin, studies of interspecific hybridization have been a major focus for evolutionary biologists. Although this phenomenon has often been viewed as problematic in the fields of ecology, taxonomy and systematics, it has become a primary source of data for studies on speciation and adaptation. Effects from genetic/ evolutionary processes, such as recombination and natural selection, usually develop over extended periods of time; however, they are accelerated in cases of hybridization. Interspecific hybrids exhibit novel genomes that are exposed to natural selection, thus providing a key to unravel the ultimate causes of adaptation and speciation. Here we provide firstly a historic perspective of hybridization research, secondly a novel attempt to assess the extent of hybridization among animals and thirdly an overview of the reviews and case studies presented in this theme issue.

AB From 2001 to 2004 we experimentally warmed 40 large, naturally established, white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] seedlings at alpine treeline in southwest Yukon, Canada, using passive open-top chambers (OTCs) distributed equally between opposing north and south-facing slopes. Our goal was to test the hypothesis that an increase in temperature consistent with global climate warming would elicit a positive growth response. OTCs increased growing season air temperatures by 1.8 degrees C and annual growing degree-days by one-third. In response, warmed seedlings grew significantly taller and had higher photosynthetic rates compared with control seedlings. On the south aspect, soil temperatures averaged 1.0 degrees C warmer and the snow-free period was nearly 1 month longer. These seedlings grew longer branches and wider annual rings than seedlings on the north aspect, but had reduced Photosystem-II efficiency and experienced higher winter needle mortality. The presence of OTCs tended to reduce winter dieback over the course of the experiment. These results indicate that climate warming will enhance vertical growth rates of young conifers, with implications for future changes to the structure and elevation of treeline contingent upon exposure-related differences. Our results suggest that the growth of seedlings on north-facing slopes is limited by low soil temperature in the presence of permafrost, while growth on south-facing slopes appears limited by winter desiccation and cold-induced photoinhibition.

AB Soil physical structure causes differential accessibility of soil organic carbon (SOC) to decomposer organisms and is an important determinant of SOC storage and turnover. Techniques for physical fractionation of soil organic matter in conjunction with isotopic analyses (delta(13)C, delta(15)N) of those soil fractions have been used previously to (a) determine where organic C is stored relative to aggregate structure, (b) identify sources of SOC, (c) quantify turnover rates of SOC in specific soil fractions, and (d) evaluate organic matter quality. We used these two complementary approaches to characterize soil C storage and dynamics in the Rio Grande Plains of southern Texas where C(3) trees/shrubs (delta(13)C = -27 parts per thousand) have largely replaced C(4) grasslands (delta(13)C = -14 parts per thousand) over the past 100-200 years. Using a chronosequence approach, soils were collected from remnant grasslands (Time 0) and from woody plant stands ranging in age from 10 to 130 years. We separated soil organic matter into specific size/density fractions and determined their C and N concentrations and natural delta(13)C and delta(15)N values. Mean residence times (MRTs) of soil fractions were calculated based on changes in their delta(13)C with time after woody encroachment. The shortest MRTs (average = 30 years) were associated with all particulate organic matter (POM) fractions not protected within aggregates. Fine POM (53-250 mu m) within macro- and microaggregates was relatively more protected from decay, with an average MRT of 60 years. All silt + clay fractions had the longest MRTs (average = 360 years) regardless of whether they were found inside or outside of aggregate structure. delta(15)N values of soil physical fractions were positively correlated with MRTs of the same fractions, suggesting that higher delta(15)N values reflect an increased degree of humification. Increased soil C and N pools in wooded areas were due to both the retention of older C(4)-derived organic matter by protection within microaggregates and association with silt + clay, and the accumulation of new C(3)-derived organic matter in macroaggregates and POM fractions.

AB Current definitions of habitat are closely allied to the concept of patch and matrix. This concept is, for instance, central to the prevailing metapopulation models of population dynamics. But, butterfly population dynamics, mobility and spatial structure can only properly be understood in the context of a resource-based definition of habitats. In criticising current definitions of habitat, we illustrate how habitat is best understood in terms of resource distributions. These transcend vegetation-based definitions of habitat and lie at the root of life history strategies, the vulnerability of butterflies to environmental changes and extinction, and govern conservation status. We emphasise the need for a resource-use database and demonstrate the shortcomings of current data for conserving butterflies; patch based definitions of habitats are inappropriate for some species and for others do not provide a universal panacea, inadequately explaining spatial occurrence when scaled over space and time. A resource-based habitat definition challenges the bipolar, patch vs. matrix view of landscape; the alternative is to view landscape as a continuum of overlapping resource distributions. We urge greater attention to the details of butterfly behaviour and resource use as the keys to understanding how landscape is exploited and therefore to successful conservation at the landscape scale.

AB A central problem in ecology is explaining the causes of population fluctuations, and an important step in the solution is determining the structure of the negative feedback (density dependent) process regulating population dynamics. The conventional way to determine the dimension or order of density dependence in a time series is to calculate the partial autorcorrelation function (PACF). We maintain, however, that PACF is not designed with biological populations in mind and has the wrong null model for detecting the structure of density dependence. We suggest an alternative diagnostic, the partial rate correlation function (PRCF), which is specifically designed for biological populations and has an appropriate null model for detecting their density dependent structures. Tests with simulated data show PRCF to be superior to PACF in detecting the underlying density dependent structure of two simple mathematical models.

AB To investigate the relation between lake type and bacterioplankton community composition, five Swedish lakes, which differed from each other in nutrient content and water color, were studied. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of I6S rDNA was used to examine community composition. The DGGE-patterns of the different samples were analyzed in relation to physical, chemical, and biological data from the lakes by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The three variables found to most strongly correlate with the DGGE patterns were biomasses of micro-zooplankton, cryptophytes, and chrysophytes, suggesting that these biota had an impact on bacterioplankton community structure. Two of the three factors were, in turn, significantly correlated to parameters associated with the trophic status of the lakes, indicating that the nutrient content of the lakes, at least indirectly, influenced the structure of the bacterioplankton community. The relation to water color was less pronounced.

AB A current paradigm in conservation biology is that forest harvest practices that better approximate natural disturbance processes are more likely to conserve biodiversity. We contrasted bird communities in three replicate stands in each of 1, 13-15, and 22-28 yr old forests following wildfire and harvest in north-central Alberta, Canada. Stands were chosen from old (>120 yr) boreal mixedwood forests having greater than or equal to 95% of the canopy trees killed during fire, and harvested sites retaining an average of 6% of the pre-harvest canopy trees. For all age classes, postharvest sites tended to have greater bird abundance. Species composition also differed between these treatment types. Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) identified five major ecological groupings of species that differed between wildfire and harvest, and among stand ages. Correspondence analysis (CA) identified similar bird communities. Greatest differences between bird communities occurred immediately following disturbance, and gradual convergence of communities occurred throughout the first 28 yr after disturbance. Species associated with open shrub and grassland or riparian habitats were associated primarily with I-yr postharvest stands. Three-toed Woodpeckers (Picoides tridactyla) and Black-backed Woodpeckers (P. arcticus), together with other species that use snags for foraging or nesting, occurred primarily in 1-yr postwildfire stands. Convergence in avian communities was correlated with the loss of standing snags on postwildfire sites. However, differences in bird communities were apparent up to 28 yr following disturbance, and this lack of complete convergence has important consequences for sustainable forestry practices designed to maintain biodiversity in the boreal mixedwood forest. Notably, Connecticut Warbler (Oporornis agilis), Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), and American Robin (Turdus migratorius) had higher densities on postwildfire than on postharvest stands. Lincoln's Sparrow (Melospiza georgiana), Alder Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum), Tennessee Warbler (Vermivora peregrina), Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia), American Redstart (Setophaga rutticilla), Mourning Warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), Rose-breasted Grosbeak (Pheucticus ludoviciana), Canada Warbler (Wilsonia canadensis), and Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus) had higher densities on postharvest stands, possibly due to the greater abundance, after harvest, of larger live residual trees and a taller and more dense shrub layer. Harvest designed to approximate stand-replacing fires may require the retention of more snags than is currently practiced. New approaches to fire salvage logging are also required to ensure adequate retention of standing dead trees on the landscape.

AB Cockles Cerastoderma edule (Linne) were exposed to different food suspensions consisting in mixtures of sediment and Tetraselmis suecica Butcher. Several parameters of feeding behaviour, including rates of filtration, pseudofaecal production, ingestion and absorption, were analysed as a function of both particle concentration and composition. We demonstrated particle selection at the preingestive level and resulting preferential organic ingestion. The relative energetic benefits derived from these processes were evaluated by computing different indices of sorting and food enrichment. Cockles fed organically rich diets were found to regulate rates of food ingestion mainly by adjusting clearance rates in order to maintain filtration of suspended matter virtually independent from changes in particle concentration. Conversely, with diets consisting of particles low in food value, clearance rates were kept nearly constant and rates of ingestion were regulated by increasing pseudofaeces production. Relative advantages derived from pseudofaeces formation have been evaluated for different dietary compositions by using a Benefit Ratio. Higher benefits were associated with preingestive food selection in the case of suspensions where particles of low organic content constituted the main dietary component, which may help to explain the maintenance of high rates of filtration coupled with extensive pseudofaecal deposition observed in cockles fed on low quality diets.

AB Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) brings major advancements in measuring terrestrial photosynthesis. Several recent studies have evaluated the potential of SIF retrievals from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) in estimating gross primary productivity (GPP) based on GPP data from eddy covariance (EC) flux towers. However, the spatially and temporally sparse nature of OCO-2 data makes it challenging to use these data for many applications from the ecosystem to the global scale. Here, we developed a new global OCO-2' SIF data set (GOSIF) with high spatial and temporal resolutions (i.e., 0.05 degrees, 8-day) over the period 2000-2017 based on a data-driven approach. The predictive SIF model was developed based on discrete OCO-2 SIF soundings, remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and meteorological reanalysis data. Our model performed well in estimating SIF (R-2 = 0.79, root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.07 W m(-2) m(-1) sr(-1)). The model was then used to estimate SIF for each 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees grid cell and each 8-day interval for the study period. The resulting GOSIF product has reasonable seasonal cycles, and captures the similar seasonality as both the coarse-resolution OCO-2 SIF (1 degrees), directly aggregated from the discrete OCO-2 soundings, and tower-based GPP. Our SIF estimates are highly correlated with GPP from 91 EC flux sites (R-2 = 0.73, p < 0.001). They capture the expected spatial and temporal patterns and also have remarkable ability to highlight the crop areas with the highest daily productivity across the globe. Our product also allows us to examine the long-term trends in SIF globally. Compared with the coarse-resolution SIF that was directly aggregated from OCO-2 soundings, GOSIF has finer spatial resolution, globally continuous coverage, and a much longer record. Our GOSIF product is valuable for assessing terrestrial photosynthesis and ecosystem function, and benchmarking terrestrial biosphere and Earth system models.

AB Many have advocated for collaborative governance and the participation of citizens and stakeholders on the basis that it can improve the environmental outcomes of public decision making, as compared to traditional, top-down decision making. Others, however, point to the potential negative effects of participation and collaboration on environmental outcomes. This article draws on several literatures to identify five clusters of causal mechanisms describing the relationship between participation and environmental outcomes. We distinguish (i) mechanisms that describe how participation impacts on the environmental standard of outputs, from (ii) mechanisms relating to the implementation of outputs. Three mechanism clusters focus on the role of representation of environmental concerns, participants' environmental knowledge, and dialogical interaction in decision making. Two further clusters elaborate on the role of acceptance, conflict resolution, and collaborative networks for the implementation of decisions. In addition to the mechanisms, linking independent with dependent variables, we identify the conditions under which participation may lead to better (or worse) environmental outcomes. This helps to resolve apparent contradictions in the literature. We conclude by outlining avenues for research that builds on this framework for analysis.

AB Biodiversity citizen science projects are growing in number, size, and scope, and are gaining recognition as valuable data sources that build public engagement. Yet publication rates indicate that citizen science is still infrequently used as a primary tool for conservation research and the causes of this apparent disconnect have not been quantitatively evaluated. To uncover the barriers to the use of citizen science as a research tool, we surveyed professional biodiversity scientists (n = 423) and citizen science project managers (n = 125). We conducted three analyses using non-parametric recursive modeling (random forest), using questions that addressed: scientists' perceptions and preferences regarding citizen science, scientists' requirements for their own data, and the actual practices of citizen science projects. For all three analyses we identified the most important factors that influence the probability of publication using citizen science data. Four general barriers emerged: a narrow awareness among scientists of citizen science projects that match their needs; the fact that not all biodiversity science is well-suited for citizen science; inconsistency in data quality across citizen science projects; and bias among scientists for certain data sources (institutions and ages/education levels of data collectors). Notably, we find limited evidence to suggest a relationship between citizen science projects that satisfy scientists' biases and data quality or probability of publication. These results illuminate the need for greater visibility of citizen science practices with respect to the requirements of biodiversity science and show that addressing bias among scientists could improve application of citizen science in conservation.

AB Ecological restoration can mitigate human disturbance to the natural environment and restore ecosystem functions. China's Grain-for-Green Programme (GFGP) has been widely adopted in the last 15 years and exerted significant impact on land-use and ecosystem services. North-western Yunnan is one of the key areas of GFGP implementation in the upper Yangtze River. Promotion of ecosystem services in this region is of great importance to the ecological sustainability of Yangtze River watershed. In this study, remote sensing and modelling techniques are applied to analyse the impact of GFGP on ecosystem services. Results show that the transformation from non-irrigated farmland to forestland could potentially improve soil conservation by 24.89%. Soil conservation of restored forest was 78.17% of retained forest while net primary production (NPP) already reached 88.65%, which suggested different recovery rates of NPP and soil conservation. Increasing extent of GFGP implementation improved soil conservation but decreased NPP and water yield at sub-watershed scale, which revealed trade-offs between ecosystem services under ecological restoration. Future ecosystem management and GFGP policy making should consider trade-offs of ecosystem services in order to achieve sustainable provision of ecosystem services. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB A major goal of remote sensing is the development of generalizable algorithms to repeatedly and accurately map ecosystem properties across space and time. Imaging spectroscopy has great potential to map vegetation traits that cannot be retrieved from broadband spectral data, but rarely have such methods been tested across broad regions. Here we illustrate a general approach for estimating key foliar chemical and morphological traits through space and time using NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-Classic). We apply partial least squares regression (PLSR) to data from 237 field plots within 51 images acquired between 2008 and 2011. Using a series of 500 randomized 50/50 subsets of the original data, we generated spatially explicit maps of seven traits (leaf mass per area (M-area), percentage nitrogen, carbon, fiber, lignin, and cellulose, and isotopic nitrogen (M concentration, delta N-15) as well as pixel-wise uncertainties in their estimates based on error propagation in the analytical methods. Both M-area and %N PLSR models had a R-2 > 0.85. Root mean square errors (RMSEs) for both variables were less than 9% of the range of data. Fiber and lignin were predicted with R-2 > 0.65 and carbon and cellulose with R-2 > 0.45. Although R-2 of %C and cellulose were lower than M-area and %N, the measured variability of these constituents (especially %C) was also lower, and their RMSE values were beneath 12% of the range in overall variability. Model performance for delta N-15 was the lowest (R-2 = 0.48, RMSE = 0.95 parts per thousand), but within 15% of the observed range. The resulting maps of chemical and morphological traits, together with their overall uncertainties, represent a first-of-its-kind approach for examining the spatiotemporal patterns of forest functioning and nutrient cycling across a broad range of temperate and sub-boreal ecosystems. These results offer an alternative to categorical maps of functional or physiognomic types by providing non-discrete maps (i.e., on a continuum) of traits that define those functional types. A key contribution of this work is the ability to assign retrieval uncertainties by pixel, a requirement to enable assimilation of these data products into ecosystem modeling frameworks to constrain carbon and nutrient cycling projections.

AB This paper proposes a framework for risk analysis of maritime transportation systems, where risk analysis is understood as a tool for argumentative decision support. Uncertainty is given a more prominent role than in the current state of art in the maritime transportation application area, and various tools are presented for analyzing uncertainty. A two-stage risk description is applied. In the first stage, Bayesian Network (BN) modeling is applied for probabilistic risk quantification. The model functions as a communication and argumentation tool, serving as an aid to thinking in a qualitative evidence and assumption effect assessment. The evidence assessment is used together with a sensitivity analysis to select alternative hypotheses for the risk quantification, while the assumption effect assessment is used to convey an argumentation beyond the model. Based on this, a deliberative uncertainty judgment is made in the second risk analysis stage, which is supplemented with a global strength of evidence assessment. The framework is applied to a case study of oil spill from tanker collisions, aimed at response capacity planning and ecological risk assessment. The BN-model is a proactive and transferable tool for assessing the occurrence of various spill sizes in a sea area. While the case study uses evidence specific to the Gulf of Finland, the model and risk analysis approach can be applied to other areas. Based on evaluation criteria and tests for the risk model and risk analysis, it is found that the model is a plausible representation of tanker collision oil spill risk. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Populations can be genetically isolated both by geographic distance and by differences in their ecology or environment that decrease the rate of successful migration. Empirical studies often seek to investigate the relationship between genetic differentiation and some ecological variable(s) while accounting for geographic distance, but common approaches to this problem (such as the partial Mantel test) have a number of drawbacks. In this article, we present a Bayesian method that enables users to quantify the relative contributions of geographic distance and ecological distance to genetic differentiation between sampled populations or individuals. We model the allele frequencies in a set of populations at a set of unlinked loci as spatially correlated Gaussian processes, in which the covariance structure is a decreasing function of both geographic and ecological distance. Parameters of the model are estimated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We call this method Bayesian Estimation of Differentiation in Alleles by Spatial Structure and Local Ecology (BEDASSLE), and have implemented it in a user-friendly format in the statistical platform R. We demonstrate its utility with a simulation study and empirical applications to human and teosinte data sets.

AB The article introduces a conceptual approach for how to enhance the assessment of ecosystem services with regard to landscape structural aspects. Therefore, we have implemented landscape metrics in the cellular automaton based software "Pimp Your Landscape". Using the example of the service "ecological functioning", we tested the potential of our approach to improve the understanding of how landscape structure contributes to the provision of ecosystem services. As a test case, we simulated different afforestation scenarios in a model region in North-Eastern Germany.
   A major finding for landscape planning was that, without the inclusion of landscape metrics, the actual potential of our poorly structured model region with a large proportion of agricultural areas would be overestimated. In contrast, the benefits gained from afforestation strategies, which aim at improving aspects such as biotope connectivity at the landscape level, would become less obvious.
   We conclude that our approach can contribute to a more realistic appraisal of the potential for landscapes to provide ecosystem services beyond the contribution of single ecosystem services or in our case land cover classes. We therefore plan to expand our approach to other ecosystem services as well, where landscape structural aspects, such as cultural services (for aesthetic value), are essential.

AB Marine aliens are non-native species that have been transported across major geographical barriers by human activities, involving vectors that move propagules along pathways. Species may also be newly observed in a geographical area due to range shifts, generally in association with climate change. Artificial structures are considered to be either man-made materials or natural materials shaped or displaced to serve a specific function for human activities. All types of artificial structures are currently increasing dramatically in coastal zones due to increasing human populations on coastlines. Most of the significant marine vectors and pathways involve mobile artificial structures and are reviewed here. These include shipping (ballast water and hull fouling) and aquaculture, including stock transfer and unintentional introductions, all of which can move species into new biogeographical provinces. Some types of structures frequently move long distances but have low fouling loads (e.g., commercial shipping), whereas others (e.g., barges and pontoons) can be hyperfouled due to long stationary periods such that when moved they transport mature fouling communities. We also examine the presence of alien marine species on static (immobile) artificial structures, which support different communities from those on natural hard substrata. We consider the role of these structures, such as coastal defences, artificial reefs, and offshore platforms, in the dispersal and abundance of alien species. Marinas include both mobile and immobile structures and are apparently particularly favourable habitats for many aliens. For example, in coastal North America approximately 90% of the alien species inhabiting hard substrata have been reported from docks and marinas. Detailed case studies of alien marine species (two seaweeds and four invertebrates) are provided, with an analysis of their origin, vectors of transport, habitat in the introduced range, and potential impact. Although there are exceptions, a large majority of marine alien species seem to be associated, at least for some of the time, with artificial structures. It is clear that artificial structures can pave the way and act as stepping stones or even corridors for some marine aliens, as do urban areas, roads and riparian environments in terrestrial ecosystems. The observed acceleration of spread rates for marine invasions over the course of the last two centuries may partly be a result of the increase of artificial structures in coastal environments coupled with greater activity of vectors.

AB Given the diversity of prey consumed by insectivorous bats, it is difficult to discern the composition of their diet using morphological or conventional PCR-based analyses of their faeces. We demonstrate the use of a powerful alternate tool, the use of the Roche FLX sequencing platform to deep-sequence uniquely 59 tagged insect-generic barcode cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) fragments, that were PCR amplified from faecal pellets of two free-tailed bat species Chaerephon pumilus and Mops condylurus (family: Molossidae). Although the analyses were challenged by the paucity of southern African insect COI sequences in the GenBank and BOLD databases, similarity to existing collections allowed the preliminary identification of 25 prey families from six orders of insects within the diet of C. pumilus, and 24 families from seven orders within the diet of M. condylurus. Insects identified to families within the orders Lepidoptera and Diptera were widely present among the faecal samples analysed. The two families that were observed most frequently were Noctuidae and Nymphalidae (Lepidoptera). Species-level analysis of the data was accomplished using novel bioinformatics techniques for the identification of molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTU). Based on these analyses, our data provide little evidence of resource partitioning between sympatric M. condylurus and C. pumilus in the Simunye region of Swaziland at the time of year when the samples were collected, although as more complete databases against which to compare the sequences are generated this may have to be re-evaluated.

AB The crucial role of biodiversity in the links between ecosystems and societies has been repeatedly highlighted both as source of wellbeing and as a target of human actions, but not all aspects of biodiversity are equally important to different ecosystem services. Similarly, different social actors have different perceptions of and access to ecosystem services, and therefore, they have different wants and capacities to select directly or indirectly for particular biodiversity and ecosystem characteristics. Their choices feed back onto the ecosystem services provided to all parties involved and in turn, affect future decisions. Despite this recognition, the research communities addressing biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human outcomes have yet to develop frameworks that adequately treat the multiple dimensions and interactions in the relationship. Here, we present an interdisciplinary framework for the analysis of relationships between functional diversity, ecosystem services, and human actions that is applicable to specific social environmental systems at local scales. We connect the mechanistic understanding of the ecological role of diversity with its social relevance: ecosystem services. The framework permits connections between functional diversity components and priorities of social actors using land use decisions and ecosystem services as the main links between these ecological and social components. We propose a matrix-based method that provides a transparent and flexible platform for quantifying and integrating social and ecological information and negotiating potentially conflicting land uses among multiple social actors. We illustrate the applicability of our framework by way of land use examples from temperate to subtropical South America, an area of rapid social and ecological change.

AB What maintains plant species diversity has been the subject of much debate with no general consensus. In forest ecosystems in which understory plants account for the majority of floristic diversity, a crucial question is whether understory plant diversity is driven by resource quantity or resource heterogeneity. This study sought to reconcile the two hypotheses in relation to their effects on understory plant diversity in forest ecosystems. A database of studies that investigated the effects of resources on understory plant diversity was compiled and analyzed using log-linear models. Whether resource quantity or resource heterogeneity is the determinant of understory plant diversity in individual studies was dependent on stand successional stage(s), presence or absence of intermediate disturbance, and forest biome within which the studies were conducted. Resource quantity was found to govern species diversity in both young and mature stands, whereas resource heterogeneity dominated in old-growth stands. Resource quantity remained the important driver in both disturbed and undisturbed forests, but resource heterogeneity played an important role in disturbed forests. We argue that neither resource quantity nor heterogeneity alone structures species diversity in forest ecosystems, but rather their influences on understory plant diversity vary with stand development and disturbances in forest ecosystems.

AB The maintenance of critical natural capital is an important objective of sustainable development. Critical natural capital represents a multidimensional concept, as it mirrors the different frameworks of various scientific disciplines and social groups in valuing nature. This article revisits the concept of critical natural capital and examines its relation to the concept of ecological resilience. I propose that ecological resilience can help a great deal in specifying the 'ecological criticality' of specific renewable parts of the natural capital. More specifically, I suggest that the degree of ecological resilience is inversely related to the degree of threat ecosystems are prone to. The concept of ecological resilience may complement other measures, such as integrity or vulnerability, in estimating the degree of threat specific ecosystems are exposed to. The empirical estimates of ecological resilience add a further criterion in order to build a comprehensive and clear conception of critical natural capital. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

   Summary
   Crop grasses were among the first plants to be domesticated c. 12 000 yr ago, and they still represent the main staple crops for humans. During domestication, as did many other crops, grasses went through dramatic genetic and phenotypic changes. The recent massive increase in genomic data has provided new tools to investigate the genetic basis and consequences of domestication. Beyond the genetics of domestication, many aspects of grass biology, including their phylogeny and developmental biology, are also increasingly well studied, offering a unique opportunity to analyse the domestication process in a comparative way. Taking such a comparative point of view, we review the history of domesticated grasses and how domestication affected their phenotypic and genomic diversity. Considering recent theoretical developments and the accumulation of genetic data, we revisit more specifically the role of mating systems in the domestication process. We close by suggesting future directions for the study of domestication in grasses.

AB Conservationists are increasingly relying on distribution models to predict where species are likely to occur, especially in poorly-surveyed but biodiverse areas. Modeling is challenging in these cases because locality data necessary for model formation are often scarce and spatially imprecise. To identify methods best suited to modeling in these conditions, we compared the success of three algorithms (Maxent, Mahalanobis Typicalities and Random Forests) at predicting distributions of eight bird and eight mammal species endemic to the eastern slopes of the central Andes. We selected study species to have a range of locality sample sizes representative of the data available for endemic species of this region and also that vary in their distribution characteristics. We found that for species that are known from moderate numbers (N = 38-94) of localities, the three methods performed similarly for species with restricted distributions but Maxent and Random Forests yielded better results for species with wider distributions. For species with small numbers of sample localities (N = 5-21), Maxent produced the most consistently successful results, followed by Random Forests and then Mahalanobis Typicalities. Because evaluation statistics for models derived from few localities can be suspect due to the poor spatial representation of the evaluation data, we corroborated these results with review by scientists familiar with the species in the field. Overall, Maxent appears to be the most capable method for modeling distributions of Andean bird and mammal species because of the consistency of results in varying conditions, although the other methods have strengths in certain situations.

AB The model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana is successful at colonizing land that has recently undergone human-mediated disturbance. To investigate the prehistoric spread of A. thaliana, we applied approximate Bayesian computation and explicit spatial modeling to 76 European accessions sequenced at 876 nuclear loci. We find evidence that a major migration wave occurred from east to west, affecting most of the sampled individuals. The longitudinal gradient appears to result from the plant having spread in Europe from the east similar to 10,000 years ago, with a rate of westward spread of similar to 0.9 km/year. This wave-of-advance model is consistent with a natural colonization from an eastern glacial refugium that overwhelmed ancient western lineages. However, the speed and time frame of the model also suggest that the migration of A. thaliana into Europe may have accompanied the spread of agriculture during the Neolithic transition.

DT Article
DE ecology; future; paradigm; rehabilitation; restoration; sustainability
ID SOCIAL VALUES; CHALLENGE
AB The discipline of restoration ecology has grown remarkably in the past decades, providing new ideas and opportunities for conserving biological diversity, managing ecosystems, and testing ecological theories. On the other side, its past-oriented, static, and idealistic approach has been criticized for subjectivity in determining restoration goals, inapplicability to dynamic ecosystems, and inability for restoring certain irreversible losses. Moreover, unpredictable sustainability of the restored ecosystems, which were modeled after its historical fidelity, adds our skepticism under the changing environment. This paper calls for a new paradigm of ecological restoration to the future. A future-oriented restoration should (1) establish the ecosystems that are able to sustain in the future, not the past, environment; (2) have multiple alternative goals and trajectories for unpredictable endpoints; (3) focus on rehabilitation of ecosystem functions rather than recomposition of species or cosmetics of landscape surface; and (4) acknowledge its identity as a "value-laden" applied science within economically and socially acceptable framework. Applicability of ecological theories to restoration practice is also discussed in this paper.

   POPULATION; CRICKET; MATES; SIZE
AB Females often mate with several males before producing offspring(1). Field studies of vertebrates suggest, and laboratory experiments on invertebrates confirm, that even when males provide no material benefits, polyandry can enhance offspring survival(2,3). This enhancement is widely attributed to genetic benefits that arise whenever paternity is biased towards males that sire more viable offspring(1,4,5). Field studies suggest that post-mating sexual selection biases fertilization towards genetically more compatible males(6,7) and one controlled experiment has shown that, when females mate with close kin, polyandry reduces the relative number of inbred offspring(8). Another potential genetic benefit of polyandry is that it increases offspring survival because males with more competitive ejaculates sire more viable offspring(9). Surprisingly, however, there is no unequivocal evidence for this process(10). Here, by experimentally assigning mates to females, we show that polyandry greatly increases offspring survival in the Australian marsupial Antechinus stuartii. DNA profiling shows that males that gain high paternity under sperm competition sire offspring that are more viable. This beneficial effect occurs in both the laboratory and the wild. Crucially, there are no confounding non-genetic maternal effects that could arise if polyandry increases female investment in a particular reproductive event(10) because A. stuartii is effectively semelparous. Our results therefore show that polyandry improves female lifetime fitness in nature. The threefold increase in offspring survival is not negated by a decline in maternal lifespan and is too large to be offset by an equivalent decline in the reproductive performance of surviving offspring.

Therefore, quantitative analyses of individual traits from organisms in different populations or environments (e.g., in studies of phenotypic plasticity) often adjust for differences in body size to isolate changes in allometry. Most studies of among population variation in morphology either (1) use analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with a univariate measure of body size as the covariate, or (2) compare residuals from ordinary least squares regression of each trait against body size or the first principal component of the pooled data (shearing). However, both approaches are problematic. ANCOVA depends on assumptions (small variance in the covariate) that are frequently violated in this context. Residuals analysis assumes that scaling relationships within groups are equal, but this assumption is rarely tested. Furthermore, scaling relationships obtained from pooled data typically mischaracterize within-group scaling relationships. We discuss potential biases imposed by the application of ANCOVA and residuals analysis for quantifying morphological differences, and elaborate and demonstrate a more effective alternative: common principal components analysis combined with Burnaby's back-projection method.

AB Urban areas are generally inhabited by greater numbers of plant species than rural areas of the same size. Though this phenomenon is well documented, scientists seem to be drawn to opposing views when it comes to explaining the high ratio of alien to native plants. Several ecological concepts claim that in cities. alien species displace native species. However, several studies show that both species groups increase proportionally. Another view tries to Correlate the high species number in urban areas to the heterogeneity of the urban landscape. This correlation seems to be evident but still needs to be tested.
   Most of these findings stem from studies performed on large or intermediate scales using data from official databases. We wanted to confront existing findings and opinions with our study comparing a typical urban with an agricultural landscape section on a local scale.
   Our results support the view that plant species richness is higher in cities than in surrounding rural areas, partly because of a high rate of alien species brought into cities by humans. However, this species richness stems from an increase in alien as well as native species. Higher species richness is supported by a highly varying landscape structure mainly caused by anthropogenic land use.(c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article provides a review of evolutionary theory and empirical research on mate choices in nonhuman species and uses it as a frame for understanding the how and why of human mate choices. The basic principle is that the preferred mate choices and attendant social cognitions and behaviors of both women and men, and those of other species, have evolved to focus on and exploit the reproductive potential and reproductive investment of members of the opposite sex. Reproductive potential is defined as the genetic, material, and/or social resources an individual can invest in offspring, and reproductive investment is the actual use of these resources to enhance the physical and social well-being of offspring. Similarities and differences in the mate preferences and choices of women and men are reviewed and can be understood in terms of similarities and differences in the form of reproductive potential that women and men have to offer and their tendency to use this potential for the well-being of children.

AB Ecomorphological and biogeochemical (trace element, and carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotope ratios) analyses have been used for determining the dietary niches and habitat preferences of large mammals from lower Pleistocene deposits at Venta Micena (Guadix-Baza Basin, Spain). The combination of these two approaches takes advantage of the strengths and overcome the weakness of both approaches. The range of delta(13)C(collagen) values for ungulate species indicates that C-3 plants were dominant in the diet of these mammals. delta(13)C(collagen) values vary among ungulates: perissodactyls have the lowest values and bovids the highest ones, with cervids showing intermediate values. The hypsodonty index measured in lower molar teeth and the relative length of the lower premolar tooth row indicate that the horse, Equus altidens, was a grazing species, whereas the rhino, Stephanorhinus etruscus, was a mixed feeder in open habitats. The similar delta(13)C(collagen) values shown in both perissodactyls does not reflect differences in feeding behavior with other ungulates, but rather a lower isotope enrichment factor in these monogastric herbivores than in ruminants, owing to their lower metabolic efficiency. The cervids Eucladoceros giulii and Dama sp. show low hypsodonty values, indicating that they were mixed feeders or browsers from forested habitats, an ecomorphologically based conclusion corroborated in the former by its low delta(15)N(collagen) content (canopy effect). Bovid species (Bovini aff. Leptobos, Soergelia minor, and Hemitragus albus) presumably inhabited open environments, according to their comparatively high hypsodonty and delta(15)N(collagen) values. Carnivore species (Homotherium latidens, Megantereon whitei, Pachycrocuta brevirostris, Canis falconeri, and Canis etruscus) exhibit higher delta(15)N(collagen) values than ungulates. These results record the isotopic enrichment expected with an increase in trophic level and are also supported by low bone Sr:Zn ratios. The elevated delta(15)N(collagen) value for a sample of Mammuthus meridionalis, which came from an individual with unfused epiphyses, confirms that it was a suckling animal. The delta(15)N(collagen) value of the scimitar-cat H. latidens is well above that obtained for the young individual of Mammuthus, which indicates that juvenile elephants were an important part of its diet. The hippo, Hippopotamus antiquus, yielded unexpectedly high delta(15)N(collagen) values, which suggest feeding on aquatic, non-N-2-fixing plants. The high delta(18)O(hydroxyl) values of bovids Hemitragus and Soergelia and of cervid Dama indicate that these ungulates obtained most of their water requirements from the vegetation. The megaherbivores and Eucladoceros exhibit the lowest delta(18)O(hydroxyl) values, which suggest increased water dependence for them. Paleosynecological analysis was based on the relative abundance of species of large mammals from different ecological categories, determined by feeding behavior and locomotion types. The comparison of the frequencies of such categories in Venta Micena with those found in modern African communities indicates that the composition of the paleocommunity closely resembles those of savannas with tall grass and shrubs. The net above-ground primary productivity estimated for the on-crop biomass of the mammalian species preserved in the fossil assemblage also yields a figure congr

ID DEFORESTATION
AB The transformation and degradation of tropical forest is thought to be the primary driving force in the loss of biodiversity worldwide. Developing countries are trying to counter act this massive lost of biodiversity by implementing national parks and biological reserves. Costa Rica is no exception to this rule. National development strategies in Costa Rica, since the early 1970s, have involved the creation of several National Parks and Biological Reserves. This has led to monitoring the integrity of and interactions between these protected areas. Key questions include: "Are these areas' boundaries respected?"; "Do they create a functioning network?"; and "Are they effective conservation tools?". This paper quantifies deforestation and secondary growth trends within and around protected areas between 1960 and 1997. We find that inside of national parks and biological reserves, deforestation rates were negligible. For areas outside of National Parks and Biological reserves we report that for 1-km buffer zones around such protected areas. there is a net forest gain for the 1987/1997 time period. Thus, it appears that to this point the boundaries of protected areas are respected. However. in the 10-km buffer zones we find significant forest loss for all study periods, This suggests that increasing isolation of protected areas may prevent them from functioning as an effective network.

AB 1. Benthic-algal distributions in the upper Illinois River basin, IL, U.S.A., were examined in relation to geology, land use, water chemistry and stream habitat using (detrended) (canonical) correspondence analysis, autecological metrics and indicator-species analysis in order to identify the major environmental gradients influencing community variation.
   2. Ionic composition and major nutrient [i.e. nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)] concentration of surface waters, salinity (Na-Cl type), substratum type and physiognomic form of dominant species were primary factors contributing to variation in benthic-algal assemblages of the basin. Basin geology was a significant contributing factor, but the explained variance associated with this factor was less than that related to land use.
   3. Proportions of algal biomass consisting of cyanophytes, filamentous chlorophytes, halophilic diatoms and diatoms which utilize nitrogen heterotrophically were greater in eutrophic river segments than in less nutrient-enriched segments. Composition of the benthic flora indicated meso-eutrophic or eutrophic conditions throughout the basin; there were few diatoms indicative of hypertrophic waters. Shifts in diatom-assemblage structure in response to nutrient loading provided an incomplete representation of the community-response curve.
   4. A weighted-averages regression model based on total P and benthic-algal abundances tall divisions included) yielded a highly significant correlation (r(2) = 0.83) between species-inferred [WA((tol))] and observed total P, with systematic bias (increased deviation of residuals) occurring only at concentrations greater than similar to 1.0 mg L-1 total P. This result indicates that total P regression and calibration models can be predictable for a river basin receiving excessive loadings of phosphorus.

AB Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) is an increasingly popular method for multivariate analysis of ecological community data. It is, however, one of the most potentially misleading multivariate methods for community analysis. Inclusion of noisy or irrelevant environmental variables can distort the representation of gradients in community structure. These hazards are illustrated with simulated community data sets having a known, simple, underlying structure, then introducing different kinds and degrees of noise into the environmental data. Because of its sensitivity to even a modest amount of noise in the environmental data, CCA with site scores as linear combinations of environmental variables is inappropriate when the objective is to describe community structure. These problems can be avoided by using traditional indirect ordination methods, where pure community structure is expressed, without any constraint imposed by the environmental variables. CCA can be appropriate, however, when the objective is to describe how species respond to particular sets of observed environmental variables.

AB Hypothesis testing in phytocoenological applications is likely to be hindered when based on conventional statistical methods. The problem created by unrealistic assumptions can, however, be overcome by randomization. This paper discusses the general idea of randomization testing, describes a method and interprets its application in group comparisons. Two sets of variables are involved, the vegetation set on the basis of which the groups are compared and the environmental factors which delimit the groups under different analytical designs. Although simple partitioning of sum of squares is at the core of the test, the method has versatility of testing uni- or multifactor designs, which is novel in phytocoenological applications. The algorithm has been implemented in programs SYNCSA and MULTIV by V.P. Data from the Campos of southern Brazil are used for illustration.

AB Over the years, many studies have demonstrated a relation between emotion dynamics and psychological well-being(1). Because our emotional life is inherently time-dynamic(2-6), affective scientists argue that, next to how positive or negative we feel on average, patterns of emotional change are informative for mental health(7-10). This growing interest initiated a surge in new affect dynamic measures, each claiming to capture a unique dynamical aspect of our emotional life, crucial for understanding well-being. Although this accumulation suggests scientific progress, researchers have not always evaluated (a) how different affect dynamic measures empirically interrelate and (b) what their added value is in the prediction of psychological well-being. Here, we address these questions by analysing affective time series data from 15 studies (n = 1,777). We show that (a) considerable interdependencies between measures exist, suggesting that single dynamics often do not convey unique information, and (b) dynamic measures have little added value over mean levels of positive and negative affect (and variance in these affective states) when predicting individual differences in three indicators of well-being (life satisfaction, depressive symptoms and borderline symptoms). Our findings indicate that conventional emotion research is currently unable to demonstrate independent relations between affect dynamics and psychological well-being.

AB Molecular neurobiological insight into human nervous tissues is needed to generate next-generation therapeutics for neurological disorders such as chronic pain. We obtained human dorsal root ganglia (hDRG) samples from organ donors and performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to study the hDRG transcriptional landscape, systematically comparing it with publicly available data from a variety of human and orthologous mouse tissues, including mouse DRG (mDRG). We characterized the hDRG transcriptional profile in terms of tissue-restricted gene coexpression patterns and putative transcriptional regulators, and formulated an information-theoretic framework to quantify DRG enrichment. Relevant gene families and pathways were also analyzed, including transcription factors, G-protein-coupled receptors, and ion channels. Our analyses reveal an hDRG-enriched protein-coding gene set (similar to 140), some of which have not been described in the context of DRG or pain signaling. Most of these show conserved enrichment in mDRG and were mined for known drug-gene product interactions. Conserved enrichment of the vast majority of transcription factors suggests that the mDRG is a faithful model system for studying hDRG, because of evolutionarily conserved regulatory programs. Comparison of hDRG and tibial nerve transcriptomes suggests trafficking of neuronal mRNA to axons in adult hDRG, and are consistent with studies of axonal transport in rodent sensory neurons. We present our work as an online, searchable repository (https://www.utdallas.edu/bbs/painneurosciencelab/sensoryomics/drgtxome), creating a valuable resource for the community. Our analyses provide insight into DRG biology for guiding development of novel therapeutics and a blueprint for cross-species transcriptomic analyses.

AB Recent shifts in the geographic distribution of marine species have been linked to shifts in preferred thermal habitats. These shifts in distribution have already posed challenges for living marine resource management, and there is a strong need for projections of how species might be impacted by future changes in ocean temperatures during the 21st century. We modeled thermal habitat for 686 marine species in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans using long-term ecological survey data from the North American continental shelves. These habitat models were coupled to output from sixteen general circulation models that were run under high (RCP 8.5) and low (RCP 2.6) future greenhouse gas emission scenarios over the 21 st century to produce 32 possible future outcomes for each species. The models generally agreed on the magnitude and direction of future shifts for some species (448 or 429 under RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6, respectively), but strongly disagreed for other species (116 or 120 respectively). This allowed us to identify species with more or less robust predictions. Future shifts in species distributions were generally poleward and followed the coastline, but also varied among regions and species. Species from the U.S. and Canadian west coast including the Gulf of Alaska had the highest projected magnitude shifts in distribution, and many species shifted more than 1000 km under the high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. Following a strong mitigation scenario consistent with the Paris Agreement would likely produce substantially smaller shifts and less disruption to marine management efforts. Our projections offer an important tool for identifying species, fisheries, and management efforts that are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts.

AB Extinction risk in vertebrates has been linked to large body size, but this putative relationship has only been explored for select taxa, with variable results. Using a newly assembled and taxonomically expansive database, we analyzed the relationships between extinction risk and body mass (27,647 species) and between extinction risk and range size (21,294 species) for vertebrates across six main classes. We found that the probability of being threatened was positively and significantly related to body mass for birds, cartilaginous fishes, and mammals. Bimodal relationships were evident for amphibians, reptiles, and bony fishes. Most importantly, a bimodal relationship was found across all vertebrates such that extinction risk changes around a body mass breakpoint of 0.035 kg, indicating that the lightest and heaviest vertebrates have elevated extinction risk. We also found range size to be an important predictor of the probability of being threatened, with strong negative relationships across nearly all taxa. A review of the drivers of extinction risk revealed that the heaviest vertebrates are most threatened by direct killing by humans. By contrast, the lightest vertebrates are most threatened by habitat loss and modification stemming especially from pollution, agricultural cropping, and logging. Our results offer insight into halting the ongoing wave of vertebrate extinctions by revealing the vulnerability of large and small taxa, and identifying size-specific threats. Moreover, they indicate that, without intervention, anthropogenic activities will soon precipitate a double truncation of the size distribution of the world's vertebrates, fundamentally reordering the structure of life on our planet.

AB Neonicotinoid insecticides are widespread in surface waters across the agriculturally intensive Midwestern United States. We report for the first time the presence of three neonicotinoids in finished drinking water and demonstrate their general persistence during conventional water treatment. Periodic tap water grab samples were collected at the University of Iowa over 7 weeks in 2016 (May July) after maize/soy planting. Clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam were ubiquitously detected in finished water samples at concentrations ranging from 0.24 to 57.3 ng/L. Samples collected along the University of Iowa treatment train indicate no apparent removal of clothianidin or imidacloprid, with modest thiamethoxam removal (similar to 50%). In contrast, the concentrations of all neonicotinoids were substantially lower in the Iowa City treatment facility finished water using granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration. Batch experiments investigated potential losses. Thiamethoxam losses are due to base-catalyzed hydrolysis under high-pH conditions during lime softening. GAC rapidly and nearly completely removed all three neonicotinoids. Clothianidin is susceptible to reaction with free chlorine and may undergo at least partial transformation during chlorination. Our work provides new insights into the persistence of neonicotinoids and their potential for transformation during water treatment and distribution, while also identifying GAC as a potentially effective management tool for decreasing neonicotinoid concentrations in finished drinking water.

   THEORY
AB Ecosystems exhibit surprising regularities in structure and function across terrestrial and aquatic biomes worldwide. We assembled a global data set for 2260 communities of large mammals, invertebrates, plants, and plankton. We find that predator and prey biomass follow a general scaling law with exponents consistently near 3/4. This pervasive pattern implies that the structure of the biomass pyramid becomes increasingly bottom-heavy at higher biomass. Similar exponents are obtained for community production-biomass relations, suggesting conserved links between ecosystem structure and function. These exponents are similar to many body mass allometries, and yet ecosystem scaling emerges independently from individual-level scaling, which is not fully understood. These patterns suggest a greater degree of ecosystem-level organization than previously recognized and a more predictive approach to ecological theory.

AB Inbreeding (mating between relatives) can dramatically reduce the fitness of offspring by causing parts of the genome to be identical by descent. Thus, measuring individual inbreeding is crucial for ecology, evolution and conservation biology. We used computer simulations to test whether the realized proportion of the genome that is identical by descent (IBDG) is predicted better by the pedigree inbreeding coefficient (F-P) or by genomic (marker-based) measures of inbreeding. Genomic estimators of IBDG included the increase in individual homozygosity relative to mean Hardy-Weinberg expected homozygosity (F-H), and two measures (F-ROH and F-E) that use mapped genetic markers to estimate IBDG. IBDG was more strongly correlated with F-H, F-E and F-ROH than with F-P across a broad range of simulated scenarios when thousands of SNPs were used. For example, IBDG was more strongly correlated with F-ROH, F-H and F-E (estimated with >= 10 000 SNPs) than with F-P (estimated with 20 generations of complete pedigree) in populations with a recent reduction in the effective populations size (from N-e=500 to N-e=75). F-ROH, F-H and F-E generally explained 490% of the variance in IBDG (among individuals) when 35 K or more SNPs were used. F-P explained <80% of the variation in IBDG on average in all simulated scenarios, even when pedigrees included 20 generations. Our results demonstrate that IBDG can be more precisely estimated with large numbers of genetic markers than with pedigrees. We encourage researchers to adopt genomic marker-based measures of IBDG as thousands of loci can now be genotyped in any species.

AB Neonicotinoid insecticides have come under scrutiny for their potential unintended effects on non-target organisms, particularly pollinators in agro-ecosystems. As part of a larger study of neonicotinoid residues associated with maize (corn) production, 76 water samples within or around the perimeter of 18 commercial maize fields and neighbouring apiaries were collected in 5 maize-producing counties of southwestern Ontario. Residues of clothianidin (mean = 2.28, max. = 43.60 ng/mL) and thiamethoxam (mean = 1.12, max. = 16.50 ng/mL) were detected in 100 and 98.7% of the water samples tested, respectively. The concentration of total neonicotinoid residues in water within maize fields increased sixfold during the first five weeks after planting, and returned to pre-plant levels seven weeks after planting. However, concentrations in water sampled from outside the fields were similar throughout the sampling period. Soil samples from the top 5 cm of the soil profile were also collected in these fields before and immediately following planting. The mean total neonicotinoid residue was 4.02 (range 0.07 to 20.30) ng/g, for samples taken before planting, and 9.94 (range 0.53 to 38.98) ng/g, for those taken immediately after planting. Two soil samples collected from within an conservation area contained detectable (0.03 and 0.11 ng/g) concentrations of clothianidin. Of three drifted snow samples taken, the drift stratum containing the most wind-scoured soil had 0.16 and 0.20 ng/mL mainly clothianidin in the melted snow. The concentration was at the limit of detection (0.02 ng/mL) taken across the entire vertical profile. With the exception of one sample, water samples tested had concentrations below those reported to have acute, chronic or sublethal effects to honey bees. Our results suggest that neonicotinoids may move off-target by wind erosion of contaminated soil. These results are informative to risk assessment models for other non-target species in maize agro-ecosytems.

AB Social selection influences the evolution of weapons, ornaments and behaviour in both males and females. Thus, social interactions in both sexual and non-sexual contexts can have a powerful influence on the evolution of traits that would otherwise appear to be detrimental to survival. Although clearly outlined by West-Eberhard in the early 1980s, the idea that social selection is a comprehensive framework for the study of ornaments and weapons has largely been ignored. In West-Eberhard's view, sexual selection is a form of social selection-a concept supported by several lines of evidence. Darwin's distinction between natural and sexual selection has been useful, but recent confusion about the limits of sexual selection suggests that some traits are not easily categorized as naturally or sexually selected. Because social selection theory has much to offer the current debates about both sexual selection and reproductive competition in females, it is sometimes viewed, narrowly, to be most useful when considering female roles. However, social selection theory encompasses much more than female reproductive competition. Our goal here was to provide that broader perspective.

AB There is a long tradition in population genetics of exploring the maintenance of variation under migration-selection balance using deterministic models that assume infinite population size. With finite population size, stochastic dynamics can greatly reduce the potential for the maintenance of polymorphism, but this has yet to be explored in detail. Here, classical two-patch models are extended to predict: (1) the probability of a locally beneficial mutation rising in frequency in the patch where it is favored and (2) the critical threshold migration rate above which the maintenance of polymorphism is much less likely. Individual-based simulations show that these approximations provide accurate predictions across a wide range of parameter space.

AB We synthesise traditional unstructured food webs, allometric body size scaling, trait-based modelling, and physiologically structured modelling to provide a novel and ecologically relevant tool for size-structured food webs. The framework allows food web models to include ontogenetic growth and life-history omnivory at the individual level by resolving the population structure of each species as a size-spectrum. Each species is characterised by the trait 'size at maturation', and all model parameters are made species independent through scaling with individual body size and size at maturation. Parameter values are determined from cross-species analysis of fish communities as life-history omnivory is widespread in aquatic systems, but may be reparameterised for other systems. An ensemble of food webs is generated and the resulting communities are analysed at four levels of organisation: community level, species level, trait level, and individual level. The model may be solved analytically by assuming that the community spectrum follows a power law. The analytical solution provides a baseline expectation of the results of complex food web simulations, and agrees well with the predictions of the full model on biomass distribution as a function of individual size, biomass distribution as a function of size at maturation, and relation between predator-prey mass ratio of preferred and eaten food. The full model additionally predicts the diversity distribution as a function of size at maturation. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A traditional approach for assessing similarity among N (N > 2) communities is to use multiple pairwise comparisons. However, pairwise similarity indices do not completely characterize multiple-community similarity because the information shared by at least three communities is ignored. We propose a new and intuitive two-stage probabilistic approach, which leads to a general framework to simultaneously compare multiple communities based on abundance data. The approach is specifically used to extend the commonly used Morisita index and NESS (normalized expected species shared) index to the case of N communities. For comparing N communities, a profile of N - 1 indices is proposed to characterize similarity of species composition across communities. Based on sample abundance data, nearly unbiased estimators of the proposed indices and their variances are obtained. These generalized NESS and Morisita indices are applied to comparison of three size classes of plant data (seedling, saplings, and trees) within old-growth and secondary rain forest plots in Costa Rica.

AB Background. Determination of seabird diet usually relies on the analysis of stomach-content remains obtained through stomach flushing; this technique is both invasive and logistically difficult. We evaluate the usefulness of DNA-based faecal analysis in a dietary study on chick-rearing macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) at Heard Island. Conventional stomach-content data was also collected, allowing comparison of the approaches. Methodology/Principal Findings. Prey-specific PCR tests were used to detect dietary DNA in faecal samples and amplified prey DNA was cloned and sequenced. Of the 88 faecal samples collected, 39 contained detectable DNA from one or more of the prey groups targeted with PCR tests. Euphausiid DNA was most commonly detected in the early (guard) stage of chick-rearing, and detection of DNA from the myctophid fish Krefftichthys anderssoni and amphipods became more common in samples collected in the later (creche) stage. These trends followed those observed in the penguins' stomach contents. In euphausiid-specific clone libraries the proportion of sequences from the two dominant euphausiid prey species (Euphausia vallentini and Thysanoessa macrura) changed over the sampling period; again, this reflected the trend in the stomach content data. Analysis of prey sequences in universal clone libraries revealed a higher diversity of fish prey than identified in the stomachs, but non-fish prey were not well represented. Conclusions/Significance. The present study is one of the first to examine the full breadth of a predator's diet using DNA-based faecal analysis. We discuss methodological difficulties encountered and suggest possible refinements. Overall, the ability of the DNA-based approach to detect temporal variation in the diet of macaroni penguins indicates this non-invasive method will be generally useful for monitoring population-level dietary trends in seabirds.

Today, population genomics offers the opportunity to evaluate both neutral and adaptive components of genetic diversity directly at the genome level with molecular tools. By screening the genome with many genetic markers, it is possible to detect loci supposedly under natural selection and thus of adaptive significance. We devised a new diversity index, the population adaptive index (PAI), which accounts for the adaptive value of the population it refers to. To estimate this index, we performed a genome scan with amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to identify neutral and selected loci in several populations of a widespread amphibian (common frog, Rana temporaria) and a threatened plant (Austrian dragonhead, Dracocephalum austriacum L.). We then investigated four different conservation strategies aimed at protecting the maximum amount of genetic diversity (neutral or selected). In particular we explored the relevance of the principle of complementarity, usually applied to the protection of species, in the management of intraspecific diversity. This principle advocates the conservation of sets of units that together maximize the species' orgenetic diversity, which is in opposition to the traditional approach of targeting populations that are the most diverse individually. Four major conclusions emerged from these results. First, the PAI seemed to be a valuable index to evaluate the adaptive diversities within populations. Second, in the two species, the neutral and adaptive diversities within and among populations were not correlated, so conservation strategies based on the neutral and adaptive indexes would not select the same populations for protection. Third, because of its efficiency in conserving genetic diversity, the principle of complementarity deserves to be used more often for this purpose. Fourth, when neutral and adaptive results conflict, additional arguments (e.g., demography, ecology, and geographic proximity) should be considered together with levels of genetic diversity to determine a conservation strategy.

AB For many bird embryos, periodic cooling occurs when the incubating adult leaves the nest to forage, but the effects of periodic cooling on embryo growth, yolk use, and metabolism are poorly known. To address this question, we conducted incubation experiments on eggs of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) that were frequently cooled and then rewarmed or were allowed to develop at a constant temperature. After 12 d of incubation, embryo mass and yolk reserves were less in eggs that experienced periodic cooling than in controls incubated constantly at 37.5 degrees C. Embryos that regularly cooled to 20 degrees C had higher mass-specific metabolic rates than embryos incubated constantly at 37.5 degrees C. Periodic cooling delayed development and increased metabolic costs, reducing the efficiency with which egg nutrients were converted into embryo tissue. Avian embryos can tolerate periodic cooling, possibly by adjusting their physiology to variable thermal conditions, but at a cost to growth efficiency as well as rate of development. This reduction in embryo growth efficiency adds a new dimension to the fitness consequences of variation in adult nest attentiveness.

AB Growth patterns and ages of tropical forest trees are strongly governed by temporal variation in light availability. Periods of high growth after canopy disturbances (releases) are necessary for successful canopy regeneration, but their importance cannot be studied without lifetime data. The recent detection of annual rings in tropical forest trees enables such analyses.
   We used tree ring analysis to study lifetime growth patterns and age variation in six Bolivian rain forest species. Our aims were to evaluate the magnitude and sources of age variation of canopy trees, to analyse the frequency of suppression and release events, and to analyse the relation between temporal growth changes and tree age.
   The average age of trees of 60 cm diameter differed threefold between species and by two- to threefold even within species. This variation was mainly explained by variation in passage time through the juvenile categories.
   We used strong relative growth changes to detect release and suppression events. On average, canopy trees experienced 0.8-1.4 releases, with a maximum of 4.
   We distinguished four canopy accession patterns by which trees have attained the canopy (growth without major growth changes, one release event, one suppression event, or several release and suppression events), with increasing time required to attain the canopy. The distribution of trees over categories of canopy accession is therefore closely related to the average age of canopy trees and its variation.
   There were clear differences among species in how trees attained the canopy and in the length of slow-growth periods they experienced, suggesting differences in shade tolerance and growth responses to gaps, which are indicative of life-history differences among non-pioneer tree species.
   Canopy attainment of tropical rain forest trees does not occur by steady growth, but rather by irregular patterns of growth spurts and stand-stills, probably mostly caused by temporal variation in light. Differences in these patterns may largely explain differences in the ages of large tropical rain forest trees.

AB Potential climatic changes of the near future have important characteristics that differentiate them from the largest magnitude and most rapid of climatic changes of the Quaternary. These potential climatic changes are thus a cause for considerable concern in terms of their possible impacts upon biodiversity.
   Birds, in common with other terrestrial organisms, are expected to exhibit one of two general responses to climatic change: they may adapt to the changed conditions without shifting location, or they may show a spatial response, adjusting their geographical distribution in response to the changing climate. The Quaternary geological record provides examples of organisms that responded to the climatic fluctuations of that period in each of these ways, but also indicates that the two are not alternative responses but components of the same overall predominantly spatial response. Species unable to achieve a sufficient response by either or both of these mechanisms will be at risk of extinction; the Quaternary record documents examples of such extinctions.
   Relationships between the geographical distributions of birds and present climate have been modelled for species breeding in both Europe and Africa. The resulting models have very high goodness-of-fit and provide a basis for assessing the potential impacts of anthropogenic climatic changes upon avian species richness in the two continents. Simulations made for a range of general circulation model projections of late 21st century climate lead to the conclusion that the impacts upon birds are likely to be substantial. The boundaries of many species' potential geographical distributions are likely to be shifted >= 1000 km. There is likely to be a general decline in avian species richness, with the mean extent of species' potential geographical distributions likely to decrease. Species with restricted distributions and specialized species of particular biomes are likely to suffer the greatest impacts. Migrant species are likely to suffer especially large impacts as climatic change alters both their breeding and wintering areas, as well as critical stopover sites, and also potentially increases the distances they must migrate seasonally.
   Without implementation of new conservation measures, these impacts will be severe and are likely to be exacerbated by land-use change and associated habitat fragmentation. Unless strenuous efforts are made to address the root causes of anthropogenic climatic change, much current effort to conserve biodiversity will be in vain.

AB The two most fundamental levels of biodiversity, species diversity and genetic diversity, are seldom studied simultaneously despite a strikingly similar set of processes that underlie patterns at the two levels. Agricultural land use drastically reduces populations of forest herbs in the north-temperate zone, so that bottlenecks or founder events in forests on abandoned agricultural land (i.e., secondary forests) may have a longterm impact on both species diversity and genetic diversity. Using forest-herb community surveys and molecular-genetic analysis of populations of Trillium grandiflorum, a representative species of forest herb, I investigated the influence of land-use history, landscape context, and environmental conditions on diversity and divergence at the population and community levels. Secondary forests (70-100 years old) had reduced diversity of both genes and species relative to primary forests (i.e., stands never cleared for agriculture). The community in secondary forests had an overrepresentation of the most common species in the landscape, though divergence in species' relative abundances within stands suggested an influence of community drift via local bottlenecks. Secondary-forest populations of T. grandiflorum were more genetically divergent than those in primary forests, again indicating drift in small populations. Land-use history and the size of populations and communities drove correlations between species diversity and genetic diversity (and community divergence X genetic divergence), though the strength of correlations was relatively weak. These results extend the generality of positive species-genetic diversity correlations previously observed for islands, and they demonstrate a long-term legacy of land-use history at multiple levels of biodiversity.

AB The strategy of relying extensively on stored nutrient reserves for reproduction (capital breeding) was thought to be common in large-bodied birds breeding in harsh environments, such as arctic-nesting geese, but this view has been challenged recently. Our objective was to model inputs to the eggs from stored reserves and from local food plants in Greater Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens atlantica) breeding in the high Arctic, using a now approach based on stable-isotope signatures. Snow Geese and their eggs were collected during laying from 1999 to 2001 (N = 66 females and 110 eggs). We analyzed the isotopic signature (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) of egg constituents (lipid-free yolk, yolk lipid, and albumen), goose tissues (lipid-free breast muscles, abdominal fat, and whole liver) and of the food plants eaten by laying geese in the Arctic (graminoids and forbs). We applied a two-isotope mixing model approach to delineate nutrient input to eggs quantitatively. Differences in the isotopic signature of endogenous reserves and arctic food plants were relatively large (5.3-8.0parts per thousand for Deltadelta(13)C and 7.5parts per thousand for Deltadelta(15)N) because reserves were accumulated in southern staging areas where geese feed in farmlands and estuarine habitats. The percentage of egg nutrients derived from exogenous sources (food consumed in the Arctic) was higher than from endogenous (body) reserves and varied little among the three years. Isotopic signatures indicated that endogenous reserves contributed 33% of lipid-free yolk nutrients, 27% of albumen, and 20% of yolk lipid, on average. Isotopic signatures of egg constituents of individual females were more strongly related to those of liver than endogenous sources (breast muscles or abdominal fat), indicating that the endogenous isotopic signature was diluted by a dietary input in the liver. We also found evidence of seasonal variation in the use of endogenous reserves. Late-laying females apparently invested proportionally more endogenous reserves in their eggs than did early layers, but not those laying larger clutches. We conclude that Greater Snow Geese use a mixed capital/income breeding strategy. Our study shows that isotopic composition of tissues can be used to infer the contribution of exogenous vs. endogenous sources of nutrients for egg formation where inputs differ isotopically.

AB Juvenile silver perch were fed various dietary protein levels to investigate their growth performance, carcass proximate composition and 24 h postprandial accumulated ammonia excretion. White fish meal was the primary protein source in the study. Eight experimental diets containing 13-55% protein with 15.06 MJ/kg diet were fed to three-replicate eight groups of eight fish (mean weight: 2.72 g) for 8 weeks. Both percent weight gain and feed efficiency significantly increased with increasing dietary protein levels up to 37%, while there were no significant differences for protein levels from 37 to 55%. Application of broken line regression analysis to percent weight gain provided an estimate of 42.15 +/- 1.87% dietary protein for maximum growth. The protein efficiency ratio and productive protein value were inversely correlated with dietary protein level. The hepatosomatic index and intraperitoneal fat ratios were also inversely related to dietary protein level. Fish fed diets containing 43% dietary protein had significantly higher condition factor than fish fed lower dietary protein levels, but fish fed only 13% dietary protein had the longest relative gut length. The protein content of the fish carcasses increased with dietary protein levels up to 31%, but no significant difference was found with protein levels higher than 37%. Lipid content decreased with increasing dietary protein levels and dry matter content also slightly decreased. The amount of postprandial ammonia excreted by silver perch within 24 h was linearly related to dietary protein level. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Using natural nests of eight bird species, we provide one of the first multispecies tests for edge effects on reproductive success in a forested landscape. Our primary objective was to assess whether distance to the edge of recent clearcuts was related to nesting success in intact northern hardwood forests. Estimated nest success was generally lower for the two ground-nesting species than for the six canopy-nesting species. Brood parasitism was <3% for species which typically accept eggs of the Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), and nest predation was the most common cause of nest failure. Probability of nest failure was influenced by distance to forest edge for the ground-nesting Hermit Thrush (Catharus guttatus) and Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), but not for six canopy-nesting species. For the Hermit Thrush and Ovenbird, nest success relative to decreasing distance to the edge was reduced during the nestling stage, but not the incubation stage. Nest density appeared to be higher in forest zones near the clearcut edge for ground-nesting and for several canopy-nesting species. Our data suggest that the effect of proximity to edge on nest success for ground-nesting species may penetrate 300 m into intact forest, while the effect of proximity to edge on nest density may penetrate farther. These data suggest that the creation of openings in forested landscapes reduces nest success and increases nest density for some species of migratory birds in a zone adjacent to the opening. This pattern supports the notion that "ecological traps" may exist for ground-nesting birds in areas near recently created forest openings. Because areas of contiguous forest (e.g., publicly owned forest) in the Upper Great Lakes remain relatively intact, they may serve as source habitat for regional songbird metapopulations.

AB In the last few years, landscape researchers have sought to understand temporal and spatial patterns of landscape changes in order to develop comprehensive models of land cover dynamics. To do so, most studies have used similar methods to quantify structural patterns, usually by comparing various landscape structural indices through time. Whereas the necessity for complementary approaches which might provide insights into landscape dynamics at some finer scale relevant to local managers has been expressed, few studies have proposed alternative methodologies. Moreover, the important relationship between the physical constraints of the landscape and land use dynamics has been seldom emphasized. Here we propose a methodological outline which was applied to the study of a rural landscape of Southern Quebec, Canada, to detect spatial and temporal ( 1958 to 1993) patterns of land cover changes at field, patch and landscape level. We then relate these patterns to the underlying physical structure of landscape elements using GIS and canonical correspondence analyses. We use the different geomorphological deposit types as stable discriminant factors which may constrain land use.
   Canonical correspondence analyses showed relations of land use and land use changes to the physical attributes of the landscape elements, whereas spatial analyses revealed very dynamic patterns at finer spatial and temporal scales. They highlighted the fact that not only the physical attributes of the landscape elements but also their spatial configuration were important determinants of land use dynamics in this area. Thus more land use changes occurred at the boundary between geomorphological deposit types than in ally other locations. This trend is apparent for specific small-size changes (e.g. forest to crop), but not for the large-size ones (e.g. abandoned land to forest). Although land use changes are triggered by socioeconomic forces in this area, these changes are nevertheless constrained by the underlying physical landscape structure. A thorough comprehension of historical changes will enhance our capability to predict future landscape dynamics and devise more effective landscape management strategies.

AB From first principles, the temporal variability of a time series of abundances can be defined as the average deviation of values from a mean value on a proportional scale. In this paper we review: (i) the different kinds of temporal variability; (ii) the different ways in which it can be measured; (iii) the design of appropriate sampling schemes; (iv) methods of analysing variability; and (v) patterns in temporal variability. We emphasize that some commonly applied measures are not appropriate, that several do not measure the desired feature of time series, and the importance of considerations of trend and sampling error. A number of suggestions are made for the improvement of the basis for comparative analyses of levels of variability, and some of the potential pitfalls are identified. Given the serious faults in many previous analyses of ecological patterns in the temporal variability of animal abundances, emphasis is laid on the theoretical basis for different patterns, and hence a set of hypotheses for testing is generated.

AB Nutritional symbionts play a major role in the ecology and evolution of insects. The recent accumulation of knowledge on the identity, function, genomics, and phylogenetic relationships of insect-bacteria symbioses provides the opportunity to assess the effects of symbiont acquisitions and replacements on the shift into novel ecological niches and subsequent lineage diversification. The megadiverse insect order Hemiptera presents a particularly large diversity of symbiotic associations that has frequently undergone shifts in symbiont localization and identity, which have contributed to the exploitation of nutritionally imbalanced diets such as plant saps or vertebrate blood. Here we review the known ecological and evolutionary implications of symbiont gains, switches, and replacements, and identify future research directions that can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of symbiosis as a major driving force of ecological adaptation.

AB Developmental plasticity describes situations where a specific input during an individual's development produces a lasting alteration in phenotype. Some instances of developmental plasticity may be adaptive, meaning that the tendency to produce the phenotype conditional on having experienced the developmental input has been under positive selection. We discuss the necessary assumptions and predictions of hypotheses concerning adaptive developmental plasticity (ADP) and develop guidelines for how to test empirically whether a particular example is adaptive. Central to our analysis is the distinction between two kinds of ADP: informational, where the developmental input provides information about the future environment, and somatic state-based, where the developmental input enduringly alters some aspect of the individual's somatic state. Both types are likely to exist in nature, but evolve under different conditions. In all cases of ADP, the expected fitness of individuals who experience the input and develop the phenotype should be higher than that of those who experience the input and do not develop the phenotype, while the expected fitness of those who do not experience the input and do not develop the phenotype should be higher than those who do not experience the input and do develop the phenotype. We describe ancillary predictions that are specific to just one of the two types of ADP and thus distinguish between them.

TI The ecology and biodiversity of urban ponds
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER
LA English
DT Review
AB Recent research has demonstrated that ponds contribute a great deal to biodiversity at a regional level as networks of habitat patches that also act as 'stepping stones' to facilitate the movement of species through the landscape. Similarly, a great deal of biodiversity persists in urban environments where synanthropic communities are supplemented by species that thrive in disturbed environments. Aquatic urban biodiversity appears to persist despite anthropogenic stressors: an array of anthropogenic pollutants (road salt and heavy metals), invasive species, and active mismanagement-particularly the removal of riparian vegetation. Optimizing urban ponds for different ecosystem services results in conflicting priorities over hydrological, geochemical, ecological, aesthetic, and cultural functions. The socio-ecosystem approach to environmental management opens a path to greater incorporation of biodiversity into town planning and sustainability, while accounting for cultural attitudes to urban ecosystems. I identify a range of research needs: (1) the roles of design and location of urban ponds in influencing biodiversity, (2) the function of urban wetlands for stormwater and pollution management, and (3) public perceptions of urban ecosystems and how those perceptions are influenced by interactions with natural systems. Urban wetlands offer an important opportunity to educate the general public on natural systems and science in general using a resource that is located on their doorstep. In the face of increasing pressures on natural systems and increasing extent and intensity of urbanization, a more comprehensive appreciation of the challenges and opportunities provided by urban ponds could play a substantial role in driving sustainable urban development.

TI Phylogenetic insights into Andean plant diversification
SO FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
LA English
DT Review
DE Andes; divergence times; orogeny; phylogeny; plants; uplift
AB Andean orogeny is considered as one of the most important events for the development of current plant diversity in South America. We compare available phylogenetic studies and divergence time estimates for plant lineages that may have diversified in response to Andean orogeny. The influence of the Andes on plant diversification is separated into four major groups: The Andes as source of new high-elevation habitats, as a vicariant barrier, as a North-South corridor, and as generator of new environmental conditions outside the Andes. Biogeographical relationships between the Andes and other regions are also considered. Divergence time estimates indicate that high-elevation lineages originated and diversified during or after the major phases of Andean uplift (Mid-Miocene to Pliocene), although there are some exceptions. As expected, Andean mid-elevation lineages tend to be older than high-elevation groups. Most clades with disjunct distribution on both sides of the Andes diverged during Andean uplift. Inner-Andean clades also tend to have divergence time during or after Andean uplift. This is interpreted as evidence of vicariance. Dispersal along the Andes has been shown to occur in either direction, mostly dated after the Andean uplift. Divergence time estimates of plant groups outside the Andes encompass a wider range of ages, indicating that the Andes may not be necessarily the cause of these diversifications. The Andes are biogeographically related to all neighboring areas, especially Central America, with floristic interchanges in both directions since Early Miocene times. Direct biogeographical relationships between the Andes and other disjunct regions have also been shown in phylogenetic studies, especially with the eastern Brazilian highlands and North America. The history of the Andean flora is complex and plant diversification has been driven by a variety of processes, including environmental change, adaptation, and biotic interactions.

AB Heavy metal pollution is one of the most serous environmental issues globally. To evaluate the metal pollution in Jiangsu Province of China, the total concentrations of heavy metals in sediments and fishes from the Yangtze River and Taihu Lake were analyzed. Ecological risk of sediments and human health risk of fish consumption were assessed respectively. Furthermore, toxicity of samples on expression of the stress responsive genes was evaluated using microbial live cell-array method. The results showed that the heavy metals concentrations in sediments from the Yangtze River were much higher than those in sediments from the Taihu Lake. However, the fishes from the Taihu Lake had higher concentrations of heavy metals than fishes from the Yangtze River. Ecological risk evaluation showed that the heavy metal contaminants in sediments from the Yangtze River posed higher risk of adverse ecological effects, while sediments from the study areas of Taihu Lake were relatively safe. Health risk assessment suggested that the heavy metals in fishes of both Yangtze River and Taihu Lake might have risk of adverse health effects to human. The toxicity assessment indicated that the heavy metals in these sediments and fishes showed transcriptional effects on the selected 21 stress responsive genes, which were involved in the pathways of DNA damage response, chemical stress, and perturbations of electron transport. Together, this field investigation combined with chemical analysis, risk assessment and toxicity bioassay would provide useful information on the heavy metal pollution in Jiangsu Province.

AB By comparing three cases of environmental activism in China, our paper answers the following three questions about public participation in environment protection in China: (1) what are the drivers for public participation, (2) who are the agents leading the participation, and (3) do existing laws facilitate public participation? We find heightened public awareness of environmental degradation and increasing anxieties over health and property values drive people to fight for more political space to influence decisions that have an impact on the environment. Despite the promises one finds in the letter of Chinese laws, Chinese society lacks a meaningful institutional framework to allow public participation, even in the area of environmental protection. The Chinese government mainly passively responds to public demands on an ad hoc basis, with no institutional commitment for engaging the public on environmental issues. This is unfortunate, because public policies without adequate public input are doomed to be clouded by illegitimacy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are potent attractants for entomophagous arthropods and researchers have long speculated that HIPVs can be used to lure natural enemies into crops, reestablishing predator-prey relationships that become decoupled in disturbed agricultural habitats. This speculation has since become reality as the number of field trials investigating HIPV-mediated attraction and its consequences for pest suppression has risen dramatically over the past 10 years. Here, I provide an overview of recent field efforts to augment natural enemy populations using HIPVs, with emphasis on those studies manipulating synthetic compounds in controlled-release dispensers, and outline a prospectus for future research needs. Specifically, I review and discuss: (i) choice of compounds and release rates; (ii) functional changes in predator and parasitoid communities; (iii) non-target effects; (iv) mechanisms of attraction and prey suppression; (v) spatial-and landscape-level considerations; (vi) context-dependent responses; and (vii) temporal stability of attraction.

AB We studied the relative importance of residence time, propagule pressure, and species traits in three stages of invasion of alien woody plants cultivated for about 150 years in the Czech Republic, Central Europe. The probability of escape from cultivation, naturalization, and invasion was assessed using classification trees. We compared 109 escaped-not-escaped congeneric pairs, 44 naturalized-not-naturalized, and 17 invasive-not-invasive congeneric pairs. We used the following predictors of the above probabilities: date of introduction to the target region as a measure of residence time; intensity of planting in the target area as a proxy for propagule pressure; the area of origin; and 21 species-specific biological and ecological traits. The misclassification rates of the naturalization and invasion model were low, at 19.3% and 11.8%, respectively, indicating that the variables used included the major determinants of these processes. The probability of escape increased with residence time in the Czech Republic, whereas the probability of naturalization increased with the residence time in Europe. This indicates that some species were already adapted to local conditions when introduced to the Czech Republic. Apart from residence time, the probability of escape depends on planting intensity (propagule pressure), and that of naturalization on the area of origin and fruit size; it is lower for species from Asia and those with small fruits. The probability of invasion is determined by a long residence time and the ability to tolerate low temperatures. These results indicate that a simple suite of factors determines, with a high probability, the invasion success of alien woody plants, and that the relative role of biological traits and other factors is stage dependent. High levels of propagule pressure as a result of planting lead to woody species eventually escaping from cultivation, regardless of biological traits. However, the biological traits play a role in later stages of invasion.

AB P>1. Effective biodiversity management can only be implemented if data are available on assemblage-environment relationships. The level of detail needs to be relevant to the scale of planning and decision making. A number of remote-sensing methods are available, but there are few studies that link information collected at both landscape and local scales. This is particularly true for arthropods even though these organisms are ecologically very important.
   2. We assessed the predictive power of habitat variables measured by airborne laser scanning (light detection and ranging; LiDAR) to model the activity, richness and composition of assemblages of forest-dwelling beetles. We compared the results with data acquired using conventional field methods. We sampled beetles with pitfall traps and flight-interception traps at 171 sampling stations along an elevation gradient in a montane forest.
   3. We found a high predictive power of LiDAR-derived variables, which captured most of the predictive power of variables measured in ground surveys. In particular, mean body size and species composition of assemblages showed considerable predictability using LiDAR-derived variables. The differences in the predictability of species richness and diversity of assemblages between trap types can be explained by sample size. We expect predictabilities with R-2 of up to 0 center dot 6 for samples with 250 individuals on average.
   4. The statistical response of beetle data and the ecological interpretability of results showed that airborne laser scanning can be used for cost-effective mapping (LiDAR : field survey : beetles 15 : 100 : 260 euro ha(-1)) of biodiversity even in remote mountain areas and in structurally complex habitats, such as forests.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The strong relationship between characteristics of beetle assemblages to variables derived by laser scanning provides an opportunity to link data from local ground surveys of hyperdiverse taxa to data collected remotely at the landscape scale. This will enable conservation managers to evaluate habitats, define hotspots or map activity, richness and composition of assemblages at scales relevant for planning and management. In addition to the large area that can be sampled remotely, the grain of the data allows a single tree to be identified, which opens up the possibility of planning management actions at local scales.

AB In nature, closely related species may hybridize while still retaining their distinctive identities. Chromosomal regions that experience reduced recombination in hybrids, such as within inversions, have been hypothesized to contribute to the maintenance of species integrity. Here, we examine genomic sequences from closely related fruit fly taxa of the Drosophila pseudoobscura subgroup to reconstruct their evolutionary histories and past patterns of genic exchange. Partial genomic assemblies were generated from two subspecies of Drosophila pseudoobscura (D. ps.) and an outgroup species, D. miranda. These new assemblies were compared to available assemblies of D. ps. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis, two species with overlapping ranges in western North America. Within inverted regions, nucleotide divergence among each pair of the three species is comparable, whereas divergence between D. ps. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis in non-inverted regions is much lower and closer to levels of intraspecific variation. Using molecular markers flanking each of the major chromosomal inversions, we identify strong crossover suppression in F(1) hybrids extending over 2 megabase pairs (Mbp) beyond the inversion breakpoints. These regions of crossover suppression also exhibit the high nucleotide divergence associated with inverted regions. Finally, by comparison to a geographically isolated subspecies, D. ps. bogotana, our results suggest that autosomal gene exchange between the North American species, D. ps. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis, occurred since the split of the subspecies, likely within the last 200,000 years. We conclude that chromosomal rearrangements have been vital to the ongoing persistence of these species despite recent hybridization. Our study serves as a proof-of-principle on how whole genome sequencing can be applied to formulate and test hypotheses about species formation in lesser-known non-model systems.

AB Soil microbes are among the most abundant and diverse organisms on Earth. Although microbial decomposers, particularly fungi, are important mediators of global carbon and nutrient cycling, the functional roles of specific taxa within natural environments remain unclear. We used a nucleotide-analog technique in soils from the Harvard Forest to characterize the fungal taxa that responded to the addition of five different carbon substrates-glycine, sucrose, cellulose, lignin, and tannin-protein. We show that fungal community structure and richness shift in response to different carbon sources, and we demonstrate that particular fungal taxa target different organic compounds within soil microcosms. Specifically, we identified eleven taxa that exhibited changes in relative abundances across substrate treatments. These results imply that niche partitioning through specialized resource use may be an important mechanism by which soil microbial diversity is maintained in ecosystems. Consequently, high microbial diversity may be necessary to sustain ecosystem processes and stability under global change.

AB Organisms in a seasonal environment often schedule activities in a regular way over the year. If we assume that such annual routines have been shaped by natural selection then life-history theory should provide a basis for explaining them. We argue that many life-history trade-offs are mediated by underlying physiological variables that act on various time scales. The dynamics of these variables often preclude considering one period of the year in isolation. In order to capture the essence of annual routines, and many life-history traits, a detailed model of changes in physiological state over the annual cycle is required. We outline a modelling approach based on suitable physiological and ecological state variables that can capture this underlying biology, and describe how models based on this approach can be used to generate a range of insights and predictions.

AB Recent experiments on grassland ecosystems have shown that biodiversity can enhance ecosystem processes such as plant biomass production. Functional complementarity is generally regarded as the main class of mechanisms generating these effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning. Although intuitively appealing and supported by some data, the complementarity hypothesis has been little explored theoretically using mechanistic approaches. Here, we present a simple dynamical model for a light-limited terrestrial ecosystem to assess the effects of species diversity on light competition and total biomass in plant communities. Our model shows that competitive relaxation (reduction in average light competition intensity) due to differences in foliar architecture among species enhances total plant biomass in mixtures, but that competitive imbalance (generated by the variance of the average light competition intensity experienced by different species) can either reinforce the effect of competitive relaxation or counteract it and contribute to reducing total plant biomass. Thus, complementary resource use is not enough to increase total plant biomass in species-rich communities; competitive balance among species also plays an important role. We propose an operational measure of light-use complementarity using empirical field data on light absorption to test the presence of complementarity in natural plant communities.

AB Fish abundance surveys in the Rhine system have shown in the past two decades that there is a rapid upriver invasion of a freshwater sculpin of the genus Cottus. These fish are found in habitats that are atypical for the known species Cottus gobio, which is confined to small cold streams within the Rhine drainage. Phylogeographic analysis based on mitochondrial haplotypes and diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms indicates that the invasive sculpins are hybrids between two old lineages from the River Scheldt drainage and the River Rhine drainage, although it is morphologically more similar to the Scheldt sculpins. Most importantly, however, the invasive population possesses a unique ecological potential that does not occur in either of the source populations from the Rhine or the Scheldt, which allows the colonization of new habitats that have previously been free of sculpins. Microsatellite analysis shows that the new lineage is genetically intermediate between the old lineages and that it forms a distinct genetic group across its whole expansion range. We conclude that hybridization between long separated groups has lead to the fast emergence of a new, adaptationally distinct sculpin lineage.

AB Roadside plant communities were studied along two roads following an altitudinal gradient in Gran Canaria and Tenerife (Canary Islands). Our aim was to investigate variation in plant species richness, particularly of the alien flora, along a gradient from coastal shrubland to summit vegetation (1950 m a.s.l. in Gran Canaria, 2300 m in Tenerife) in relation to variation in habitat factors (altitude, habitat structure, roadside disturbance, distance to urban nuclei). We compared different species groups that were classified in terms of their biogeographical status, origin and life form. Altitude was the most important factor determining species richness and composition along both roadside transects. Alien plants showed a unimodal distribution pattern along the altitudinal gradient, with less species and lower abundance at low and high altitudes, and highest abundance at intermediate altitude. Alien plant species were also relatively more frequent near urban centres. The number of native and alien species was significantly positively correlated along the altitudinal gradient. Both alien and native, non-endemic species showed differences in their distribution along the altitudinal gradient according to their biogeographical affinities and climatic tolerances. Despite considerable differences in species pools these patterns were consistent among the two islands. Environmental (abiotic) stress is proposed as a primary, altitude-related factor acting as a filter against most alien plants at coastal and high-mountain altitudes. A higher frequency or intensity of disturbance at intermediate altitudes may be a further causal factor promoting alien plants in this zone. Future management efforts to control alien plants along roads should, therefore, concentrate on intermediate altitudinal zones of the higher Canary Islands. (c) 2005 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich.

AB Avian ecology in tropical urban area is poorly understood. We determined, through surveys in 29 sites, how birds with different dietary and nesting requirements responded in terms of guild richness and abundance to various facets of urbanisation in Singapore. The sites selected were representative of the full range of urbanisation outside of the undisturbed native forests. Among the dietary guilds, we found that insectivores and carnivores were adversely affected by increased urbanisation. Frugivores were favoured by low-density housing, probably because more fruit-bearing ornamental plants were planted in such estates. Richness and abundance of shrub and shrub/tree nesters, and primary cavity excavators declined with increased urbanisation. We believe that the availability of nesting sites was an important factor in their decline. Exotic species accounted for only 13% of the total species richness detected in our surveys but they were numerically dominant (accounting for 61 % of overall bird abundance). Abundance of native resident birds declined monotonically with increasing amount of built-up environment while birds of exotic species appeared to be more abundant in sites with intermediate amount of built-up environment. While urban greenery serves architectural and other functions, it has little effect on overall bird community assembly. The preponderance of exotic species in Singapore city suggests that birds of tropical rainforests are poor colonisers of this relatively novel environment. Many of the native urban species originated from mangrove and coastal scrub forests, so the maintenance of rainforests is necessary for the preservation of many native bird species.

AB Aims and location The potential of pollen records in quantitative climate reconstructions has been widely debated but seldom tested. Our aim is to develop a pollen-climate transfer function for northern Europe and test its performance and inference power by numerical cross-validation with modern climate data. Annual mean temperature (T-ann) was assessed as the critical climatic variable because T-ann has a distinct south-north gradient (5.5 to -4.7 degreesC) in the study region with a corresponding zonal vegetation gradient from the hemiboreal zone in the south to the northern boreal zone in the north.
   Methods We collected 137 pollen surface samples from small- to medium size lakes from southern Estonia to northern Finland. The transfer function for T-ann was developed with weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) regression. All 102 terrestrial pollen and spore types were included in the calculation sum and all 137 surface samples and all 102 taxa were included in the transfer function. The performance of the WA-PLS transfer function was evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation.
   Results A cross-validated root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of our model is 0.89 degreesC and the coefficient of determination (r(2)) between the observed meteorological T-ann values and those predicted by the model in leave-one-out cross-validation is 0.88. The RMSEP as a percentage of the gradient length of T-ann is 8.8%. These figures indicate high performance statistics for our transfer function compared with other inference models. This is probably because of standardization of our surface-sampling and pollen-analytical procedures, careful selection of the surface sample sites with consideration of the relevant pollen source area, the simple patterns of vegetation zones and climate in the study area, and the mostly natural floristic composition of the forests in northern Europe. However, we also demonstrate the limitations of our model in reliably detecting fine-scale climatic variability.
   Main conclusions The study shows the strong influence of T-ann on modern pollen composition and demonstrates the potential of pollen data for long-term climate reconstructions in northern Europe. It also provides evidence against simple interpretations of fine-scale variations in a single climate reconstruction. In particular, our results highlight the importance of careful study design and implementation in the construction of pollen-climate transfer functions.

AB Dated sediment cores from five alpine lakes (>3200 m asl) in Rocky Mountain National Park (Colorado Front Range, USA) record near-synchronous stratigraphic changes that are believed to reflect ecological and biogeochemical responses to enhanced nitrogen deposition from anthropogenic sources. Changes in sediment proxies include progressive increases in the frequencies of mesotrophic planktonic diatom taxa and diatom concentrations, coupled with depletions of sediment delta N-15 and C : N values. These trends are especially pronounced since approximately 1950. The most conspicuous diatoms to expand in recent decades are Asterionella formosa and Fragilaria crotonensis. Down-core species changes are corroborated by a year-long sediment trap experiment from one of the lakes, which reveals high frequencies of these two taxa during autumn and winter months, the interval of peak annual limnetic [NO3-]. Although all lakes record recent changes, the amplitude of stratigraphic shifts is greater in lakes east of the Continental Divide relative to those on the western slope, implying that most nitrogen enrichment originates from urban, industrial and agricultural sources east of the Rocky Mountains. Deviations from natural trajectories of lake ontogeny are illustrated by canonical correspondence analysis, which constrains the diatom record as a response to changes in nitrogen biogeochemistry. These results indicate that modest rates of anthropogenic nitrogen deposition are fully capable of inducing directional biological and biogeochemical shifts in relatively pristine ecosystems.

AB The increase in species richness from the poles to the Equator has been observed in numerous terrestrial and aquatic taxa. A number of different hypotheses have been put forward as explanations for this trend, e.g. area and energy availability. However, whether these hypotheses apply to large spatial scales in marine environments remains unclear. The present study shows a clear latitudinal gradient from high to low latitude (from 80degrees N to 70degrees S) in marine species richness for 6643 species (fishes and invertebrates) in 10 different taxa dwelling in benthic and pelagic habitats on both sides of the Atlantic. The patterns in benthic taxa are strongly influenced by coastal hydrographic processes, with marked peaks and troughs, and consequently the gradients are not symmetric along both Atlantic sides. Pelagic taxa show a plateau-shaped distribution and the influence from coastal events on gradients could not be demonstrated. The relationships between species richness and different environmental factors indicate that area size does not explain the latitudinal pattern in benthic species richness on a large spatial scale. Sea-surface temperature (positive relationship) is the best predictor of this pattern for benthic species, and nitrate concentration (negative relationship) is the best predictor for pelagic species. The results call into question the existence of a single primary cause that would explain the pattern in marine species richness on a large spatial scale.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) currently may be derived from remotely sensed data with limited accuracy. This research addresses the need for increased accuracy in the estimation of LAI through integration of texture to the relationship between LAI and vegetation indices. The inclusion of texture, which acts as a surrogate for forest structure, to the relationship between LAI and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) increased the accuracy of modeled LAI estimates. First-order, second-order, and a newly developed semivariance moment texture are assessed in the relationship with LAI. The ability to increase the accuracy of LAI estimates was demonstrated over a range of forest species, densities, closures, tolerances, and successional regimes. Initial assessment of LAI from spectral response over the full range of stand types demonstrated the need for stratification by stand type prior to analysis. Stratification of the stands based upon species types yields an improvement in the regression relationships. For example, deciduous hardwood stands, spanning an LAI range from approximate to 1.5 to 7, have a moderate initial bivariate relationship between LAI and NDVI at an r(2) of 0.42. Inclusion of additional texture statistics to the multivariate relationship between LAI and NDVI further increases the amount of variation accounted for, to an R-2 of 0.61, which represents an increase in ability to estimate hardwood forest LAI from remotely sensed imagery by approximately 20% with the inclusion of texture. Mixed forest stands, which are spectrally diverse, had an insignificant initial r(2) of 0.01 between LAI and NDVI, which improved to a significant R-2 of 0.44 with the inclusion of semivariance moment texture.

AB The interspecific geographic range size-body size relationship for animals is widely described simply as a positive interaction. However, examples of this relationship have been reported in which geographic range size increases with increasing body size, decreases with increasing body size, or follows no simple pattern. Here we suggest that much of this variation can be explained in terms of the extent of the geographic coverage of different studies. In the main, where significant interactions are found, 'comprehensive' analyses (performed over areas which embrace a very large proportion of the geographic ranges of the species concerned) report positive range size-body size relationships, whilst 'partial' analyses (performed over areas which embrace the entire geographic ranges of none or only a small proportion of the species concerned) report positive or negative relationships with about equal frequency. Some of the consequences of this observation are discussed.

AB The purpose of this study was to partition the components of a mixed fire frequency, and empirically relate these components to temporal and spatial differences in fire frequency.  The method of reconstructing the fire frequency was to build a stand-origin map, from this estimate the mixed time-since-fire distribution, and then use a graphic technique to partition the mixed distribution into two homogeneous fire-frequency distributions.
   The fire frequency for the last 380 yr in the 495-km2 Kananaskis Watershed showed a temporal change in fire frequency at almost-equal-to 1730.  This change in fire frequency is related to a change from a warmer and drier climate before 1730 to a cooler and moister climate since then.  When the fire-frequency data were partitioned by a graphic technique, the two resulting fire frequencies fit negative exponential distributions.  For the period 1730-1980 the fire cycle (the time required to burn an area equal to the area of study, or one divided by the scale parameter of the exponential distribution) was 90 yr.  For the period before 1730 the fire cycle was 50 yr.  The Watershed could not be subdivided into smaller, spatially homogeneous fire-frequency units.  The negative exponential distribution of fire frequencies suggests a constant hazard function (mortality force).  This constant hazard was corroborated by a spatial correlation (Moran's I) test which found no spatial pattern other than ones expected by chance between forest ages on either side of all fire boundaries.  Thus, there was no tendency for young stands to be associated either with only younger- or only older-aged stands.  Other studies on fire behavior in the Watershed corroborate the short fire cycle, constant hazard, and lack of spatial fire-frequency differences, and suggest that the regional climate control of the temporal fire frequency is related to a characteristic synoptic weather pattern and the resulting high intensity and high rate-of-spread of fires.

AB Soils constitute one of the most valuable resources on earth, especially because soil is renewable on human time scales. During the 20th century, a period marked by a widespread rural exodus and land abandonment, fire suppression policies were adopted facilitating the accumulation of fuel in forested areas, exacerbating the effects of wildfires, leading to severe degradation of soils. Prescribed fires emerged as an option for protecting forests and their soils from wildfires through the reduction of fuels levels. However such fires can serve other objectives, including stimulating the regeneration of a particular plant species, maintaining biological diversity or as a tool for recovering grasslands in encroached lands. This paper reviews studies examining the short-and long-term impacts of prescribed fires on the physical, chemical and biological soil properties; in so doing, it provides a summary of the benefits and drawbacks of this technique, to help determine if prescribed fires can be useful for managing the landscape. From the study conducted, we can affirm that prescribed fires affects soil properties but differ greatly depending on soil initial characteristics, vegetation or type of fire. Also, it is possible to see that soil's physical and biological properties are more strongly affected by prescribed fires than are its chemical properties. Finally, we conclude that prescribed fires clearly constitute a disturbance on the environment (positive, neutral or negative depending on the soil property studied), but most of the studies reviewed report a good recovery and their effects could be less pronounced than those of wildfires because of the limited soil heating and lower fire intensity and severity.

AB The purpose of this review is to highlight progress in unraveling carbon cycling dynamics across the continuum of landscapes, inland waters, coastal oceans, and the atmosphere. Earth systems are intimately interconnected, yet most biogeochemical studies focus on specific components in isolation. The movement of water drives the carbon cycle, and, as such, inland waters provide a critical intersection between terrestrial and marine biospheres. Inland, estuarine, and coastal waters are well studied in regions near centers of human population in the Northern hemisphere. However, many of the world's large river systems and their marine receiving waters remain poorly characterized, particularly in the tropics, which contribute to a disproportionately large fraction of the transformation of terrestrial organic matter to carbon dioxide, and the Arctic, where positive feedback mechanisms are likely to amplify global climate change. There are large gaps in current coverage of environmental observations along the aquatic continuum. For example, tidally-influenced reaches of major rivers and near-shore coastal regions around river plumes are often left out of carbon budgets due to a combination of methodological constraints and poor data coverage. We suggest that closing these gaps could potentially alter global estimates of CO2 outgassing from surface waters to the atmosphere by several-fold. Finally, in order to identify and constrain/embrace uncertainties in global carbon budget estimations it is important that we further adopt statistical and modeling approaches that have become well-established in the fields of oceanography and paleoclimatology, for example.

AB Background: The influence of sperm competition upon sperm size has been a controversial issue during the last 20 years which remains unresolved for mammals. The hypothesis that, when ejaculates compete with rival males, an increase in sperm size would make sperm more competitive because it would increase sperm swimming speed, has generated contradictory results from both theoretical and empirical studies. In addition, the debate has extended to which sperm components should increase in size: the midpiece to accommodate more mitochondria and produce more energy to fuel motility, or the principal piece to generate greater propulsion forces.
   Results: In this study we examined the influence of sperm competition upon sperm design in mammals using a much larger data set (226 species) than in previous analyses, and we corrected for phylogenetic effects by using a more complete and resolved phylogeny, and more robust phylogenetic control methods. Our results show that, as sperm competition increases, all sperm components increase in an integrated manner and sperm heads become more elongated. The increase in sperm length was found to be associated with enhanced swimming velocity, an adaptive trait under sperm competition.
   Conclusions: We conclude that sperm competition has played an important role in the evolution of sperm design in mammals, and discuss why previous studies have failed to detect it.

AB Species' life-history and population dynamics are strongly shaped by the longevity of individuals, but life span is one of the least accessible demographic traits, particularly in clonal plants. Continuous vegetative reproduction of genets enables persistence despite low or no sexual reproduction, affecting genet turnover rates and population stability. Therefore, the longevity of clonal plants is of considerable biological interest, but remains relatively poorly known.
   Here, we critically review the present knowledge on the longevity of clonal plants and discuss its importance for population persistence. Direct life-span measurements such as growth-ring analysis in woody plants are relatively easy to take, although, for many clonal plants, these methods are not adequate due to the variable growth pattern of ramets and difficult genet identification. Recently, indirect methods have been introduced in which genet size and annual shoot increments are used to estimate genet age. These methods, often based on molecular techniques, allow the investigation of genet size and age structure of whole populations, a crucial issue for understanding their viability and persistence. However, indirect estimates of clonal longevity are impeded because the process of ageing in clonal plants is still poorly understood and because their size and age are not always well correlated. Alternative estimators for genet life span such as somatic mutations have recently been suggested.
   Empirical knowledge on the longevity of clonal species has increased considerably in the last few years. Maximum age estimates are an indicator of population persistence, but are not sufficient to evaluate turnover rates and the ability of long-lived clonal plants to enhance community stability and ecosystem resilience. In order to understand the dynamics of populations it will be necessary to measure genet size and age structure, not only life spans of single individuals, and to use such data for modelling of genet dynamics.

AB River channels tend to a dynamic equilibrium driven by the dynamics of water and sediment discharge. The resulting fluctuating pattern of channel form is affected by the slope, the substrate erodibility, and the vegetation in the river corridor and in the catchment. Geomorphology is basic to river biodiversity and ecosystem functioning since the channel pattern provides habitat for the biota and physical framework for ecosystem processes. Human activities increasingly change the natural drivers of channel morphology on a global scale (e.g. urbanization increases hydrological extremes, and clearing of forests for agriculture increases sediment yield). In addition, human actions common along world rivers impact channel dynamics directly, e.g. river regulation simplifies and fossilizes channel form. River conservation and restoration must incorporate mechanisms of channel formation and ecological consequences of channel form and dynamics. This article (1) summarizes the role of channel form on biodiversity and functioning of river ecosystems, (2) describes spatial complexity, connectivity and dynamism as three key hydromorphological attributes, (3) identifies prevalent human activities that impact these key components and (4) analyzes gaps in current knowledge and identifies future research topics.

AB We review current knowledge about the biology of the genus Acacia, and Acacia dealbata Link ( silver wattle) in particular, as an invader in Europe, focusing on (i) the biology of the genus Acacia; (ii) biological attributes that are important for the invasiveness of the genus and A. dealbata; (iii) possible hypotheses for the invasion success; and (iv) control methods.
   Several Australian wattles have been recorded as naturalized in Europe. Acacia has attained pest proportions in certain habitats and protected sites ( notably coastal dunes, river courses, natural parks and biosphere reserves).
   The spread of Acacia dealbata seems to be assisted by human interference such as soil disturbance and severe fires. The biological attributes favoring invasion by A. dealbata include tolerance of changing soil conditions, the ability to take advantage of environmental disturbance, phenotypic plasticity, vegetative reproduction, fire tolerance and allelopathic potential.
   Different hypotheses explaining invasiveness and transition between invasion steps related to biological attributes as the key factor for A. dealbata invasion are discussed. Effects on the biodiversity of native flora are little understood and studies of suppression of autochthonous species are needed. It is desirable that further studies comparing Acacia at field sites in their native and exotic range should be done.
   Understanding the biology of invasive wattles in Europe is the first step to an effective control method. Studies comparing plant invaders at field sites in their native and invaded areas seem to be most appropriate in order to be able to attack the most vulnerable stages.

AB Social learning is increasingly becoming a normative goal in natural resource management and policy. However, there remains little consensus over its meaning or theoretical basis. There are still considerable differences in understanding of the concept in the literature, including a number of articles published in Ecology & Society. Social learning is often conflated with other concepts such as participation and proenvironmental behavior, and there is often little distinction made between individual and wider social learning. Many unsubstantiated claims for social learning exist, and there is frequently confusion between the concept itself and its potential outcomes. This lack of conceptual clarity has limited our capacity to assess whether social learning has occurred, and if so, what kind of learning has taken place, to what extent, between whom, when, and how. This response attempts to provide greater clarity on the conceptual basis for social learning. We argue that to be considered social learning, a process must: (1) demonstrate that a change in understanding has taken place in the individuals involved; (2) demonstrate that this change goes beyond the individual and becomes situated within wider social units or communities of practice; and (3) occur through social interactions and processes between actors within a social network. A clearer picture of what we mean by social learning could enhance our ability to critically evaluate outcomes and better understand the processes through which social learning occurs. In this way, it may be possible to better facilitate the desired outcomes of social learning processes.

AB In order to expand our understanding of the diversity and biogeography of Prochlorococcus ribotypes, we PCR-amplified, cloned and sequenced the 16S/23S rRNA ITS region from sites in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Ninety-three per cent of the ITS sequences could be assigned to existing Prochlorococcus clades, although many novel subclades were detected. We assigned the sequences to operational taxonomic units using a graduated scale of sequence identity from 80% to 99.5% and correlated Prochlorococcus diversity with respect to environmental variables and dispersal time between the sites. Dispersal time was estimated using a global ocean circulation model. The significance of specific environmental variables was dependent on the degree of sequence identity used to define a taxon: light correlates with broad-scale diversity (90% cut-off), temperature with intermediate scale (95%) whereas no correlation with phosphate was observed. Community structure was correlated with dispersal time between sample sites only when taxa were defined using the finest sequence similarity cut-off. Surprisingly, the concentration of nitrate, which cannot be used as N source by the Prochlorococcus strains in culture, explains some variation in community structure for some definitions of taxa. This study suggests that the spatial distribution of Prochlorococcus ecotypes is shaped by a hierarchy of environmental factors as well dispersal limitation.

AB Africa supports Earth's richest assemblage of large predators, which coexist despite a high degree of dietary overlap. This study used reviews of the prey preferences of African wild dog Lycaon pictus, cheetah Acinonyx jubatus, leopard Panthera pardus, lion P. leo, and spotted hyaena Crocuta crocuta to Investigate the degree of dietary overlap and dietary niche breadth amongst the guild. Wild dogs and cheetahs exhibited the greatest dietary overlap and smallest dietary niche breadth, while lions exhibited the least dietary overlap and, with leopards, had the broadest dietary niche breadth. Increased extinction risk within the guild was related to lower dietary niche breadth. The behavioural and morphological specializations of the two most threatened predators (wild dogs and cheetahs) limit the prey available to them, and increases the potential for dietary competition. Conversely, the large body mass and group hunting strategy of lions and the predatory flexibility of leopards and spotted hyaenas minimizes the effects of dietary overlap, assuring a more secure status. This study Intimates reasons why cheetahs and African wild dogs are naturally less common than lions, leopards and spotted hyaenas In unmodified landscapes. The methods used can be applied to all adequately studied faunal guilds and could highlight previously undetected competitors.

AB Although a mitochondrial DNA barcode has been shown to be of great utility for species identification and discovery in an increasing number of diverse taxa, caution has been urged with its application to one of the most taxonomically diverse vertebrate groups-the amphibians. Here, we test three of the perceived shortcomings of a CO1 DNA barcode's utility with a group of Holarctic amphibians: primer fit, sequence variability and overlapping intra- and interspecific variability. We found that although the CO1 DNA barcode priming regions were variable, we were able to reliably amplify a CO1 fragment from degenerate primers and primers with G-C residues at the 3' end. Any overlap between intra- and interspecific variation in our taxonomic sampling was due to introgressive hybridization (Bufo/Anaxyrus), complex genetics (Ambystoma) or incomplete taxonomy (Triturus). Rates of hybridization and species discovery are not expected to be greater for amphibians than for other vertebrate groups, and thus problems with the utility of using a single mitochondrial gene for species identification will not be specific to amphibians. Therefore, we conclude that there is greater potential for a CO1 barcode's use with amphibians than has been reported to date. A large-scale effort to barcode the amphibians of the world, using the same primary barcode region of CO1, will yield important findings for science and conservation.

AB 1. Compared to bioclimatic variables, remote sensing predictors are rarely used for predictive species modelling. When used, the predictors represent typically habitat classifications or filters rather than gradual spectral, surface or biophysical properties. Consequently, the full potential of remotely sensed predictors for modelling the spatial distribution of species remains unexplored. Here we analysed the partial contributions of remotely sensed and climatic predictor sets to explain and predict the distribution of 19 tree species in Utah. We also tested how these partial contributions were related to characteristics such as successional types or species traits.
   2. We developed two spatial predictor sets of remotely sensed and topo-climatic variables to explain the distribution of tree species. We used variation partitioning techniques applied to generalized linear models to explore the combined and partial predictive powers of the two predictor sets. Non-parametric tests were used to explore the relationships between the partial model contributions of both predictor sets and species characteristics.
   3. More than 60% of the variation explained by the models represented contributions by one of the two partial predictor sets alone, with topo-climatic variables outperforming the remotely sensed predictors. However, the partial models derived from only remotely sensed predictors still provided high model accuracies, indicating a significant correlation between climate and remote sensing variables. The overall accuracy of the models was high, but small sample sizes had a strong effect on cross-validated accuracies for rare species.
   4. Models of early successional and broadleaf species benefited significantly more from adding remotely sensed predictors than did late seral and needleleaf species. The core-satellite species types differed significantly with respect to overall model accuracies. Models of satellite and urban species, both with low prevalence, benefited more from use of remotely sensed predictors than did the more frequent core species.
   5. Synthesis and applications. If carefully prepared, remotely sensed variables are useful additional predictors for the spatial distribution of trees. Major improvements resulted for deciduous, early successional, satellite and rare species. The ability to improve model accuracy for species having markedly different life history strategies is a crucial step for assessing effects of global change.

AB 1 Recent studies have documented local-scale associations between tree species and topographic and edaphic habitat types in forests worldwide. To determine whether such associations form at early life stages, we compared species' positive associations with five habitat types (high plateau, low plateau, slope, streamside, and swamp) at two life stages for 80 tree and shrub species in a Panamanian lowland forest.
   2 Nineteen significant, positive habitat associations were detected at the small tree stage (seedlings and saplings >= 20 cm tall and < 1 cm d.b.h.), and 18 at the large tree stage (individuals >= 1 cm d.b.h.), according to results of torus-translation randomization tests. The majority of species did not show consistent associations at the two stages. Of the 30 species significantly associated with a habitat, only five were associated with the same habitat at both stages. Overall, more species were associated with the wetter slope habitat at the large tree stage compared with the small tree stage.
   3 For a subset of species, we examined the relationship between observed habitat associations and seed dispersal and seedling establishment patterns by using species-specific seed dispersal kernels to predict seed rain into each habitat.
   4 Two-thirds of species associated with a habitat at the large tree stage had higher predicted seed densities in the associated habitat relative to other habitat types, indicating that limited seed dispersal acts to reinforce habitat associations for most species. In contrast, only one-third of the species associated with a habitat at the large tree stage showed evidence of higher seedling establishment rates in the associated habitat compared with other habitats, and an equal number of species appeared to have lower rates of establishment in the habitat that large trees of the species were associated with.
   5 Overall, our results indicate that habitat associations of large trees typically do not form at early life stages. Rather, many species appear to exhibit different ecological habitat preferences across life stages. Future studies of species' habitat associations should therefore include multiple life stages in order to detect developmental shifts in ecological preferences.

AB Quantitative relationships between modem pollen rain and climate are poorly studied in China, partly due to the extensive human impact on the modem vegetation. A dataset consisting of 227 modem pollen samples from forests, shrublands, meadows, steppes, and deserts in the Tibetan Plateau, the least anthropologically-disturbed region in China, provides a unique opportunity to study the quantitative relationships between modem pollen rain and climate. Pollen percentage data were calculated on a sum of 20 pollen taxa. Climatic data for each site, including mean annual precipitation (W-P), mean annual temperature (MAT), July temperature (T-july), and January temperature (T-jan), were derived from 214 meteorological stations in the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas using natural neighbor interpolation and linear interpolation methods.
   Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to reveal the climatic parameters that best reflect the main patterns of variation in the modem pollen rain, and to detect anomalous observations. Results of CCA indicate that MAP and T-july are two climatic parameters controlling the variation of modem pollen rain in the Tibetan Plateau. Pollen-climate transfer functions for MAP and T-july were then developed using the inverse linear regression and weighted-averaging partial least squares regression models. The functions derived from these two models are statistically significant at the 0.0000 level. A case study, in which these functions were applied to a fossil pollen record from an alpine lake in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, was conducted to show the feasibility of these functions in paleoclimate reconstruction. The results demonstrated the applicability of these pollen-climate transfer functions to fossil pollen data. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The traditional view of the species as the fundamental unit of evolution has been challenged by observations that in heterogeneous environments, gene flow may be too restricted to overcome the effects of local selection. Whether a species evolves as a cohesive unit depends critically on the dynamic balance between homogenizing gene flow among populations and potentially disruptive local adaptation. To examine this evolutionary balance between "global" gene flow and local selection, we studied northern Californian populations of Helianthus exilis, the serpentine sunflower, within a mosaic of contrasting serpentine and nonserpentine areas that differ considerably in soil chemistry and water availability. Local adaptation to riparian and serpentine habitats was studied in Helianthus exilis along with an analysis of gene flow patterns among populations within these habitats. Local adaptation was assessed in H. exilis during 2002 and 2003 using reciprocal transplant experiments at multiple locations within serpentine and riparian habitats. Effects of competition and germination date on the expression of local adaptation were also examined within the reciprocal transplant experiments. Local adaptation was detected in both years at the local site level and at the level of habitat. The analysis of the transplanted populations indicated that the patterns of selection differed considerably between riparian and serpentine sites. Differential survivorship occurred in serpentine habitats, whereas selection on reproductive output predominated in riparian habitats. Local adaptation was expressed only in the absence of competition. Local adaptation in terms of survivorship was most strongly expressed in treatments with delayed seed germination. Microsatellite markers were used to quantify population genetic parameters and examine the patterns of gene flow among sampled populations. Analysis of molecular markers revealed a system of population patches that freely exchange genes with each other. Strong selection seems to maintain ecotypic variation within this endemic sunflower species, while extensive gene flow among populations prevents local speciation between serpentine and riparian ecotypes.

AB circle The aim of the study was to assess the potential importance for Mediterranean plants of trade-offs in the response to irradiance and water availability at the regeneration stage.
   circle Survival and growth patterns across an experimentally imposed irradiance gradient (1, 6, 20 and 100% sunlight) were studied in seedlings of eight Mediterranean woody species, together with the impact of a simulated summer drought.
   circle We found evidence of some of the trade-offs previously reported for non-Mediterranean plant communities, such as between survival in the shade and relative growth rate (RGR) at high light, but no evidence for others, such as between shade and drought tolerances. The impact of drought on survival and RGR was stronger in high light than in deep shade.
   circle The observed species-specific differences in performance provide a mechanistic basis for niche differentiation at the regeneration stage, contributing to possible explanations of species coexistence in Mediterranean ecosystems.

AB 1 Potential height, which spans at least an order of magnitude across species, is considered an important indicator of light capture strategy. Still, it remains unclear how potential height is coordinated with other traits that influence height growth rate, stem persistence and performance in low light. We proposed that contrasting correlations between potential height and other plant attributes would be observed for sets of species selected to span two hypothetical axes of light availability within mature forest and time since disturbance.
   2 We selected 45 perennial rain forest species in Australia's wet tropics to span gradients of light availability and successional status and measured potential height together with traits influencing light capture and regeneration strategy on mature individuals. The traits included leaf mass per area, leaf nitrogen, wood density, stem mass per length, branch mass fraction and seed mass.
   3 Potential height was significantly correlated with numerous traits among species selected to span each of the two gradients. Height was positively correlated with leaf mass area(-1), leaf nitrogen and seed mass and negatively correlated with leaf area ratio at the branch tip along both light and successional gradients. Height was positively correlated with wood density along the successional axis, with the opposite relationship along the light gradient.
   4 Trait relationships differed in either slope or intercept between the two gradients, reflecting different strategic trade-offs. At a given height, shorter species in the successional gradient were characterized by lower leaf mass area(-1), lighter wood, smaller seeds, lower leaf nitrogen and lower leaf area ratio at the branch tip than similar sized species along the light gradient.
   5 The results of this study support the idea of two distinct, trait-mediated axes of coexistence among short and tall plant species within vegetation. In several cases, trait relationships were weak or non-significant when species groupings were merged, indicating the importance of separating out the two sets for comparative studies.

AB 1 The environmental conditions of a site are thought to influence its invasibility by exotic plants. We tested the effects of physical disturbance, water and nutrient addition on growth and survival of a total of 28 plant species from urban bushland remnants on low fertility Hawkesbury Sandstone soils in Sydney, Australia. Species were classified as native (to Australia, including the local community) or exotic (from outside Australia) and as non-invasive or invasive.
   2 In a glasshouse experiment the treatments were control (natural soil), added water, added nutrients and added water and nutrients. We found significant differences in response of the plant types to additional nutrients but not to water. Under additional nutrients, exotic invasive species had better survival than all other plant types. There were strong biomass responses to added nutrients for all plant types except native non-invasives. In contrast, the survival and growth of all plant types were similar under control and additional water treatments.
   3 In a field experiment the factors were site (high and low nutrient soils) and physical disturbance but survival differed between plant types only in relation to site. Exotic species had much better survival than native species at the high nutrient site only. Exotic invasive species had the strongest biomass responses to the high nutrient site while native and exotic non-invasive species showed relatively smaller growth responses.
   4 Differences between invasive and non-invasive plants were not consistent between exotic and native species. Exotic invasives had greater survival than exotic non-invasives under high nutrient conditions in both experiments, and only exotic invasives showed consistently strong biomass responses to nutrient addition. For native species, there were no differences between invasives and non-invasives in survival in high nutrient conditions in the glasshouse or field; however, only invasive species showed a positive growth response to high nutrient conditions.
   5 This study provides clear evidence that the success of exotic invasive species in this low fertility vegetation community is facilitated by the addition of nutrients. It would appear that on relatively infertile (particularly phosphorus-limited) sites, invasive species cannot take advantage of additional resources provided by physical disturbance or water addition due to overwhelming nutrient-limitation. We suggest that a combination of the environmental conditions (nutrient-enrichment) and invading species having traits that allow high survival and faster growth in response to nutrients, may allow successful invasion in Hawkesbury Sandstone communities.

AB Current research efforts to understand the relative invasibility of different plant communities have mostly ignored tropical forests. Only a few studies have treated invasive species in tropical forests, and recent worldwide analyses have not provided clear predictions concerning the relative invasibility of tropical forests. In this review, the extent to which exotic species have invaded tropical forests is summarized and four leading hypotheses to explain the apparently low frequency of invading plants in tropical forests are evaluated. In general, it is found that invasibility positively correlates with human disturbance, and that undisturbed tropical forests harbour few exotic species. To date, there is no evidence to attribute the low invasibility of undisturbed tropical forests to either their high species diversity or their high diversity of functional types. Instead, the low occurrence of exotic species in most tropical forests is most likely due to the fact that the great majority of exotic species that are transported to tropical countries lack specific life history traits, most importantly shade tolerance, necessary for successful invasion of undisturbed tropical forests. Unfortunately, this situation could change in the future with the expected increase in the plantation forestry of high-grade timber combined with common forestry practices that favour the cultivation of exotic species.

AB Among the factors threatening the Iberian lynx, (Lynx pardinus) (the most endangered species of all the Felidae), loss and fragmentation of its habitats are probably the most important. Connectivity between the remaining populations in the predominantly fragmented landscapes is a key factor in the dynamics and persistence of metapopulations. Based on the data collected during a long-term study on the ecology of this species in a small and fragmented population in SW Spain, I analyse the factors affecting connectivity between the two main sources and the rest of local populations. Connectivity was estimated as the proportion of dispersers from a source that reached a given subpopulation. Among the explanatory variables considered, only distance (both straight and effective distance, which takes into account habitat quality between local populations) and location of the source were clearly related to connectivity. Some other variables describing landscape features separating sources and target subpopulations (proportion of unsuitable habitats, patch cohesion, size of targets, overall size of subpopulations closer than the target) were not related to connectivity. Differences in the landscape surrounding sources help to explain the different connectivity from the two sources. An asymmetrical connectivity between the two sources and populations surrounding them (north and south) is likely explained by the configuration of habitats encountered by dispersers, which force those from one source to behave as crossers of unsuitable habitats. These results have consequences for the conservation of Iberian lynx populations and for ecologically similar species. Distance, the factor most affecting connectivity, is difficult to manage, although at least size and configuration of usable patches can be modified. Connectivity could also be improved through recovery of habitats with cover, suitable for dispersing. Reduction of mortality risks would also enhance connectivity indirectly, by allowing longer times and larger areas covered during dispersal. In the case of the study population, it is urgent to promote connectivity with other Iberian lynx populations due to genetic consequences of small population size and effective isolation.

AB One approach to ecosystem management is to emulate the effects of natural disturbance in producing landscape patterns; this approach requires a spatial analysis of the pattern and an understanding of the processes producing the pattern. Forested landscapes exhibit mosaic patterns of both stand types and ages. This study investigates the spatial mosaic of stand ages produced by high-intensity stand-replacing fires in the mixed-wood boreal forest of western Canada. A high-resolution, accurately dated, time-since-fire map for a large (3461 km(2)) contiguous area is used to produce the landscape survivorship distribution in which both spatial and temporal changes in fire cycle are statistically tested. Spatial multivariate analysis of the time-since-fire map is also used to investigate the spatial assembly of the age mosaic. Significant changes in fire cycle can be explained by climatic change as well as land use change in the surrounding area. The shift from a shore (15 yr) fire cycle to a longer (75 yr) cycle after 1890 in the northern half of the study area coincides with climatic change at the end of the Little Ice Age. In the southern half of the study area, the short fire cycle continues after 1890 due to the spread of human-caused fires from the adjacent area which was settled and cleared for agriculture during the first half of the 20th century. Upon completion of settlement in 1945, the fire cycle becomes significantly longer due to the fragmentation of the once continuous forest that surrounded the study area and from which the majority of large fires propagated in the past. The different fire cycle histories of the two parts of the study area also explain the spatial mosaic pattern of stand ages, sizes, and shapes. The extended period of the short fire cycle through the first half of this century in the southern region results in it being dominated by younger, larger, oblong-shaped polygons with irregular edges: characteristics that describe the shapes of large burns. The northern region has generally older and smaller, more circular, compact polygons that are the remnants of larger much earlier burns that have since been overburned. The polygons in the northern region are more similar in size and shape but less similar in age to adjacent polygons than are those in the southern region. Thus, this study shows how spatial heterogeneity in the landscape mosaic pattern can be characterized and related to the disturbance history of an area. Furthermore, it provides evidence of the impacts on the age mosaic due to forest fragmentation in surrounding areas.

AB Predation on artificial nests was studied in Belgian deciduous forest fragments between 1 and 20() ha. Predation rates were compared to fragment size, distance from the forest edge, time period (three replicates), and nest type (ground and tree). Logistic regression analysis showed that overall nest predation did not vary with distance from the edge, forest size, and time period. Birds represented over 70% of all predator attacks but their importance decreased in larger areas and away from the forest edge where mammals were responsible for much of the nest predation. It is concluded that the effect of habitat fragmentation depends on the composition of the local predator community.

ID NATIONAL-PARK; PATTERN
AB Age determination of post-fire forests and the analysis of fire scars on surviving trees have allowed for the historical reconstruction and mapping of fires in a forest area of 11 715 ha in northwestern Quebec, south of Lake Abitibi. Most of the study area was burnt by two large fires (>1000 ha) in 1760 and 1923. All the other fires recorded (1797, 1823, 1870, 1907, 1919) were smaller in extent and occurred in a restricted part (1984 ha) of the study area, characterized by the fragmentation of the forest landscape by water bodies. The compilation of data concerning area burnt per type of surficial material confirms that the physical environment exerts a stronger control on the delimitation of these smaller fires. The data do not allow for the estimation of the fire cycle owing to the small size of the study area and possible temporal changes during the observation period.

AB The gut microbiome is emerging as an important factor in regulating mental health yet it remains unclear what the target should be for psychiatric treatment. We aimed to elucidate the complement of the gutmicrobiome community for individuals with bipolar disorder relative to controls; and test for relationships with burden of disease measures. We compared the stool microbiome from individuals with bipolar disorder (n = 115) and control subjects (n = 64) using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence analysis. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed global community case-control differences (AMOVA p = 0.047). Operational Taxonomical Unit (OTU) level analysis revealed significantly decreased fractional representation (p < 0.001) of Faecalibacterium after adjustment for age, sex, BMI and false discovery rate (FDR) correction at the p < 0.05 level. Within individuals with bipolar disorder, the fractional representation of Faecalibacterium associated with better self-reported health outcomes based on the Short Form Health Survey (SF12); the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9); the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD7); and the Altman Mania Rating Scale (ASRM), independent of covariates. This study provides the first detailed analysis of the gut microbiome relationships with multiple psychiatric domains from a bipolar population. The data support the hypothesis that targeting the microbiome may be an effective treatment paradigm for bipolar disorder. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over half of the world's forests are disturbed, and the rate at which ecosystem processes recover after disturbance is important for the services these forests can provide. We analyze the drivers' underlying changes in rates of key ecosystem processes (biomass productivity, litter productivity, actual litter decomposition, and potential litter decomposition) during secondary succession after shifting cultivation in wet tropical forest of Mexico.
   We test the importance of three alternative drivers of ecosystem processes: vegetation biomass (vegetation quantity hypothesis), community-weighted trait mean (mass ratio hypothesis), and functional diversity (niche complementarity hypothesis) using structural equation modeling. This allows us to infer the relative importance of different mechanisms underlying ecosystem process recovery.
   Ecosystem process rates changed during succession, and the strongest driver was aboveground biomass for each of the processes. Productivity of aboveground stem biomass and leaf litter as well as actual litter decomposition increased with initial standing vegetation biomass, whereas potential litter decomposition decreased with standing biomass. Additionally, biomass productivity was positively affected by community-weighted mean of specific leaf area, and potential decomposition was positively affected by functional divergence, and negatively by community-weighted mean of leaf dry matter content.
   Our empirical results show that functional diversity and community-weighted means are of secondary importance for explaining changes in ecosystem process rates during tropical forest succession. Instead, simply, the amount of vegetation in a site is the major driver of changes, perhaps because there is a steep biomass buildup during succession that overrides more subtle effects of community functional properties on ecosystem processes. We recommend future studies in the field of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning to separate the effects of vegetation quality (community-weighted mean trait values and functional diversity) from those of vegetation quantity (biomass) on ecosystem processes and services.

AB Conditions fish encounter during embryogenesis and early life history can leave lasting effects not only on morphology, but also on growth rate, life-history and behavioural traits. The ecology of offspring can be affected by conditions experienced by their parents and mother in particular. This review summarizes such early impacts and their ecological influences for a variety of teleost species, but with special reference to salmonids. Growth and adult body size, sex ratio, egg size, lifespan and tendency to migrate can all be affected by early influences. Mechanisms behind such phenotypically plastic impacts are not well known, but epigenetic change appears to be one central mechanism. The thermal regime during development and incubation is particularly important, but also early food consumption and intraspecific density can all be responsible for later life-history variation. For behavioural traits, early experiences with effects on brain, sensory development and cognition appear essential. This may also influence boldness and other social behaviours such as mate choice. At the end of the review, several issues and questions for future studies are given. (C) 2014 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles

AB The benefits of protected areas (PAs) for biodiversity have been questioned in the context of climate change because PAs are static, whereas the distributions of species are dynamic. Current PAs may, however, continue to be important if they provide suitable locations for species to colonize at their leading-edge range boundaries, thereby enabling spread into new regions. Here, we present an empirical assessment of the role of PAs as targets for colonization during recent range expansions. Records from intensive surveys revealed that seven bird and butterfly species have colonized PAs 4.2 (median) times more frequently than expected from the availability of PAs in the landscapes colonized. Records of an additional 256 invertebrate species with less-intensive surveys supported these findings and showed that 98% of species are disproportionately associated with PAs in newly colonized parts of their ranges. Although colonizing species favor PAs in general, species vary greatly in their reliance on PAs, reflecting differences in the dependence of individual species on particular habitats and other conditions that are available only in PAs. These findings highlight the importance of current PAs for facilitating range expansions and show that a small subset of the landscape receives a high proportion of colonizations by range-expanding species.

AB The evolutionary dissimilarity between communities (phylogenetic beta diversity PBD) has been increasingly explored by ecologists and biogeographers to assess the relative roles of ecological and evolutionary processes in structuring natural communities. Among PBD measures, the PhyloSor and UniFrac indices have been widely used to assess the level of turnover of lineages over geographical and environmental gradients. However, these indices can be considered as 'broad-sense' measures of phylogenetic turnover as they incorporate different aspects of differences in evolutionary history between communities that may be attributable to phylogenetic diversity gradients. In the present study, we extend an additive partitioning framework proposed for compositional beta diversity to PBD. Specifically, we decomposed the PhyloSor and UniFrac indices into two separate components accounting for 'true' phylogenetic turnover and phylogenetic diversity gradients, respectively. We illustrated the relevance of this framework using simple theoretical and archetypal examples, as well as an empirical study based on coral reef fish communities. Overall, our results suggest that using PhyloSor and UniFrac may greatly over-estimate the level of spatial turnover of lineages if the two compared communities show contrasting levels of phylogenetic diversity. We therefore recommend that future studies use the 'true' phylogenetic turnover component of these indices when the studied communities encompass a large phylogenetic diversity gradient.

AB Hybrids between species provide information about the evolutionary processes involved in divergence. In addition to creating hybrids in the laboratory, biologists can take advantage of natural hybrid zones to understand the factors that shape gene flow between divergent lineages. In the early stages of speciation, most regions of the genome continue to flow freely between populations. Alternatively, the subset of the genome that confers reproductive barriers between nascent species is expected to reject introgression. Now enabled by advances in genomics, this perspective is motivating detailed comparisons of gene flow across genomic regions in hybrid zones. Here, I review methods for measuring and interpreting introgression at multiple loci in hybrid zones, focusing on the problem of identifying loci that contribute to reproductive isolation. Emerging patterns from multi-locus studies of hybrid zones are highlighted, including remarkable variance in introgression across the genome. Although existing methods have been useful, there is scope for development of new analytical approaches that better connect differential patterns of gene flow in hybrid zones with current knowledge of speciation mechanisms. I outline future prospects for differential introgression studies on a genomic scale.

AB Autosomal dominant mutations in leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the presence of multiple domains, the kinase activity of LRRK2 is thought to represent the primary function of the protein. Alterations in LRRK2 kinase activity are thought to underlie the pathogenesis of its PD-linked mutations; however, many questions regarding basic aspects of LRRK2 function remain unclear, including the cellular mechanisms of LRRK2 regulation and the importance of its unique distribution within the cell. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the subcellular localization of wild-type LRRK2 is associated with changes in four distinct biochemical properties likely crucial for LRRK2 function. Our data demonstrate for the first time that the wild-type LRRK2 dimer possesses greater kinase activity than its more abundant monomeric counterpart. Importantly, we show that this activated form of LRRK2 is substantially enriched at the membrane of cells expressing endogenous or exogenous LRRK2, and that the membrane-associated fraction of LRRK2 likewise possesses greater kinase activity than cytosolic LRRK2. In addition, membrane-associated LRRK2 binds GTP more efficiently than cytosolic LRRK2 but demonstrates a lower degree of phosphorylation. Our observations suggest that multiple events, including altered protein protein interactions and post-translational modifications, contribute to the regulation of LRRK2 function, through modulation of membrane association and complex assembly. These Findings may have implications for the sites of LRRK2 function within the cell, the identification and localization of bona fide LRRK2 substrates, and efforts to design small molecule inhibitors of LRRK2.

AB Drought- and insect-associated tree mortality at low-elevation ecotones is a widespread phenomenon but the underlying mechanisms are uncertain. Enhanced growth sensitivity to climate is widely observed among trees that die, indicating that a predisposing physiological mechanism(s) underlies tree mortality. We tested three, linked hypotheses regarding mortality using a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) elevation transect that experienced low-elevation mortality following prolonged drought. The hypotheses were: (1) mortality was associated with greater growth sensitivity to climate, (2) mortality was associated with greater sensitivity of gas exchange to climate, and (3) growth and gas exchange were correlated. Support for all three hypotheses would indicate that mortality results at least in part from gas exchange constraints. We assessed growth using basal area increment normalized by tree basal area [basal area increment (BAI)/basal area (BA)] to account for differences in tree size. Whole-crown gas exchange was indexed via estimates of the CO2 partial pressure difference between leaf and atmosphere (p(a)-p(c)) derived from tree ring carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13), corrected for temporal trends in atmospheric CO2 and delta C-13 and elevation trends in pressure. Trees that survived the drought exhibited strong correlations among and between BAI, BAI/BA, p(a)-p(c), and climate. In contrast, trees that died exhibited greater growth sensitivity to climate than trees that survived, no sensitivity of p(a)-p(c) to climate, and a steep relationship between p(a)-p(c) and BAI/BA. The p(a)-p(c) results are consistent with predictions from a theoretical hydraulic model, suggesting trees that died had a limited buffer between mean water availability during their lifespan and water availability during drought - i.e., chronic water stress. It appears that chronic water stress predisposed low-elevation trees to mortality during drought via constrained gas exchange. Continued intensification of drought in mid-latitude regions may drive increased mortality and ecotone shifts in temperate forests and woodlands.

AB The factors regulating the structure of food webs are a central focus of community and ecosystem ecology, as trophic interactions among species have important impacts on nutrient storage and cycling in many ecosystems. For soil invertebrates in grassland ecosystems in the Netherlands, the site-specific slopes of the faunal biomass to organism body mass relationships reflected basic biochemical and biogeochemical processes associated with soil acidity and soil C:N:P stoichiometry. That is, the higher the phosphorus availability in the soil, the higher, on average, the slope of the faunal biomass size spectrum (i.e., the higher the biomass of large-bodied invertebrates relative to the biomass of small invertebrates). While other factors may also be involved, these results are consistent with the growth rate hypothesis from biological stoichiometry that relates phosphorus demands to ribosomal RNA and protein production. Thus our data represent the first time that ecosystem phosphorus availability has been associated with allometry in soil food webs ( supporting information available online). Our results have broad implications, as soil invertebrates of different size have different effects on soil processes.

AB Bottom trawling has widespread impacts on benthic communities and habitats. While the direct impacts of trawl disturbances on benthic communities have been extensively studied, the consequences from long-term chronic disturbances are less well understood. The response of benthic macrofauna to chronic otter-trawl disturbance from a Nephrops norvegicus (Norway lobster) fishery was investigated along a gradient of fishing intensity over a muddy fishing ground in the northeastern Irish Sea. Chronic otter trawling had a significant, negative effect on benthic infauna abundance, biomass, and species richness. Benthic epifauna abundance and species richness also showed a significant, negative response, while no such effect was evident for epibenthic biomass. Furthermore, chronic trawl disturbance led to clear changes in community composition of benthic infauna and epifauna. The results presented indicate that otter-trawl impacts are cumulative and can lead to profound changes in benthic communities, which may have far-reaching implications for the integrity of marine food webs. Studies investigating the short-term effects of fishing manipulations previously concluded that otter trawling on muddy substrates had only modest effects on the benthic biota. Hence, the results presented by this study highlight that data from experimental studies can not be readily extrapolated to an ecosystem level and that subtle cumulative effects may only become apparent when fishing disturbances are examined over larger spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, this study shows that data on chronic effects of bottom trawling on the benthos will be vital in informing the recently advocated move toward an ecosystem approach in fisheries management. As bottom-trawl fisheries are expanding into ever deeper muddy habitats, the results presented here are an important step toward understanding the global ecosystem effects of bottom trawling.

AB Colonial seabirds are relatively easy to observe, count, measure and manipulate, and consequently have long been used as models for testing ecological hypotheses. A combination of animal tracking and satellite imagery has the potential to greatly inform such efforts, by allowing seabird-environment interactions to be observed remotely. We review how this can be achieved by applying innovative statistical techniques to quantify habitat use and preferences. Seabird movements are now observable at scales of meters using GPS loggers, and up to several years using light-based geolocation, while satellite remote sensing systems, at resolutions of km, are capable of characterizing the millions of km(2) of habitat that are accessible to seabirds. Physical forcing and biological processes result in a hierarchical, patchy distribution of prey. Hence, analyses of seabird movements should be conducted at appropriate scales. Variation in habitat accessibility should also be considered: this declines with distance from the colony during the breeding season, when seabirds are central place foragers, and may be limited in the nonbreeding period by migration corridors that are defined by wind patterns. Intraspecific competition can further modify spatial usage, leading to spatial segregation of birds foraging from different colonies. We recommend that spatial usage be modeled as a function of habitat preference, accessibility and, potentially, competition. At the population level, this is currently best achieved using an empirical approach (e.g. using mixed-effects generalized additive models), At the individual level, more mechanistic models (e.g. state-space models) are more appropriate and have the advantage of modeling location errors explicitly.

AB The study of Quaternary environmental change is directly applicable to on-going issues of global conservation. Palaeoecological research techniques provide the tools to address some of the key questions presently being asked by conservation ecologists and land management organizations. But is this type of analysis currently being utilized to its full potential? Are the results of palaeoenvironmental analyses routinely applied to practical issues of natural resource management, and if not what can be done to expand the application of this research within the conservation community? This paper reviews recent developments in the application of the analysis of late Quaternary environmental change to key environmental issues of biodiversity and conservation management and examines areas which could be strengthened in the future including: (i) determination of baselines and natural ecosystem variability; (ii) understanding ecological thresholds and resilience; (iii) climate change conservation strategies; (iv) biological invasions; and (v) conservation and culture.

AB Human development often favors species adapted to human conditions with subsequent negative effects on sensitive species. This is occurring throughout the urbanizing world as increases by generalist omnivores, like some crows and ravens (corvids) threaten other birds with increased rates of nest predation. The process of corvid responses and their actual effects on other species is only vaguely understood, so we quantified the population response of radio-tagged American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos), common ravens (Corvus corax), and Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) to human settlements and campgrounds and examined their influence as nest predators on simulated marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) nests on Washington's Olympic Peninsula from 1995 to 2000. The behavior and demography of crows, ravens, and jays was correlated to varying degrees with proximity to human development. Crows and ravens had smaller home ranges and higher reproduction near human settlements and recreation. Annual survival of crows was positively associated with proximity to human development. Home range and reproduction of Steller's jays was independent of proximity to human settlements and campgrounds. Local density of crows increased because home ranges of neighboring breeding pairs overlapped extensively (6x more than ravens and 3x more than Steller's jays) and breeders far from anthropogenic foods traveled 10s of kilometers to access them. Corvids accounted for 32.5% of the predation events (n = 837) we documented on artificial murrelet nests. Small corvids (jays) were common nest predators across our study area but their contribution as predators did not vary with proximity to settlements and campgrounds. in contrast, large corvids (crows and ravens) were rare nest predators across our study area but their contribution varied greatly with proximity to settlements and campgrounds. Managers seeking to reduce the risk of nest predation need to consider the varied impacts and variable behavioral and population responses of potential nest predators. In our situation, removing large corvids may do little to reduce overall rates of nest predation because of the diverse predator assemblage, but reducing anthropogenic food in the landscape may be effective.

ID BERGMANNS RULE; MAMMALS; BIRDS; DIFFERENTIATION
AB Latitudinal trends in body size have been explained as a response to temperature- or water-related factors, which are predictors of primary production. We used the first principal component calculated from three body parameters (weight, body length and the greatest length of the skull) of a sample of mammals from Israel and Sinai to determine those species that vary in size geographically, and whether such variation is related to annual rainfall, average minimum January temperature and average maximum August temperature. We used a conservative approach to discern the effects of precipitation and temperature by applying sequential regression. Variable priorities were assigned according to their bivariate correlation with body size, except for rainfall and its interactions that entered into the model last. Eleven species (Acomys cahirinus, Apodemus mystacinus, Canis lupus, Crocidura suaveolens, Gerbillus dasyurus, Hyaena hyaena, Lepus capensis, Meles meles, Meriones tristrami, Rousettus aegyptius and Vulpes vulpes) of the 17 species examined varied in size geographically. In five of them, rainfall was positively related to body size, while in one species it was negatively related to it. Contrary to the prediction of Bergmann's rule, mean minimum January temperature was positively related to body size in five species and negatively related to body size in two species (C. suaveolens and G. dasyurus). As predicted by Bergmann's rule, maximum June temperature was negatively related to body size in three species, and positively so in one (L. capensis). Primary production, particularly in desert and semi-desert areas, is determined mainly by precipitation. The above results indicate that, in our sample, primary production has an important effect on body size of several species of mammals. This is evident from the considerable proportion of

ID PHAKOPSORA-PACHYRHIZI; DISPERSAL; TEMPERATURE; EPIDEMICS; SPORES
AB Aerial transport alone is seldom responsible for the introduction of nonindigenous species into distant regions, however, the capacity to use the atmospheric pathway for rapid spread in large part determines the invasive potential of organisms once they are introduced. Because physical and biological features of Earth's surface influence the routes and timing of organisms that use the atmospheric pathway, long-distance movement of aerobiota is largely regular and thus predictable. Soybean rust (Phakopsora pachyrhizi), potentially the most destructive foliar disease of soybean, recently invaded North America. The concepts presented in this article form the basis of the soybean rust acrobiology prediction system (SRAPS) that was developed to assess potential pathogen movement from South America to the United States. Output from SRAPS guided the scouting operations after the initial discovery of soybean rust in Louisiana. Subsequent observations of P. pachyrhizi in the southeastern United States provide validation of the modeling effort.

AB Habitat constrains and shapes successful ecological and physiological strategies and thus provides the context for the evolution of life-history traits. The stress axis plays a vital role in the endocrine system and is a critical component adapting mammals to particular habitat pressures. It is subject to both individual activational and organizational plasticity as well as to evolutionary modification. To illustrate, I examine the suite of traits of the stress axis associated with breeding frequency in male mammals, which varies in a continuum from semelparity to iteroparity. During the breeding season, males in species at the semelparous end of the continuum exhibit high concentrations of free corticosteroids, low concentrations of glucocorticoid-binding protein, a failure of the negative feedback system, a gonadal axis that is not inhibited by high corticosteroid concentrations, and immunosuppression. Iteroparous species exhibit the opposite traits. The evolutionary constraints selecting for the former may partially be related to phylogeny (in marsupials) as well as to an interaction of the restrictions imposed by the environment on female reproduction, the mating system, the high costs of reproduction, and the low adult survival during the nonbreeding season.

   INTERACTIONS; HABITAT SEGREGATION
AB The field study of food webs and the processes maintaining them is hampered by the sheer complexity and unreplicated nature of natural systems. The animal communities in phytotelmata-plant-held waters-are a convenient exception to this generalization. Tree holes, bamboo internodes, pitcher plants, tank bromeliads, and water-retaining plant axils contain a rich fauna, principally of arthropods, which constitute more or less complex, highly discrete food webs. They are widespread and replicated. The explanations for the community structure observed in these systems may call on "bottom-up" mechanisms such as simple environmental limitations, competition, predation, and facilitation, or they may adduce grander "top-down" theories, which explore biogeographic, energetic, dynamic, or biodiversity-related constraints. The existence of the bottom-up mechanisms is well established in experimental systems, and their consequences may be apparent in naturally occurring food webs. Top-down mechanisms demand a more holistic approach and are more difficult to test either by pattern analysis or experimental manipulation. The synoptic explanation of community composition and structure demands a multidimensional approach best expressed as a heuristic "template." Phytotelmata represent nearly ideal natural instruments for further study of food web dynamics, and exciting opportunities exist for the development and testing of community theories through their manipulation.

AB A diatom-based calibration model for predicting summer temperatures was developed using climatically sensitive subarctic lakes in northern Fennoscandia. The model was applied to a sediment core from a treeline lake to infer trends in Holocene climate. The record exhibits long-term variations, as well as a series of shorter-term fluctuations on a time scale of centuries. Summers were warmest in the area about 6200 cal yr B.P. and featured distinct cooling episodes around 8300, 7200, 4200, 3000, and 400 cal yr B.P., most of these coinciding with some known climate events (e.g., the 8200 cal yr B.P. event and the Little Ice Age). The similarity of the observed shifts with the pacings of climate events from marine and ice-core records represents evidence for coupled ocean-atmosphere forcing of the regional climate.

AB Evaluation of the ecosystem effects of fishing presupposes that it is possible to measure the state of an ecosystem, detect differences among measures of its state, and determine if the differences are due to chance or impacts of fishing. Ecologists have developed or adopted four main classes of community/ecosystem metrics For such tasks: diversity and similarity indices, ordination methods, metrics of aggregate community properties. and metrics derived from ecosystem models. Each class is explained briefly, and guidance is given to the Literature. Size spectra, k-dominance curves, and multidimensional scaling emerge as promising methods for these uses. Some modelling frameworks also may be useful, but more work is needed on sensitivity testing and development of independent theory for these models. The current theoretical basis for most ecosystem models assumes that competition structures the system bring modelled. Problems with applying that framework to exploited marine systems are reviewed. Resampling methods are essential when testing for differences among community metrics. Practices for determining causality when ecosystem metrics change are reviewed, and additional knowledge and data necessary to link change to cause are highlighted.

AB Bird abundance trends have been correlated with habitat changes in urban developed areas but have seldom been associated with specific patterns of urban-related habitat changes. We examined breeding bird-habitat relationships in 334 random plots ranging from undisturbed natural to highly developed land in Tucson, Arizona. In each plot we quantified 19 variables describing three land cover patterns (habitat physiognomy, floristics, and spatial relationships of native habitat fragments) and correlated them with abundances of 21 bird species. Abundances of 17 bird species were associated with variables describing land cover pattern. In addition, we correlated abundance, species richness, and evenness for three bird guilds (non-natives, natives, and a native indicator guild) with land cover variables. Housing density best explained the variation in species richness for both the non-native (r(2) = 0.79) and the indicator guilds (r(2) = -0.69), whereas area of Upland Sonoran vegetative cover (r(2) = 0.56) and distance from undisturbed washes (r(2) = -0.56) correlated most strongly with the native-bird group. Finally, we developed and tested regression models predicting species richness for each bird guild. The following variables loaded into the predictive models: house density; percentage cover of paved areas; exotic, Upland Sonoran, and undisturbed riparian vegetation; and distance from undisturbed washes. The models explained 71% of the variation in non-native bird species richness, 56% of the variation in native bird species richness, and 60% of the variation in species richness for the indicator guild of birds. The correlations and regression models can be used to predict species richness responses to future residential development in the Tucson area.

AB 1 Forest species in West Africa show clear distribution patterns in relation to the principal rainfall gradient and associated soil fertility gradient in the region. The distribution of each species presumably reflects environmental limitation of seedling establishment, but the segregation of seasonal drought or soil conditions as controlling factors is obscured because soil nutrient availability and rainfall strongly covary.
   2 Frequency of occurrence of individual species in four categories based on rainfall and a composite fertility variable are compared with the distribution of all samples. Four possible groups of species are identified, each showing a bias to one of the four site categories: dry-fertile, wet-fertile, dry-infertile and wet-infertile. A fifth group of species include those whose distribution is not significantly different from that of all sample sites.
   3 Apart from the indifferent species, the wet-infertile group includes the majority of the tree species tested, including two ectomycorrhizal legumes; the wet and dry fertile groups are notable for the inclusion of deciduous Sterculiaceae. No species were found to be significantly biased to the inhospitable dry-infertile forests, which are composed principally of species with widespread distribution.
   4 Experiments are proposed to test the drought tolerance and soil nutrient sensitivity of species implied by these results.

AB Sequence capture and restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) are two genomic enrichment strategies for applying next-generation sequencing technologies to systematics studies. At shallow timescales, such as within species, RAD-Seq has been widely adopted among researchers, although there has been little discussion of the potential limitations and benefits of RAD-Seq and sequence capture. We discuss a series of issues that may impact the utility of sequence capture and RAD-Seq data for shallow systematics in non-model species. We review prior studies that used both methods, and investigate differences between the methods by re-analyzing existing RAD-Seq and sequence capture data sets from a Neotropical bird (Xenops minutus). We suggest that the strengths of RAD-Seq data sets for shallow systematics are the wide dispersion of markers across the genome, the relative ease and cost of laboratory work, the deep coverage and read overlap at recovered loci, and the high overall information that results. Sequence capture's benefits include flexibility and repeatability in the genomic regions targeted, success using low-quality samples, more straightforward read orthology assessment, and higher per-locus information content. The utility of a method in systematics, however, rests not only on its performance within a study, but on the comparability of data sets and inferences with those of prior work. In RAD-Seq data sets, comparability is compromised by low overlap of orthologous markers across species and the sensitivity of genetic diversity in a data set to an interaction between the level of natural heterozygosity in the samples examined and the parameters used for orthology assessment. In contrast, sequence capture of conserved genomic regions permits interrogation of the same loci across divergent species, which is preferable for maintaining comparability among data sets and studies for the purpose of drawing general conclusions about the impact of historical processes across biotas. We argue that sequence capture should be given greater attention as a method of obtaining data for studies in shallow systematics and comparative phylogeography.

AB Many crops display differential geographic phenotypes and sensorial signatures, encapsulated by the concept of terroir. The drivers behind these differences remain elusive, and the potential contribution of microbes has been ignored until recently. Significant genetic differentiation between microbial communities and populations from different geographic locations has been demonstrated, but crucially it has not been shown whether this correlates with differential agricultural phenotypes or not. Using wine as a model system, we utilize the regionally genetically differentiated population of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in New Zealand and objectively demonstrate that these populations differentially affect wine phenotype, which is driven by a complex mix of chemicals. These findings reveal the importance of microbial populations for the regional identity of wine, and potentially extend to other important agricultural commodities. Moreover, this suggests that long-term implementation of methods maintaining differential biodiversity may have tangible economic imperatives as well as being desirable in terms of employing agricultural practices that increase responsible environmental stewardship.

AB Environmental gradients may influence a plant's physiological status and morphology, which in turn may affect plantplant interactions. However, little is known about the relationship between environmental variation, physiological and morphological variability of plants and variation in the balance between competition and facilitation. Mountain ranges in dry environments have opposing altitudinal environmental gradients of temperature and aridity, which limit plant growth at high and low elevations. This makes them particularly suitable for exploring the relationships between environmental conditions, plant phenotype and plantplant interactions. We hypothesized that different environmental stressors will differently affect the physiological status of a nurse plant. This, then, manifests itself as variation in nurse plant morphological traits, which in turn mediates plantplant interactions by altering microhabitat conditions for the nurse and associated species. In an observational study, we measured a series of functional traits of Arenaria tetraquetra cushions as indicators of its physiological status (e.g. specific leaf area, relative water content) and morphology (e.g. cushion compactness, size). Measurements were taken along the entire elevation range where A.tetraquetra occurs. Furthermore, we analysed how these functional traits related to soil properties beneath cushions and the number of associated species and individuals compared with open areas. Cushions at high elevation showed good physiological status; they were compact and large, had higher soil water and organic matter content compared with open areas and showed the strongest facilitation effect of the whole elevation gradient that is, the highest increase in species richness and abundance of beneficiaries compared with open areas. Physiological data at low elevation indicated stressful abiotic conditions for A.tetraquetra, which formed loose and small cushions. These cushions showed less improved soil conditions and had reduced facilitative effects compared with those at high elevation. Synthesis. Functional traits of the nurse species varied distinctively along the two opposing stress gradients, in parallel to the magnitude of differences in microenvironmental conditions between cushions and the surrounding open area, and also to the facilitation effect of cushions. Our data, therefore, provides a strong demonstration of the generally overlooked importance of a nurse plant's vigour and morphology for its facilitative effects.

AB Heritable genetic variation is required for evolution, and while typically encoded within nuclear and organellar genomes, several groups of invertebrates harbour heritable microbes serving as additional sources of genetic variation. Hailing from the symbiont-rich insect order Hemiptera, pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) possess several heritable symbionts with roles in host plant utilization, thermotolerance and protection against natural enemies. As pea aphids vary in the numbers and types of harboured symbionts, these bacteria provide heritable and functionally important variation within field populations. In this study, we quantified the cytoplasmically inherited genetic variation contributed by symbionts within North American pea aphids. Through the use of Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and 454 amplicon pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes, we explored the diversity of bacteria harboured by pea aphids from five populations, spanning three locations and three host plants. We also characterized strain variation by analysing 16S rRNA, housekeeping and symbiont-associated bacteriophage genes. Our results identified eight species of facultative symbionts, which often varied in frequency between locations and host plants. We detected 28 cytoplasmic genotypes across 318 surveyed aphids, considering only the various combinations of secondary symbiont species infecting single hosts. Yet the detection of multiple Regiella insecticola, Hamiltonella defensa and Rickettsia strains, and diverse bacteriophage genotypes from H.defensa, suggest even greater diversity. Combined, these findings reveal that heritable bacteria contribute substantially to genetic variation in A.pisum. Given the costs and benefits of these symbionts, it is likely that fluctuating selective forces play a role in the maintenance of this diversity.

AB A central challenge to studying emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) is a landscape dilemma: Our best empirical understanding of disease dynamics occurs at local scales, whereas pathogen invasions and management occur over broad spatial extents. The burgeoning field of landscape epidemiology integrates concepts and approaches from disease ecology with the macroscale lens of landscape ecology, enabling examination of disease across spatiotemporal scales in complex environmental settings. We review the state of the field and describe analytical frontiers that show promise for advancement, focusing on natural and human-altered ecosystems. Concepts fundamental to practicing landscape epidemiology are discussed, including spatial scale, static versus dynamic modeling, spatially implicit versus explicit approaches, selection of ecologically meaningful variables, and inference versus prediction. We highlight studies that have advanced the field by incorporating multiscale analyses, landscape connectivity, and dynamic modeling. Future research directions include understanding disease as a component of interacting ecological disturbances, scaling up the ecological impacts of disease, and examining disease dynamics as a coupled human-natural system.

AB Prey usually adjust anti-predator behavior to subtle variations in perceived risk. However, it is not clear whether adult large carnivores that are virtually free of natural predation adjust their behavior to subtle variations in human-derived risk, even when living in human-dominated landscapes. As a model, we studied resting-site selection by a large carnivore, the brown bear (Ursus arctos), under different spatial and temporal levels of human activity. We quantified horizontal and canopy cover at 440 bear beds and 439 random sites at different distances from human settlements, seasons, and times of the day. We hypothesized that beds would be more concealed than random sites and that beds would be more concealed in relation to human-derived risk. Although human densities in Scandinavia are the lowest within bear ranges in Western Europe, we found an effect of human activity; bears chose beds with higher horizontal and canopy cover during the day (0700-1900 hours), especially when resting closer to human settlements, than at night (2200-0600 hours). In summer/fall (the berry season), with more intensive and dispersed human activity, including hunting, bears rested further from human settlements during the day than in spring (pre-berry season). Additionally, day beds in the summer/fall were the most concealed. Large carnivores often avoid humans at a landscape scale, but total avoidance in human-dominated areas is not possible. Apparently, bears adjust their behavior to avoid human encounters, which resembles the way prey avoid their predators. Bears responded to fine-scale variations in human-derived risk, both on a seasonal and a daily basis.

AB Groundwater can serve as an important resource for woody vegetation in semiarid landscapes, particularly when soil water is functionally depleted and unavailable to plants. This study examines the uptake of groundwater by deciduous blue oak trees (Quercus douglasii) in a California oak savanna. Here we present a suite of direct and indirect methods that demonstrate its occurrence and quantify its rates. The study site is underlain by a thin soil layer and fractured metavolcanic bedrock. Typical depth to groundwater is approximately 8 m. A variety of water storage and flux measurements were collected from 2005 to 2008, including groundwater levels, soil moisture contents, sap flows, and latent heat fluxes. During the dry season, groundwater uptake rates ranged from 4 to 25 mm month(-1) and approximately 80% of total ET during June, July, and August came from groundwater. Leaf and soil water potentials supported these results, indicating that groundwater uptake was thermodynamically favorable over soil water uptake for key portions of the growing season. These findings strongly suggest that blue oaks should be considered obligate phreatophytes and that groundwater reserves provide a buffer to rapid changes in their hydroclimate, if these assets are not otherwise depleted by prolonged drought or human consumption. While groundwater uptake may provide for short-term protection, it should be viewed not as a mechanism for continued plant growth. It allows the woody vegetation to subsist during the summer but not to flourish.

AB P>1. Carnivores are difficult to conserve because of direct and indirect competition with people. Public hunts are increasingly proposed to support carnivore conservation. This article reviews scientific evidence for the effectiveness of public hunts of large carnivores in attaining three common policy goals: stable carnivore populations, preventing conflict with carnivores (property damage and competition over game) and building public support for carnivore conservation.
   2. Sustainable exploitation of stable wildlife populations has a solid, scientific foundation but the theory and its predictions must be adapted to complex patterns of carnivore behavioural ecology and population dynamics that demand years of landscape-level monitoring to understand fully.
   3. A review of the evidence that hunting prevents property damage or reduces competition for game reveals large gaps in our understanding. Reducing the number of large carnivores to protect hunters' quarry species seems straightforward but we still know little about behavioural and ecological responses of the contested prey and sympatric meso-predators. For reducing property damage, the direct effect - numerical reduction in problematic individual carnivores - presents numerous obstacles, whereas the indirect effect - behavioural avoidance of humans by hunted carnivores - holds more promise.
   4. Scientific measures of public support for carnivore-hunting policies are almost completely lacking, particularly measures of attitudes among hunters before and after controversial wildlife is designated as legal game species. Moreover, illegal killing of carnivores does not appear to diminish if they are designated as game.
   5.Synthesis and applications. Sustainable hunting to maintain stable populations is well understood in theory but complex life histories of carnivores, and behavioural changes of hunters and the carnivores they stalk may result in unsustainable mortality for carnivores. The direct impact of hunting on carnivore damage to property is unclear and even doubtful given the inability or unwillingness of hunters to remove specific individuals selectively. However, hunters may indirectly deter carnivores from people and their property. The assumption that hunters will steward carnivores simply because they have in the past helped conserve other game species requires more study as preliminary results suggest it is incorrect. Policy-makers may achieve support for policy if they mesh utilitarian and preservationist values held by the general public. A number of opposed hypotheses should be disentangled before researchers confidently inform policy on sustainable hunting to prevent conflicts and build public support for carnivore conservation.

AB We show that observed co-variations at sub-hourly time scales between the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and canopy light use efficiency (LUE) over a Douglas-fir forest result directly from sub-hourly leaf reflectance changes in a 531 mm spectral window roughly 50 nm wide. We conclude then, that over a forest stand we are observing the direct effects of photosynthetic down-regulation on leaf-level reflectance at 531 nm. Key to our conclusion is our ability to simultaneously measure the LUE and reflectance of the Douglas-fir stand as a function of shadow fraction from the "hot spot" to the "dark spot" and a new finding herein, based on radiative transfer theory, that the magnitude of a normalized reflectance difference index (NDRI) such as PRI can vary with shadow fraction only in case the reflectance of the shaded and sunlit leaves differ in at least one of the NDRI bands.
   Our spectrometer measurements over a nearly 6 month period show that at a forest stand scale, only two NDRIs (both containing a band near 570 nm) vary with shadow fraction and are correlated with LUE: an NDRI with a band centered at 531 nm roughly 50 nm wide, and another near 705 nm. Therefore, we are able to conclude that only these two bands' reflectance differ between the sunlit and the shaded elements of the canopy. Their reflectance changes on time scales of a few minutes or less. Our observations also show that the reflectance changes at 531 nm are more highly correlated with variations in canopy light use efficiency when only sunlit canopy elements are viewed (the hot spot), than when only shaded elements (the dark spot) are viewed. Taken together then, these results demonstrate that the observed sub-hourly changes in foliage reflectance at 531 nm and 705 turn can only result from corresponding variations in photosynthetic rates. The importance of our results are as follows: (1) We show that variations in PRI with LUE are a direct result of rapid changes in foliage reflectance at 531 nm resulting from photosynthetic down-regulation, and can be observed at forest scales. (2) Our findings also suggest a new sensor and methodology for the direct retrieval from space of changes in forest LUE by measuring PRI as a function of shadow fraction using a multi-angle spectrometer simultaneously retrieving both shadow fraction and PRI.

AB We analyzed a large dataset of simultaneous measurements of phytoplankton pigments, spectral specific absorption coefficient for phytoplankton [a*(lambda)], and photosynthesis versus irradiance (P versus E) curve parameters to examine the possible relationships between phytoplankton community structure and photophysiological properties at large spatial scales. Data were collected in various regions, mostly covering the trophic gradient encountered in the world's open ocean. The community composition is described in terms of biomass of three phytoplankton classes, determined using specific biomarker pigments. We present a general empirical model that describes the dependence of algal photophysiology on both the community composition and the relative irradiance within the water column (essentially reflecting photoacclimation). The application of the model to the in situ dataset enables the identification of vertical profiles of photophysiological properties for each phytoplankton class. The class-specific a*(lambda) obtained are consistent with results from the literature and with previous models developed for small and large cells, both in terms of the absolute values and the vertical patterns. Similarly, for the class-specific P versus E curve parameters, the magnitude and vertical distribution obtained with this method are coherent with previous observations. Large cells (mainly diatoms) may be more efficient in carbon storage than smaller cells, whereas their yield of light absorption is lower. We anticipate that such photophysiological parameterizations can improve primary production models by providing estimates of primary production that are specific to different phytoplankton classes on large scale.

AB Nitrogen (N) deposition in the North China Plain (NCP), an intensive agricultural region undergoing rapid economic development in China, has not been well documented until now. In a 4-year study, using a deposition network (11 sites), we analyzed bulk and wet-only deposition, and the isotopic composition (delta N-15) of ammonium and nitrate in precipitation in the NCP. Annual bulk deposition of inorganic N averaged 27 kg N ha(-1) (ranging from 15 to 50 kg N ha(-1)) across sites and years, but with very large variation in both space and time. Bulk and wet deposition of inorganic N were significantly higher at sites in the Beijing area compared with that at rural sites in the NCP, implying more air N pollution around Beijing. Although there was a wide seasonal variation of (delta N-15 for NH4-N (-12.7 parts per thousand. to + 12.9 parts per thousand) and NO3-N (-10.0 parts per thousand to + 20.7 parts per thousand.) in precipitation across the sites in the NCP, a significant difference in the mean isotopic composition of NH4-N and NO3-N was measured in precipitation samples from two suburban sites (Dongbeiwang, DBW; Campus experimental farm, CEF) in Beijing (+ 0.45 +/- 4.39 parts per thousand for NH4-N and + 4.23 +/- 4.34 parts per thousand for NO3-N on average) compared to two rural sites (Quzhou, QZ; Wuqiao, WQ) in Hebei (-2.8 +/- 4.06 parts per thousand for NH4-N and -1.19 +/- 3.74 parts per thousand for NO3-N on average). Both deposition flux and isotopic composition of inorganic N in precipitation suggest that N deposition is most probably influenced by multiple pollution sources in the urban area around Beijing area, while it is mainly derived from local agricultural sources of reactive N species at rural areas of the NCP.

AB Normative invasive species are one of the main global threats to biodiversity. The understanding of the traits characterizing successful invaders and invasion-prone ecosystems is increasing, but our predictive ability is still limited. Quantitative information on biotic homogenization and particularly its temporal dynamics is even scarcer. We used freshwater fish distribution data in the Iberian Peninsula in four periods (before human intervention, 1991, 1995, and 2001) to assess the temporal dynamics of biotic homogenization among river basins. The percentage of introduced species among fish faunas has increased in recent times (from 41.8% in 1991 to 52.5% in 2001), leading to a clear increase in the similarity of community composition among basins. The mean Jaccard's index increase (a measure of biotic homogenization) from the pristine situation to the present (17.1%) was similar to that for Californian fish but higher than for other studies. However, biotic homogenization was found to be a temporally dynamic process, with finer temporal grain analyses detecting transient stages of biotic differentiation. Introduced species assemblages were spatially structured along a latitudinal gradient in the Iberian Peninsula, with species related to sport fishing being characteristic of northern basins. Although the comparison of fish distributions in the Iberian Peninsula and France showed significant and generalized biotic homogenization, normative assemblages of northeastern Iberian basins were more similar to those of France than to those of the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, indicating a main introduction route. Species introduced to the Iberian Peninsula tended to be mainly piscivores or widely introduced species that previously had been introduced to France., Our results indicate that the simultaneous analysis of the spatial distribution of introduced assemblages (excluding native species that reflect other biogeographical patterns) and their specific traits can be an effective tool to detect introduction and invasion routes and to predict future invaders from donor regions.

AB Lineage sorting and introgression can lead to incongruence among gene phylogenies, complicating the inference of species trees for large groups of taxa that have recently and rapidly radiated. In addition, it can be difficult to determine which of these processes is responsible for this incongruence. We explore these issues with the radiation of New Zealand alpine cicadas of the genus Maoricicada Dugdale. Gene trees were estimated from four putative independent loci: mitochondrial DNA ( 2274 nucleotides), elongation factor 1- alpha ( 1275 nucleotides), period ( 1709 nucleotides), and calmodulin ( 678 nucleotides). We reconstructed phylogenies using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods from 44 individuals representing the 19 species and subspecies of Maoricicada and two outgroups. Species- level relationships were reconstructed using a novel extension of gene tree parsimony, whereby gene trees were weighted by their Bayesian posterior probabilities. The inferred gene trees show marked incongruence in the placement of some taxa, especially the enigmatic forest and scrub dwelling species, M. iolanthe. Using the species tree estimated by gene tree parsimony, we simulated coalescent gene trees in order to test the null hypothesis that the nonrandom placement of M. iolanthe among gene trees has arisen by chance. Under the assumptions of constant population size, known generation time, and panmixia, we were able to reject this null hypothesis. Furthermore, because the two alternative placements of M. iolanthe are in each case with species that share a similar song structure, we conclude that it is more likely that an ancient introgression event rather than lineage sorting has caused this incongruence.

AB Wetlands provide important ecosystem functions and values, such as wildlife habitat, water filtration and flood protection. Wetland plant communities play a fundamental role in maintaining these functions but are thought to be increasingly threatened by human modifications of the landscape, such as deforestation and road construction. Here, we examine the quantitative relationships between two dependent variables (plant species richness, community composition) and a set of independent variables describing land use (e.g., forest cover, road density, and building density). As independent variables, we further include wetland characteristics that may be related to landuse practices (e.g., area and nutrient status). Wetland size is the most important predictor of both total plant species richness and the species richness within most functional groups. In addition, landscape properties, such as forest cover, presence of streams and nutrient status of water and sediment are significant predictors of plant species richness. Adjacent land use 250-300 m from the wetland affects plant diversity. Differences in the land-use-diversity relationship among different plant functional groups suggest that adjacent land use affects wetland plant communities in two important ways. First, it alters the abundance and distribution of propagules in adjoining habitats. Second, it alters the number of dispersal routes. Our results suggest that Current management practices are inadequate and that regulation of adjacent land use is a critical component of wetland conservation.

AB Microevolution may determine both the safety and efficacy of classical biological control. Despite a growing body of literature, there are several key unanswered questions regarding the role of evolution in biological control: (1) How common is local adaptation of natural enemies to their hosts or the environment in the native range? How critical is it for success of biological control to find locally adapted agents for importation? (2) Does adaptive evolution following introductions play an important role in biological control? (3) Do introductions of biological control agents impose bottlenecks in population size that reduce genetic variation, and is reduced genetic variation associated with low fitness and poor performance? (4) How great is the risk of evolution of host range of biological control agents? (5) What is the risk of target pests evolving resistance to biological control agents? If pests evolve increased resistance, will biological control agents evolve mechanisms to overcome that resistance? Here, we review the four fundamental processes of microevolution, and discuss how they interact in the context of biological control. We discuss our current state of knowledge regarding the outstanding questions, highlight the types of experiments that can address them, and suggest ways to use microevolution to define risks, and enhance efficacy and safety of biological control.

AB Severe, stand-replacing fires affect large areas of northern temperate and boreal forests, potentially modifying ecosystem function for decades after their occurrence. Because these fires occur over large extents, and in areas where plant production is limited by nitrogen (N) availability, the effect of fire on N cycling may be important for long-term ecosystem productivity. In this article, we review what is known about postfire N cycling in northern temperate and boreal forests experiencing stand-replacing fires. We then build upon existing literature to identify the most important mechanisms that control postfire N availability in systems experiencing severe, stand-replacing fires compared with fires of lower severity. These mechanisms include changes in abiotic conditions caused by the opening of the canopy (for example, decreased LAI, increased solar radiation), changes in ground layer quantity and quality (for example, nutrient release, permafrost levels), and postfire plant and microbial adaptations affecting N fixation and N uptake (for example, serotiny, germination cues). Based on the available literature, these mechanisms appear to affect N inputs, internal N cycling, and N outputs in various ways, indicating that severe fire systems are variable across time and space as a result of complex interactions between postfire abiotic and biotic factors. Future experimental work should be focused on understanding these mechanisms and their variability across the landscape.

AB Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) have a world-wide distribution, and show morphotypic variation among regions. Distinctions between coastal and pelagic populations have been documented; however, regional patterns of differentiation had not been previously investigated in a wider geographic context. We analysed up to nine different populations from seven different areas of the world by mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite DNA markers, and found differentiation among all putative regional populations. Both mtDNA and microsatellite DNA data show significant differentiation, suggesting restricted gene flow for both males and females. Dolphins in coastal habitat showed less variability and were in most cases differentiated from a pelagic lineage, which could suggest local founder events in some cases. Two coastal populations recently classified as belonging to a new species, T. aduncus, were each highly differentiated from populations of the truncatus morphotype, and from each other, suggesting a possible third species represented by the South African aduncus type.

AB Changes in forest structure and species diversity throughout secondary succession were studied using a chronosequence at two sites in the Bolivian Amazon. Secondary forests ranging in age from 2 to 40 years as well as mature forests were included, making a total of 14 stands. Fifty plants per forest layer (understory, subcanopy, and canopy) were sampled using the transect of variable area technique. Mean and maximum height, total stem density basal area, and species number were calculated at the stand level. Species diversity was calculated for each stand and for each combination of forest layer and stand. A correspondence analysis was performed, and the relationship between relative abundance of the species and stand age was modeled using a set of hierarchical models. Canopy height and basal area increased with stand age, indicating that secondary forests rapidly attain a forest structure similar in many respects to mature forests. A total of 250 species were recorded of which ca 50 percent made up 87 percent of the sampled individuals. Species diversity increased with stand age and varied among the forest layers, with the lowest diversity in the canopy. The results of the correspondence analysis indicated that species composition varies with stand age, forest layer, and site. The species composition of mature forests recovered at different rates in the different forest layers, being the slowest in the canopy layer. Species showed different patterns of abundance in relation to stand age, supporting the current model of succession.

AB 1. We examined the relative importance of maternal, environmental and social factors for post-weaning pup growth and survival in a co-operatively breeding mammal, the meerkat Suricata suricatta.
   2. Pup daily weight gain was primarily influenced by the number of carers per pup and the daily weight gain of those carers. Rainfall and daily temperatures had additional positive and negative effects, respectively, on weight gain of pups born to subordinates.
   3. Pup overnight weight loss was primarily influenced by the amount of weight pups gained during the day, and their age. However, pups also lost considerably more weight overnight when temperatures were cold, although such effects were less in large groups.
   4. Pup growth rates were positively influenced by the number of carers per pup and carer condition, and negatively influenced by high daytime temperatures.
   5. Pup weight at independence was positively associated with weight at emergence and pup weight gain during provisioning, but negatively associated with the extent of overnight weight loss.
   6. Pup survival between emergence and independence was related to maternal status, pup sex and overnight weight loss, as well as to group size, daytime temperature and monthly rainfall.
   7. Thus, in meerkats, social factors largely, but not wholly, replace the importance of maternal factors that are commonly found to govern reproductive success in non-co-operatively breeding social vertebrates.

AB We introduce an initiative to assess and compare landscape changes related to human activities on a global scale, using a single group of invertebrates. The GLOBENET programme uses common field methodology (pitfall trapping), to appraise assemblages of ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) in visually-similar land-mosaics (urban-rural gradients). Carabids were selected as the focal taxon as they are sufficiently varied (both taxonomically and ecologically), abundant and sensitive to the environment. However, work on other taxa is comparable with the GLOBENET framework. The continuum of decreasing human pressure from city centres into the surrounding countryside was selected to represent human-caused disturbance for this initial stage of GLOBENET because these gradients can be found virtually all over the world. Through the broad-scale assessment envisioned in the GLOBENET programme, we seek to separate general, repeated effects on biodiversity from those that depend on local environments or particular biotic assemblages. Based on this understanding we aim to develop simple tools and protocols for assessing ecological effects of human-caused landscape changes, which could help to sustainably manage landscapes for biodiversity and for human requirements. For instance, the response of different functional groups of carabids to these landscape changes may help guide management practices. Further GLOBENET developments and information are available at our website: http://www.helsinki.fi/science/globenet/

AB We study the evolution of dispersal rates In a two parch metapopulation model. The local dynamics in each patch are given by difference equations, which, together with the rate of dispersal between the patches, determine the ecological dynamics of the metapopulation. We assume that phenotypes are given by their dispersal rate. The evolutionary dynamics in phenotype space are determined by invasion exponents, which describe whether a mutant can invade a given resident population. If the resident metapopulation is at a stable equilibrium, then selection on dispersal rates is neutral if the population sizes in the two patches are the same, while selection drives dispersal rates to zero if the local abundances are different. With non-equilibrium metapopulation dynamics, non-zero dispersal rates can be maintained by selection. In this case, and if the patches are: ecologically identical, dispersal rates always evolve to values which induce synchronized metapopulation dynamics. If the patches are ecologically different, evolutionary branching into two coexisting dispersal phenotypes can be observed. Such branching can happen repeatedly, leading to polymorphisms with more than two phenotypes. If there is a cost to dispersal, evolutionary cycling in phenotype space can occur due to the dependence of selection pressures on the ecological attractor of the resident population, or because phenotypic branching alternates with the extinction of one of the branches. Our results extend those of Holt and McPeek (1996), and suggest that phenotypic branching is an important evolutionary process. This process may be relevant for sympatric speciation.

AB Sediments collected from the northwestern Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean) were exposed to anoxic bottom-water conditions for more than 2 mo in order to examine the resistance of dominant meiobenthic taxa to prolonged anoxia. Copepods appeared to be most sensitive to anoxia, with densities being reduced to zero within 11 d. Compared to oxic conditions, densities of both nematodes and soft-shelled foraminifera were significantly lower under prolonged anoxia. In contrast, total hard-shelled foraminiferal densities did not differ significantly. This differential response resulted in a change in the meiobenthic community structure which was apparent after 1 mo. The change is reflected, and can be followed, in the foraminifera:nematode ratio, which is proposed as a bio-indicator of prolonged anoxia. The results clearly demonstrate that, among the meiobenthos, hard-shelled foraminifera are most resistant to prolonged anoxia. However, conditions resulting from the anoxic treatment (e.g. decreased biological interactions) were beneficial to some foraminiferal genera. This resulted in a shift in faunal patterns eventually leading to a strong reduction in foraminiferal generic diversity. Results also indicated that details of these trends may not be evident if only the part of the foraminiferal assemblage retained on a 63 mu m sieve is examined.

AB Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) is increasing, which increases leaf-scale photosynthesis and intrinsic water-use efficiency. These direct responses have the potential to increase plant growth, vegetation biomass, and soil organic matter; transferring carbon from the atmosphere into terrestrial ecosystems (a carbon sink). A substantial global terrestrial carbon sink would slow the rate of [CO2] increase and thus climate change. However, ecosystem CO(2)responses are complex or confounded by concurrent changes in multiple agents of global change and evidence for a [CO2]-driven terrestrial carbon sink can appear contradictory. Here we synthesize theory and broad, multidisciplinary evidence for the effects of increasing [CO2] (iCO(2)) on the global terrestrial carbon sink. Evidence suggests a substantial increase in global photosynthesis since pre-industrial times. Established theory, supported by experiments, indicates that iCO(2)is likely responsible for about half of the increase. Global carbon budgeting, atmospheric data, and forest inventories indicate a historical carbon sink, and these apparent iCO(2)responses are high in comparison to experiments and predictions from theory. Plant mortality and soil carbon iCO(2)responses are highly uncertain. In conclusion, a range of evidence supports a positive terrestrial carbon sink in response to iCO(2), albeit with uncertain magnitude and strong suggestion of a role for additional agents of global change.

AB The study of microorganisms that pervade each and every part of this planet has encountered many challenges through time such as the discovery of unknown organisms and the understanding of how they interact with their environment. The aim of this review is to take the reader along the timeline and major milestones that led us to modern metagenomics. This new and thriving area is likely to be an important contributor to solve different problems. The transition from classical microbiology to modern metagenomics studies has required the development of new branches of knowledge and specialization. Here, we will review how the availability of high-throughput sequencing technologies has transformed microbiology and bioinformatics and how to tackle the inherent computational challenges that arise from the DNA sequencing revolution. New computational methods are constantly developed to collect, process, and extract useful biological information from a variety of samples and complex datasets, but metagenomics needs the integration of several of these computational methods. Despite the level of specialization needed in bioinformatics, it is important that life scientists have a good understanding of it for a correct experimental design, which allows them to reveal the information in a metagenome.

AB Growth is a fundamental biological trait, generally considered to have an important role in structuring populations and communities. Accordingly, many studies have quantified growth rates of scleractinian corals, but using a variety of different methods and measures that may or may not be comparable. The purpose of this review is to compile extensive data on the growth of corals, to relate disparate methods of measuring coral growth, and to explore spatial, temporal, and taxonomic variation in growth rates. The most common metric of coral growth is linear extension, measured as unidirectional change in branch length or colony radius. Rates of linear extension vary greatly among corals, being highest among arborescent Acropora species. This is not unexpected given the limited carbonate investment in producing long, slender branches compared to solid hemispherical colonies. However, differences in the way that extension rates are actually measured (e.g., linear extension of individual branches vs. changes in the mean solid radius of massive corals) could potentially bias interspecific comparisons of coral growth. The most comparable measure of growth, which gives unbiased estimates of growth across different growth forms, is average annual calcification or change in weight normalized to a measure of size. Surprisingly, even calcification rates appear to be much higher for branching Acropora compared to other coral genera, which contributes to the high extension rates recorded for this genus. Despite inconsistencies and incompatibilities among studies of coral growth, there is clear evidence that coral growth rates vary spatially and temporally, largely in response to light and water quality (e.g., turbidity), temperature, and aragonite saturation state. Ongoing changes in environmental conditions (e.g., due to climate change) are expected to have generally negative consequences for the growth of scleractinian corals, which may be further exacerbated by shifts in assemblage structure towards relatively slowgrowing species.

AB We review recent empirical efforts to understand human tolerance for large, terrestrial carnivores, and highlight how psychological theory on hazard acceptance can help conservation scientists explain, and ultimately increase, human tolerance for these species. For hazards in general, and for carnivores in particular, the majority of variation in acceptability judgments can be explained by the perceptions of risks and benefits associated with the hazard. Factors such as affective (emotional) reaction to a species, personal control over the risks, and trust in managing agencies are important, but secondary factors. Experimental research highlights the importance of communicating the benefits of a species to increase tolerance. In combination, these findings point to a need to rethink communications about carnivores that focus solely on lowering perceived risk by increasing individual control over the hazard. Such efforts may inadvertently decrease tolerance by overlooking the distinct and important role that the positive outcomes (i.e., benefits) associated with carnivores can play when evaluating the acceptability of a particular population or management action.

AB Aim Decision-making for conservation management often involves evaluating risks in the face of environmental uncertainty. Models support decision-making by (1) synthesizing available knowledge in a systematic, rational and transparent way and (2) providing a platform for exploring and resolving uncertainty about the consequences of management decisions. Despite their benefits, models are still not used in many conservation decision-making contexts. In this article, we provide evidence of common objections to the use of models in environmental decision-making. In response, we present a series of practical solutions for modellers to help improve the effectiveness and relevance of their work in conservation decision-making. Location Global review. Methods We reviewed scientific and grey literature for evidence of common objections to the use of models in conservation decision-making. We present a set of practical solutions based on theory, empirical evidence and best-practice examples to help modellers substantively address these objections. Results We recommend using a structured decision-making framework to guide good modelling practice in decision-making and highlight a variety of modelling techniques that can be used to support the process. We emphasize the importance of participatory decision-making to improve the knowledge-base and social acceptance of decisions and to facilitate better conservation outcomes. Improving communication and building trust are key to successfully engaging participants, and we suggest some practical solutions to help modellers develop these skills. Main conclusions If implemented, we believe these practical solutions could help broaden the use of models, forging deeper and more appropriate linkages between science and management for the improvement of conservation decision-making.

AB Residential landscapes with private gardens are major land covers in cities and their sustainable management is paramount for achieving a resilient urban future. Here we focus on the value of residential ecosystems for biodiversity conservation and explore the social and ecological factors that influence wildlife-friendly garden management. Using a stratified sampling design across the UK city of Leeds, this interdisciplinary study develops and applies a mixed method approach, including questionnaires, interviews and ecological surveys across multiple spatial scales. We quantify wildlife-friendly gardening using two measures: (i) the number of wildlife-friendly features within gardens (the wildlife resources index, WRI); and (ii) the frequency of winter bird feeding. Wildlife-friendly gardening is influenced by a combination of garden characteristics and management intensity, householder demographics, wider environmental activity and landscape context. Residents reveal a range of motivations for wildlife-friendly gardening, notably personal well-being and a moral responsibility to nature. Respondents expressed a duty to maintain neighbourhood standards, revealing that social norms are a considerable barrier to uptake of wildlife-friendly activities, but also provide an opportunity where neighbour mimicry results in diffusion of wildlife-friendly practices. Community-driven initiatives that engage, educate and empower residents are better placed to encourage wildlife-friendly gardening than top-down financial incentives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Resolving contingencies in community ecology requires comparative studies of local communities along broad-scale environmental gradients and in different biogeographic regions. However, comparisons of local ecological processes among regions require a synthetic understanding of how the species pool of potential community members influences the structure of ecological communities. Here, we outline an integrative approach for quantifying local ecological processes while explicitly accounting for species pool influences. Specifically, we highlight the utility of combining geographically replicated local studies, null models of community structure, and ecologically explicit definitions of the species pool as a means to compare predominant ecological processes among regions. By uniting concepts and tools from community ecology and macroecology, this approach might facilitate synthesis and resolve many perceived ecological contingencies.

AB Aim We tested whether the geographic variation in the proportion of beta diversity attributed to nestedness or turnover components was explained by the effect of past glaciation events. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that most of the beta diversity in regions retaining ice until recent periods was due to nestedness. Additionally, we tested whether the variation was influenced by thermal tolerance and the dispersal ability of species.
   Location This study analysed data from the New World.
   Methods We used presence/absence data for amphibians, birds and mammals of the New World. We calculated beta diversity among each 1 degrees x 1 degrees cell and the adjacent cells using the Sorensen dissimilarity index that expresses the total beta diversity. Furthermore, we partitioned it into turnover and nestedness components. The relative importance of the two latter components was expressed as the proportion of total beta diversity explained by nestedness (beta(ratio)). We calculated the correlation between beta(ratio) and the time each cell was free of ice since the last glaciation (cell age). To control the effects of spatial autocorrelation, we calculated geographically effective degrees of freedom.
   Results The proportion of beta diversity attributed to nestedness was negatively correlated with cell age. Moreover, this effect was stronger for amphibians than mammals, and stronger for mammals than birds.
   Main conclusions Our results are in accordance with the hypothesis that the nestedness component of beta diversity is more important in areas affected by glaciations until recent time. The beta diversity in high latitudes is the result of past extinctions and recent recolonization, which result in higher levels of nestedness. This process is more evident for vertebrates with lower dispersal ability and lower temperature tolerance.

AB Changes in climate, land use, fire incidence, and ecological connections all may contribute to current species' range shifts. Species shift range individually, and not all species shift range at the same time and rate. This variation causes community reorganization in both the old and new ranges. In terrestrial ecosystems, range shifts alter aboveground-belowground interactions, influencing species abundance, community composition, ecosystem processes and services, and feedbacks within communities and ecosystems. Thus, range shifts may result in no-analog communities where foundation species and community genetics play unprecedented roles, possibly leading to novel ecosystems. Long-distance dispersal can enhance the disruption of aboveground-belowground interactions of plants, herbivores, pathogens, symbiotic mutualists, and decomposer organisms. These effects are most likely stronger for latitudinal than for altitudinal range shifts. Disrupted aboveground-belowground interactions may have influenced historical postglacial range shifts as well. Assisted migration without considering aboveground-belowground interactions could enhance risks of such range shift-induced invasions.

TI Systematic and Evolutionary Insights Derived from mtDNA COI Barcode

AB Background: Decapods are the most recognizable of all crustaceans and comprise a dominant group of benthic invertebrates of the continental shelf and slope, including many species of economic importance. Of the 17635 morphologically described Decapoda species, only 5.4% are represented by COI barcode region sequences. It therefore remains a challenge to compile regional databases that identify and analyse the extent and patterns of decapod diversity throughout the world.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We contributed 101 decapod species from the North East Atlantic, the Gulf of Cadiz and the Mediterranean Sea, of which 81 species represent novel COI records. Within the newly-generated dataset, 3.6% of the species barcodes conflicted with the assigned morphological taxonomic identification, highlighting both the apparent taxonomic ambiguity among certain groups, and the need for an accelerated and independent taxonomic approach. Using the combined COI barcode projects from the Barcode of Life Database, we provide the most comprehensive COI data set so far examined for the Order (1572 sequences of 528 species, 213 genera, and 67 families). Patterns within families show a general predicted molecular hierarchy, but the scale of divergence at each taxonomic level appears to vary extensively between families. The range values of mean K2P distance observed were: within species 0.285% to 1.375%, within genus 6.376% to 20.924% and within family 11.392% to 25.617%. Nucleotide composition varied greatly across decapods, ranging from 30.8 % to 49.4 % GC content.
   Conclusions/Significance: Decapod biological diversity was quantified by identifying putative cryptic species allowing a rapid assessment of taxon diversity in groups that have until now received limited morphological and systematic examination. We highlight taxonomic groups or species with unusual nucleotide composition or evolutionary rates. Such data are relevant to strategies for conservation of existing decapod biodiversity, as well as elucidating the mechanisms and constraints shaping the patterns observed.

AB Animal locations estimated by Global Positioning System (GPS) inherently contain errors. Screening procedures used to remove large positional errors often trade data accuracy for data loss. We developed a simple screening method that identifies locations arising from unrealistic movement patterns. When applied to a large data set of moose (Alces alces) locations, our method identified virtually all known errors with minimal loss of data. Thus, our method for screening GPS data improves the quality of data sets and increases the value of such data for research and management.

AB Aim
   To provide the first comparative overview on the current numbers of alien species that invade representative European terrestrial and freshwater habitats for a range of taxonomic groups.
   Location
   Europe.
   Methods
   Numbers of naturalized alien species of plants, insects, herptiles, birds and mammals occurring in 10 habitats defined according to the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) were obtained from 115 regional data sets. Only species introduced after ad 1500 were considered. Data were analysed by ANCOVA and regression trees to assess whether differences exist among taxonomic groups in terms of their habitat affinity, and whether the pattern of occurrence of alien species in European habitats interacts with macroecological factors such as insularity, latitude or area.
   Results
   The highest numbers of alien plant and insect species were found in human-made, urban or cultivated habitats; if controlled for habitat area in the region, wetland and riparian habitats appeared to support relatively high numbers of alien plant species too. Invasions by vertebrates were more evenly distributed among habitats, with aquatic and riparian, woodland and cultivated land most invaded. Mires, bogs and fens, grassland, heathland and scrub were generally less invaded. Habitat and taxonomic group explained most variation in the proportions of alien species occurring in individual habitats related to the total number of alien species in a region, and the basic pattern determined by these factors was fine-tuned by geographical variables, namely by the mainland-island contrast and latitude, and differed among taxonomic groups.
   Main conclusions
   There are two ecologically distinct groups of alien species (plants and insects versus vertebrates) with strikingly different habitat affinities. Invasions by these two contrasting groups are complementary in terms of habitat use, which makes an overall assessment of habitat invasions in Europe possible. Since numbers of naturalized species in habitats are correlated among taxa within these two groups, the data collected for one group of vertebrates, for example, could be used to estimate the habitat-specific numbers of alien species for other vertebrate groups with reasonable precision, and the same holds true for insects and plants.

AB Conservation biogeography involves the application of biogeographical principles, theories, and analyses to problems regarding biodiversity conservation. The field was formally defined in 2005, and considerable research has been conducted in the ensuing 5 years.
   This editorial sets the context for 16 contributions in a special issue of Diversity and Distributions on developments and challenges in conservation biogeography. Papers are grouped into the following main themes: species distribution modelling; data requirements; approaches for assigning conservation priorities; approaches for integrating information from numerous disparate sources; special challenges involving invasive species; and the crucial issue of determining how elements of biodiversity are likely to respond to rapid climate change. One paper provides a synthesis of requirements for a robust conservation biogeography for freshwater ecosystems.
   Conservation biogeography is well poised to make a significant contribution to the process of providing policy makers with objectively formulated scenarios and options for the effective management of biodiversity. The editorial, and the papers in the special issue, deliberate on many of the exciting developments in play in the field, and the many complex challenges that lie ahead.

AB Wood density plays a key role in ecological strategies and life history variation in woody plants, but little is known about its anatomical basis in shrubs. We quantified the relationships between wood density, anatomy, and climate in 61 shrub species from eight field sites along latitudinal belts between 31 degrees and 35 degrees in North and South America. Measurements included cell dimensions, transverse areas of each xylem cell type and percentage contact between different cell types and vessels. Wood density was more significantly correlated with precipitation and aridity than with temperature. High wood density was achieved through reductions in cell size and increases in the proportion of wall relative to lumen. Wood density was independent of vessel traits, suggesting that this trait does not impose conduction limitations in shrubs. The proportion of fibers in direct contact with vessels decreased with and was independent of wood density, indicating that the number of fiber-vessel contacts does not explain the previously observed correlation between wood density and implosion resistance. Axial and radial parenchyma each had a significant but opposite association with wood density. Fiber size and wall thickness link wood density, life history, and ecological strategies by controlling the proportion of carbon invested per unit stem volume.

AB Multilocus analysis of phylogeography and population history is a powerful tool for understanding the origin, dispersal, and geographic structure of species over time and space. Using 36 genetic markers (29 newly developed anonymous nuclear loci, six introns and one from mitochondrial DNA, amounting to over 15 kb per individual), we studied population structure and demographic history of the red-backed fairy wren Malurus melanocephalus, a small passerine distributed in the northern and eastern part of Australia across the Carpentarian barrier. Analysis of anonymous loci markers revealed large amounts of genetic diversity (pi = 0.016 +/- 0.01; average number of SNPs per locus = 48; total number of SNPs = 1395), and neither nuclear nor mitochondrial gene trees showed evidence of reciprocal monophyly among Cape York (CY), Eastern Forest (EF), and Top End (TE) populations. Despite traditional taxonomy linking TE and CY populations to the exclusion of EF, we found that the CY population is genetically closer to the EF population, consistent with predicted area cladograms in this region. Multilocus coalescent analysis suggests that the CY population was separated from the other two regions approximately 0.27 million years ago, and that significant gene flow between the ER and the CY populations (similar to 2 migrants per generation) suggests geographic continuity in eastern Australia. By contrast, gene flow between the CY and the TE populations has been dampened by divergence across the Carpentarian barrier.

AB This study examined trends along a gradient of fishing intensity in an artisanal coral reef fishery over a 10-year period along 75 km of Kenya's most populated coastline. As predicted by Malthusian scenarios, catch per unit effort (CPUE), mean trophic level, the functional diversity of fished taxa, and the diversity of gear declined, while total annual catch and catch variability increased along the fishing pressure gradient. The fishery was able to sustain high (similar to 16 Mg.km(-2).yr(-1)) but variable yields at high fishing pressure due to the dominance of a few productive herbivorous fish species in the catch. The effect of two separate management strategies to overcome this Malthusian pattern was investigated: fisheries area closure and elimination of the dominant and most "competitive'' gear. We found that sites within 5 km of the enforced closure showed significantly lower total catch and CPUE, but increased yield stability and trophic level of catch than predicted by regression models normalized for fishing effort. Sites that had excluded illegal beach seine use through active gear management exhibited increased total catch and CPUE. There was a strong interaction between closure and gear management, which indicates that, for closures to be effective at increasing catch, there must be simultaneous efforts at gear management around the periphery of the closures. We propose that Malthusian effects are responsible for the variation in gear and catch and that active management through reduced effort and reductions in the most competitive gear have the greatest potential to increase the functional and trophic diversity and per-person productivity.

AB Antarctica and its surrounding islands lie at one extreme of global variation in diversity. Typically, these regions are characterized as being species poor and having simple food webs. Here, we show that terrestrial systems in the region are nonetheless characterized by substantial spatial and temporal variations at virtually all of the levels of the genealogical and ecological hierarchies which have been thoroughly investigated. Spatial variation at the individual and population levels has been documented in a variety of genetic studies, and in mosses it appears that UV-B radiation might be responsible for within-clump mutagenesis. At the species level, modern molecular methods have revealed considerable endemism of the Antarctic biota, questioning ideas that small organisms are likely to be ubiquitous and the taxa to which they belong species poor. At the biogeographic level, much of the relatively small ice-free area of Antarctica remains unsurveyed making analyses difficult. Nonetheless, it is clear that a major biogeographic discontinuity separates the Antarctic Peninsula and continental Antarctica, here named the 'Gressitt Line'. Across the Southern Ocean islands, patterns are clearer, and energy availability is an important correlate of indigenous and exotic species richness, while human visitor numbers explain much of the variation in the latter too. Temporal variation at the individual level has much to do with phenotypic plasticity, and considerable life-history and physiological plasticity seems to be a characteristic of Antarctic terrestrial species. Environmental unpredictability is an important driver of this trait and has significantly influenced life histories across the region and probably throughout much of the temperate Southern Hemisphere. Rapid climate change-related alterations in the range and abundance of several Antarctic and sub-Antarctic populations have taken place over the past several decades. In many sub-Antarctic locations, these have been exacerbated by direct and indirect effects of invasive alien species. Interactions between climate change and invasion seem set to become one of the most significant conservation problems in the Antarctic. We conclude that despite the substantial body of work on the terrestrial biodiversity of the Antarctic, investigations of interactions between hierarchical levels remain scarce. Moreover, little of the available information is being integrated into terrestrial conservation planning, which lags far behind in this region by comparison with most others.

AB 1. While it is generally accepted that the evolution of morphological traits is mediated by selection on whole-animal performance, few studies have examined how variation in performance explains variation in fitness. Most studies to date have studied how performance predicts survival, and these typically examine only a single age class.
   2. Maximal sprint speed was measured for hatchling and adult Collared Lizards (Crotaphytus collaris), in addition to morphological measurements, in order to determine how well annual survival could be predicted by performance and whether the relationship between performance and survival differed between age classes.
   3. Logistic regression revealed that no morphological trait or sprint speed performance predicted survival in adults. However, sprint speed predicted survival in hatchlings. Further, hindlimb length differed between survivors and non-survivors and correlated with sprint speed, suggesting that the evolution of hindlimb length in hatchlings may be driven by selection on sprint speed performance.
   4. Selection on sprint speed may be mediated directly by predators where hatchlings cannot attain speeds sufficient to escape predators or indirectly where slower individuals use a greater proportion of their maximal capacity than faster individuals while escaping predators, perhaps causing elevated stress levels or a higher expenditure of energy stores.

AB Lizards and snakes putatively arose between the early Jurassic and late Triassic; they diversified worldwide and now occupy many different ecological niches, making them ideal for testing theories on the origin of ecological traits. We propose and test the "deep history hypothesis," which claims that differences in ecological traits among species arose early in evolutionary history of major clades, and that present-day assemblages are structured largely because of ancient, preexisting differences. We combine phylogenetic data with ecological data collected over nearly 40 years to reconstruct the evolution of dietary shifts in squamate reptiles. Data on diets of 184 lizard species in 12 families from 4 continents reveal significant dietary shifts at 6 major divergence points, reducing variation by 79.8%. The most striking dietary divergence (27.6%) occurred in the late Triassic, when Iguania and Scleroglossa split. These two clades occupy different regions of dietary niche space. Acquisition of chemical prey discrimination, jaw prehension, and wide foraging providedscleroglossans access to sedentary and hidden prey that are unavailable to iguanians. This cladogenic event may have profoundly influenced subsequent evolutionary history and diversification. We suggest the hypothesis that ancient events in squamate cladogenesis, rather than present-day competition, caused dietary shifts in major clades such that some lizard clades gained access to new resources, which in turn led to much of the biodiversity observed today.

AB White grubs ( larvae of Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) are abundant in below-ground systems and can cause considerable damage to a wide variety of crops by feeding on roots. White grub populations may be controlled by natural enemies, but the predator guild of the European species is barely known. Trophic interactions within soil food webs are difficult to study with conventional methods. Therefore, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach was developed to investigate, for the first time, a soil insect predator-prey system. Can, however, highly sensitive detection methods identify carrion prey in predators, as has been shown for fresh prey? Fresh Melolontha melolontha ( L.) larvae and 1- to 9-day-old carcasses were presented to Poecilus versicolor Sturm larvae. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I fragments of the prey, 175, 327 and 387 bp long, were detectable in 50% of the predators 32 h after feeding. Detectability decreased to 18% when a 585 bp sequence was amplified. Meal size and digestion capacity of individual predators had no influence on prey detection. Although prey consumption was negatively correlated with cadaver age, carrion prey could be detected by PCR as efficiently as fresh prey irrespective of carrion age. This is the first proof that PCR-based techniques are highly efficient and sensitive, both in fresh and carrion prey detection. Thus, if active predation has to be distinguished from scavenging, then additional approaches are needed to interpret the picture of prey choice derived by highly sensitive detection methods.

AB The number of studies examining how species diversity influences the productivity of ecosystems has increased dramatically in the past decade as concern about global loss of biodiversity has intensified. Research to date has greatly improved our understanding of how, when, and why species loss alters primary production in ecosystems. However, because experiments have been performed at rather small spatial and short temporal scales, it is unclear whether conclusions can be readily extrapolated to the broader scales at which natural communities are most likely to influence ecosystem functioning. Here we develop a simple patch-dynamics model to examine some of the scale-dependent and independent qualities of the diversity-productivity relationship. We first simulate a typical diversity-productivity experiment and show that the influence of species richness on productivity is temporally dynamic, growing stronger through successional time. This holds true irrespective of whether resource partitioning or a sampling effect is the underlying mechanism. We then increase the spatial scale of the simulation from individual patches to a region consisting of many patch types. Results suggest that the diversity-productivity relationship is not influenced by spatial scale per se, but that the mechanism producing the relationship can change from sampling effects within individual patches to resource partitioning across patch types composing the region. This change occurs even though model dynamics are the same at both scales, suggesting that sampling effects and resource partitioning can represent different descriptions of the same biological processes operating concurrently at differing scales of observation. Lastly, we incorporate regional processes of dispersal and disturbance into the model and show that these processes can amplify the effect of species richness on productivity, resulting in patterns not easily anticipated from experiments. We conclude that the relative control of community structure by local versus regional processes may be a primary determinant of the diversity-productivity relationship in natural ecosystems. Therefore, past experiments having focused only on local processes might not reflect patterns and processes underlying diversity-productivity relationships in communities where disturbance and dispersal regulate species biomasses.

AB Climatic conditions during embryonic development can exert profound and long-term effects on many types of organisms, but most previous research on this topic has focussed on endothermic vertebrates (birds and mammals). Although viviparity in ectothermic taxa allows the reproducing female to buffer ambient thermal variation for her developing offspring, even an actively thermoregulating female may be unable to provide optimal incubation regimes in severe weather conditions. We examined the extent to which fluctuations in natural thermal conditions during pregnancy affect reproduction in a temperate viviparous snake, the aspic viper (Vipera aspis). Data gathered from a long term field study demonstrated that ambient thermal conditions influenced (1) female body temperatures and (2) gestation length, embryo viability, and offspring phenotypes. Interestingly, thermal conditions during each of the three months of gestation affected different aspects of reproduction. Hotter weather early in gestation (June) increased ventral scale counts (=number of body segments) of neonates; hotter weather mid-gestation (July) hastened development and thus the date of parturition; and hotter weather late in gestation (August) reduced the incidence of stillborn neonates. The population that we studied is close to the northern limit of the species' range, and embryonic thermal requirements may prevent Vipera aspis from extending into cooler conditions further north.

AB The two central paradigms of marine diversity are that there is a latitudinal cline of increasing species richness from poles to tropics and that species richness increases with depth to a maximum around 2,000 in and thereafter decreases. However, these paradigms were based on data collected in the late 1950's and early 1960's. Here I show that the 1960's data, are not representative and thus the paradigms need re-examination. New data from coastal areas in the northern hemisphere, record species richness as high as the highest recorded in the deep-sea. Whilst this suggests that the cline of increasing diversity from shallow to deep-sea does not exist, however, the database for the deep sea is not sufficient to draw such a conclusion. The basic problem with the data from the 1960s is that samples were taken on ecological scales and yet they are used to answer evolutionary questions. The questions that such data were to answer were why do the tropics have higher species richness than polar regions or why do deep-sea sediments have more species than coastal sediments? Evolutionary questions need data from much larger spatial areas. Recently, data representative of large scales have been collected from coastal areas in the northern hemisphere and show that there is a cline of increasing species richness from the Arctic to the tropics, but there does not yet seem to be a similar cline in the southern hemisphere. A number of hypotheses have been proposed for the observed patterns in biodiversity. In terrestrial ecology the energy-productivity hypothesis has gained wide acceptance as an explanation for the latitudinal gradient. Here I examine this and other hypotheses critically. Finally an analysis of research priorities is made. Assessment is urgently needed of the spatial scales and dynamics of species richness from point samples to assemblages, habitats and landscapes, especially in coastal areas and in the tropics, where the threats to biodiversity are greatest. New technologies are available, such as side-scan sonar, acoustics, and under-water digital video cameras but as yet have been relatively little used. Conservation of marine biodiversity must be based on sound theory, yet marine diversity studies lag well behind those of terrestrial habitats.

DT Article
AB The crustose lichen flora of fifteen areas in boreal coniferous forests from southern Sweden to Lapland was surveyed. Many of these areas are included in a national programme for monitoring long-term environmental change, the PMK programme. In all 190 species were recorded, 129 of them occurring on bark of conifers and lignum. Some species were found exclusively in forests with a long continuity. By using ordination and hierarchical classifications further species with similar habitat requirements were identified. An Indicator Species Index of Forest Continuity (ISIFC) was designed. Only two of the twenty index species occur on deciduous trees. The ISIFC was highly correlated with forest continuity and also with occurrence of species listed as threatened. Correlations with macroclimatic variables are considered sampling artifacts, and microclimatic factors are suggested to be of primary importance for species occurring in forests with a long continuity.

AB The application of high-throughput sequencing-based approaches to DNA extracted from environmental samples such as gut contents and faeces has become a popular tool for studying dietary habits of animals. Due to the high resolution and prey detection capacity they provide, both metabarcoding and shotgun sequencing are increasingly used to address ecological questions grounded in dietary relationships. Despite their great promise in this context, recent research has unveiled how a wealth of biological (related to the study system) and technical (related to the methodology) factors can distort the signal of taxonomic composition and diversity. Here, we review these studies in the light of high-throughput sequencing-based assessment of trophic interactions. We address how the study design can account for distortion factors, and how acknowledging limitations and biases inherent to sequencing-based diet analyses are essential for obtaining reliable results, thus drawing appropriate conclusions. Furthermore, we suggest strategies to minimize the effect of distortion factors, measures to increase reproducibility, replicability and comparability of studies, and options to scale up DNA sequencing-based diet analyses. In doing so, we aim to aid end-users in designing reliable diet studies by informing them about the complexity and limitations of DNA sequencing-based diet analyses, and encourage researchers to create and improve tools that will eventually drive this field to its maturity.

AB We examine satellite-based measurements of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) over the region impacted by the Russian drought and heat wave of 2010. Like the popular Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) that has been used for decades to measure photosynthetic capacity, SIF measurements are sensitive to the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically-active radiation (fPAR). However, in addition, SIF is sensitive to PAR as well as the fluorescence yield that is related to the photosynthetic yield. Both SIF and NDVI from satellite data show drought-related declines early in the growing season in 2010 as compared to other years between 2007 and 2013 for areas dominated by crops and grasslands. This suggests an early manifestation of the dry conditions on fPAR. Using MODIS fPAR retrievals, we computed SIF/APAR which is related to light use efficiencies (LUEs) for fluorescence and photosynthesis. We found drought-related losses in fluorescence efficiency for all areas including those dominated by mixed forests. Unlike croplands and grasslands, areas of mixed forest did not show significant drought-related declines in fPAR. We also simulated SIF and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) using a global land surface model driven by observation-based meteorological fields. The model provides a reasonable simulation of the drought and heat impacts on SIF in terms of the spatial extents of anomalies, but some differences were found in timing of the peak drought response between modeled and observed SIP. Model data also suggested that drought-related declines in LUE for fluorescence and photosynthesis in areas of mixed forest produce losses in SIF and GPP. SIF and GPP losses due to drought in croplands and grasslands result from both LUE and fPAR reductions. The combination of SIF and NDVI or fPAR data is shown to be an important source of information for evaluating model performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Size is a fundamental organismal trait and an important driver of ecosystem functions. Although large individuals may dominate some functions and provide important habitat structuring effects, intra-specific body size effects are rarely investigated in the context of BEF relationships. We used an in situ density manipulation experiment to explore the contribution of large, deep-burrowing bivalves to oxygen and nutrient fluxes across the sediment-water interface. By manipulating bivalve size structure through the removal of large individuals, we held species identity constant, but altered the trait characteristics of the community. The number of large bivalves was the best predictor of ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight that (a) accounting for body size provides important insights into the mechanisms underpinning biodiversity effects on ecosystem function, and (b) if local disturbances are recurrent, preventing individuals from reaching large sizes, the contribution of large adults may be lost, with largely unknown implications for ecosystem functionality.

AB Acoustic noise has the potential to cause stress, to distract and to mask important sounds, and thus to affect behaviour. Human activities have added considerable noise to both terrestrial and aquatic habitats, and there is growing evidence that anthropogenic noise affects communication and movement patterns in a variety of species. However, there has been relatively little work considering the effect on behaviours that are fundamental to survival, and thus have direct fitness consequences. We conducted a series of controlled tank-based experiments to consider how playback of ship noise, the most common source of underwater noise, affects foraging and antipredator behaviour in the shore crab, Carcinus maenas. Ship noise playback was more likely than ambient-noise playback to disrupt feeding, although crabs experiencing the two sound treatments did not differ in their likelihood of, or speed at, finding a food source in the first place. While crabs exposed to ship noise playback were just as likely as ambient-noise controls to detect and respond to a simulated predatory attack, they were slower to retreat to shelter. Ship noise playback also resulted in crabs that had been turned on their backs righting themselves faster than those experiencing ambient-noise playback; remaining immobile may reduce the likelihood of further predatory attention. Our findings therefore suggest that anthropogenic noise has the potential to increase the risks of starvation and predation, and showcases that the behaviour of invertebrates, and not just vertebrates, is susceptible to the impact of this pervasive global pollutant.

AB Old-growth forest ecosystems comprise a mosaic of patches in different successional stages, with the fraction of the landscape in any particular state relatively constant over large temporal and spatial scales. The size distribution and return frequency of disturbance events, and subsequent recovery processes, determine to a large extent the spatial scale over which this old-growth steady state develops. Here, we characterize this mosaic for a Central Amazon forest by integrating field plot data, remote sensing disturbance probability distribution functions, and individual-based simulation modeling. Results demonstrate that a steady state of patches of varying successional age occurs over a relatively large spatial scale, with important implications for detecting temporal trends on plots that sample a small fraction of the landscape. Long highly significant stochastic runs averaging 1.0 Mg biomass.ha(-1).y(-1) were often punctuated by episodic disturbance events, resulting in a sawtooth time series of hectare-scale tree biomass. To maximize the detection of temporal trends for this Central Amazon site (e.g., driven by CO2 fertilization), plots larger than 10 ha would provide the greatest sensitivity. A model-based analysis of fractional mortality across all gap sizes demonstrated that 9.1-16.9% of tree mortality was missing from plot-based approaches, underscoring the need to combine plot and remote-sensing methods for estimating net landscape carbon balance. Old-growth tropical forests can exhibit complex large-scale structure driven by disturbance and recovery cycles, with ecosystem and community attributes of hectare-scale plots exhibiting continuous dynamic departures from a steady-state condition.

AB While invasive plant species primarily occur in disturbed, high-resource environments, many species have invaded ecosystems characterized by low nutrient, water, and light availability. Species adapted to low-resource systems often display traits associated with resource conservation, such as slow growth, high tissue longevity, and resource-use efficiency. This contrasts with our general understanding of invasive species physiology derived primarily from studies in high-resource environments. These studies suggest that invasive species succeed through high resource acquisition. This review examines physiological and morphological traits of native and invasive species in low-resource environments. Existing data support the idea that species invading low-resource environments possess traits associated with resource acquisition, resource conservation or both. Disturbance and climate change are affecting resource availability in many ecosystems, and understanding physiological differences between native and invasive species may suggest ways to restore invaded ecosystems.

AB 1. Plastic responses to spatiotemporal environmental variation strongly influence species distribution, with widespread species expected to have high phenotypic plasticity. Theoretically, high phenotypic plasticity has been linked to plant invasiveness because it facilitates colonization and rapid spreading over large and environmentally heterogeneous new areas.
   2. To determine the importance of phenotypic plasticity for plant invasiveness, we compare well-known exotic invasive species with widespread native congeners. First, we characterized the phenotype of 20 invasive-native ecologically and phylogenetically related pairs from the Mediterranean region by measuring 20 different traits involved in resource acquisition, plant competition ability and stress tolerance. Second, we estimated their plasticity across nutrient and light gradients.
   3. On average, invasive species had greater capacity for carbon gain and enhanced performance over a range of limiting to saturating resource availabilities than natives. However, both groups responded to environmental variations with high albeit similar levels of trait plasticity. Therefore, contrary to the theory, the extent of phenotypic plasticity was not significantly higher for invasive plants.
   4. We argue that the combination of studying mean values of a trait with its plasticity can render insightful conclusions on functional comparisons of species such as those exploring the performance of species coexisting in heterogeneous and changing environments.

AB The Shannon index of entropy and related measures of compositional complexity are often used to assess species diversity in ecological communities, even when they are difficult to understand and their values are not comparable. This paper shows that the effective numbers of species (true diversity measures) allows for a more intuitive interpretation, and offers easily comparable values of species diversity. Their use is exemplified by reanalyzing the data from 4 studies published in the Revista Mexicana de Biodiversidad (done in different ecosystems and regions of Mexico, with different levels of taxonomic resolution and different biological groups). Diversity estimation models are also used; these assume that samples are incomplete representations of communities. This paper also offers an explanation of how diversity measures of different orders incorporate species depending on their abundance in the community. This may be especially useful when the diversity values are used to support proposals for resource management and biological conservation.

AB Partial migration is common in ungulates living in highly seasonal environments. Typically, at higher latitudes, this involves movement between high elevation summer areas used during breeding and lowland areas with less snow used during winter. Snow depth is regarded the main cause of migration to low elevation, but it is less clear why deer migrate to high elevation in spring. The forage maturation hypothesis explains the upward migration due to plant phenology. We here present also an alternative and non-exclusive hypothesis, that deer migrate uphill in summer to escape competition due to the high density in winter areas (the competition avoidance hypothesis). We also suggest that social fences may play a role at high population density. Based on a unique study of 141 GPS-marked red deer from seven regions covering the main distribution in Norway, we found that the proportion of migrants in the populations varied from 38% to 100%. Migration was more common in areas with a diverse topography, i.e. for areas with access to high elevation. Further, we found evidence that migration was negatively density dependent, and that fall migration was delayed at high density. We suggest that a combination of avoidance of competition in high density winter ranges, social fencing during summer in addition to the forage maturation and predation risk avoidance hypotheses, is needed to explain migration patterns of northern ungulates.

AB The phenotypic responses of functional traits in natural populations are driven by genetic diversity and phenotypic plasticity. These two mechanisms enable trees to cope with rapid climate change. We studied two European temperate tree species (sessile oak and European beech), focusing on (i) in situ variations of leaf functional traits (morphological and physiological) along two altitudinal gradients and (ii) the extent to which these variations were under environmental and/or genetic control using a common garden experiment. For all traits, altitudinal trends tended to be highly consistent between species and transects. For both species, leaf mass per area displayed a positive linear correlation with altitude, whereas leaf size was negatively correlated with altitude. We also observed a significant increase in leaf physiological performance with increasing altitude: populations at high altitudes had higher maximum rates of assimilation, stomatal conductance and leaf nitrogen content than those at low altitudes. In the common garden experiment, genetic differentiation between populations accounted for 0-28% of total phenotypic variation. However, only two traits (leaf mass per area and nitrogen content) exhibited a significant cline. The combination of in situ and common garden experiments used here made it possible to demonstrate, for both species, a weaker effect of genetic variation than of variations in natural conditions, suggesting a strong effect of the environment on leaf functional traits. Finally, we demonstrated that intrapopulation variability was systematically higher than interpopulation variability, whatever the functional trait considered, indicating a high potential capacity to adapt to climate change.

AB 1. Functional diversity has been suggested as an important descriptor of an assemblage and as an indicator of ecosystem function. However, there has been little testing of recent functional diversity measures on field data and across environmental gradients of disturbance and productivity. This study tested how three recently developed measures of functional diversity behave in practice and what could be deduced about assembly rules operating in the systems studied.
   2. Data from 30 plant communities in a small area, comprising arable fields, mown and grazed grasslands, moorland and woodland, were analysed in terms of these diversity indices. Functional Divergence, Evenness and Richness were independent of each other, but Richness correlated to species diversity through the sampling effect.
   3. As evidenced by reduced Functional Richness, habitat filtering operated at a significant proportion of the sites sampled. Functional Richness was also reduced against expectations at high levels of both productivity and disturbance. Functional Divergence showed no clear patterns, but Functional Evenness showed a clear promotion by disturbance and a reduction at high standing biomass.
   4. Synthesis. Knowledge of how functional diversity is related to the environment provides indications of the processes governing community assembly, and the possibility of developing them as measures of ecosystem function.

AB Marine broadcast spawners have two-phase life cycles, with pelagic larvae and benthic adults. Larval supply and settlement link these two phases and are crucial for the persistence of marine populations. Mainly due to the complexity in sampling larval supply accurately, many researchers use settlement as a proxy for larval supply. larval supply is a constraining variable for settlement because, without larval supply, there is no settlement. Larval supply and settlement may not be well correlated, however, and settlement may not consistently estimate larval supply.
   This paper explores the argument that larval supply (i.e., larval abundance near settlement sites) may not relate linearly to settlement. We review the relationship between larval supply and settlement, from estimates and biases in larval supply sampling, to non-behavioral and behavioral components, including small-scale hydrodynamics, competency, gregarious behavior, intensification of settlement, lunar periodicity, predation and cannibalism. Physical and structural processes coupled with behavior, such as small-scale hydrodynamics and intensification of settlement, sometimes result in under- or overestimation of larval supply, where it is predicted from a linear relationship with settlement. Although settlement is a function of larval supply, spatial and temporal processes interact with larval behavior to distort the relationship between larval supply and settlement, and when these distortions act consistently in time and space, they cause biased estimates of larval supply from settlement data.
   Most of the examples discussed here suggest that behavior is the main source of the decoupling between larval supply and settlement because larval behavior affects the vertical distribution of larvae, the response of larvae to hydrodynamics, intensification of settlement, gregariousness, predation and cannibalism. Thus, larval behavior seems to limit broad generalizations on the regulation of settlement by larval supply. Knowledge of the relationship is further hindered by the lack of a well founded theoretical relationship between the two variables. The larval supply-settlement transition may have strong general consequences for population connectivity, since larval supply is a result of larval transport, and settlement constrains recruitment. Thus, measuring larval supply and settlement effectively allows more accurate quantification and understanding of larval transport, recruitment and population connectivity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB P>1. Calcareous grasslands are diversity hotspots for plant and butterfly species in Europe, but connectivity of these grasslands has been reduced by habitat loss and fragmentation in recent decades. Reduced habitat area leads to biodiversity loss, but the significance of habitat connectivity independent of patch size and habitat quality is unclear.
   2. Here, we focus on the impact of habitat connectivity on both butterfly and plant species richness and compare (i) a connectivity index, (ii) percentage habitat cover and (iii) distance to the next suitable habitat patch as alternative measures of connectivity. Species were recorded in 2007 in northern Bavaria (Germany) in paired large and small study sites in 31 independent landscapes.
   3. We found that total loss of grassland connectivity would reduce species richness of specialist butterflies (38-69%) and specialist plants (24-37%). A connectivity index combining patch size and distance in the surrounding landscape was a better measure of connectivity than percentage habitat cover or distance to the next suitable habitat.
   4. Species richness, species density and abundance of habitat-specialist butterflies and plants were significantly higher in large compared with small study sites.
   5.Synthesis and applications. We conclude that connectivity is highly relevant for conservation of butterfly and plant species with specialized habitat requirements, but the decision as to which connectivity measure is most appropriate depends on patch configuration, landscape context and study design. We suggest that management strategies should aim to increase connectivity by active restoration of former calcareous grasslands to ensure long-term survival of habitat-specialist species.

AB Aerosols have always been part of the atmosphere, and plant surfaces are a major aerosol sink. Given the nutrient content of aerosols and the natural stability of aerosol concentrations over evolutionary time, plants may have developed adaptations to aerosol input. Although little is known about such adaptations, leaf surface micro-roughness appears to play a key role.
   This review focuses on the deposition and fate of. ne aerosols that are less than 2.5 mu m in diameter. Most of these aerosols are hygroscopic, and they are often deliquescent (liquid) on transpiring leaves. Such concentrated solutions may be taken up by both the cuticle and stomata, contradicting previous concepts. The establishment of a continuous liquid water connection along stomatal walls affects individual stomata and is a new concept called "hydraulic activation of stomata'' (HAS). HAS enables the efficient bidirectional transport of water and solutes between the leaf interior and leaf surface and makes stomatal transpiration partly independent of stomatal aperture. The response of plants to changes in humidity can be explained by the split transpiration in an HAS pore and its interaction with neighboring stomata, i.e., as an emergent property of a stomatal patch. Normally, HAS affects only a few stomata, but if too many are activated by excessive particle accumulation or additional surfactants, hygroscopic particles may work as "desiccants,'' reducing the drought tolerance of plants. This is made use of when hygroscopic salts and acids are sprayed to kill potato vine, but may cause problems in foliar fertilization. Excessive particle accumulation may also be caused by air pollution. It is hypothesized that deliquescent hygroscopic particles, due to their amorphous appearance, may have been misinterpreted as "degraded waxes.'' Degraded waxes have been highly correlated to leaf loss, decreased drought tolerance, and decreased frost tolerance of trees. No sound explanation for degraded waxes has been found, and they have been interpreted as symptoms of forest decline. Because hygroscopic particles may affect the drought tolerance of trees, they could be drivers of regional tree die-off and especially affect those trees that have adapted to capture aerosols. Several research questions are identified.

AB Diverse landscape elements in cities are valued differently by residents. People are willing to pay a premium for attractive views. This study assessed the amenity value of two major types of natural landscape in Hong Kong: harbor and mountain. The study was based on 1474 transactions in 2005 and 2006 in 18 private housing estates in a residential district. The high-rise and high-density blocks were typical for middle-income housing in the city. The hedonic pricing method was employed to estimate the proportional share of various views and factors on transaction prices. Only harbor view was preferred and reflected in housing value. A broad harbor view could increase the value of an apartment by 2.97%, equivalent to US$ 15,173. Even a confined harbor view could lift price by 2.18% or US$ 11,137. On the contrary, a broad mountain view would depress apartment price by 6.7%. whereas a confined mountain view was statistically insignificant. Increasing distance between an apartment and a preferred natural landscape would lower transaction price. The negative perception of street view induced a price reduction by 3.7%. Building views were tolerated as an inevitable feature of the compact and vertical city. Quantifying the Value of nature and scenic endowments in cities could inform policies and strategies on urban planning. development, nature conservation, and property appraisal.

AB Interspecific hybridization can generate transgressive hybrid phenotypes with extreme trait values exceeding the combined range of the parental species. Such variation can enlarge the working surface for natural selection, and may facilitate the evolution of novel adaptations where ecological opportunity exists. The number of quantitative trait loci fixed for different alleles in different species should increase with time since speciation. If transgression is caused by complementary gene action or epistasis, hybrids between more distant species should be more likely to display transgressive phenotypes. To test this prediction we collected data on transgression frequency from the literature, estimated genetic distances between the hybridizing species from gene sequences, and calculated the relationship between the two using phylogenetically controlled methods. We also tested if parental phenotypic divergence affected the occurrence of transgression. We found a highly significant positive correlation between transgression frequency and genetic distance in eudicot plants explaining 43% of the variance in transgression frequency. In total, 36% of the measured traits were transgressive. The predicted effect of time since speciation on transgressive segregation was unconfounded by the potentially conflicting effects of phenotypic differentiation between species. Our analysis demonstrates that the potential impact hybridization may have on phenotypic evolution is predictable from the genetic distance between species.

AB Valuable insights into mechanisms of community responses to environmental change can be gained by analysing in tandem the variation in functional and taxonomic composition along environmental gradients.
   We assess the changes in species and functional trait composition (i.e. dominant traits and functional diversity) of diverse bee communities in contrasting fire-driven systems in two climatic regions: Mediterranean (scrub habitats in Israel) and temperate (chestnut forests in southern Switzerland).
   In both climatic regions, there were shifts in species diversity and composition related to post-fire age. In the temperate region, functional composition responded markedly to fire; however, in the Mediterranean, the taxonomic response to fire was not matched by functional replacement.
   These results suggest that greater functional stability to fire in the Mediterranean is achieved by replacement of functionally similar species (i.e. functional redundancy) which dominate under different environmental conditions in the heterogeneous landscapes of the region. In contrast, the greater functional response in the temperate region was attributed to a more rapid post-fire vegetation recovery and shorter time-window when favourable habitat was available relative to the Mediterranean.
   Bee traits can be used to predict the functional responses of bee communities to environmental changes in habitats of conservation importance in different regions with distinct disturbance regimes. However, predictions cannot be generalized from one climatic region to another where distinct habitat configurations occur.

AB The genus Rosa has a complex evolutionary history caused by several factors, often in conjunction: extensive hybridization, recent radiation, incomplete lineage sorting, and multiple events of polyploidy. We examined the applicability of AFLP markers for reconstructing (species) relationships in Rosa, using UPGMA clustering, Wagner parsimony, and Bayesian inference. All trees were well resolved, but many of the deeper branches were weakly supported. The cluster analysis showed that the rose cultivars can be separated into a European and an Oriental cluster, each being related to different wild species. The phylogenetic analyses showed that (1) two of the four subgenera (Hulthemia and Platyrhodon) do not deserve subgeneric status; (2) section Carolinae should be merged with sect. Cinnamomeae; (3) subsection Rubigineae is a monophyletic group within sect. Caninae, making sect. Caninae paraphyletic; and (4) there is little support for the distinction of the five other subsections within sect. Caninae. Comparison of the trees with morphological classifications and with previous molecular studies showed that all methods yielded reliable trees. Bayesian inference proved to be a useful alternative to parsimony analysis of AFLP data. Because of their genome-wide sampling, AFLPs are the markers of choice to reconstruct (species) relationships in evolutionary complex groups.

AB Comparison of tree-ring-based warm-season temperature reconstructions and their instrumental target data reveals substantial divergence between (warmer) early instrumental measurements and (colder) proxy estimates. Here we detail this systematic misfit for the Northern Hemisphere before similar to 1900 and the European Alps before similar to 1850. Five hypotheses related to both proxy and target uncertainties are presented towards explaining this phenomenon. These include: (1) tree-ring detrending methods, (2) biological persistence in the proxy time-series, (3) uncertainties and instabilities in the growth response to given climatic parameters, (4) reduced instrumental station availability back in time, and (5) instrumental data homogeneity. We suggest that uncertainties in the choice of instrumental targets at the hemispheric scale, and instrumental data inhomogeneities at the Alpine and possibly also the hemispheric-scale are the most important factors in explaining this offset. Assessment of homogeneity at larger scales remains challenging. Attention is drawn to possible warm biases in early thermometer shelters and the relevance of proxy/target discrepancies for understanding and quantifying the amplitude of both recent anthropogenic and past natural forced climate fluctuations.

AB Two major foci of ecological research involve reciprocal views of the relationship between biodiversity and disturbance: disturbance determines community diversity or diversity determines realized disturbance severity. Here, we present an initial attempt to synthesize these two approaches in order to understand whether feedbacks occur, and what their effects on patterns of diversity might be. Out review of published experiments shows that (i) disturbance severity can be both a cause and a consequence of local diversity in a wide range of ecosystems and (ii) shapes of the unidirectional relationships between diversity and disturbance can be quite variable. To explore how feedbacks between diversity and disturbance might operate to alter expected patterns of diversity in nature, we develop and then evaluate a conceptual model that decomposes the relationships into component parts, considering sequentially the effect of diversity on disturbance severity, and the effect of realized disturbance on diversity loss, subsequent recruitment, and competitive exclusion. Our model suggests that feedbacks can increase mean values of richness, decrease variability, and alter the patterns of correlation between diversity and disturbance in nature. We close by offering ideas for future research to help fill gaps in our understanding of reciprocal relationships among ecological variables like diversity and disturbance.

AB Continuous-trait game theory fills the niche of enabling analytically solvable models of the evolution of biologically realistically complex traits. Game theory provides a mathematical language for understanding evolution by natural selection. Continuous-trait game theory starts with the notion of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) and adds the concept of convergence stability (that the ESS is an evolutionary attractor). With these basic tools in hand, continuous-trait game theory can be easily extended to model evolution under conditions of disruptive selection and speciation, nonequilibrium population dynamics, stochastic environments, coevolution, and more. Many models applying these tools to evolutionary ecology and coevolution have been developed in the past two decades. Going forward we emphasize the communication of the conceptual simplicity and underlying unity of ideas inherent in continuous-trait game theory and the development of new applications to biological questions.

AB Statistical methods for modelling plant species distributions are difficult to evaluate using field data because "truth" is unknown. Artificial data based on explicit theory can be used as "truth". Statistical models should be capable of recovering "truth" if they are to be useful when applied to field data. Use of artificial data in plant community ecology to evaluate statistical methods is reviewed. Two plant community theoretical models based on the continuum concept are identified for describing species responses, the Swan/ter Braak model (Gaussian symmetric unimodal responses) and the Ellenberg/Minchin model (skewed unimodal responses). Theory regarding both indirect and direct environmental gradients is used to simulate a realistic species/environment data set. The software package COMPAS with a restricted set of options is used to generate two types of data set: (1) direct, where species show typical responses to variables such as radiation and (2) indirect, where variables like aspect and slope which are related to radiation by complex environmental processes. An example of generalised linear models (GLM) and generalised additive models (GAM) applied to the artificial data sets by analysts unaware of truth is presented. The results are evaluated on the following criteria: correct selection of predictors; accurate description of response curves; prediction of abundance; and ecologically rational relationships. The potential impacts of differences in the skills of the analysts are discussed. Both GLM and GAM performed well with Gaussian responses and direct gradient predictors. GAM performed marginally better with the skewed response model and direct predictors. GAM performed consistently better than GLM with the indirect predictors. The main conclusion was that the ecological knowledge and statistical skills of the analysts were more important than the method used.

AB In monogamous species, the value of present reproduction is affected by the current condition of the mate, and females may use male ornaments to evaluate his condition and adjust their level of investment according. Many animals display colour in fleshy structures which may be accurate indicators of quality due to their potentially rapid response to changes in condition. Here we show that in the blue-footed booby, Sula nebouxii, male foot colour is structurally (collagen arrays) and pigment based. In 48 h foot colour became duller when males were food deprived and brighter when they were re-fed with fresh fish. Variation of dietary carotenoids induced comparable changes in cell-mediated immune function and foot colour, suggesting that carotenoid-pigmentation reveals the immunological state of individuals. These results suggest that pigment-based foot colour is a rapid honest signal of current condition. In a second experiment, we found that rapid variation in male foot colour caused parallel variation in female reproductive investment. One day after the first egg was laid we captured the males and modified the foot colour of experimental males with a non-toxic and water resistant duller blue intensive make-up, mimicking males in low condition. Females decreased the size of their second eggs, relative to the second egg of control females, when the feet of their mates were experimentally duller. Since brood reduction in this species is related to size differences between brood mates at hatching, by laying lighter second eggs females are facilitating brood reduction. Our data indicate that blue-footed booby females are continuously evaluating their mates and can perform rapid adjustments of reproductive investment by using dynamic sexual traits. We suggest that this fine-tuned adjustment may be widespread in socially monogamous animals.

AB A molecular approach, using aphid-specific monoclonal antibodies, was used to test the hypothesis that alternative prey can affect predation on aphids by linyphiid spiders. These spiders locate their webs in cereal crops within microsites where prey density is high. Previous work demonstrated that of two subfamilies of Linyphiidae, one, the Linyphiinae, is web-dependent and makes its webs at sites where they were more likely to intercept flying insects plus those (principally aphids) falling from the crop above. The other, the Erigoninae, is less web-dependent, making its webs at ground level at sites with higher densities of ground-living detritivores, especially Collembola. The guts of the spiders were analysed to detect aphid proteins using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Female spiders were consuming more aphid than males of both subfamilies and female Linyphiinae were, as predicted, eating more aphid than female Erigoninae. Rates of predation on aphids by Linyphiinae were related to aphid density and were not affected by the availability of alternative prey. However, predation by the Erigoninae on aphids was significantly affected by Collembola density. Itinerant Linyphiinae, caught away from their webs, contained the same concentration of aphid in their guts as web-owners. However, nonweb-owning Erigoninae, living away from Collembola aggregations at web-sites, contained significantly higher concentrations of aphid. For both subfamilies there was evidence of a disproportionate increase in predation on aphids once Collembola populations had declined. It was concluded that nonaphid prey, by helping to maintain spiders in the field, can significantly affect predation on aphids.

AB 1. The relative importance of regional species pools and local ecological processes in governing landscape variation in plant species diversity and productivity was evaluated in a Kansas grassland.
   2. We examined the impact of multispecies sowing treatments and experimental canopy disturbances on plant species diversity and ecosystem processes along a complex natural gradient of plant standing crop.
   3. Data collected 4 years after sowing showed that plant invasion and diversity were seed limited in unproductive sites, but microsite limited in productive sites. Effects of sowing on plant diversity along the natural landscape gradient were paralleled by significant effects of sowing on measures of local plant production and community resilience to disturbance.
   4. These results support the shifting limitations hypothesis (SLH) that landscape gradients in local plant diversity should reflect shifts in the major regulating factor, from species pools to local ecological processes, as one moves from sites of inherently low to inherently high productivity.
   5. Our findings also indicate that diversity at the level of the available propagule pool acts to constrain ecosystem productivity and stability by mediating local community assembly, by determining the availability of key species, and by governing opportunities for functional compensation within the community.
   6. In total, our results support an emerging view that community processes and ecosystem functions are dynamically linked and act reciprocally to constrain each other.

AB We review an increasingly commonly used experimental approach in avian ecological studies that typifies the difficulties of maximizing two major components of experimental design: internal and external validity. Avian ecologists estimate reproductive success by measuring the rate at which nests in specified treatment groups fledge or fail. Because real bird nests are time-consuming and difficult to find and are rarely dispersed across treatments in sufficient numbers for powerful statistical analyses, investigators often utilize artificial nests, which are human-constructed surrogates baited with eggs and distributed in the field across treatments of interest. The primary advantage of artificial nests is that investigators can control the distribution and numbers of nests. The underlying assumption of similar predation rates on artificial and real nests is almost never tested. In the few studies that directly compare predation of artificial and real nests, however, external validity (or the degree to which results of an experiment can be generalized to subjects other than the experimental sample) is poor: predation of artificial nests differs from that of real nests in unpredictable and inconsistent directions. A primary reason for discrepancies may be that real and artificial nests attract different predators. We conclude that past protocols for use of artificial nests should be abandoned unless investigators carefully demonstrate minimal bias between measures of predation on real and artificial nests.

AB Phyteuma globulariifolium is a high alpine plant species growing in the European Alps and the Pyrenees. In order to elucidate its glacial history, 325 individuals from 69 populations were analysed using the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique. A strongly hierarchical phylogeographical pattern was detected: Two major east-west vicariant groups can be separated along a gap in the distributional area. A further subdivision into at least four populational groups is in congruence with presumed peripheral glacial refugia. There is no indication for survival on unglaciated mountain tops (nunataks) in the interior of the Pleistocene ice shield covering the Alps. Our results favour glacial survival in peripheral, unglaciated or not fully glaciated areas. Populations of P. globulariifolium in the Pyrenees are the result of relatively recent long-distance dispersal. Within the Alps, there is strong differentiation among groups of populations, whereas within them the differentiation is weak. This suggests high levels of gene-flow over short to middle distances.

AB Carbohydrate stores may hold the answer to the old question whether treeline trees are carbon limited. However, it is still unknown how sensitively mobile carbon pools reflect the carbon supply status of trees in cold climates. There may be an inherent lower limit to the depiction of these pools, which could restrict their usefulness as indicator values. Here we examined the responsiveness of non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations in tissues of trees which were either defoliated (removal of sources), debudded (removal of sinks) or pruned (removal of both sources and sinks) in naturally grown Pinus cembra L. at the upper treeline in the Swiss Central Alps. Complete defoliation and pruning of 66% of all branches in late winter caused a massive reduction of NSC (glucose, fructose, sucrose and starch) in all tissues during and after the following growing season, whereas 100% debudding led to a small increase of NSC, except in new buds. The NSC concentration in roots was most sensitive. Commonly, starch represented the greatest fraction of NSC. Complete defoliation before budbreak significantly reduced height growth of trees and the length of new needles; 66% pruning reduced height growth as well, but led to greater length of current-year needles. We conclude that the NSC pool in treeline trees responds to a perturbation of the source/sink balance over a wide range of NSC concentrations. Growth responses reflect the availability of carbohydrates. The seasonal variation of whole tree NSC appears to be a promising marker for testing the carbon-limitation hypothesis in treeline trees.

AB A previous study of the hybrid zone in western Panama between white-collared (Manacus candei) and golden-collared manakins (M. vitellinus) documented the unidirectional introgression of vitellinus male secondary sexual traits across the zone. Here, we examine the hybrid zone in greater genetic and morphological detail. Statistical comparisons of clines are performed using maximum-likelihood and nonparametric bootstrap methods. Our results demonstrate that an array of six molecular and two morphometric markers agree in cline position and width. Clines for male collar and belly color are similar in width to the first eight clines, but are shifted in position by at least five cline widths. The result is that birds in intervening populations are genetically and morphometrically very like parental candei, but males have the plumage color of parental vitellinus. Neither neutral diffusion nor nonlinearity of color scales appear to be viable explanations for the large cline shifts. Genetic dominance of vitellinus plumage traits is another potential explanation that will require breeding experiments to test. Sexual selection remains a plausible explanation for the observed introgression of vitellinus color traits in these highly dimorphic, polygynous. lek-mating birds. Two other clines, including a nondiagnostic isozyme locus, are similar in position to the main cluster of clines, but are broader in width. Thus, introgression at some loci is greater than that detected with diagnostic markers. Assuming that narrow clines are maintained by selection, variation in cline width indicates that selection is not uniform throughout the genome and that diagnostic markers are under more intense selective pressure. The traditional focus on diagnostic markers in studies of hybrid zones may therefore lead to underestimates of average introgression. This effect may be more pronounced in organisms with low levels of genetic divergence between hybridizing taxa.

AB Eutrophication and contamination with micropollutants have been major problems in water quality management. Both problems have been subjected to extensive research and modelling but traditionally are treated separately. Traditional simulation models for aquatic systems can be categorised as eutrophication models, contaminant fate models, food web models and food chain bioaccumulation models. Because they are single issue models, many interactions and feedbacks between the food web, nutrient and toxicant cycles are missed. Linking these models is essential to evaluate the fate and risks of contaminants in systems with changing nutrient loading, to assess the natural attenuation of contaminants or to understand the selfpurifying capacity of ecosystems. Combination of the single issue models requires inclusion of 'interaction processes' to account for the coupling between the (sub-) model types, such as organic carbon cycling, toxicity, transport and accumulation of organic contaminants in the food chain, and bottom up versus top down control of primary production and nutrient cycling. This review first provides a brief overview of traditional approaches in modelling eutrophication, contaminant fate, food web dynamics and food chain bioaccumulation. Second, five existing integrated eutrophication, fate and/or effects models are reviewed. Third, the gaps and limitations in modelling the four types of interaction processes are discussed. It is concluded that these models are invaluable tools to focus attention to feedback mechanisms that are often overlooked, to identify dominating processes in ecosystems, to formulate counterintuitive hypotheses on ecosystem functioning, or to assess short term risks of acutely toxic stressors, However, the potential of integrated models for long term simulations of contaminant exposure, food chain bioaccumulation and effects to higher trophic levels remains limited, mainly because of principal limitations in food web modelling. In contrast, the potential of integrated models for long term simulations of contaminant fate is better because the environmental distribution of contaminants is mainly determined by the major abiotic compartments and by biotic compartments at the base of the food chain.

AB We examined the dynamics of avian communities associated with fragmented grasslands in Oklahoma, USA, using long-term (1965-1995) raw (stop-level) data from the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). Aerial photography was used to document changes in land cover type and landscape pattern as affected by woody plant (mostly Juniperus virginiana L.) encroachment and concurrent cropland conversions to agricultural grassland under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Rank trend analysis identified species with significant population trends, and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to identify important environmental gradients from a group of descriptive habitat variables that included land cover type composition and indices of vegetation cover, landscape pattern, and grassland patch structure.
   Avian community structure shifted along gradients of increasing woody plant cover and indicators of continuing landscape fragmentation. Open-habitat generalists, woodland, and successional scrub species generally increased, whereas many grassland species decreased. In some instances, neotropical migrants responded positively to increasing woody vegetation. Some grassland birds also showed a positive response to increases in agricultural grassland, but only in areas of severe juniper encroachment. Most grassland species exhibited consistent declines related to the influx of woody vegetation and associated landscape changes.
   Woody plant encroachment into southern Great Plains grasslands already fragmented by agricultural activity represents a conservation management dilemma. Although woody vegetation in remnant native prairies may provide habitat for some declining neotropical migrants that require shrubby areas, grassland structure and suitability is compromised for many declining grassland-endemic birds. Cropland conversion to agricultural grassland does appear to provide suitable habitat for some grassland species. However, this benefit appears to be limited to areas where woody plant invasion into grasslands is relatively advanced, and may have only a temporary effect, as most CRP areas are likely to return to agricultural production in the near future. Changes are needed in grassland management practices to restrict woody plant encroachment and fragmentation; otherwise, continued declines in grassland bird populations can be expected.

AB 1. The effects of human-caused fragmentation of boreal forest on the abundance of red fox Vulpes vulpes L. and pine marten Martes martes L. were studied by combining the Finnish wildlife-triangle snow-track data (1990-94) with land-use and forest resources data employing the GIS. Two study areas (each 45 000 km(2)) located in northern and southern Finland were selected for the investigation.
   2. The extent of landscape that best explained predator abundance (tracks per 10 km 24 h(-1)) was the same (about 100 km(2)) in both species and study areas.
   3. The decreasing proportion of older forest and the increasing proportions of young forest and agricultural land in the landscape positively affected track density of red fox. The relationship between agricultural land and fox abundance, however, was characterized by a convex curve peaking at 20-30% of agricultural land. With the habitat classification used, landscape composition explained 26% and 11% of the spatial variation in fox abundance in the northern and southern study area, respectively.
   4. The relationship between landscape composition and pine marten abundance was not as clear as in that of red fox. Landscape composition explained 10% and 6% of spatial variation in pine marten abundance in the northern and southern study area, respectively. In both areas a positive impact occurred with the increasing proportion of young forest in the landscape, but in the northern area the negative effect of increasing proportion of agricultural land was dominant.
   5. The abundances of red fox and pine marten were not negatively correlated, indicating that competition or intraguild predation by red fox do not determine abundance of pine marten on a landscape scale.
   6. A general increase in predation pressure by generalist predators in fragmented forest landscapes has been an intensively discussed conservation problem during recent years. We conclude that the red fox is a species potentially able to cause elevated predation pressure in boreal landscapes fragmented by human activities, but that the evidence against the pine marten is weaker.

AB Landscape ecology includes the study of the effects of spatial patterning of habitats on biotic and abiotic processes. Seagrass beds occur in a variety of spatial configurations providing a model system to test how spatial patterning of habitats influences ecological processes. We established four replicate plots over very patchy (22% cover),patchy (70% cover), and continuous (97% cover) seagrass beds so that each plot contained approximately 100 m(2) of vegetated bottom. Fifty individually marked scallops were placed within the seagrass in each plot and their survivorship monitored over three replicate 24-h periods, and growth and survival monitored over an additional four-week period. There was no pattern in survivorship with differences in habitat configuration over the first three 24-h of the experiment. By four weeks, more scallops were lost to predation in the very patchy seagrass beds than in the patchy or continuous beds. There was a non-significant trend for increased growth of juvenile scallops with increased patchiness of the seagrass habitat. Vegetation characteristics such as shoot density, biomass, and blade length, which have been shown to affect survival of seagrass-associated invertebrates, were not significantly different among seagrass beds with different spatial configurations. Our results demonstrate that spatial patterning of the habitat, independent of structural characteristics of the seagrass, can alter rates of predation on seagrass inhabitants. This implies that habitat utilization and/or foraging strategies of predators change with the spatial patterning of the vegetation and that very patchy seagrass beds may provide habitats where transfer of secondary production to higher trophic levels is great.

AB Hybridization has played an important role in the evolution of many lineages. With the growing availability of genomic tools and advancements in genomic analyses, it is becoming increasingly clear that gene flow between divergent taxa can generate new phenotypic diversity, allow for adaptation to novel environments, and contribute to speciation. Hybridization can have immediate phenotypic consequences through the expression of hybrid vigor. On longer evolutionary time scales, hybridization can lead to local adaption through the introgression of novel alleles and transgressive segregation and, in some cases, result in the formation of new hybrid species. Studying both the abundance and the evolutionary consequences of hybridization has deep historical roots in plant biology. Many of the hypotheses concerning how and why hybridization contributes to biological diversity currently being investigated were first proposed tens and even hundreds of years ago. In this Update, we discuss how new advancements in genomic and genetic tools are revolutionizing our ability to document the occurrence of and investigate the outcomes of hybridization in plants.

AB Accurate estimation of the gross primary production (GPP) of terrestrial ecosystems is vital fora better understanding of the spatial-temporal patterns of the global carbon cycle. In this study, we estimate GPP in North America (NA) using the satellite-based Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), MODIS images at 8-day temporal and 500 m spatial resolutions, and NCEP-NARR (National Center for Environmental Prediction-North America Regional Reanalysis) climate data. The simulated GPP (GPP(VPM)) agrees well with the flux tower derived GPP (GPP(EC)) at 39 AmeriFlux sites (155 site-years). The GPP(VPM) in 2010 is spatially aggregated to 0.5 by 0.5 grid cells and then compared with sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data from Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument 2 (GOME-2), which is directly related to vegetation photosynthesis. Spatial distribution and seasonal dynamics of GPP(VPM) and GOME-2 SIF show good consistency. At the biome scale, GPP(VPM) and SIF shows strong linear relationships (R-2 > 0.95) and small variations in regression slopes (4.60-5.55 g C m(-2) day(-1)/mW m(-2) nm(-1) sr(-1)). The total annual GPP(VPM) in NA in 2010 is approximately 13.53 Pg C year(-1), which accounts for similar to 11.0% of the global terrestrial GPP and is within the range of annual GPP estimates from six other process-based and data-driven models (11.35-22.23 Pg C year(-1)) Among the seven models, some models did not capture the spatial pattern of GOME-2 SIF data at annual scale, especially in Midwest cropland region. The results from this study demonstrate the reliable performance of VPM at the continental scale, and the potential of SIF data being used as a benchmark to compare with GPP models.

AB Although diversity-stability relationships have been extensively studied in local ecosystems, the global biodiversity crisis calls for an improved understanding of these relationships in a spatial context. Here, we use a dynamical model of competitive metacommunities to study the relationships between species diversity and ecosystem variability across scales. We derive analytic relationships under a limiting case; these results are extended to more general cases with numerical simulations. Our model shows that, while alpha diversity decreases local ecosystem variability, beta diversity generally contributes to increasing spatial asynchrony among local ecosystems. Consequently, both alpha and beta diversity provide stabilising effects for regional ecosystems, through local and spatial insurance effects respectively. We further show that at the regional scale, the stabilising effect of biodiversity increases as spatial environmental correlation increases. Our findings have important implications for understanding the interactive effects of global environmental changes (e. g. environmental homogenisation) and biodiversity loss on ecosystem sustainability at large scales.

AB Here we present results of a three-year study to determine the fate of imidacloprid residues in hive matrices and to assess chronic sublethal effects on whole honey bee colonies fed supplemental pollen diet containing imidacloprid at 5, 20 and 100 mu g/kg over multiple brood cycles. Various endpoints of colony performance and foraging behavior were measured during and after exposure, including winter survival. Imidacloprid residues became diluted or non-detectable within colonies due to the processing of beebread and honey and the rapid metabolism of the chemical. Imidacloprid exposure doses up to 100 mu g/kg had no significant effects on foraging activity or other colony performance indicators during and shortly after exposure. Diseases and pest species did not affect colony health but infestations of Varroa mites were significantly higher in exposed colonies. Honey stores indicated that exposed colonies may have avoided the contaminated food. Imidacloprid dose effects was delayed later in the summer, when colonies exposed to 20 and 100 mu g/kg experienced higher rates of queen failure and broodless periods, which led to weaker colonies going into the winter. Pooled over two years, winter survival of colonies averaged 85.7, 72.4, 61.2 and 59.2% in the control, 5, 20 and 100 mu g/kg treatment groups, respectively. Analysis of colony survival data showed a significant dose effect, and all contrast tests comparing survival between control and treatment groups were significant, except for colonies exposed to 5 mu g/kg. Given the weight of evidence, chronic exposure to imidacloprid at the higher range of field doses (20 to 100 mu g/kg) in pollen of certain treated crops could cause negative impacts on honey bee colony health and reduced overwintering success, but the most likely encountered high range of field doses relevant for seed-treated crops (5 mu g/kg) had negligible effects on colony health and are unlikely a sole cause of colony declines.

AB Knowledge of spatiotemporal patterns in species distribution is fundamental to understanding the ecological and evolutionary processes shaping communities. The emergence of DNA-based tools has expanded the geographic and taxonomic scope of studies examining spatial and temporal distribution of mycorrhizal fungi. However, the nature of spatiotemporal patterns documented and subsequent interpretation of ecological processes can vary significantly from study to study. In order to look for general patterns we synthesize the available data across different sampling scales and mycorrhizal types. The results of this analysis shed light on the relative importance of space, time and vertical soil structure on community variability across different mycorrhizal types. Although we found no significant trend in spatiotemporal variation among mycorrhizal types, the vertical community variation was distinctly greater than the spatial and temporal variability in mycorrhizal fungal communities. Both spatial and temporal variability of communities was greater in topsoil compared with lower horizons, suggesting that greater environmental heterogeneity drives community variation on a fine scale. This further emphasizes the importance of both niche differentiation and environmental filtering in maintaining diverse fungal communities.

AB Determining how ecological and evolutionary processes produce spatial variation in local species richness remains an unresolved challenge. Using mountains as a model system, we outline an integrative research approach to evaluate the influence of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms on the generation and maintenance of patterns of species richness along and among elevational gradients. Biodiversity scientists interested in patterns of species richness typically start by documenting patterns of species richness at regional and local scales, and based on their knowledge of the taxon, and the environmental and historical characteristics of a mountain region, they then ask whether diversity-environment relationships, if they exist, are explained mostly by ecological or evolutionary hypotheses. The final step, and perhaps most challenging one, is to tease apart the relative influence of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms. We propose that elucidating the relative influence of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms can be achieved by taking advantage of the replicated settings afforded by mountains, combined with targeted experiments along elevational gradients. This approach will not only identify potential mechanisms that drive patterns of species richness, but also allow scientists to generate more robust hypotheses about which factors generate and maintain local diversity.

AB 1Global warming is predicted to dramatically alter communities' composition through differential colonization abilities, such as between sessile plants and their mobile herbivores. Novel interactions between previously non-overlapping species may, however, also be mediated by altered plants' responses to herbivore attack.
   Syndromes of plant defences and tolerance are driven by inherited functional traits, biotic and abiotic conditions, and the geographical and historical contingencies affecting the community. Therefore, understanding climate change-driven herbivore responses and evolution towards a particular plant defence syndrome is key to forecasting species interactions in the near future.
   In this paper, we first document variations in herbivory, and plant defences along altitudinal gradients that act as natural experiments'. We then use an empirical model to predict how specialist herbivore abundance may shift with respect to elevation in the near future.
   Our field surveys and field experiment showed a decrease in herbivory with elevation. However, contrary to expectations, our meta-regression analyses showed that plant defences, particularly leaf toughness and flavonoid compounds, tend to be higher at high elevations, while secondary metabolites showed no clear trend with elevation.
   Based on those results, we discuss how plant communities and species-specific plant defence syndromes will change in response to the climate-driven herbivore colonization of higher altitudes. Particularly, plant from high elevation, due to high protection against abiotic stress may be already ecologically fitted to resist the sudden increase in herbivory pressure that they will likely experience during global change.

AB Land-use change is the main driver of global biodiversity loss, but its relative impact on species turnover (-diversity) across multiple spatial scales remains unclear. Plant communities in fragmented rain forests can undergo declines (floristic homogenization) or increases (floristic differentiation) in -diversity. We tested these alternative hypotheses analysing a large vegetation data base from a hierarchically nested sampling design (450 plots in 45 forest patches in 3 landscapes with different deforestation levels) at Los Tuxtlas rain forest, Mexico. Differences in -diversity across spatial scales (i.e. among plots, among patches, and among landscapes) were analysed using multiplicative diversity decompositions of Hill numbers. Plant -diversity among plots within forest patches decreased in landscapes with higher deforestation levels, leading to floristic homogenization within patches. This homogenization process can be explained by the loss of rare and shade-tolerant plant species, and the recruitment and dominance of disturbance-adapted species, and can limit the accumulation of species (-diversity) in landscapes with higher deforestation. Nevertheless, the landscape with the highest deforestation level showed the highest floristic differentiation among patches. This landscape showed the greatest isolation distances between patches; a landscape spatial pattern that can limit the interchange of seeds (and species) between patches. Because the study patches are undergoing secondary succession following disturbances (e.g. logging, edge effects), different disturbance regimes and increased distance among patches could lead to higher -diversity.Synthesis. These findings indicate that patterns of floristic homogenization and differentiation depend on the landscape configuration and on the spatial scale of analysis. At the landscape scale, our results suggest that, in accordance with non-equilibrium dynamics and the landscape-divergence hypothesis, patches located in landscapes with different forest cover and different connectivity can experience contrasting successional pathways due to increasing levels of compositional differentiation between patches. These novel findings add further uncertainties to the maintenance of biodiversity in severely deforested tropical landscapes and have key ecological implications for biodiversity conservation planning.

AB Recent innovations in phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) have spurred a renaissance of research into the causes and consequences of large-scale patterns of biodiversity. In this paper, we review these advances. We also highlight the potential of comparative methods to integrate across fields and focus on three examples where such integration might be particularly valuable: quantitative genetics, community ecology, and paleobiology. We argue that PCMs will continue to be a key set of tools in evolutionary biology, shedding new light on how evolutionary processes have shaped patterns of biodiversity through deep time.

AB The erection of dams alters habitat and longitudinal stream connectivity for migratory diadromous and potamodromous fish species and interrupts much of organismal exchange between freshwater and marine ecosystems. In the US, this disruption began with colonial settlement in the seventeenth century but little quantitative assessment of historical impact on accessible habitat and population size has been conducted. We used published surveys, GIS layers and historical documents to create a database of 1356 dams, which was then analyzed to determine the historical timeline of construction, use and resultant fragmentation of watersheds in Maine, US. Historical information on the anadromous river herring was used to determine natural upstream boundaries to migration and establish total potential alewife spawning habitat in nine watersheds with historic populations. Dams in Maine were constructed beginning in 1634 and by 1850 had reduced accessible lake area to less than 5% of the virgin 892 km(2) habitat and 20% of virgin stream habitat. There is a near total loss of accessible habitat by 1860 that followed a west-east pattern of European migration and settlement. Understanding historic trends allows current restoration targets to be assessed and prioritized within an ecosystem-based perspective and may inform expectations for future management of oceanic and freshwater living resources.

AB Understanding and predicting the distribution of organisms in heterogeneous environments lies at the heart of ecology. The spatial distribution of fish populations observed in the wild results from the complex interactions of multiple controls both external or internal to the fish populations. Whilst species distribution models (SDMs) have been mostly concerned with static description of species distribution as a function of environmental constraints, models of animal movements (MAMs) have focussed on the dynamic nature of spatial distribution of groups of individuals under a number of constraints external and internal to the population. Besides SDMs and MAMs, modelling the spatial distribution of fish populations can be achieved by models that are fundamentally static (like SDMs) but can also incorporate many hypotheses on the control of fish spatial distribution (like MAMs). The hypotheses underlying these models need to make sense at the population level - rather than at the individual or species level -we term these 'population distribution models' (PDMs). PDMs are statistical models that rely on several hypotheses, which include: (i) control through geographical attachment, (ii) environmental conditions, (iii) density-dependent habitat selection, (iv) spatial dependency, (v) population demographic structure, (vi) species interactions and (vii) population memory. We review the basis behind each of these conceptual models and we examine corresponding numerical applications. We argue that the conceptual models are complementary rather than competing, that existing numerical applications are still rarely compared and combined, and that PDMs can offer a statistical framework to achieve this. We recommend that the numerical models associated with different hypotheses be constructed within such a common general framework. This will permit evaluation, comparison and combination of the multiple hypotheses on fish spatial distribution. It will ultimately lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the factors controlling the spatial distribution of fish populations and to more accurate predictions in which model uncertainty is accounted for.

AB Species distribution models (SDMs) were applied to predict the distribution of benthic species in the North Sea. An understanding of species distribution patterns is essential to gain insight into ecological processes in marine ecosystems and to guide ecosystem management strategies. Therefore, we compared 9 different SDM methods, including GLM, GBM, FDA, SVM, RF, MAXENT, BIOCLIM, GARP and MARS, by using 10 environmental variables to model the distribution of 20 marine benthic species. Most of the models showed good or very good performance in terms of predictive power and accuracy, with highest mean area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.845 and 0.840, obtained for the MAXENT and GBM models, respectively. The poorest performance was shown by the BIOCLIM model, which had a mean AUC of 0.708. Nevertheless, the mapped distribution patterns varied remarkably depending on the model used, with up to 32.5% differences in predictions between models. For species with a narrow distribution range, the models showed a better performance based on the AUC than for species with a broad distribution range, which can most likely be attributed to the restricted spatial scale and the model evaluation procedure. Of the environmental variables, bottom water temperature and depth had the greatest effect on the distribution of 14 benthic species, based on MAXENT results. We examine the potential utility of this strategy for predicting future distribution of benthic species in response to climate change.

AB Question
   What plant properties might define plant functional types (PFTs) for the analysis of global vegetation responses to climate change, and what aspects of the physical environment might be expected to predict the distributions of PFTs?
   Methods
   We review principles to explain the distribution of key plant traits as a function of bioclimatic variables. We focus on those whole-plant and leaf traits that are commonly used to define biomes and PFTs in global maps and models.
   Results
   Raunkiaer's plant life forms (underlying most later classifications) describe different adaptive strategies for surviving low temperature or drought, while satisfying requirements for reproduction and growth. Simple conceptual models and published observations are used to quantify the adaptive significance of leaf size for temperature regulation, leaf consistency for maintaining transpiration under drought, and phenology for the optimization of annual carbon balance. A new compilation of experimental data supports the functional definition of tropical, warm-temperate, temperate and boreal phanerophytes based on mechanisms for withstanding low temperature extremes. Chilling requirements are less well quantified, but are a necessary adjunct to cold tolerance. Functional traits generally confer both advantages and restrictions; the existence of trade-offs contributes to the diversity of plants along bioclimatic gradients.
   Conclusions
   Quantitative analysis of plant trait distributions against bioclimatic variables is becoming possible; this opens up new opportunities for PFT classification. A PFT classification based on bioclimatic responses will need to be enhanced by information on traits related to competition, successional dynamics and disturbance.

AB A highly supported maximum-likelihood species phylogeny for the genus Bradyrhizobium was inferred from a supermatrix obtained from the concatenation of partial atpD, recA, glnII, and rpoB sequences corresponding to 33 reference strains and 76 bradyrhizobia isolated from the nodules of Glycine max (soybean) trap plants inoculated with soil samples from Myanmar, India, Nepal, and Vietnam. The power of the multigene approach using multiple strains per species was evaluated in terms of overall tree resolution and phylogenetic congruence, representing a practical and portable option for bacterial molecular systematics. Potential pitfalls of the approach are highlighted. Seventy-five of the isolates could be classified as B. japonicum type Ia (USDA110/USDA122-like), B. liaoningense, B. yuanmingense, or B. elkanii, whereas one represented a novel Bradyrhizobium lineage. Most Nepalese B. japonicum Ia isolates belong to a highly epidemic clone closely related to strain USDA110. Significant phylogenetic evidence against the monophyly of the of B. japonicum I and Ia lineages was found. Analysis of their DNA polymorphisms revealed high population distances, significant genetic differentiation, and contrasting population genetic structures, suggesting that the strains in the Ia lineage are misclassified as B. japonicum. The DNA polymorphism patterns of all species conformed to the expectations of the neutral mutation and population equilibrium models and, excluding the B. japonicum Ia lineage, were consistent with intermediate recombination levels. All species displayed epidemic clones and had broad geographic and environmental distribution ranges, as revealed by mapping climate types and geographic origins of the isolates on the species tree.

AB Models that posit speciation in the face of gene flow are replacing classical views that hybridization is rare between animal species. We use a multilocus approach to examine the history of hybridization and gene flow between two species of chipmunks (Tamias ruficaudus and T. amoenus). Previous studies have shown that these species occupy different ecological niches and have distinct genital bone morphologies, yet appear to be incompletely isolated reproductively in multiple areas of sympatry. We compared data from four sequenced nuclear loci and from seven microsatellite loci to published cytochrome b sequences. Interspecific gene flow was primarily restricted to introgression of the T. ruficaudus mitochondrial genome into a sympatric subspecies of T. amoenus, T. a. canicaudus, with the four sequenced nuclear loci showing little to no interspecific allele sharing. Microsatellite data were consistent with high levels of differentiation between the species and also showed no current gene flow between broadly sympatric populations of T. a. canicaudus and T. ruficaudus. Coalescent analyses date the mtDNA introgression event from the mid-Pleistocene to late Pliocene. Overall, these data indicate that introgression has had a minimal impact on the nuclear genomes of T. amoenus and T. ruficaudus despite multiple independent hybridization events. Our findings challenge long-standing assumptions on patterns of reproductive isolation in chipmunks and suggest that there may be other examples of hybridization among the 23 species of Tamias that occur in western North America.

AB Sexual selection theory traditionally considers choosiness for mates to be negatively related to intra-sexual competition. Males were classically considered to be the competing, but not the choosy, sex. However, evidence of male choosiness is now accumulating. Male choosiness is expected to increase with an individual's competitive ability, and to decrease as intra-sexual competition increases. However, such predictions have never been tested in field conditions. Here, we explore male mate choice in a spider by studying size-assortative pairing in two natural sites that strongly differ in the level of male-male competition. Unexpectedly, our results demonstrate that mate choice shifts from opportunism to high selectivity as competition between males increases. Males experiencing weak competition did not exhibit size-related mating preferences. By contrast, when competition was intense we found strong size-assortative pairing due to male choice: while larger, more competitive males preferentially paired with larger, more fecund females, smaller males chose smaller females. Thus, we show that mating preferences of males vary with their competitive ability. The distinct preferences exhibited by males of different sizes seem to be an adaptive response to the lower reproductive opportunities arising from increased competition between males.

AB Phylogenies of major groups of insects based on both morphological and molecular data have sometimes been contentious, often lacking the data to distinguish between alternative views of relationships. This paucity of data is often due to real biological and historical causes, such as shortness of time spans between divergences for evolution to occur and long time spans after divergences for subsequent evolutionary changes to obscure the earlier ones. Another reason for difficulty in resolving some of the relationships using molecular data is the limited spectrum of genes so far developed for phylogeny estimation. For this latter issue, there is cause for current optimism owing to rapid increases in our knowledge of comparative genomics. At least some historical patterns of divergence may, however, continue to defy our attempts to completely reconstruct them with confidence, at least using current strategies.

AB We review the current understandings of the frequency, spatial distributions, mechanisms, and ecological consequences of fire in riparian zones. Riparian zones are well known for influencing many ecological processes at local to landscape scales, and fire can have an important ecosystem-scale influence on them. Riparian zones differ from surrounding uplands in their biophysical templates, moisture regimes and disturbance regimes; as a consequence the characteristics and effects of fire are different than in adjacent uplands. Fire impacts on riparian zones vary proportionally with the severity and extent of burning in the catchment and are affected by stream size. Riparian zones can act as a buffer against fire and therefore as a refuge for fire-sensitive species. However, under some circumstances, such as dry pre-fire climatic conditions and the accumulation of dry fuel, riparian areas become corridors for fire movement. Fire incursion into riparian zones creates canopy gaps and drier conditions, which allow subsequent build up of dead wood and establishment of fire adapted species. In concert, this increases fuel loads and the probability of another fire. Secondary effects of riparian fire include altering nutrient fluxes and cycling, increasing sediment loads, and stimulating erosion. We conclude that riparian fires are potentially important in shaping ecological characteristics in many regions, but this is poorly quantified. A better understanding of riparian fire regimes is essential to assess the effects of fire in helping shape the complex ecological characteristics of riparian zones over the longer-term.

AB The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revolutionized the field of diagnostics, and today it has routine applications in medical, veterinary, forensic and botanical sciences. The fields of biological control and insect pest management have generally been slow to adopt PCR-based diagnostics in comparison with other fields of science. However, there has been increasing interest in the use of molecular diagnostic tools in arthropod biological control. In applied entomology, molecular techniques have generally been used for insect identification and systematics; however, PCR-based techniques are increasingly becoming recognized as valuable tools in ecological studies. Here, we review research that has used PCR-based techniques for parasitoid and predator/prey identification and detection, and place these studies in the context of their contributions to biological control of arthropods. The status and future directions of diagnostic molecular markers in applied entomology and insect pest management are also discussed.

AB Intermittent streams are common worldwide, and the ability of invertebrates to recover from floods and drought is a key feature of communities from these highly disturbed ecosystems. The macroinvertebrate assemblages of Kings Creek in northeastern Kansas were sampled regularly from four intermittent and two perennial sites over 2 years (1995-1996) to investigate the response and recovery to seasonal drying and floods. A similar to 9 mo drying period reduced taxa richness and density to 14% and 3% of pre-drying assemblages, respectively, in 1995-1996, whereas a 2 mo drying period reduced richness by half and density to 4% of pre-drying assemblages in 1996. Floods at intermittent sites reduced densities and richness by 95% and similar to50%, respectively. A > 50 y-flood reduced macroinvertebrate richness by 97% and density by > 99% at a downstream perennial site. Resistance and resilience of total macroinvertebrate density was typically greater to floods than to drying, whereas resilience of taxa richness did not differ between disturbance types. The time required for recovery to pre-flood conditions ( richness and density) was half as long ( 27 vs. 76 day) for intermittent sites compared to perennial sites. Colonization of intermittent sites was a function of distance from upstream refugia. Floods were a more important disturbance on assemblages in a downstream reach as compared to upstream reaches. In contrast, upstream reaches were more likely to dry. Recovery following flood and drought was dominated by colonization as opposed to tolerance, thus resilience is more important than resistance in regulating macroinvertebrate communities in these streams, and relative position in the landscape affects disturbance type, intensity, and ability of communities to recover from disturbance.

AB Leaf-level morphological and structural adaptations to reduce water loss were examined in five olive (Olea europaea L.) tree cultivars (Arbequina, Blanqueta, Cobranqosa, Manzanilla and Negrinha) growing under field conditions with low water availability. Leaf measurements included leaf tissue thickness, stomatal density, leaf area, leaf mass per unit area, density of leaf tissue, relative water content, succulence, water saturation deficit, water content at saturation and cuticular transpiration rate. We found considerable genotypic differences among the cultivars. Negrinha, Manzanilla and Cobranqosa had more morphological and structural leaf adaptations to protect against water loss than the other cultivars. Manzanilla and Negrinha enhanced their sclerophylly by building parenchyma tissues and increasing protective structures like the upper cuticle and both the upper and lower epidermis. Cobrancosa exhibited good protection against water loss through high density of foliar tissue and by thick cuticle and trichome layers. Compared with the Negrinha, Manzanilla and Cobrangosa cultivars, Arbequina leaves had a thinner trichome layer, implying that the leaves were less protected against water loss; however, the development of smaller leaves may reduce water loss at the whole-plant level. Among cultivars, Blanqueta had the largest leaves and some anatomical traits that may lead to high water loss, especially from the adaxial surface. The mechanisms employed by the cultivars to cope with summer stress are discussed at the morpho-structural level.

ID SHORELINE VEGETATION; ZONATION; PLANTS; HABITAT
AB Hydrological and vegetation data from 21 New Zealand lakes were used in the study, to assess how water level fluctuations affected the diversity of a low-growing species-rich littoral plant community (here LMC).
   Species diversity of the LMC was affected by the water level range, the frequency of variation and the duration of low water level events. Diversity tended to increase with monthly level range, with a possible saturation at an inter-quartile range (the monthly water level fluctuation occurring between 25 and 75% of the time) of approximately 1 m. The species richness was much lower in lakes with inter-annual level variations than in lakes with intra-annual fluctuations. This indicates a relative long establishment time for a species-rich LMC. Up to a period of 1 month, increasing duration of events below median water level appeared to increase species diversity, though events longer than 2 months reduced it. To determine what hydrological conditions determine the upper depth limit of the LMC we made a series of paired sample tests of the measured upper limit of the LMC and the water levels where the mean length of dry period is 10, 30, 60, 120 and 180 days. We found that the observed upper limit best corresponded to the level where the dry period lasted between 10 and 30 days. Hence, the community was not observed where aerial exposure exceeds 30 days. Amongst the species found in the LMC, Elatine gratioloides, Glossostigma sp., Lilaeopsis ruthiana and Limosella lineata are the commonest species under most conditions, and can be considered as the most competitive species in the community. A generalised optimum habitat for a diverse LMC can thus be defined as occurring in a 1 m monthly water level range, with a mean duration of low level events lasting up to 1 month in lakes with low inter-annual water level fluctuation.

AB Field boundaries are generally considered as important semi-natural environments in agrarian landscapes. The aim of this paper is to provide a methodological framework towards a holistic approach for field boundary studies. First, an overview of the successive milestones that have been passed in the history of hedgerow studies is given. These are classified a posteriori and then related to the succession of dominant ecological paradigms. Secondly, we show how former results have been used and integrated into a multiple scale approach involving agronomic and ecological studies in hedgerow network landscapes of western France. The hypothesis is that the main determinants of hedgerow biodiversity are related to farming activities. This hypothesis has been tested in three hedgerow network landscapes differing in their density of hedgerows and their relative abundance of grassland versus crops. The dominant agriculture of the region is dairy production, utilising grassland, maize and cereals. We focus on plant biodiversity and relate it to farming activities described from the boundary up to the landscape. The results show that the composition of the plant assemblages of the herb layer of field boundaries depends upon complex interactions between local structure, herb layer management, field use, farm types and landscape structure. The latter factors are related to the diversity of farming systems. Finally, the advantages of such an approach in terms of fundamental and applied landscape management aspects are discussed, showing how our framework of hedgerow studies expands by successive incorporation, rather than by rejection of former approaches. The main lesson is that it is necessary to capitalise on closer collaboration between ecologists and agronomists in order to stimulate future development of field boundary management and planning.

AB The observation that, for unstressed plants, light use efficiency of a plant canopy, defined as the ratio of net primary productivity (NPP) to absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), is approximately constant with respect to changes in APAR, implies that NPP can be modeled using a linear relationship with APAR. However, such a linear relationship is counter-intuitive because the relationship between leaf photosynthesis and absorbed light is strongly nonlinear. Three arguments have been advanced to explain the observed linear relationship between NPP and APAR. In this paper, a detailed, physiologically based model of canopy radiation absorption and photosynthesis (MAESTRO) was used to analyze these arguments.
   The first argument is that the canopy is structured so that radiation is distributed throughout the canopy such that most leaves are exposed to non-saturating quantum flux density, resulting in a linear response of canopy photosynthesis to APAR. Simulations of MAESTRO indicated that this explanation is inadequate, because daily values of canopy photosynthetic light use efficiency calculated with MAESTRO were highly variable regardless of canopy structure.
   The second argument is that variability in light use efficiency decreases with increasing time scale. The simulations showed that this is true to some extent, although simulated annual canopy photosynthetic light use efficiency still varies across sites with different LAI or light climate.
   The third argument is that changes in canopy nitrogen content act both to maximize net canopy photosynthesis and to keep light use efficiency constant. This argument could not be tested with the model, but the failure of the first two explanations suggests that this third explanation deserves closer attention.

ID GRADIENT ANALYSIS; COLORADO; CLIMATE; UPLIFT
AB Leaf physiognomy provides estimates of environmental parameters, including mean annual enthalpy, which is a thermodynamic parameter of the atmosphere that varies with altitude. Analyses of 12 mid-Miocene floras from western Nevada indicate that this part of the Basin and Range Province stood similar to 3 kilometers above sea level at 15 to 16 million years ago, which is 1 to 1.5 kilometers higher than its present altitude. Much, if not all, of the collapse to present-day altitudes seems to have been achieved by similar to 13 million years ago, The crust in much of this area has been extended and thinned throughout the past 40 to 50 million years, and the isostatic balance of a thinning crust requires subsidence, not uplift as suggested by previous paleobotanical work.

ID DRY-MATTER ACCUMULATION; GENETIC-IMPROVEMENT; GRAIN; ENVIRONMENT;
   SORGHUM; YIELD
AB Differences in dry matter accumulation among crop cultivars can be attributed to differences in either the absorptance of incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and/or the conversion of absorbed PAR into dry matter.  This study was conducted to quantify the contribution of radiation use efficiency (RUE, g dry matter MJ-1) to the difference in dry matter accumulation between an old and a new maize (Zea mays L.) hybrid.  An old (Pride 5) and a new (Pioneer 3902) maize hybrid were grown during 1989 and 1990 at the Elora Research Station, Ontario, on a London loam (Aquic Hapludalf) soil that had been tile drained.  Both hybrids were grown at their respective optimum plant density for grain yield (i.e., 7 plants/m2 for Pride 5 and 8 plants/m2 for Pioneer 3902) and, in addition, the new hybrid was grown at 5 plants/m2 which resulted in a leaf area index (LAI) similar to that of the old hybrid grown at its optimum plant density.  Starting at silking, 2-wk crop growth rates (CGR, kg ha-1 d-1) were measured until physiological maturity, and incident PAR and absorptance of PAR by the three treatments were monitored during three 2-wk periods after silking.  From silking to 6 wk postsilking, PAR absorption did not differ among the two hybrids grown at plant densities that resulted in similar LAIs, but crop growth rate was 19% larger for the new hybrid.  The difference in crop growth rate between the old and the new hybrid grown at their respective optimum plant density was 33%; approximately 80% of the difference could be attributed to a higher RUE of the new hybrid.  The difference in RUE was not associated with a change in the distribution of PAR across the canopy, i.e., extinction coefficients did not differ among treatments.  Dry matter accumulation declined for all treatments after 8 wk postsilking, but the decline was steeper for the old hybrid and the decline was associated with rate of leaf senescence.  In conclusion, increased dry matter accumulation of new maize hybrids after silking can be attributed, in a large part, to increased radiation use efficiency.

AB A large array of species distribution model (SDM) approaches has been developed for explaining and predicting the occurrences of individual species or species assemblages. Given the wealth of existing models, it is unclear which models perform best for interpolation or extrapolation of existing data sets, particularly when one is concerned with species assemblages. We compared the predictive performance of 33 variants of 15 widely applied and recently emerged SDMs in the context of multispecies data, including both joint SDMs that model multiple species together, and stacked SDMs that model each species individually combining the predictions afterward. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of these SDM approaches by examining their performance in predicting withheld empirical validation data of different sizes representing five different taxonomic groups, and for prediction tasks related to both interpolation and extrapolation. We measure predictive performance by 12 measures of accuracy, discrimination power, calibration, and precision of predictions, for the biological levels of species occurrence, species richness, and community composition. Our results show large variation among the models in their predictive performance, especially for communities comprising many species that are rare. The results do not reveal any major trade-offs among measures of model performance; the same models performed generally well in terms of accuracy, discrimination, and calibration, and for the biological levels of individual species, species richness, and community composition. In contrast, the models that gave the most precise predictions were not well calibrated, suggesting that poorly performing models can make overconfident predictions. However, none of the models performed well for all prediction tasks. As a general strategy, we therefore propose that researchers fit a small set of models showing complementary performance, and then apply a cross-validation procedure involving separate data to establish which of these models performs best for the goal of the study.

ID CLIMATE; CIRCULATION; TURNOVER
AB While there is a clear demand for scenarios that provide alternative states in biodiversity with respect to future emissions, a thorough analysis and communication of the associated uncertainties is still missing. Here, we modelled the global distribution of similar to 11,500 amphibian, bird and mammal species and project their climatic suitability into the time horizon 2050 and 2070, while varying the input data used. By this, we explore the uncertainties originating from selecting species distribution models (SDMs), dispersal strategies, global circulation models (GCMs), and representative concentration pathways (RCPs). We demonstrate the overwhelming influence of SDMs and RCPs on future biodiversity projections, followed by dispersal strategies and GCMs. The relative importance of each component varies in space but also with the selected sensitivity metrics and with species' range size. Overall, this means using multiple SDMs, RCPs, dispersal assumptions and GCMs is a necessity in any biodiversity scenario assessment, to explicitly report associated uncertainties.

AB Large carnivores are persecuted globally because they threaten human industries and livelihoods. How this conflict is managed has consequences for the conservation of large carnivores and biodiversity more broadly. Mitigating human-predator conflict should be evidence-based and accommodate people's values while protecting carnivores. Despite much research into human and large-carnivore coexistence strategies, there have been few attempts to document the success of conflict-mitigation strategies on a global scale. We conducted a meta-analysis of global research on conflict mitigation related to large carnivores and humans. We focused on conflicts that arise from the threat large carnivores pose to livestock. We first used structured and unstructured searching to identify replicated studies that used before-after or control-impact design to measure change in livestock loss as a result of implementing a management intervention. We then extracted relevant data from these studies to calculate an overall effect size for each intervention type. Research effort and focus varied among continents and aligned with the histories and cultures that shaped livestock production and attitudes toward carnivores. Livestock guardian animals most effectively reduced livestock losses. Lethal control was the second most effective control, although its success varied the most, and guardian animals and lethal control did not differ significantly. Financial incentives have promoted tolerance of large carnivores in some settings and reduced retaliatory killings. We suggest coexistence strategies be location-specific, incorporate cultural values and environmental conditions, and be designed such that return on financial investment can be evaluated. Improved monitoring of mitigation measures is urgently required to promote effective evidence-based policy.

AB The widespread use of 'statistical significance' as a license for making a claim of a scientific finding leads to considerable distortion of the scientific process (according, to the American Statistical Association). We review why degrading p-vaIues into 'significant' and 'nonsignificant' contributes to making studies irreproducible, or to making them seem irreproducible. A major problem is that we tend to take small p values at face value, but mistrust results with larger p-values. In either case, p-values tell little about reliability of research, because they are hardly replicable even if an alternative hypothesis is true. Also significance (p < 0.05) is hardly replicable: at a good statistical power of 80%, two studies will be 'conflicting', meaning that one is significant and the other is not, in one third of the cases if there is a true effect. A replication can therefore not be interpreted as having failed only because it is nonsignificant. Many apparent replication failures may thus reflect faulty judgment based on significance thresholds rather than a crisis of unreplicable research. Reliable conclusions on replicability and practical importance of a finding can only be drawn using cumulative evidence from multiple independent studies. However, applying significance thresholds makes cumulative knowledge unreliable. One reason is that with anything but ideal statistical power, significant effect sizes will be biased upwards. Interpreting inflated significant results while ignoring nonsignificant results will thus lead to wrong conclusions. But current incentives to hunt for significance lead to selective reporting and to publication bias against nonsignificant findings. Data dredging, p-hacking, and publication bias should be addressed by removing fixed significance thresholds. Consistent with the recommendations of the late Ronald Fisher, p-values should be interpreted as graded measures of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. Also larger p-values offer some evidence against the null hypothesis, and they cannot be interpreted as supporting the null hypothesis, falsely concluding that 'there is no effect'. Information on possible true effect sizes that are compatible with the data must be obtained from the point estimate, e.g., from a sample average, and from the interval estimate, such as a confidence interval. We review how confusion about interpretation of larger p values can be traced back to historical disputes among the founders of modern statistics. We further discuss potential arguments against removing significance thresholds, for example that decision rules should rather be more stringent, that sample sizes could decrease, or that p-values should better be completely abandoned. We conclude that whatever method of statistical inference we use, dichotomous threshold thinking must give way to non-automated informed judgment.

AB 1. Forests account for a substantial part of the terrestrial biomass storage and productivity. To better understand forest productivity, we need to disentangle the processes underlying net biomass change.
   2. We tested how above-ground net biomass change and its underlying biomass dynamics (biomass recruitment, growth and mortality) can be explained by four alternative and contested hypotheses; the soil fertility, biomass ratio, niche complementarity and vegetation quantity hypotheses.
   3. Above-ground biomass dynamics were evaluated over a 5-year period in 200 permanent sample plots in 8 tropical dry forests in Brazil, and related to soil fertility, community-weighted mean (CWM) traits that are important for carbon storage and sequestration (wood density, specific leaf area, maximum stem diameter and deciduousness), species richness, functional diversity and initial stand biomass.
   4. Initial stand biomass was the best predictor of all three processes of biomass dynamics, providing strong support for the vegetation quantity hypothesis. In these dry forests, the dominance of conservative species, rather than of acquisitive species, is associated with high biomass growth and storage, probably because their low specific leaf area and high wood density allow them to keep on functioning during drought stress.
   5. Paradoxically, high soil fertility (Ca) led to low biomass productivity, probably because of nutrient imbalance.
   6. In contrast to what is shown for controlled experiments, we found no support for niche complementarity (in terms of functional diversity or species richness) for forest productivity. Biomass storage was favoured by low-rather than high trait diversity, as most of the biomass is concentrated in species with large stem diameter and high wood density. 7. Synthesis. Biomass dynamics are mainly shaped by vegetation quantity, and then by vegetation quality, in line with the mass ratio hypothesis. Dry forests show different trait-productivity relationships than wet forests, as stands with 'slow' trait values are 'fast' in terms of productivity. Diversity matters, but in a different way than expected; high trait diversity does not enhance productivity, but instead, does low trait diversity enhance carbon storage.

AB Research about ecosystem services (ES) often aims to generate knowledge that influences policies and institutions for conservation and human development. However, we have limited understanding of how decision-makers use ES knowledge or what factors facilitate use. Here we address this gap and report on, to our knowledge, the first quantitative analysis of the factors and conditions that explain the policy impact of ES knowledge. We analyze a global sample of cases where similar ES knowledge was generated and applied to decision-making. We first test whether attributes of ES knowledge themselves predict different measures of impact on decisions. We find that legitimacy of knowledge is more often associated with impact than either the credibility or salience of the knowledge. We also examine whether predictor variables related to the science-to-policy process and the contextual conditions of a case are significant in predicting impact. Our findings indicate that, although many factors are important, attributes of the knowledge and aspects of the science-to-policy process that enhance legitimacy best explain the impact of ES science on decision-making. Our results are consistent with both theory and previous qualitative assessments in suggesting that the attributes and perceptions of scientific knowledge and process within which knowledge is coproduced are important determinants of whether that knowledge leads to action.

AB Biologists are often confronted with high levels of unexplained variation when studying the processes that determine genetic and species diversity. Here, we argue that eco-evolutionary interactions might often play an important role during colonization and have longstanding effects on populations and communities. Adaptation following colonization can produce a strong positive feedback loop that promotes priority effects and context-dependent trajectories of population or species assembly. We establish how monopolization, and more generally evolution-mediated priority effects, influence ecological patterns at multiple scales of space, time, and biological organization. We then highlight the underappreciated implications for our understanding of population and landscape genetics, adaptive evolution, community diversity, biogeography, and conservation biology. We indicate multiple future directions for research, including extending theory beyond competition.

AB Ecosystem health assessment is always one of the key topics of ecosystem management. However, few studies has focused on assessing ecosystem health of landscapes, which are geo-spatial units composed of different kinds of ecosystem mosaics. Healthy ecosystems should sustainably provide a range of ecosystem services to meet human needs, and such a concept often cannot be expressed using the traditional ecosystem health assessment. Using Shenzhen City in China as a case study area, this research aims to assess the ecosystem health of urban landscapes based on ecosystem services. Results showed a distinct deterioration of urban ecosystem health for all of the 30 units assessed in Shenzhen City during 1978-2005. Five levels were classified with respect to health using fixed thresholds. There were 12 towns appearing with the worst level and 4 towns disappearing with the best level in 2005 compared with the status in 1978. Although there was no significant decrease in the level of health during 1978-2000, by 2005 more than 70% of towns belonged to the top two levels, classifying them as unhealthy. Among all the assessing indicators, the indicators of ecosystem organization contributed least to ecosystem health, except in 1986, and ecosystem services were found to be the most contributive indicator during 1978-2005. It was also suggested that land use patterns provided an integrating bridge among regional ecosystem health, economic development, and environmental performances. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The honey bee, the world's most important agricultural pollinator, relies exclusively on plant-derived foods for nutrition. Nectar and pollen collected by honey bees are processed and matured within the nest through the activities of honey bee-derived microbes and enzymes. In order to better understand the contribution of the microbial community to food processing in the honey bee, we generated a metatranscriptome of the honey bee gut microbiome. The function of the microbial community in the honey bee, as revealed by metatranscriptome sequencing, resembles that of other animal guts and food-processing environments. We identified three major bacterial classes that are active in the gut (-Proteobacteria, Bacilli and Actinobacteria), all of which are predicted to participate in the breakdown of complex macromolecules (e.g. polysaccharides and polypeptides), the fermentation of component parts of these macromolecules, and the generation of various fermentation products, such as short-chain fatty acids and alcohol. The ability of the microbial community to metabolize these carbon-rich food sources was confirmed through the use of community-level physiological profiling. Collectively, these findings suggest that the gut microflora of the honey bee harbours bacterial members with unique roles, which ultimately can contribute to the processing of plant-derived food for colonies.

AB The rate of biological invasions is expected to increase as the effects of climate change on biological communities become widespread. Climate change enhances habitat disturbance which facilitates the establishment of invasive species, which in turn provides opportunities for hybridization and introgression. These effects influence local biodiversity that can be tracked through genetic and genomic approaches. Metabarcoding and metagenomic approaches provide a way of monitoring some types of communities under climate change for the appearance of invasives. Introgression and hybridization can be followed by the analysis of entire genomes so that rapidly changing areas of the genome are identified and instances of genetic pollution monitored. Genomic markers enable accurate tracking of invasive species' geographic origin well beyond what was previously possible. New genomic tools are promoting fresh insights into classic questions about invading organisms under climate change, such as the role of genetic variation, local adaptation and climate pre-adaptation in successful invasions. These tools are providing managers with often more effective means to identify potential threats, improve surveillance and assess impacts on communities. We provide a framework for the application of genomic techniques within a management context and also indicate some important limitations in what can be achieved.

AB The genetic diversity of our crop plants has been substantially reduced during the process of domestication and breeding. This reduction in diversity necessarily constrains our ability to expand a crop's range of cultivation into environments that are more extreme than those in which it was domesticated, including into "sustainable" agricultural systems with reduced inputs of pesticides, water, and fertilizers. Conversely, the wild progenitors of crop plants typically possess high levels of genetic diversity, which underlie an expanded (relative to domesticates) range of adaptive traits that may be of agricultural relevance, including resistance to pests and pathogens, tolerance to abiotic extremes, and reduced dependence on inputs. Despite their clear potential for crop improvement, wild relatives have rarely been used systematically for crop improvement, and in no cases, have full sets of wild diversity been introgressed into a crop. Instead, most breeding efforts have focused on specific traits and dealt with wild species in a limited and typically ad hoc manner. Although expedient, this approach misses the opportunity to test a large suite of traits and deploy the full potential of crop wild relatives in breeding for the looming challenges of the 21st century. Here we review examples of hybridization in several species, both intentionally produced and naturally occurring, to illustrate the gains that are possible. We start with naturally occurring hybrids, and then examine a range of examples of hybridization in agricultural settings.

AB The seasonal and spatial variations of phytoplankton community and their correlation with environmental factors, as well as the applicability of phytoplankton to serve as biological water quality indicator in Lake Chaohu are investigated in the present study. 97 phytoplankton species were identified, in which 35.1% of Cyanophyta and 37.1% of Chlorophyta. In terms of the community composition at the annual average level and the spatial distribution, Cyanophyta was absolutely dominant (more than 99.4% of the total). The main dominant species in Lake Chaohu were Microcystis viridis, Microcystis flos-aquae, and Anabaena circinalis, all belonging to Cyanophyta. The average phytoplankton cell density of the dominant species showed substantial seasonal differences. In Lake Chaohu, the M. flos-aquae was dominant in spring and summer; while the M. viridis and the A. circinalis were dominant in autumn and in winter, respectively. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that the water temperature (T), oxidation reduction potential (ORP), dissolved oxygen (DO) and orthophosphate (PO43--P) were the environmental factors having the greatest influence on the phytoplankton community composition in Lake Chaohu, whereas T, ORP, total suspended solids (TSS) and total nitrogen (TN) were the most important environmental factors in the inflow and outflow rivers. The average species number of phytoplankton was lowest, and the average cell density of phytoplankton was highest in summer, which corresponded to the worst water quality, as indicated by physical and chemical indicators, TSS, DO, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total phosphorus (TP); while, in winter, the average species number of phytoplankton was largest, and the average cell density of phytoplankton was lowest, which corresponded to the best water quality, as indicated by TSS, DO, COD and TP. This implied that the species number and cell density of phytoplankton could serve as biological water quality indicators, which would give overall descriptions of water quality by combining with the physical and chemical indicators.

AB It is usually assumed that modern language is a recent phenomenon, coinciding with the emergence of modern humans themselves. Many assume as well that this is the result of a single, sudden mutation giving rise to the full "modern package." However, we argue here that recognizably modern language is likely an ancient feature of our genus pre-dating at least the common ancestor of modern humans and Neandertals about half a million years ago. To this end, we adduce a broad range of evidence from linguistics, genetics, paleontology, and archaeology clearly suggesting that Neandertals shared with us something like modern speech and language. This reassessment of the antiquity of modern language, from the usually quoted 50,000-100,000 years to half a million years, has profound consequences for our understanding of our own evolution in general and especially for the sciences of speech and language. As such, it argues against a saltationist scenario for the evolution of language, and toward a gradual process of culture gene co-evolution extending to the present day. Another consequence is that the present-day linguistic diversity might better reflect the properties of the design space for language and not just the vagaries of history, and could also contain traces of the languages spoken by other human forms such as the Neandertals.

AB Distribution models are used to predict the likelihood of occurrence or abundance of a species at locations where census data are not available. An integral part of modelling is the testing of model performance. We compared different schemes and measures for testing model performance using 79 species from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The four testing schemes we compared featured increasing independence between test and training data: resubstitution, random data hold-out and two spatially segregated data hold-out designs. The different testing measures also addressed different levels of information content in the dependent variable: regression R2 for absolute abundance, squared correlation coefficient r2 for relative abundance and AUC/Somer's D for presence/absence. We found that higher levels of independence between test and training data lead to lower assessments of prediction accuracy. Even for data collected independently, spatial autocorrelation leads to dependence between random hold-out test data and training data, and thus to inflated measures of model performance. While there is a general awareness of the importance of autocorrelation to model building and hypothesis testing, its consequences via violation of independence between training and testing data have not been addressed systematically and comprehensively before. Furthermore, increasing information content (from correctly classifying presence/absence, to predicting relative abundance, to predicting absolute abundance) leads to decreasing predictive performance. The current tests for presence/absence distribution models are typically overly optimistic because a) the test and training data are not independent and b) the correct classification of presence/absence has a relatively low information content and thus capability to address ecological and conservation questions compared to a prediction of abundance. Meaningful evaluation of model performance requires testing on spatially independent data, if the intended application of the model is to predict into new geographic or climatic space, which arguably is the case for most applications of distribution models.

AB The 'rain use efficiency' (RUE) may be defined as the ratio of above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) to annual precipitation, and it is claimed to be a conservative property of the vegetation cover in drylands, if the vegetation cover is not subject to non-precipitation related land degradation. Consequently, RUE may be regarded as means of normalizing ANPP for the impact of annual precipitation, and as an indicator of non-precipitation related land degradation. Large scale and long term identification and monitoring of land degradation in drylands, such as the Sahel, can only be achieved by use of Earth Observation (EO) data. This paper demonstrates that the use of the standard EO-based proxy for ANPP, summed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies 3rd generation (GIMMS3g)) over the year (Sigma NDVI), and the blended EO/rain gauge based data-set for annual precipitation (Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation, CMAP) results in RUE-estimates which are highly correlated with precipitation, rendering RUE useless as a means of normalizing for the impact of annual precipitation on ANPP. By replacing SNDVI by a 'small NDVI integral', covering only the rainy season and counting only the increase of NDVI relative to some reference level, this problem is solved. Using this approach, RUE is calculated for the period 1982-2010. The result is that positive RUE-trends dominate in most of the Sahel, indicating that non-precipitation related land degradation is not a widespread phenomenon. Furthermore, it is argued that two preconditions need to be fulfilled in order to obtain meaningful results from the RUE temporal trend analysis: First, there must be a significant positive linear correlation between annual precipitation and the ANPP proxy applied. Second, there must be a near-zero correlation between RUE and annual precipitation. Thirty-seven percent of the pixels in Sahel satisfy these requirements and the paper points to a range of different reasons why this may be the case.

AB The migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, is the most widely distributed grasshopper species in the world. However, its global genetic structure and phylogeographic relationships have not been investigated. In this study, we explored the worldwide genetic structure and phylogeography of the locust populations based on the sequence information of 65 complete mitochondrial genomes and three mitochondrial genes of 263 individuals from 53 sampling sites. Although this locust can migrate over long distances, our results revealed high genetic differentiation among the geographic populations. The populations can be divided into two different lineages: the Northern lineage, which includes individuals from the temperate regions of the Eurasian continent, and the Southern lineage, which includes individuals from Africa, southern Europe, the Arabian region, India, southern China, South-east Asia and Australia. An analysis of population genetic diversity indicated that the locust species originated from Africa. Ancestral populations likely separated into Northern and Southern lineages 895 000 years ago by vicariance events associated with Pleistocene glaciations. These two lineages evolved in allopatry and occupied their current distributions in the world via distinct southern and northern dispersal routes. Genetic differences, caused by the long-term independent diversification of the two lineages, along with other factors, such as geographic barriers and temperature limitations, may play important roles in maintaining the present phylogeographic patterns. Our phylogeographic evidence challenged the long-held view of multiple subspecies in the locust species and tentatively divided it into two subspecies, L. m. migratoria and L. m. migratorioides.

AB Aim Across all latitudes, high-elevation tree lines represent a drastic change in the dominant plant life-form, from upright trees to low-stature alpine plants. Although associated with low temperatures, the physiological mechanisms controlling this boundary are still not clear. The growth-limitation hypothesis assumes a direct low-temperature restriction of tissue formation at otherwise sufficient photoassimilation. In order to test this hypothesis, we present a global synthesis of previously published and new data on tree carbon supply status at high-elevation tree lines. Location Global; 13 regions between 68 degrees N and 45 degrees S. Methods Late-season concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in foliage and branch wood were measured at three elevations across the tree line ecotones, from upper tall forests (timber line) to the edges of aborescent tree growth (tree line). Year-round records of -10 cm soil temperatures were taken at the tree line. Results Despite large differences in elevation and season length, the mean growing season temperature at the tree line was similar (approximately 6.6 degrees C) between all sites. NSC concentrations were not depleted at any of the elevation gradients between timber line and tree line, indicating no shortage of C at the uppermost tree stands. Tested across all sites, NSC concentrations in fact significantly increased with elevation. On average, NSC increased by 18% in leaves and 26% in branch wood from the lowest to the highest stands, primarily due to higher starch concentrations rather than free sugars. Hence, these responses do not reflect osmotic adjustments to lower temperatures at the end of the growing season. Main conclusions This global data set contributes to a mechanistic understanding of tree line formation based on biological principles across climatic zones and tree genera. No evidence of C shortage was found at the high-elevation tree line in either seasonal and non-seasonal regions. The increasing trend of NSC concentrations with elevation is in line with the growth-limitation hypothesis.

AB Temperate forest soils store globally significant amounts of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). Understanding how soil pools of these two elements change in response to disturbance and management is critical to maintaining ecosystem services such as forest productivity, greenhouse gas mitigation, and water resource protection. Fire is one of the principal disturbances acting on forest soil C and N storage and is also the subject of enormous management efforts. In the present article, we use meta-analysis to quantify fire effects on temperate forest soil C and N storage. Across a combined total of 468 soil C and N response ratios from 57 publications (concentrations and pool sizes), fire had significant overall effects on soil C (-26%) and soil N (-22%). The impacts of fire on forest floors were significantly different from its effects on mineral soils. Fires reduced forest floor C and N storage (pool sizes only) by an average of 59% and 50%, respectively, but the concentrations of these two elements did not change. Prescribed fires caused smaller reductions in forest floor C and N storage (-46% and -35%) than wildfires (-67% and -69%), and the presence of hardwoods also mitigated fire impacts. Burned forest floors recovered their C and N pools in an average of 128 and 103 years, respectively. Among mineral soils, there were no significant changes in C or N storage, but C and N concentrations declined significantly (-11% and -12%, respectively). Mineral soil C and N concentrations were significantly affected by fire type, with no change following prescribed burns, but significant reductions in response to wildfires. Geographic variation in fire effects on mineral soil C and N storage underscores the need for region-specific fire management plans, and the role of fire type in mediating C and N shifts (especially in the forest floor) indicates that averting wildfires through prescribed burning is desirable from a soils perspective.

AB Forest responses to climate change will depend on demographic impacts in the context of competition. Current models used to predict species responses, termed climate envelope models (CEMs), are controversial, because (i) calibration and prediction are based on correlations in space (CIS) between species abundance and climate, rather than responses to climate change over time (COT), and (ii) they omit competition. To determine the relative importance of COT, CIS, and competition for light, we applied a longitudinal analysis of 27 000 individual trees over 6-18 years subjected to experimental and natural variation in risk factors. Sensitivities and climate and resource tracking identify which species are vulnerable to these risk factors and in what ways. Results show that responses to COT differ from those predicted based on CIS. The most important impact is the effect of spring temperature on fecundity, rather than any input variable on growth or survival. Of secondary importance is growing season moisture. Species in the genera Pinus, Ulmus, Magnolia, and Fagus are particularly vulnerable to climate variation. However, the effect of competition on growth and mortality risk exceeds the effects of climate variation in space or time for most species. Because sensitivities to COT and competition are larger than CIS, current models miss the most important effects. By directly comparing sensitivity to climate in time and space, together with competition, the approach identifies which species are sensitive to climate change and why, including the heretofore overlooked impact on fecundity.

AB Measurements of the energy balance components of a small boreal lake (area 0.041 km(2), mean depth 2.5 m) in southern Finland were performed during four open water periods (April-October) in 2005-2008. Turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat acquired using the eddy covariance technique were accompanied by net radiation and water heat storage measurements. In April the lake was near isothermal, whereas in May the development of a thermocline was enabled by dark water color and a sheltered location. The thermocline continued to deepen until September down to the depth of 3.5 m and prevented the deeper water from interacting with the atmosphere. The sensible heat flux was governed by the air-water temperature difference and had its minimum in the afternoon (values down to -45 W m(-2)) and peaked in the early morning (values up to 32 W m(-2)). The monthly means ranged from -9 W m(-2) (April 2005) to 24 W m(-2) (July 2008). The diurnal variation of the latent heat flux, controlled by vapor pressure deficit, had an opposite diurnal phase with a maximum in the afternoon (values up to 120 W m(-2)) and minimum in the morning (values down to similar to 2 W m(-2)). The monthly averages ranged from 4 W m(-2) (October 2008) to 77 W m(-2) (July 2006). Furthermore, the lake acted as a heat sink until July and August when the maximum heat content was about 230 MJ m(-2). The monthly energy balance closure varied from 57% to 112%, and the average closure was 82% (residual 16 W m(-2)) and 72% (residual 23 W m(-2)) for 2006 and 2007, respectively.

AB Aquatic plant invasions are often associated with long-distance dispersal of vegetative propagules and prolific clonal reproduction. These reproductive features combined with genetic bottlenecks have the potential to severely limit genetic diversity in invasive populations. To investigate this question we conducted a global scale population genetic survey using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers of the world's most successful aquatic plant invader - Eichhornia crassipes (water hyacinth). We sampled 1140 ramets from 54 populations from the native (South America) and introduced range (Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, Central America and the Caribbean). Although we detected 49 clones, introduced populations exhibited very low genetic diversity and little differentiation compared with those from the native range, and similar to 80% of introduced populations were composed of a single clone. A widespread clone ('W') detected in two Peruvian populations accounted for 70.9% of the individuals sampled and dominated in 74.5% of the introduced populations. However, samples from Bangladesh and Indonesia were composed of different genotypes, implicating multiple introductions to the introduced range. Nine of 47 introduced populations contained clonal diversity suggesting that sexual recruitment occurs in some invasive sites where environmental conditions favour seedling establishment. The global patterns of genetic diversity in E. crassipes likely result from severe genetic bottlenecks during colonization and prolific clonal propagation. The prevalence of the 'W' genotype throughout the invasive range may be explained by stochastic sampling, or possibly because of pre-adaptation of the 'W' genotype to tolerate low temperatures.

AB Background: The increasing availability of gene sequences of prokaryotic species in samples extracted from all kind of locations allows addressing the study of the influence of environmental patterns in prokaryotic biodiversity. We present a comprehensive study to address the potential existence of environmental preferences of prokaryotic taxa and the commonness of the specialist and generalist strategies. We also assessed the most significant environmental factors shaping the environmental distribution of taxa.
   Results: We used 16S rDNA sequences from 3,502 sampling experiments in natural and artificial sources. These sequences were taxonomically assigned, and the corresponding samples were also classified into a hierarchical classification of environments. We used several statistical methods to analyze the environmental distribution of taxa. Our results indicate that environmental specificity is not very common at the higher taxonomic levels (phylum to family), but emerges at lower taxonomic levels (genus and species). The most selective environmental characteristics are those of animal tissues and thermal locations. Salinity is another very important factor for constraining prokaryotic diversity. On the other hand, soil and freshwater habitats are the less restrictive environments, harboring the largest number of prokaryotic taxa. All information on taxa, samples and environments is provided at the envDB online database, http://metagenomics.uv.es/envDB.
   Conclusions: This is, as far as we know, the most comprehensive assessment of the distribution and diversity of prokaryotic taxa and their associations with different environments. Our data indicate that we are still far from characterizing prokaryotic diversity in any environment, except, perhaps, for human tissues such as the oral cavity and the vagina.

AB During 2005-2007, we used the eddy covariance and associated hydrometric methods to construct energy and water budgets along a chronosequence of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantations that included a mid-rotation stand (LP) (i.e., 13-15 years old) and a recently established stand on a clearcut site (CC) (i.e., 4-6 years old) in Eastern North Carolina. Our central objective was to quantify the differences in both energy and water balances between the two contrasting stands and understand the underlining mechanisms of environmental controls. We found that the LP site received about 20% more net radiation (R-n) due to its lower averaged albedo (alpha) of 0.25, compared with that at the CC (alpha = 0.34). The mean monthly averaged Bowen ratios (beta) at the LP site were 0.89 +/- 0.7, significantly (p = 0.02) lower than at the CC site (1.45 +/- 1.2). Higher net radiation resulted in a 28% higher (p = 0.02) latent heat flux (LE) for ecosystem evapotranspiration at the LP site, but there was no difference in sensible heat flux (H) between the two contrasting sites. The annual total evapotranspiration (ET) at the LP site and CC site was estimated as 1011-1226 and 755-855 mm year(-1), respectively. The differences in ET rates between the two contrasting sites occurred mostly during the non-growing seasons and/or dry periods, and they were small during peak growing seasons or wet periods. Higher net radiation and biomass in LP were believed to be responsible to the higher ET. The monthly ET/Grass Reference ET ratios differed significantly across site and season. The annual ET/P ratio for the LP and CC were estimated as 0.70-1.13 and 0,60-0.88, respectively, indicating higher runoff production from the CC site than the LP site. This study implied that reforestation practices reduced Surface albedos and thus increased available energy, but they did not necessarily increase energy for warming the atmosphere in the coastal plain region where soil water was generally not limited. This study showed the highly variable response of energy and water balances to forest management due to climatic variability. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Monitoring of photosynthetic efficiency (epsilon) over space and time is a critical component of climate change research as it is a major determinant of the amount of carbon accumulated by terrestrial ecosystems. While the past decade has seen progress in the remote estimation of c at the leaf, canopy and stand level using the photochemical reflectance index PRI (based on the normalized difference of reflectance at 531 and 570 nm), little is known about the temporal and spatial requirements for up-scaling PRI to landscape and global levels using satellite observations. One potential way to investigate these requirements is using automated tower-based remote sensing platforms, which observe stand level reflectance with high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution. Prediction of epsilon from PRI diurnally or over a full year requires observations of canopy reflectance over multiple view and sun-angles. As a result, these observations are subject to directional reflectance effects which can be interpreted in terms of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) using semi-empirical kernel driven models. These semi-empirical models use a combination of physically based BRDF shapes and empirical observations to standardize rnulti-angular observations to a common viewing and illumination geometry. Directional reflectance effects are thereby modeled as a linear superposition of mathematical kernels, representing the bi-direction variation in reflectance from isotropic, geometric, and volumetric scattering components of the vegetation canopy. However, because variations in plant physiological conditions can also introduce bidirectional reflectance variations, we introduce an approach to separate bidirectional effects arising purely from plant physiological status from other effects by stratifying PRI observations into categories based on environmental conditions for which the expected physiological variability is low. Within each of these PRI strata, the derived physically based BRDF shapes were used to standardize multi-angular PRI measurements to a common viewing and illumination geometry. The method significantly enhanced the relationship found between PRI and epsilon (from r(2)=0.38 for the directionally uncorrected case to r(2)=0.82 for the directionally corrected case) from data measured continuously over the course of 1 year over an evergreen conifer forest using an automated platform. Results show that isotropic PRI scattering is highly correlated to changes in epsilon, while geometric scattering can be related to canopy level shading. Instrumentation and approaches such as the one demonstrated in this study may be integrated into current efforts aiming at predicting epsilon at global scales using satellite observations.

AB The transfer of antibodies from mother to offspring has broad potential implications in evolutionary ecology, from the adaptive value of maternal effects to the role of transgenerational plasticity in host-parasite interactions. Recent contributions have addressed key issues such as environmental and genetic factors affecting the amount of antibodies transferred and whether maternal antibodies affect offspring immunity, but little is still known about the implications of the maternal transfer of antibodies in natural populations. By its position at the crossroads between population ecology, animal science, medicine and epidemiology, current studies of the role of the maternal transfer of antibodies highlight how research in ecological immunology needs to combine functional and evolutionary approaches while also keeping in mind ecological settings.

AB The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is a pest of soybeans in Asia, and in recent years has caused extensive damage to soybeans in North America. Within these agroecosystems, generalist predators form an important component of the assemblage of natural enemies, and can exert significant pressure on prey populations. These food webs are complex and molecular gut-content analyses offer nondisruptive approaches for examining trophic linkages in the field. We describe the development of a molecular detection system to examine the feeding behaviour of Orius insidiosus (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) upon soybean aphids, an alternative prey item, Neohydatothrips variabilis (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), and an intraguild prey species, Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). Specific primer pairs were designed to target prey and were used to examine key trophic connections within this soybean food web. In total, 32% of O. insidiosus were found to have preyed upon A. glycines, but disproportionately high consumption occurred early in the season, when aphid densities were low. The intensity of early season predation indicates that O. insidiosus are important biological control agents of A. glycines, although data suggest that N. variabilis constitute a significant proportion of the diet of these generalist predators. No Orius were found to contain DNA of H. axyridis, suggesting intraguild predation upon these important late-season predators during 2005 was low. In their entirety, these results implicate O. insidiosus as a valuable natural enemy of A. glycines in this soybean agroecosystem.

AB Bioclimatic models are the primary tools for simulating the impact of climate change on species distributions. Part of the uncertainty in the output of these models results from uncertainty in projections of future climates. To account for this, studies often simulate species responses to climates predicted by more than one climate model and/or emission scenario. One area of uncertainty, however, has remained unexplored: internal climate model variability. By running a single climate model multiple times, but each time perturbing the initial state of the model slightly, different but equally valid realizations of climate will be produced. In this paper, we identify how ongoing improvements in climate models can be used to provide guidance for impacts studies. In doing so we provide the first assessment of the extent to which this internal climate model variability generates uncertainty in projections of future species distributions, compared with variability between climate models. We obtained data on 13 realizations from three climate models (three from CSIRO Mark2 v3.0, four from GISS AOM, and six from MIROC v3.2) for two time periods: current (1985-1995) and future (2025-2035). Initially, we compared the simulated values for each climate variable (P, T-max, T-min, and T-mean) for the current period to observed climate data. This showed that climates simulated by realizations from the same climate model were more similar to each other than to realizations from other models. However, when projected into the future, these realizations followed different trajectories and the values of climate variables differed considerably within and among climate models. These had pronounced effects on the projected distributions of nine Australian butterfly species when modelled using the BIOCLIM component of DIVA-GIS. Our results show that internal climate model variability can lead to substantial differences in the extent to which the future distributions of species are projected to change. These can be greater than differences resulting from between-climate model variability. Further, different conclusions regarding the vulnerability of species to climate change can be reached due to internal model variability. Clearly, several climate models, each represented by multiple realizations, are required if we are to adequately capture the range of uncertainty associated with projecting species distributions in the future.

AB Urbanization changes local environmental conditions and may lead to altered selection regimes for life history traits of organisms thriving in cities. Previous studies have reported changes in breeding phenology and even trends toward increased sedentariness in migratory bird species colonizing urban areas. However, does the change in migratory propensity simply represent a phenotypic adjustment to local urban environment, or is it genetically based and hence the result of local adaptation? To test this, we hand-raised European Blackbirds (Turdus merula) from urban and forest populations, quantified their nocturnal activity and fat deposition covering two complete migratory cycles and examined the consequences of a reduced migratory propensity for the timing of gonadal development ( a physiological measure of the seasonal timing of reproduction). Although nocturnal activities differed strikingly between fall and spring seasons, with low activities during the fall and high activities during the spring seasons, our data confirm, even in birds kept from early life under common-garden conditions, a change toward reduced migratoriness in urban blackbirds. The first score of a principal component analysis including amount of nocturnal activity and fat deposition, defined as migratory disposition, was lower in urban than in forest males particularly during their first year, whereas females did not differ. The results suggest that the intrinsic but male-biased difference is genetically determined, although early developmental effects cannot be excluded. Moreover, individuals with low migratory disposition developed their gonads earlier, resulting in longer reproductive seasons. Since urban conditions facilitate earlier breeding, intrinsic shifts to sedentariness thus seem to be adaptive in urban habitats. These results corroborate the idea that urbanization has evolutionary consequences for life history traits such as migratory behavior.

AB As a charismatic carnivore that is vulnerable to extinction, many studies have been conducted on predation by the cheetah Acinonyx jubatus. Cheetah are generally considered to capture medium-sized prey; however, which species are actually preferred and why has yet to be addressed. We used data from 21 published and two unpublished studies from six countries throughout the distribution of the cheetah to determine which prey species were preferred and which were avoided using Jacobs' index. The mean Jacobs' index value for each prey species was used as the dependent variable in multiple regression, with prey abundance and prey body mass as predictive variables. Cheetah prefer to kill and actually kill the most available prey present at a site within a body mass range of 23-56 kg with a peak (mode) at 36 kg. Blesbok, impala, Thomson's and Grant's gazelles, and springbok are significantly preferred, whereas prey outside this range are generally avoided. The morphological adaptations of the cheetah appear to have evolved to capture medium-sized prey that can be subdued with minimal risk of injury. Coincidentally, these species can be consumed rapidly before kleptoparasites arrive. These results are discussed through the premise of optimality theory whereby decisions made by the predator maximize the net energetic benefits of foraging. Information is also presented that allows conservation managers to determine which prey species should be in adequate numbers at cheetah reintroduction sites to support a cheetah population. Conversely, these results will illustrate which potential prey species of local conservation concern should be monitored for impact from cheetahs as several species are likely to be preyed upon more frequently than others.

ID MUTUAL MATE CHOICE; SEXUAL SELECTION; COMPETITION
AB There has recently been an increase in interest in the notion that female ornamentation is selected through male choice, rather than being an artefact of selection on male ornamentation. There are, however, key differences between the sexes in the type of selection pressures that are likely to generate ornamentation and important differences in investment tradeoffs. Here, I discuss that female ornamentation might be selected more often through female competition over resources than through competition over mates, as exemplified in a recent study by Heinsohn and colleagues.

AB There is increasing evidence that the environment experienced early in life can strongly influence adult life histories. It is largely unknown, however, how past and present conditions influence suites of life-history traits regarding major life-history trade-offs. Especially in animals with indeterminate growth, we may expect that environmental conditions of juveniles and adults independently or interactively influence the life-history trade-off between growth and reproduction after maturation. juvenile growth conditions may initiate a feedback loop determining adult allocation patterns, triggered by size-dependent mortality risk. I tested this possibility in a long-term growth experiment with mouthbrooding cichlids. Females were raised either on a high-food or low-food diet. After maturation half of them were switched to the opposite treatment, while the other half remained unchanged. Adult growth was determined by current resource availability, but key reproductive traits like reproductive rate and offspring size were only influenced by juvenile growth conditions, irrespective of the ration received as adults. Moreover, the allocation of resources to growth versus reproduction and to offspring number versus size were shaped by juvenile rather than adult ecology. These results indicate that early individual history must be considered when analysing causes of life-history variation in natural populations.

AB Plant biodiversity can enhance primary production in terrestrial ecosystems, but biodiversity effects are largely unstudied in the ocean. We conducted a series of field and mesocosm experiments to measure the relative effects of macroalgal identity and richness on primary productivity (net photosynthetic rate) and biomass accumulation in hard substratum subtidal communities in North Carolina, USA. Algal identity consistently and strongly affected production; species richness effects, although often significent, were subtle. Partitioning of the net biodiversity effect indicated that complementarity effects were always positive and species were usually more productive in mixtures than in monoculture. Surprisingly, slow growing species performed relatively better in the most diverse treatments than the most productive species, thus selection effects were consistently negative. Our results suggest that several basic mechanisms underlying terrestrial plant biodiversity effects also operate in algal-based marine ecosystems, and thus may be general.

AB A well-resolved rhizobial species phylogeny with 51 haplotypes was inferred from a combined atpD + recA data set using Bayesian inference with best-fit, gene-specific substitution models. Relatively dense taxon sampling for the genera Rhizobium and Mesorhizobium was achieved by generating atpD and recA sequences for six type and 24 reference strains not previously available in GenBank. This phylogeny was used to classify nine nodule isolates from Sesbania exasperata, S. punicea and S. sericea plants native to seasonally flooded areas of Venezuela, and compared with a PCR-RFLP analysis of rrs plus rrl genes and large maximum likelihood rrs and nifH phylogenies. We show that rrs phylogenies are particularly sensitive to strain choice due to the high levels of sequence mosaicism found at this locus. All analyses consistently identified the Sesbania isolates as Mesorhizobium plurifarium or Rhizobium huautlense. Host range experiments on ten legume species coupled with plasmid profiling uncovered potential novel biovarieties of both species. This study demonstrates the wide geographic and environmental distribution of M. plurifarium, that R. galegae and R. huautlense are sister lineages, and the synonymy of R. gallicum, R. mongolense and R. yanglingense. Complex and diverse phylogeographic, inheritance and host-association patterns were found for the symbiotic nifH locus. The results and the analytical approaches used herein are discussed in the context of rhizobial taxonomy and molecular systematics. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Unique DNA sequences are present in all species and can be used as biomarkers for the detection of cells from that species. These DNA sequences can most easily be detected using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which allows very small quantities of target DNA sequence to be amplified even when the target is mixed with large amounts of nontarget DNA. PCR amplification of DNA markers that are present in a wide range of species has proven very useful for studies of species diversity in environmental samples. The taxonomic range of species to be identified from environmental samples may often need to be restricted to simplify downstream analyses and to ensure that less abundant sequences are amplified. Group-specific PCR primer sets are one means of specifying the range of taxa that produce an amplicon in a PCR. We have developed a range of group-specific PCR primers for studying the prey diversity found in predator stomach contents and scats. These primers, their design and their application to studying prey diversity and identity in predator diet are described.

AB Land-use and land-cover changes affect ecological landscape functions and processes. Hence, landscape ecologists have a central interest in a comprehensive understanding of such changes. Our study focuses on the relationships between environmental conditions and agricultural land-cover changes. We present a method to (i) characterise the major spatial-temporal processes of land-cover changes, (ii) identify the correlations between environmental attributes and land-cover changes and (iii) derive potential environmental drivers of land-cover changes in a German marginal rural landscape. The method was applied to study land-cover dynamics from 1945 to 1998 in the districts of Erda, Steinbrucken and Eibelshausen, situated in the marginal rural landscape of the Lahn-Dill Highlands, Germany. We employed land-cover data gained by the interpretation of multi-temporal aerial photographs. Various environmental variables were introduced into the analyses. We identified physical landscape attributes (elevation, slope, aspect, available water capacity and soil texture) and structural landscape dimensions (patch size, patch shape and distance between patch and nearest settlement). With the aid of GIS, K-means partitioning and canonical correspondence analysis, we investigated land-cover trajectory types, land-cover transitions at individual time intervals and their relationships to these environmental variables. Our results show that, between 1945 and 1998, land-cover changes correlated with the physical attributes of the underlying landscape. On the other hand, the structural landscape dimensions correlated with land cover only in periods of minor land-cover changes (1972-98). Greater diversity of physical landscape attributes is correlated with greater land-cover dynamics. Besides the important influence of socio-economic factors, land-cover changes in the study areas took place within the relatively stable physical constraints of the underlying landscape.

AB The possible relationships between relative brain size and developmental mode and between relative brain size and five measures of the length of the development period were tested across over 1400 species of birds. Using both conventional statistics and phylogenetically based comparative methods, significant differences in relative brain size were detected among modes of development. Across all species, there were significant relationships between relative brain size and each of the following developmental traits: incubation period, age of fledging, duration of postfledging parental care, and total period of parental care. In contrast, the age of first flight was not significantly correlated with relative brain size. The relationships between these five developmental traits and relative brain size varied among developmental modes and orders such that significant relationships were present within some modes and orders but not in others. Thus, developmental differences play a significant role in the evolution of brain-size differences, but the role depends upon the taxonomic level being investigated. This is likely due to the differential lengths of periods of neural and behavioural development in young birds. Our conclusions support the contention of previous studies that developmental differences have played a key role in avian brain evolution.

AB We sequenced 965 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b from 102 woodmice (Apodemus sylvaticus ) collected from 40 European localities. The aims of the study were to answer the following questions. (i) Did the Mediterranean peninsulas play a role as refuge for woodmice? (ii) Is genetic variability of A. sylvaticus higher in the Mediterranean region compared with northern Europe? (iii) Are the patterns of the postglacial colonization of Europe by woodmice similar to those presently recognized for other European species? The results provide a clear picture of the impact of the Quaternary glaciations on the genetic and geographical structure of the woodmouse. Our analyses indicate a higher genetic variability of woodmice in the Mediterranean peninsulas compared to northern Europe, suggesting a role of the former as refuge regions for this small mammal. An original pattern of postglacial colonization is proposed where the Iberian and southern France refuge populations colonized almost all European regions. The Sicilian population appears to be very differentiated and highly variable. This emphasizes the importance of this island as a 'hot spot' for the intraspecific genetic diversity of the woodmouse. Finally, woodmice in North Africa originated from southwestern Europe, most probably as a result of a recent anthropogenic introduction.

AB Although an interspecific trade-off between competitive and colonizing ability can permit multispecies coexistence, whether this mechanism controls the structure of natural systems remains unresolved. We used models to evaluate the hypothesized importance of this trade-off for explaining coexistence and relative abundance patterns in annual plant assemblages. in a nonspatial model, empirically derived competition-colonization trade-offs related to seed mass were insufficient to generate coexistence. This was unchanged by spatial structure or interspecific variation in the fraction of seeds dispersing globally. These results differ from those of the more generalized competition-colonization models because the latter assume completely asymmetric competition, an assumption that appears unrealistic considering existing data for annual systems. When, for heuristic purposes, completely asymmetric competition was incorporated into our models, unlimited coexistence was possible. However, in the resulting abundance patterns, the best competitors/poorest colonizers were the most abundant, the opposite of that observed in natural systems. By contrast, these natural patterns were produced by competition-colonization models where environmental heterogeneity permitted species coexistence. Thus, despite the failure of the simple competition-colonization trade-off to explain coexistence in annual plant systems, this trade-off may be essential to explaining relative abundance patterns when other processes permit coexistence.

AB 1. The methods used to indicate the biological state of streams are often based on taxonomic composition, and the abundance of species or other taxa. This 'taxonomic structure' varies among ecoregions and cannot be applied to wider geographical areas. Therefore, we assessed the species traits of benthic macroinvertebrates from semi-natural reference sites as a potential benchmark for large-scale biomonitoring. Our purpose was to assess the stability of community structure, based on the representation of taxa and of traits, across large gradients of geology (sedimentary to granitic), altitude (65-1982 m), geographical coordinates (0 degrees 48' W to 7 degrees 20' E and 42 degrees 52' to 48 degrees 44' N), stream order (1-5) and slope (0.5-60%).
   2. We used invertebrate abundance data from the 62 most natural French stream sites available. These abundance data served to weight the occurrence of 'biological' traits, such as reproductive characteristics, mobility, resistance forms, food, feeding habits, respiration, and 'ecological' traits, such as preferences for temperature, trophic level, saprobity,, biogeographic distribution, longitudinal zonation, substratum and current velocity.
   3. Multivariate analyses of taxonomic composition demonstrated a clear site gradient from lowlands to uplands and from calcareous to granitic geology. In contrast, community structure based on both biological and ecological traits was stable across environmental gradients.
   4. The frequency distribution of biological traits indicated that the stream benthos of the 'reference sites' had a mixture of categories which confirmed theoretical predictions for temporally stable and spatially variable habitats. A mixture of ecological trait categories also occurred at our reference sites. Thus, semi-natural benthic macroinvertebrate communities are functionally diverse. Moreover, we included an initial application of these traits to a case of slightly to moderately polluted sites to show that the impact of humans significantly changes this natural functional diversity.
   5. Future studies should focus on the potential for various biological and ecological traits to discriminate different human impacts on the benthic macroinvertebrates of running waters, and on the integration of this functional application into a general 'reference-condition' approach.

AB This review summarises current knowledge on root interactions in agroforestry systems, discussing cases from temperate and tropical ecosystems and drawing on experiences from natural plant communities where data from agroforestry systems are lacking. There is an inherent conflict in agroforestry between expected favourable effects of tree root systems, e.g. on soil fertility and nutrient cycling, and competition between tree and crop roots. Root management attempts to optimise root functions and to stimulate facilitative and complementary interactions. It makes use of the plasticity of root systems to respond to environmental factors, including other root systems, with altered growth and physiology. Root management tools include species selection, spacing, nutrient distribution, and shoot pruning, among others. Root distribution determines potential zones of root interactions in the soil, but are also a result of such interactions. Plants tend to avoid excessive root competition both at the root system level and at the single-root level by spatial segregation. As a consequence, associated plant species develop vertically stratified root systems under certain conditions, leading to complementarity in the use of soil resources. Parameters of root competitiveness, such as root length density, mycorrhization and flexibility in response to water and nutrient patches in the soil, have to be considered for predicting the outcome of interspecific root interactions. The patterns of root activity around individual plants differ between species; knowing these may help to avoid excessive competition and unproductive nutrient losses in agroforestry systems through suitable spacing and fertiliser placement. The possibility of alleviating root competition by supplying limiting growth factors is critically assessed. A wide range of physical, chemical and biological interactions occurs not only in spatial agroforestry, but also in rotational systems. In a final part, the reviewed information is applied to different types of agroforestry systems: associations of trees with annual crops; associations of trees with grasses or perennial fodder and cover crops; associations of different tree and shrub species; and improved fallows.

AB The distribution of diatoms with respect to salinity and ionic gradients was studied in lakes of the northern Great Plains of North America. The lakes range from freshwater to hypersaline (0.65-270 g.L(-1)) and include a variety of brine types, although the majority are dominated by sulfate salts. Canonical correspondence analysis of diatoms in the surface sediments of 66 lakes and associated water chemistry data indicates that diatom distributions are highly correlated with salinity. The ordination also suggests that brine type forms a significant environmental gradient and separates taxa characteristic of bicarbonate/carbonate lakes from those of sulfate-dominated systems. The salinity optima and tolerances of diatom species are calculated by weighted averaging regression, and these data provide a tool for the reconstruction of past salinity and the inferance of climatic change in arid and semiarid regions.

AB Numerous nest predation studies have been conducted, but few have been representative of forest-dominated landscapes or early successional forest stages. Thus, we examined the rates of predation on artificial ground nests in a forested landscape in both clearcuts and the adjoining forest. We placed artificial nests containing Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) eggs every 15 m on transects perpendicular to clearcut-forest edges. Nests were exposed for 7 days in early July 1989 and for 14 days each in June and July 1990. We placed artificial shrub nests (1-2 m above ground) along the forest edge and in the forest interior in July 1990. Predation rates were higher (P < 0.001) for forest nests than for clearcut nests. Neither clearcut size nor forest react size exhibited a consistent relationship with predation intensity. Distance to edge had no apparent effect on predation of ground nests. However, the predation rate of shrub nests on the edge was higher (P < 0.025) than for ground nests on the edge and ground and shrub nests in the forest interior. Analyses of vegetation surrounding nests suggested that cover was negatively associated with predation rates in forests, and positively associated in clearcuts. Because our findings are quite different from those obtained in agricultural landscapes, we advise caution when extrapolating results from nest predation studies in one type of landscape to a different landscape type.

AB We assess the literature on innovation and upscaling for negative emissions technologies (NETs) using a systematic and reproducible literature coding procedure. To structure our review, we employ the framework of sequential stages in the innovation process, with which we code each NETs article in innovation space. We find that while there is a growing body of innovation literature on NETs, 59% of the articles are focused on the earliest stages of the innovation process, 'research and development' (R&D). The subsequent stages of innovation are also represented in the literature, but at much lower levels of activity than R&D. Distinguishing between innovation stages that are related to the supply of the technology (R&D, demonstrations, scale up) and demand for the technology (demand pull, niche markets, public acceptance), we find an overwhelming emphasis (83%) on the supply side. BECCS articles have an above average share of demand-side articles while direct air carbon capture and storage has a very low share. Innovation in NETs has much to learn from successfully diffused technologies; appealing to heterogeneous users, managing policy risk, as well as understanding and addressing public concerns are all crucial yet not well represented in the extant literature. Results from integrated assessment models show that while NETs play a key role in the second half of the 21st century for 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C scenarios, the major period of new NETs deployment is between 2030 and 2050. Given that the broader innovation literature consistently finds long time periods involved in scaling up and deploying novel technologies, there is an urgency to developing NETs that is largely unappreciated. This challenge is exacerbated by the thousands to millions of actors that potentially need to adopt these technologies for them to achieve planetary scale. This urgency is reflected neither in the Paris Agreement nor in most of the literature we review here. If NETs are to be deployed at the levels required to meet 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C targets, then important post-R&D issues will need to be addressed in the literature, including incentives for early deployment, niche markets, scale-up, demand, and-particularly if deployment is to be hastened-public acceptance.

AB T cell responses to allogeneic major histocompatibility complex antigens present a formidable barrier to organ transplantation, necessitating long-term immunosuppression to minimize rejection. Chronic rejection and drug-induced morbidities are major limitations that could be overcome by allograft tolerance induction. Tolerance was first intentionally induced in humans via combined kidney and bone marrow transplantation (CKBMT), but the mechanisms of tolerance in these patients are incompletely understood. We now establish an assay to identify donor-reactive T cells and test the role of deletion in tolerance after CKBMT. Using high-throughput sequencing of the T cell receptor B chain CDR3 region, we define a fingerprint of the donor-reactive T cell repertoire before transplantation and track those clones after transplant. We observed posttransplant reductions in donor-reactive T cell clones in three tolerant CKBMT patients; such reductions were not observed in a fourth, nontolerant, CKBMT patient or in two conventional kidney transplant recipients on standard immunosuppressive regimens. T cell repertoire turnover due to lymphocyte-depleting conditioning only partially accounted for the observed reductions in tolerant patients; in fact, conventional transplant recipients showed expansion of circulating donor-reactive clones, despite extensive repertoire turnover. Moreover, loss of donor-reactive T cell clones more closely associated with tolerance induction than in vitro functional assays. Our analysis supports clonal deletion as a mechanism of allograft tolerance in CKBMT patients. The results validate the contribution of donor-reactive T cell clones identified before transplant by our method, supporting further exploration as a potential biomarker of transplant outcomes.

AB Climate warming challenges our approach to building systems of protected areas because it is likely to drive accelerating shifts in species distributions, and the projections of those future species distributions are uncertain. There are several important sources of uncertainty intrinsic to using species occurrence projections for reserve system design including uncertainty in the number of occurrences captured by any reserve selection solution, and uncertainty arising from the different approaches used to fit predictive models. Here we used the present and future predicted distributions of Iberian herptiles to analyze how dynamics and uncertainty in species distributions may affect decisions about resource allocation for conservation in space and time. We identified priority areas maximizing coverage of current and future (2020 and 2080) predicted distributions of 65 species, under "Mild" and "Severe" uncertainty. Next, we applied a return-on-investment analysis to quantify and make explicit trade-offs between investing in areas selected when optimizing for different times and with different uncertainty levels. Areas identified as important for conservation in every time frame and uncertainty level were the ones considered to be robust climate adaptation investments, and included chiefly already protected areas. Areas identified only under "Mild" uncertainty were considered good candidates for investment if extra resources are available and were mainly located in northern Iberia. However, areas selected only in the "Severe" uncertainty case should not be completely disregarded as they may become climatic refugia for some species. Our study provides an objective methodology to deliver "no regrets" conservation investments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Trees are exceptional organisms that have evolved over some 385 million years and have overtaken other plants in order to harvest light first. However, this advantage comes with a cost: trees must transport water all the way up to their crowns and inherent physical limitations make them vulnerable to water deficits. Because climate change scenarios predict more frequent extreme drought events, trees will increasingly need to cope with water stress. Recent occurrences of climate change-type droughts have had severe impacts on several forest ecosystems. Initial experimental studies have been undertaken and show that stomatal control of water loss hinders carbon assimilation and could lead to starvation during droughts. Other mechanisms of drought-induced mortality are catastrophic xylem dysfunction, impeded long-distance transport of carbohydrates (translocation) and also symplastic failure (cellular breakdown). However, direct empirical support is absent for either hypothesis. More experimental studies are necessary to increase our understanding of these processes and to resolve the mystery of drought-related tree mortality. Instead of testing the validity of particular hypothesis as mechanisms of drought-induced tree mortality, future research should aim at revealing the temporal dynamics of these mechanisms in different species and over a gradient of environmental conditions. Only such studies will reveal whether the struggle for light will become a struggle for water and/or for carbon in drought-affected areas.

AB The establishment of an endosymbiotic relationship typically seems to be driven through complementation of the host's limited metabolic capabilities by the biochemical versatility of the endosymbiont. The most significant examples of endosymbiosis are represented by the endosymbiotic acquisition of plastids and mitochondria, introducing photosynthesis and respiration to eukaryotes. However, there are numerous other endosymbioses that evolved more recently and repeatedly across the tree of life. Recent advances in genome sequencing technology have led to a better understanding of the physiological basis of many endosymbiotic associations. This review focuses on endosymbionts in protists (unicellular eukaryotes). Selected examples illustrate the incorporation of various new biochemical functions, such as photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation and recycling, and methanogenesis, into protist hosts by prokaryotic endosymbionts. Furthermore, photosynthetic eukaryotic endosymbionts display a great diversity of modes of integration into different protist hosts.
   In conclusion, endosymbiosis seems to represent a general evolutionary strategy of protists to acquire novel biochemical functions and is thus an important source of genetic innovation.

AB Despite that soils may be the greatest repository of biodiversity on Earth, and that most terrestrial ecosystem functions occur in the soil, research on the role of soil biodiversity in ecosystem function has lagged behind corresponding research on aboveground organisms. Soil organisms pose special problems to biodiversity-function research, including the fact that we usually do not know their identity nor what they do in soil ecosystems, cannot easily estimate their biodiversity, and cannot culture the majority of the organisms for use in manipulative experiments. We propose here that biological soil crusts (BSCs) of deserts and many other ecosystems may serve as a useful model system for diversity-function research because the species concept is relatively well-defined within BSC organisms, their functional attributes are relatively well-known, and estimation and manipulation of biodiversity in experiments are feasible, at least within some groups of BSC biota. In spite of these features, there is a pronounced lack of research on biodiversity-function using these organisms. At least two complementary approaches are possible: experiments using artificially-constructed BSCs, and observational studies which statistically control for the effects of other factors which are likely to covary with biodiversity. We applied the latter to four observational datasets collected at multiple spatial scales in Spain and the United States using structural equation models or path analysis using ecosystem function indicators relating to hydrology, trapping and retention of soil resources, and nutrient cycling. We found that, even when total BSC abundance and key environmental gradients are controlled for, direct and approximately linear relationships between species richness and/or evenness and indicators of ecosystem functioning were common. Such relationships appear to vary independently of region or spatial scale, but their strength seems to differ in every dataset. Functional group richness did not seem to adequately capture biodiversity-function relationships, suggesting that bryophyte and lichen components of BSC may exhibit low redundancy. More research employing the multi-trophic, multi-functional, and manipulable BSC system may enable more rapid understanding of the consequences of biodiversity loss in soils, and help enable a biodiversity-function theory that is pertinent to the numerous ecosystem services provided by soil organisms.

AB Economic impacts of invasive species worldwide are substantial. Management strategies have been incorporated in population models to assess the effectiveness of management for reducing density, with the implicit assumption that economic impact of the invasive species will also decline. The optimal management effort, however, is that which minimizes the sum of both the management and impact costs. The relationship between population density and economic impact (what we call the "density-impact curve'') is rarely examined in a management context and could take several nonlinear forms. Here we determine the effects of population dynamics and density-impact curves of different shapes on optimal management effort and discover cases where management is either highly effective or a waste of resources. When an inaccurate density-impact curve is used, the increase in total costs due to over- or underinvestment in management can be large. We calculate the increase in total costs incurred if the density-impact curve is incorrect and find that the greater the maximum impact caused by an invasive species, the more important it is not only to reduce its density, but also to know the shape of the density-impact relationship accurately. Lack of information regarding the relationship between density and economic impact causes the most acute problems for invaders that cause high impact at low density, where management typically will be too little, too late. For species that are only problematic at high density, ignorance of the density-impact curve can lead to overinvestment in management with little reduction in impact.

AB Anthropogenic understory fires affect large areas of tropical forest, particularly during severe droughts. Yet, the mechanisms that control tropical forests' susceptibility to fire remain ambiguous. We tested the widely accepted hypothesis that Amazon forest fires increase susceptibility to further burning by conducting a 150 ha fire experiment in a closed-canopy forest near the southeastern Amazon forest-savanna boundary. Forest flammability and its possible determinants were measured in adjacent 50 ha forest plots that were burned annually for 3 consecutive years (B3), once (B1), and not at all (B0). Contrary to expectation, an annual burning regime led to a decline in forest flammability during the third burn. Microclimate conditions were more favorable compared with the first burn (i.e. vapor pressure deficit increased and litter moisture decreased), yet flame heights declined and burned area halved. A slight decline in fine fuels after the second burn appears to have limited fire spread and intensity. Supporting this conclusion, fire spread rates doubled and burned area increased fivefold in B3 subplots that received fine fuel additions. Slow replacement of surface fine fuels in this forest may be explained by (i) low leaf litter production (4.3 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)), half that of other Amazon forests; and (ii) low fire-induced tree and liana mortality (5.5 +/- 0.5% yr(-1), SE, in B3), the lowest measured in closed-canopy Amazonian forests. In this transitional forest, where severe seasonal drought removed moisture constraints on fire propagation, a lack of fine fuels inhibited the intensity and spread of recurrent fire in a negative feedback. This reduction in flammability, however, may be short-lived if delayed tree mortality or treefall increases surface fuels in future years. This study highlights that understanding fuel input rate and timing relative to fire frequency is fundamental to predicting transitional forest flammability - which has important implications for carbon emissions and potential replacement by scrub vegetation.

AB The contribution to urban green space by private or domestic gardens in residential zones was investigated in the city of Sheffield, UK, as part of a wider study of the garden resource and its associated biodiversity. The attributes of 61 gardens, including patterns of landcover and vegetation cover, were explored in relation to housing characteristics and the nature of the surrounding landscape. The number of surrounding houses, and the areas of buildings and of roads were negatively correlated with garden area. The proportion of a housing parcel comprising garden increased with parcel size, although the proportion that was rear garden remained relatively constant. Garden size played an overwhelming role in determining garden composition: larger gardens supported more landcovers, contained greater extents of three-quarters of the recorded landcovers, and were more likely to contain trees taller than 2 m, vegetable patches, and composting sites. Unvegetated landcovers made greater proportional contributions as garden size declined. All categories of vegetation canopy increased with garden size, and large gardens supported disproportionately greater cover above 3 m. House age was a less significant factor determining garden landcover. Gardens of newer houses were more likely to occur towards the edge of the urban area, and older properties, that contained fewer hedges, possessed less canopy between 2-3 m. The extent and occurrence of different landcovers in gardens, and their consequences for wildlife, are considered for residential patches in urban areas. The implications for urban planners are discussed.

AB We studied the phylogeography of alder buckthorn (Frangula alnus), a bird-dispersed shrub or small tree distributed over most of Europe and West Asia and present in three of the four main refugia of West Palaearctic temperate woody plants: the Iberian Peninsula, the Balkans and Anatolia. A total of 78 populations from 21 countries were analysed for chloroplast DNA variation using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), and 21 different haplotypes were distinguished. We found a very strong overall population differentiation (G(ST) = 0.81) and phylogeographical structure, and a sharp contrast between the haplotype-rich refugia and the almost completely uniform area of postglacial colonization. The haplotype network comprises three lineages made up of haplotypes from the Iberian Peninsula, Anatolia with the Caucasus, and temperate Europe. The Iberian and the Anatolian branches represent parts of a major lineage that spans over the whole northern Mediterranean Basin and some neighbouring areas and probably dates back to the Tertiary. Many haplotypes of this lineage are distributed locally and most populations are fixed for a single haplotype; these populations have apparently been very stable since their establishment, experiencing negligible gene flow and few mutations. The temperate European lineage consists of one very widespread and abundant plus six locally distributed haplotypes. Four of them are located in Southeast Europe, the putative refugium of all extant temperate European populations. Contrary to populations from Iberia and Anatolia, F. alnus populations from the southeastern European refugium have most genetic variation within populations. Bird-mediated seed dispersal has apparently allowed not only a very rapid postglacial expansion of F. alnus but also subsequent regular seed exchanges between populations of the largely continuous species range in temperate Europe. In contrast, the disjunct F. alnus populations persisting in Mediterranean mountain ranges seem to have experienced little gene flow and have therefore accumulated a high degree of differentiation, even at short distances. Populations from the southern parts of the glacial refugia have contributed little to the postglacial recolonization of Europe, but their long-term historical continuity has allowed them to maintain a unique store of genetic variation.

AB As nonindigenous species continue to displace native species and disrupt ecosystems, understanding the degree to which native species richness affects the vulnerability of communities to nonindigenous species invasions has grown in importance. Native and exotic species diversity are often positively correlated in large-scale observational studies, but negatively correlated in small-scale experimental studies. This discrepancy suggests that the scale of invasion studies may be an important influence on their outcomes. Using a competition-based model that exhibits a negative relationship on a small scale, we show that changes in the number of available resources across communities can cause invasion success to become positively correlated with native species diversity at larger scales. The strength of the positive correlation, however, depends on the relationship between niche breadth and species diversity in natural communities. Adding species to a community or removing resources has a similar effect-increasing the sum of interspecific interaction strengths, which decreases invasion success.

AB Tropical island ecosystems appear to be especially vulnerable to invasive species as indicated by the often high numbers and percentages of exotic species on oceanic and continental islands. Here I reexamine hypotheses offered to account for the apparently high invasibility of tropical islands and suggest a simple synthesis based on resource availability, propagule supply, and relative competitive abilities of exotic and island species. This review suggests that fundamentally two interacting processes-high net resource availability and poor ability of native species to preempt those resources-make island communities vulnerable to the establishment and spread of alien species. In addition, historically high rates of introduction have provided opportunity in the form of a diverse and abundant propagule rain of exotic species. The combination produces a scenario that is not an optimistic one for island ecosystems. It suggests that these native ecosystems on islands are particularly vulnerable to naturalizing exotics-growing on their borders, and that while disturbance from a variety of causes, including pigs, fire, grazing, and natural dieback of the canopy dominants, increases the opportunities for exotic incursions, even intact forests are not immune. Unless these forests are aggressively managed and alien propagule pressure reduced, they will be highly modified by expanding exotic plant populations. Tropical islands are an effective early warning system of the impacts that successive waves of exotic species invasions may cause to isolated ecosystems. As mainland natural areas become fragmented, degraded and depauperate, they acquire many of the ecological attributes of islands, including limited habitat area, missing functional groups, declining species diversity, and disturbed habitats. A better understanding of invasions on islands may improve our attempts to protect both mainland and island ecosystems from the impacts of exotic species.

AB Lepidopteran larvae possess multiple defenses against a diverse group of predators and parasitoids. Many studies of larval defenses have determined whether a defense works against a particular enemy, but the question of which types of defenses are most effective against which types of enemy has not been examined closely. We assessed the efficacy of different caterpillar defenses against parasitoid wasps, flies, and nematodes,. and compared the results to earlier work with predatory invertebrates. Third to fifth instar caterpillars from 266 species and 30 families were collected in a lowland wet forest in Costa Rica during wet and dry seasons from 1996 through 1999, scored for various behavioral and morphological defenses, and then reared in the laboratory. Defense categories were used as predictor variables in logit models with parasitism as the response variable. Whether or not a particular caterpillar defense was effective depended on the taxon of parasitoid that attacked. Caterpillars attacked by flies benefited from a solitary, exophytic feeding habit; wasps were most deterred by biting, dropping, and regurgitating; and larvae attacked by nematodes benefited from both a solitary habit and, behavioral defenses. Mortality caused by parasitoids was high for caterpillars that are normally protected from predators. In particular, chemically defended herbivores that are undesirable meals for predators are safe hosts for parasitoids.

AB Dispersal is considered a vital life history characteristic for insects exploiting temporary habitats, and life history theorists have often hypothesized an inverse relationship between dispersal capability and habitat persistence. Most often, this hypothesis has been tested using interspecific comparisons of dispersal capability and qualitative estimates of habitat persistence. Consequently, most assessments have failed to control for possible phylogenetic nonindependence and they also lack quantitative rigor.
   We capitalized on existing intraspecific variation in the dispersal capability of Prokelisia planthoppers to examine the relationship between habitat persistence and dispersal, thereby minimizing possible phylogenetic effects. Two congeneric species (Prokelisia marginata and P. dolus) occur in the intertidal marshes of North America, where they feed exclusively on cordgrasses (Spartina). Because these planthoppers exhibit wing dimorphism, flight-capable adults (macropters with fully developed wings) are easily differentiated from flightless adults (brachypters with reduced wings). Thus, dispersal capability can be readily estimated by the percentage of macropters in a population.
   At a regional spatial scale, we found a highly significant negative relationship between dispersal capability (percent macroptery) and habitat persistence. In this system, habitat persistence is influenced by a combination of marsh elevation, winter severity, and tidal range, which interact to determine the ability of planthoppers to endure through winter in their primary habitat for development. P. marginata develops primarily in low-marsh habitats during summer, habitats that can be subjected to pronounced winter disturbance due to ice scouring and/or extensive tidal inundation. Levels of winter disturbance of the low marsh are extreme along the Atlantic coast, intermediate along the Pacific, and low along the Gulf. Both the failure of P. marginata populations to remain through winter in this habitat, and the dispersal ability of these populations (92%, 29%, and 17% macroptery, respectively), are correlated with levels of disturbance. Thus, in regions where winter disturbance is high, levels of dispersal are correspondingly high to allow for recolonization of extirpated habitats from overwintering sites on the high marsh. Unlike P. marginata, P. dolus develops primarily in high-marsh habitats, which are much less disturbed on all coasts during winter. Consequently, this species remains year-round in its primary habitat for development, and most populations exhibit relatively low levels of macroptery (<10%).
   When raised under common garden conditions, many more macropters of both species were produced from Atlantic compared to Gulf populations. Thus the proportion of macropters produced from the populations used in this experiment paralleled the incidence of macroptery measured in the field, providing evidence that the geographic variation in dispersal capability in both species has in part a genetic basis. The results of this study provide strong intraspecific evidence for an inverse relationship between the dispersal capability of insects and the persistence of their habitats.

AB I use multilocus genetics to describe assortative mating in a competition model. The intensity of competition between individuals is influenced by a quantitative character whose value is determined additively by alleles from many loci. With assortative mating based on this character, frequency- and density-dependent competition can subdivide a population with an initially unimodal character distribution. The character distribution becomes bimodal, and the subpopulations corresponding to the two modes are reproductively separated because mating is assortative. This happens if the resource distribution is unimodal, i.e. even if selection due to phenotypic carrying capacities is not disruptive. The results suggest that sympatric speciation due to frequency-dependent selection can occur in quite general ecological scenarios if mating is assortative. I also discuss the evolution of assortative mating. Since it induces bimodal phenotype distributions, assortative mating leads to a better match of the resources if their distribution is also bimodal. Moreover, in a population with a bimodal phenotype distribution, the average strength of frequency-dependent competition is lower than in a unimodal population. Therefore, assortative mating permits higher equilibrium densities than random mating even if the resource distribution is unimodal. Thus, even though it may lead to a less efficient resource use, assortative mating is favoured over random mating because it reduces frequency-dependent effects of competition.

AB Artificial fluctuations in streamflow have been documented to alter the composition and structure of stream communities. This study tests the hypothesis that a spatial recovery gradient in fish assemblage structure exists downstream of a hydroelectric dam, and that recovery can be identified by the presence and abundance of species largely restricted to flowing-water habitats (fluvial specialists). A longitudinal gradient of change in a shoreline fish assemblage was quantified in a 66-km reach of a mid-sized, species-rich river (Tallapoosa River, Alabama) with daily flow fluctuations from hydropower generation. The shoreline fish assemblage in a nearby and similar river (Cahaba River, Alabama) was quantified as a regional reference for the occurrence of fish assemblage gradients. Fish were collected with prepositioned area electrofishers in 240 randomly located sampling sites, and physical habitat was quantified. Using distributional and habitat use information, fish species were categorized as fluvial specialists or macrohabitat generalists (species that occur in a wide variety of aquatic systems). Sampled habitats were similar between rivers and along each study reach. The longitudinal pattern of species occurrence and fish abundance was consistent in the free-flowing river. A longitudinal gradient of increasing abundance and richness of only fluvial specialist species existed downstream of the hydroelectric dam. No similar spatial gradient existed for macrohabitat generalists in either river. Although a fish community recovery gradient was identified, a recovery endpoint was not evident because assemblage change was gradual and possibly incomplete. The preservation and management of riverine fish faunas will partly depend on incorporating spatial recovery into decisions about permitting and siting of anthropogenic changes like hydroelectric dams.

AB Fungi play an important regulating role in terrestrial ecosystem functioning. However, their biogeographic distribution patterns along combined gradients of plant communities and environmental variables across regional spatial scales remain poorly understood. This knowledge gap is particularly pronounced in arid and semi-arid grassland ecosystems, which occupy one third of the terrestrial surface of China. Here, a regional-scale field investigation was conducted to collect soil samples from 290 plots at 52 sites along a 4000 km transect in temperate grasslands of northern China to assess the distribution patterns of fungal communities. The high-throughput Illumina sequencing revealed that soil fungal communities were dominated by Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Zygomycota across the temperate grasslands. Fungal richness increased with plant species richness and mean annual precipitation (MAP). Bray-Cutis dissimilarities in soil fungal community composition between sites were significantly correlated with plant community composition, geographical distance, and abiotic factors including MAP, mean annual temperature, soil pH, and soil organic carbon. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that variation in fungal community composition was mainly explained by plant community composition, followed by geographical distance and abiotic factors. Structural equation models further highlighted the significant role of plant species richness in determining soil fungal richness. Taken together, these results suggest that the regional-scale distribution pattern of soil fungal communities is predominantly mediated by plant community composition, and also by abiotic factors and geographical distance in arid and semi-arid temperate grasslands.

AB 1. Two alternative frameworks have been proposed to partition compositional dissimilarity into replacement and nestedness-resultant component or into replacement and richness-difference components. These are, respectively, the BAS (Baselga 2010, Global Ecology and Biogeography, 19, 134-143) and POD (Podani & Schmera 2011. Oikos, 120, 1625-1638) frameworks.
   2. We conduct a systematic comparison of parallel components in alternative approaches. We test whether the replacement components derived from the BAS and POD frameworks are independent of richness difference. We also evaluate whether previously reported tests of monotonicity between indices and ecological processes are informative to assess the performance of indices. Finally, we illustrate the consequences of differences between the BAS and POD frameworks using the North American freshwater fish fauna as an empirical example.
   3. In the BAS framework, the nestedness-resultant component (beta(jne) or beta(sne)) accounts only for richness differences derived from nested patterns while, in the POD framework, richness-difference dissimilarity (beta(rich) or beta(rich.s)) accounts for all kind of richness differences. Likewise, the replacement components of both alternative methods account for different concepts. Only the replacement component of the BAS framework (beta(jtu) or beta(sim)) is independent of richness difference, while the parallel component in the POD framework (beta(-3) or beta(-3.s)) is not (i.e. it is mathematically constrained by richness difference).
   4. Therefore, only the BAS framework allows separating (i) the variation in species composition derived from species replacement which is independent of richness difference (i.e. not mathematically constrained by it) and (ii) the variation in species composition derived from nested patterns.

AB Habitat loss and degradation, driven largely by agricultural expansion and intensification, present the greatest immediate threat to biodiversity. Tropical forests harbour among the highest levels of terrestrial species diversity and are likely to experience rapid land-use change in the coming decades. Synthetic analyses of observed responses of species are useful for quantifying how land use affects biodiversity and for predicting outcomes under land-use scenarios. Previous applications of this approach have typically focused on individual taxonomic groups, analysing the average response of the whole community to changes in land use. Here, we incorporate quantitative remotely sensed data about habitats in, to our knowledge, the first worldwide synthetic analysis of how individual species in four major taxonomic groups-invertebrates, 'herptiles' (reptiles and amphibians), mammals and birds-respond to multiple human pressures in tropical and sub-tropical forests. We show significant independent impacts of land use, human vegetation offtake, forest cover and human population density on both occurrence and abundance of species, highlighting the value of analysing multiple explanatory variables simultaneously. Responses differ among the four groups considered, and-within birds and mammals-between habitat specialists and habitat generalists and between narrow-ranged and wide-ranged species.

AB Understanding the ability of species to shift their distribution ranges in response to climate change is crucial for conservation biologists and resources managers. Although freshwater ecosystems include some of the most imperilled fauna worldwide, such range shifts have been poorly documented in streams and rivers and have never been compared to the current velocity of climate change. Based on national monitoring data, we examined the distributional changes of 32 stream fish species in France and quantified potential time lags in species responses, providing a unique opportunity to analyze range shifts over recent decades of warming in freshwater environments. A multi-facetted approach, based on several range measures along spatial gradients, allowed us to quantify range shifts of numerous species across the whole hydrographic network between an initial period (1980-1992) and a contemporary one (2003-2009), and to contrast them to the rates of isotherm shift in elevation and stream distance. Our results highlight systematic species shifts towards higher elevation and upstream, with mean shifts in range centre of 13.7 m decade(-1) and 0.6 km decade(-1), respectively. Fish species displayed dispersal-driven expansions along the altitudinal gradient at their upper range limit (61.5 m decade(-1)), while substantial range contractions at the lower limit (6.3 km decade(-1)) were documented for most species along the upstream-downstream gradient. Despite being consistent with the geographic variation in climate change velocities, these patterns reveal that the majority of stream fish have not shifted at a pace sufficient to track changing climate, in particular at their range centre where range shifts lag far behind expectation. Our study provides evidence that stream fish are currently responding to recent climate warming at a greater rate than many terrestrial organisms, although not as much as needed to cope with future climate modifications.

AB 1. Ecosystem invasibility is determined by combinations of environmental variables, invader attributes, disturbance regimes, competitive abilities of resident species and evolutionary history between residents and disturbance regimes. Understanding the relative importance of each factor is critical to limiting future invasions and restoring ecosystems. 2. We investigated factors potentially controlling Bromus tectorum invasions into Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis communities across 75 sites in the Great Basin. We measured soil texture, cattle grazing intensity, gaps among perennial plants and plant cover including B.tectorum, biological soil crusts (BSCs) and bare soil. Using a priori knowledge, we developed a multivariate hypothesis of the susceptibility of Artemisia ecosystems to B.tectorum invasion and used the model to assess the relative importance of the factors driving the magnitude of such invasions. 3. Model results imply that bunchgrass community structure, abundance and composition, along with BSC cover, play important roles in controlling B.tectorum dominance. Evidence suggests abundant bunchgrasses limit invasions by limiting the size and connectivity of gaps between vegetation, and BSCs appear to limit invasions within gaps. Results also suggest that cattle grazing reduces invasion resistance by decreasing bunchgrass abundance, shifting bunchgrass composition, and thereby increasing connectivity of gaps between perennial plants while trampling further reduces resistance by reducing BSC. 4. Synthesis and applications. Grazing exacerbates Bromustectorum dominance in one of North America's most endangered ecosystems by adversely impacting key mechanisms mediating resistance to invasion. If the goal is to conserve and restore resistance of these systems, managers should consider maintaining or restoring: (i) high bunchgrass cover and structure characterized by spatially dispersed bunchgrasses and small gaps between them; (ii) a diverse assemblage of bunchgrass species to maximize competitive interactions with B.tectorum in time and space; and (iii) biological soil crusts to limit B.tectorum establishment. Passive restoration by reducing cumulative cattle grazing may be one of the most effective means of achieving these three goals.

AB Beta diversity is an important concept used to describe turnover in species composition across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, and it underpins much of conservation theory and practice. Although substantial progress has been made in the mathematical and terminological treatment of different measures of beta diversity, there has been little conceptual synthesis of potential scale dependence of beta diversity with increasing spatial grain and geographic extent of sampling. Here, we evaluate different conceptual approaches to the spatial scaling of beta diversity, interpreted from fixed' and varying' perspectives of spatial grain and extent. We argue that a sliding window' perspective, in which spatial grain and extent covary, is an informative way to conceptualize community differentiation across scales. This concept more realistically reflects the varying empirical approaches that researchers adopt in field sampling and the varying scales of landscape perception by different organisms. Scale dependence in beta diversity has broad implications for emerging fields in ecology and biogeography, such as the integration of fine-resolution ecogenomic data with large-scale macroecological studies, as well as for guiding appropriate management responses to threats to biodiversity operating at different spatial scales.

AB 1. Despite recent interest in linkages between above- and below-ground communities and their consequences for ecosystem processes, much remains unknown about their responses to long-term ecosystem change. We synthesize multiple lines of evidence from a long-term natural experiment to illustrate how ecosystem retrogression (the decline in ecosystem process rates due to long-term absence of major disturbance) drives vegetation change, and thus above-ground and below-ground carbon (C) sequestration, and communities of consumer biota.

AB We carried out a simulation study to compare the efficiency of three alternative programs (dfdist, detseld and bayescan) to detect loci under directional selection from genome-wide scans using dominant markers. We also evaluated the efficiency of correcting for multiple testing those methods that use a classical probability approach. Under a wide range of scenarios, we conclude that bayescan appears to be more efficient than the other methods, detecting a usually high percentage of true selective loci as well as less than 1% of outliers (false positives) under a fully neutral model. In addition, the percentage of outliers detected by this software is always correlated with the true percentage of selective loci in the genome. Our results show, nevertheless, that false positives are common even with a combination of methods and multitest correction, suggesting that conclusions obtained from this approach should be taken with extreme caution.

   HISTORY; MODELS; COEXISTENCE; NEUTRALITY
AB The paradox of biodiversity involves three elements, (i) mathematical models predict that species must differ in specific ways in order to coexist as stable ecological communities, ( ii) such differences are difficult to identify, yet ( iii) there is widespread evidence of stability in natural communities. Debate has centred on two views. The first explanation involves tradeoffs along a small number of axes, including 'colonization-competition', resource competition ( light, water, nitrogen for plants, including the 'successional niche'), and life history (e.g. high-light growth vs. low-light survival and few large vs. many small seeds). The second view is neutrality, which assumes that species differences do not contribute to dynamics. Clark et al. ( 2004) presented a third explanation, that coexistence is inherently high dimensional, but still depends on species differences. We demonstrate that neither traditional low-dimensional tradeoffs nor neutrality can resolve the biodiversity paradox, in part by showing that they do not properly interpret stochasticity in statistical and in theoretical models. Unless sample sizes are small, traditional data modelling assures that species will appear different in a few dimensions, but those differences will rarely predict coexistence when parameter estimates are plugged into theoretical models. Contrary to standard interpretations, neutral models do not imply functional equivalence, but rather subsume species differences in stochastic terms. New hierarchical modelling techniques for inference reveal high-dimensional differences among species that can be quantified with random individual and temporal effects ( RITES), i.e. process-level variation that results from many causes. We show that this variation is large, and that it stands in for species differences along unobserved dimensions that do contribute to diversity. High dimensional coexistence contrasts with the classical notions of tradeoffs along a few axes, which are often not found in data, and with 'neutral models', which mask, rather than eliminate, tradeoffs in stochastic terms. This mechanism can explain coexistence of species that would not occur with simple, low-dimensional tradeoff scenarios.

AB Although the distribution of plant species abundance in a Minnesota grassland was consistent with neutral theory, niche but not neutral mechanisms were supported by the ability of species traits to predict species abundances in three experimental grassland communities. In particular, data from 27 species grown in monoculture showed that species differed in a trait, R*, which is the level to which each species reduced the concentration of soil nitrate, the limiting soil nutrient and which is predicted to be inversely associated with competitive ability for nitrogen (N). In these N-limited habitats, species abundance ranks correlated with their predicted competitive ranks: low R* species, on average dominated. These correlations were significantly different than expected for neutral theory, which assumes the exchangeability of species traits. Additionally, we found that changes in relative abundance after environmental change (N-addition or disturbance) were not neutral but also were significantly associated with R*.

TI An extant cichlid fish radiation emerged in an extinct Pleistocene lake
SO NATURE

ID EVOLUTION; VICTORIA; DESICCATION; AFRICA; ORIGIN
AB The haplochromine cichlid fish of the East African Great Lakes represent some of the fastest and most species-rich adaptive radiations known(1), but rivers in most of Africa accommodate only a few morphologically similar species of haplochromine cichlid fish. This has been explained by the wealth of ecological opportunity in large lakes compared with rivers. It is therefore surprising that the rivers of southern Africa harbour many, ecologically diverse haplochromines. Here we present genetic, morphological and biogeographical evidence suggesting that these riverine cichlids are products of a recent adaptive radiation in a large lake that dried up in the Holocene. Haplochromine species richness peaks steeply in an area for which geological data reveal the historical existence of Lake palaeo-Makgadikgadi(2,3). The centre of this extinct lake is now a saltpan north of the Kalahari Desert, but it once hosted a rapidly evolving fish species radiation, comparable in morphological diversity to that in the extant African Great Lakes. Importantly, this lake seeded all major river systems of southern Africa with ecologically diverse cichlids. This discovery reveals how local evolutionary processes operating during a short window of ecological opportunity can have a major and lasting effect on biodiversity on a continental scale.

AB Comparing species that become invasive with others from the same regional species pool that do not invade raises several issues about the accuracy of analyses attempting to define the determinants of invasiveness. The delimitation of the source area and deciding which species group(s) to include are especially relevant in analyses focusing on species originating in Europe. Historical patterns of immigration of alien species into Europe must be considered since European floras comprise a complex mix of native species, historical introductions (archaeophytes) and relative newcomers (neophytes). We make three main points: (1) Archaeophytes (species introduced to Europe before the discovery of America) differ from natives in a number of traits and in historical association with people; it is misleading to lump archaeophytes with native taxa. (2) Taxa from climatically and geographically different regions, representing distinct floristic geoelements, need to be treated separately, and not as a homogenous pool of potential invaders. Restricting the source species pool to native taxa with comparable phytogeographical characteristics reduces the variation associated with chance of dispersal by humans from the source area. (3) For prediction, a clear distinction should be made between accuracy (the proportion of those found to be alien that were also predicted to be there) and reliability (or predictive value, the proportion of those predicted to become aliens that do so). Information accumulated over centuries by botanists in Central Europe provides an excellent opportunity to deal with these issues and avoid spurious results. To illustrate these issues, we revisit a recently published study of Central-European plant species as invaders in two Argentinean provinces (Prinzing et al., 2002) to explore and demonstrate the implications of the above points. We hope that future studies will build on these points to achieve more reliable predictions.

AB We examined the occurrence of carabid beetles along a forest succession gradient in central Finland (forest age classes: 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 years since clear-cutting). Species richness of carabids was higher in the two youngest age classes, while no clear differences were detected in carabid abundance. The high species richness in the young, open sites was due to invasion of open-habitat species. Many forest species were absent from or scarce in the young sites and became gradually more abundant towards the older forest age classes. The catches indicated a drastic decrease and assemblage-level change in concert with canopy closure, i.e. 20-30 years after clear-cutting. Some forest specialists with poor dispersal ability may face local extinction, if the proportion of mature forest decreases further and the remaining mature stands become more isolated. We recommend that, while harvesting timber, connectivity between mature stands is ensured, mature stands are maintained close (a few tens of metres) to each other and the matrix quality is improved for forest species by green tree retention.

AB 1. Animals can reduce the competition for a limiting resource by temporal segregation, whereby individuals exploit the resource at different times. However, the pay-offs may vary predictably over time, and it can be predicted that (a) more dominant competitors should gain access to resources at the preferred times and (b) the degree of temporal segregation will vary with the intensity of competition.
   2. Here we show experimentally that individual brown trout Salmo trutta (L.) made sequential use of foraging areas, with dominant individuals feeding mainly at the most beneficial times of dusk and the early part of the night while more subordinate fish fed at other times.
   3. However, the degree of overlap in foraging times between high-ranking fish was dependent on energetic demands. At low temperatures (when requirements were low) the temporal activity patterns of top-ranking fish were synchronized, with foraging concentrated at the preferred times. In contrast, when temperature was raised to increase energetic requirements, activity patterns showed strong temporal segregation: the most dominant fish remained predominantly nocturnal, whereas second-ranking fish became increasingly diurnal.
   4. This is the first experimental demonstration of shifts in the daily pattern of activity caused by varying intensity of intraspecific competition.

AB We investigated genetic population structure in wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) from a series of Prairie Pothole wetlands in the northern Great Plains. Amphibians are often thought to exist in demographic metapopulations, which require some movement between populations, yet genetic studies have revealed strong subdivision among populations, even at relatively fine scales (several km). Wood frogs are highly philopatric and studies of dispersal suggest that they may exhibit subdivision on a scale of approximate to 1-2 km. We used microsatellites to examine population structure among 11 breeding assemblages separated by as little as 50 m up to approximate to 5.5 km, plus one population separated from the others by 20 km. We found evidence for differentiation at the largest distances we examined and among a few neighbouring ponds, but most populations were strikingly similar in allele frequencies, suggesting high gene now among all but the most distant populations. We hypothesize that the few significant differences among neighbouring populations at the finest scale may be a transient effect of extinction-recolonization founder events, driven by periodic drying of wetlands in this hydrologically dynamic landscape.

AB We review species richness in major organism groups, mainly using examples from northern Europe. A high proportion of these species is forest living, and large numbers are dependent on decaying wood. Biodiversity can be assessed at various scales using two different principles. One is to use features. such as ancient and dead trees, known to be important for a large number of species. The other method is to choose species or groups of species known to indicate high biodiversity or presence of many red-listed species. We argue that any serious biodiversity assessment method should include the most species rich organism groups, for example insects. In the present paper we point out the most important features for high biodiversity (old trees and large dead trees), and review the quantities of these features in near-virgin forests. The natural disturbance regime of a region should be the basis for defining a suitable scale and the appropriate features for biodiversity assessment. Possible indicator species for high biodiversity in northern Europe are suggested. based on previous investigations. Among epiphytic lichens and wood-living beetles there are many potentially useful species in addition to vascular plants in the nemoral forest. Among vertebrates, woodpeckers and grouses seem to be the most useful. Validation tests for indicator structures and species are largely lacking but urgently needed. The implications of possible delayed local extinctions tire important to bear in mind when managing for sustainable forestry. The knowledge of forest history is useful when developing cost-efficient measures.
