AB We present and describe a modeling and analysis framework for monitoring protected area (PA) ecosystems with net primary productivity (NPP) as an indicator of health. It brings together satellite data, an ecosystem simulation model (NASA-CASA), spatial linear models with autoregression, and a GIS to provide practitioners a low-cost, accessible ecosystem monitoring and analysis system (EMAS) at landscape resolutions. The EMAS is evaluated and assessed with an application example in Yellowstone National Park aimed at identifying the causes and consequences of drought. Utilizing five predictor covariates (solar radiation, burn severity, soil temperature, and precipitation), spatio-temporal analysis revealed how landscape controls and productivity, climate (summer vegetation moisture stress) affected patterns of NPP according to vegetation functional type, species cover type, and successional stage. These results supported regional and national trends of NPP in relation to carbon fluxes and lag effects of climate. Overall, the EMAS provides valuable decision support for PAS regarding informed land use planning, conservation programs, vital sign monitoring, control programs (fire fuels, invasives, etc.), and restoration efforts (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Improved understanding of tree-growth responses to climate is needed to model and predict forest ecosystem responses to current and future climatic variability. We applied dendroclimatological techniques to assess the effects of inter-annual climate variations on radial growth of high-elevation conifers in the central Hengduan Mountains, southwestern China. Eight tree-ring width chronologies of the major tree genera Abies and Picea that are aligned along an elevation gradient from 3200 to 4200 m a.s.l, were developed. Correlation and principal component analyses for the eight chronologies identified three groups of sites, representing different patterns of growth-climate relationships. Correlation and redundancy analyses with regional climate data revealed that radial growth of fir growing at high-elevation sites is enhanced by normal or warm summer temperatures (June and July) during the current growing season. In addition, radial growth of trees growing from high to middle elevations is sensitive to low temperatures during winter season. At low-elevation sites, trees display low sensitivity to temperature variation. However spring moisture availability becomes crucial for radial growth regardless of tree species. High- to middle-elevation conifers in the central Hengduan Mountains may benefit from the current climate warming, especially from rising winter temperatures. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB The environment that an offspring experiences during its development can have lifelong consequences for its morphology, anatomy, physiology and behaviour that are strong enough to span generations. One aspect of an offspring's environment that can have particularly pronounced and long-lasting effects is that provided by its parent(s) (maternal effects). Some disciplines in biology have been quicker to appreciate maternal effects than others, and some organisms provide better model systems for understanding the causes and consequences of the maternal environment for ecology and evolution than others. One field in which maternal effects has been poorly represented, and yet is likely to represent a particularly fruitful area for research, is the field of cooperative breeding (i.e. systems where offspring are reared by carers in addition to parent(s)). Here, we attempt to illustrate the scope of cooperative breeding systems for maternal effects research and, conversely, highlight the importance of maternal effects research for understanding cooperative breeding systems. To this end, we first outline why mothers will commonly benefit from affecting the phenotype of their offspring in cooperative breeding systems, present potential strategies that mothers could employ in order to do so and offer predictions regarding the circumstances under which different types of maternal effects might be expected. Second, we highlight why a neglect of maternal strategies and the effects that they have on their offspring could lead to miscalculations of helper/worker fitness gains and a misunderstanding of the factors selecting for the evolution and maintenance of cooperative breeding. Finally, we introduce the possibility that maternal effects could have significant consequences for our understanding of both the evolutionary origins of cooperative breeding and the rise of social complexity in cooperative systems.

AB We used rarefaction curve analysis and diversity ordering-based approaches to rank the 11 most frequently encountered bacterial lineages in soil according to diversity in 5 previously reported 16S rRNA gene clone libraries derived from agricultural, undisturbed tall grass prairie and forest soils (n = 26,140, 28 328, 31 818, 13 001 and 53 533). The Planctomycetes, Firmicutes and the delta-Proteobacteria were consistently ranked among the most diverse lineages in all data sets, whereas the Verrucomicrobia, Gemmatimonadetes and beta-Proteobacteria were consistently ranked among the least diverse. On the other hand, the rankings of alpha-Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Chloroflexi varied widely in different soil clone libraries. In general, lineages exhibiting largest differences in diversity rankings also exhibited the largest difference in relative abundance in the data sets examined. Within these lineages, a positive correlation between relative abundance and diversity was observed within the Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi, and a negative diversity-abundance correlation was observed within the Bacteroidetes. The ecological and evolutionary implications of these results are discussed.

AB Recent models of community assembly, structure, and dynamics have incorporated, to varying degrees, three mechanistic processes: resource limitation and interspecific competition, niche requirements of species, and exchanges between a local community and a regional species pool. Synthesizing 30 years of data from an intensively studied desert rodent community, we show that all of these processes, separately and in combination, have influenced the structural organization of this community and affected its dynamical response to both natural environmental changes and experimental perturbations. In addition, our analyses suggest that zero-sum constraints, niche differences, and metacommunity processes are inextricably linked in the ways that they affect the structure and dynamics of this system. Explicit consideration of the interaction of these processes should yield a deeper understanding of the assembly and dynamics of other ecological communities. This synthesis highlights the role that long-term data, especially when coupled with experimental manipulations, can play in assessing the fundamental processes that govern the structure and function of ecological communities.

AB Sperm competition has classically been thought to maintain anisogamy (large eggs and smaller sperm) because males are thought to maximize their chance of winning fertilizations by trading sperm size for number. More recently it has been recognized that sperm quality (e.g., size, velocity) can also influence sperm competition, although studies have yielded conflicting results. Because sex evolved in the sea, debate has continued over the role of sperm competition and sperm environment in determining both sperm and egg size in externally fertilizing broadcast spawners. Remarkably, however, there have been no direct tests of whether broadcast spawners change the traits of their gametes depending on the likelihood of sperm competition. We manipulated the density (and thus, sperm environment) of a broadcast spawning ascidian (Styela plicata) in the field and then determined whether the phenotype of eggs and sperm changed. We found that sperm from adults kept at high density were larger and more motile than sperm from low-density adults. in vitro fertilizations revealed that sperm from high-density adults also lived longer and induced less polyspermy. Adult density also affected egg traits: eggs from high-density adults were smaller targets for sperm overall but produced larger ovicells than eggs from low-density adults. This suggests that broadcast spawning mothers balance (potentially conflicting) pre- and postzygotic selection pressures on egg size. Overall, our results suggest that sperm competition does not represent a strong force maintaining anisogamy in broadcast spawners. Instead, sperm limitation seems to select for large eggs and smaller, more numerous sperm.

AB Aim The aim of this study was to determine whether the Casiquiare River functions as a free dispersal corridor or as a partial barrier (i.e. filter) for the interchange of fish species of the Orinoco and Negro/Amazon basins using species assemblage patterns according to geographical location and environmental features.
   Location The Casiquiare, Upper Orinoco and Upper Negro rivers in southern Venezuela, South America. Methods Our study was based on an analysis of species presence/absence data and environmental information (11 habitat characteristics) collected by the authors and colleagues between the years 1984 and 1999. The data set consisted of 269 sampled sites and 452 fish species (> 50,000 specimens). A wide range of habitat types was included in the samples, and the collection sites were located at various points along the entire length of the Casiquiare main channel, at multiple sites on its tributary streams, as well as at various nearby sites outside the Casiquiare drainage, within the Upper Orinoco and Upper Rio Negro river systems. Most specimens and field data used in this analysis are archived in the Museo de Ciencias Naturales in Guanare, Venezuela. We performed canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) based on species presence/absence using two versions of the data set: one that eliminated sites having < 5 species and species occurring at < 5 sites; and another that eliminated sites having < 10 species and species occurring at < 10 sites. Cluster analysis was performed on sites based on species assemblage similarity, and a separate analysis was performed on species based on CCA loadings.
   Results The CCA results for the two versions of the data set were qualitatively the same. The dominant environmental axis contrasted assemblages and sites associated with blackwater vs. clearwater conditions. Longitudinal position on the Casiquiare River was correlated (r(2) = 0.33) with CCA axis-1 scores, reflecting clearwater conditions nearer to its origin (bifurcation of the Orinoco) and blackwater conditions nearer to its mouth (junction with the Rio Negro). The second CCA axis was most strongly associated with habitat size and structural complexity. Species associations derived from the unweighted pair-group average clustering method and pair-wise squared Euclidean distances calculated from species loadings on CCA axes 1 and 2 showed seven ecological groupings. Cluster analysis of species assemblages according to watershed revealed a stronger influence of local environmental conditions than of geographical proximity.
   Main conclusions Fish assemblage composition is more consistently associated with local environmental conditions than with geographical position within the river drainages. Nonetheless, the results support the hypothesis that the mainstem Casiquiare represents a hydrochemical gradient between clearwaters at its origin and blackwaters at its mouth, and as such appears to function as a semi-permeable barrier (environmental filter) to dispersal and faunal exchanges between the partially vicariant fish faunas of the Upper Orinoco and Upper Negro rivers.

AB Current theory expects that fungi, on the one hand, are spatially ubiquitous but, on the other, are more susceptible than bacteria to disturbance such as land use change due to dispersal limitations. This study examined the relative importance of location and land use effects in determining soil fungal community composition in south-eastern Australia. We use terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP; primer pair ITS1-F-ITS4) and multivariate statistical methods (NMDS ordinations, ANOSIM tests) to compare relative similarities of soil fungal communities from nine sites encompassing three locations (ca 50-200 km apart) and four land uses (native eucalypt forest, Pinus radiata plantation, Eucalyptus globulus plantation, and unimproved pasture). Location effects were generally weak (e.g. ANOSIM test statistic R <= 0.49) and were, in part, attributed to minor differences in soil texture. By contrast, we found clear and consistent evidence of land use effects on soil fungal community composition (R <= 0.95). That is, soils from sites of the same land use grouped together in NMDS ordinations of fungal composition despite geographic separations of up to ca 175 km (native eucalypt forests) and 215 km (P. radiata plantations). In addition, different land. uses from the same location were clearly separate in NMDS ordinations, despite, in one case, being just 180 m apart and having similar land use histories (i.e. P. radiata versus E. globulus plantation both established on pasture in the previous decade). Given negligible management of all sites beyond the early establishment phase, we attribute much of the land use effects to changes in dominant plant species based on consistent evidence elsewhere of strong specificity in pine and eucalypt mycorrhizal associations. In addition, weak to moderate correlations between soil fungal community composition and soil chemical variables (e.g. Spearman rank correlation coefficients for individual variables of 0.08-0.32), indicated a minor contributing role of vegetation-mediated changes in litter and soil chemistry. Our data provide evidence of considerable plasticity in soil fungal community composition over time spans as short as 6-11 years. This suggests that - at least within geographic zones characterised by more-or-less contiguous forest cover - soil fungal community composition depends most on availability of suitable habitat because dispersal propagules are readily available for colonisation after land use change.

AB The phylogenetic history of Medicago was examined for 60 accessions from 56 species using two nuclear genes (CNGC5 and beta-cop) and one mitochondrial region (rpS14-cob). The results of several analyses revealed that extensive robustly supported incongruence exists among the nuclear genes, the cause of which we seek to explain. After rejecting several processes, hybridization and lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms remained as the most likely factors promoting incongruence. Using coalescence simulations, we rejected lineage sorting alone as an explanation of the differences among gene trees. The results indicate that hybridization has been common and ongoing among lineages since the origin of Medicago. Coalescence provides a good framework to test the causes of incongruence commonly seen among gene trees but requires knowledge of effective population sizes and generation times. We estimated the effective population size at 240,000 individuals and assumed a generation time of 1 year in Medicago (many are annual plants). A sensitivity analysis showed that our conclusions remain unchanged using a larger effective population size and/or longer generation time.

AB Effective management of introduced species requires the early identification of species that pose a significant threat of becoming invasive. To better understand the invasive ecology of species in New England, USA, we compiled a character data set with which to compare non-native species that are known invaders to non-native species that are not currently known to be invasive. In contrast to previous biological trait-based models, we employed a Bayesian hierarchical analysis to identify sets of plant traits associated with invasiveness for each of three growth forms (vines, shrubs, and trees). The resulting models identify a suite of 'invasive traits' highlighting the ecology associated with invasiveness for each of three growth forms. The most effective predictors of invasiveness that emerged from our model were 'invasive elsewhere', 'fast growth rate', 'native latitudinal range', and 'growth form'. The contrast among growth forms was pronounced. For example, 'wind dispersal' was positively correlated with invasiveness in trees, but negatively correlated in shrubs and vines. The predictive model was able to correctly classify invasive plants 67% of the time (22/33), and non-invasive plants 95% of the time (204/215). A number of potential future invasive species in New England that deserve management consideration were identified.

AB Alien plant invasions result from a complex interaction between the species life traits (i.e. 'invasiveness') and the recipient ecosystem attributes (i.e. 'invasibility'). However, little is known about the demographical strategy of invaders and its plasticity among similar ecosystems. To assess the role of demographical attributes and their interaction with soil and light conditions on the durable integration of an exotic invasive tree species into a recipient forest, we analyzed population structure, sexual and clonal reproduction, and growth characteristics of the American black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.) in a European forest. As seeds, R serotina is able to enter closed-canopy forests and form a long-living sapling bank, according to the 'Oskar syndrome' (no height growth, diameter increment < 0.06 mm year(-1)). Suppressed saplings typically develop a 'sit-and-wait' strategy so that the invader had a head start on native species when a disturbance-induced gap occurs. Once released, suppressed saplings grow rapidly (height growth > 56 cm year(-1)) to reach the canopy, fill in the gap and produce numerous seeds (6011 per tree on average). During the self-thinning process characterizing the aggrading phase, overtopped saplings die back but subsequently resprout from roots and stumps, going back to 'Oskar' stage. This 'Alice behaviour' would enable individuals to decrease in size, delay mortality and locally self-maintain in the understories. These results suggest that P. serotina may successfully invade European forests thanks to a combination of traits which fits well the disturbance regime of the recipient ecosystems. It would behave as a shade-tolerant K-strategist in juvenile stages by giving priority to persistence, but as a light-demanding r-strategist once released, by allocating high energy in growth and reproduction. Initial stages of colonisation are weakly affected by soil but strongly by light conditions. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Competition between two invasive plants of similar growth form, Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) (Royle) and Egeria densa (Planch), was studied in response to season and sediment fertility. These two invasive species were grown in outdoor concrete tanks in monocultures, and mixtures. Five fertilization rates were tested for monocultures and two for mixtures where six combinations of planting densities were used in two seasons (spring and fall). Monitoring of plant biomass was made at the end of each of these 2-month-experiments. In contrast to E densa, clear seasonal patterns in biomass production and in reproductive allocations of H. verticillata were evident. Competitive pressure for both species was lower during the fall experiment. Biomass production increased with fertilization for H. verticillata in monocultures and changes either in allocative ratios or in tuber production patterns were shown in response to nutrient availability. However, E. densa growth was not affected by fertilization. In most cases, H. verticillata was a better competitor than E. densa except when sediment was pure sand. Competition occurred mainly for nutrient uptake rather than for light harvesting. These results suggest that despite the similar ecology, H. verticillata may outcompete E. densa in many situations, probably due to its higher plasticity. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Detrended canonical correspondence analysis is used to estimate the amount of palynological change or compositional turnover in ten Holocene pollen-stratigraphical sequences from Setesdal, southern Norway. The results, when the analyses are standardised for the same time interval, show that the highest amounts of change occurred at sites in the south of Setesdal where there is a richer tree flora. This primarily methodological study provides a robust approach to answering the question as to how much change is recorded within a pollen sequence, and to summarising the amount of change between sequences.

AB Plant polyploid complexes provide useful model systems for distinguishing between adaptive and nonadaptive causes of parapatric distributions in closely related lineages. Polyploidy often gives rise to morphological and physiological changes, which may be adaptive to different environments, but separate distributions may also be maintained by reproductive interference caused by postzygotic reproductive isolation. Here, we test the hypothesis that diploid and descendent polyploid races of the wind-pollinated herb Mercurialis annua, which are found in parapatry over an environmental gradient in northeast Spain, are differentiated in their ecophysiology and life history. We also ask whether any such differences represent adaptations to their different natural environments. On the basis of a series of reciprocal transplant experiments in the field, and experiments under controlled conditions, we found that diploid and polyploid populations of M. annua are ecologically differentiated, but that they do not show local adaptation; rather, the diploids have higher fitness than the polyploids across both diploid- and polyploid-occupied regions. In fact, diploids are currently displacing polyploids by advancing south on two separate fronts in Spain, and previous work has shown that this displacement is being driven to a large extent by asymmetrical pollen swamping. Our results here suggest that ecophysiological superiority of the diploids may also be contributing to their expansion.

AB Data from 40 published studies of the diet composition of larval and juvenile cod (Gadus morhua) from around the northern North Atlantic were summarized to assess generic patterns in ontogenetic and regional variability in the key prey. The results showed that larvae at the northern edge of the latitudinal range of cod depend primarily on development stages of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, whilst those at the southern edge depend on Para- and Pseudocalanus species. Juvenile cod preyed on a wider range of taxa than larvae, but euphausiids were the main target prey. Analysis of regional variations in the relative abundances of C. finmarchicus and Para/Pseudocalanus spp. in the plankton, as estimated by the continuous plankton recorder (CPR) surveys, showed a similar geographical pattern to the larval cod stomach contents. Comparison of CPR data from the 1960s and 70s with data from the 1990s showed that the boundary between C. finmarchicus and Para/Pseudocalanus spp. dominance has shifted northwards on both sides of the Atlantic, whilst the abundance of euphausiids in the southern cod stock regions has declined. The results are discussed in relation to regional differences in the response of cod stocks to climate variability.

AB Biogenic structures built by ecosystem engineers such as corals, bivalves, polychaetes, and sea grasses provide habitat for benthic vertebrates and invertebrates. The polychaete Sabellaria alveolata is an important foundation species whose reef structure adds topographic complexity and high levels of biodiversity to the otherwise low-relief, low diversity, soft-bottom environments in the Bay of Mont Saint-Michel, France, where the largest such reef formations in Europe are found. In this bay, reefs are being increasingly colonised by oysters (Crassostrea gigas) from local aquaculture operations and by green algae (Ulva sp.) due to the increasing inputs of nitrates from terrestrial origin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible impacts of epibiotic oysters and green algae on the S. alveolata population and reef community structure in the Bay of Mont Saint-Michel, France. Univariate and multivariate comparisons of macrofauna were conducted for five reef types: controls (no epibionts), low oyster density, high oyster density, green algae, and oyster and green algae. Results showed that all the three reef types with oysters had significantly higher species richness and diversity values than control and algae-only reef types. Pairwise ANOSIM and SIMPER comparisons of controls versus the four reef types with epibionts revealed that all three of the reef types with oysters were significantly different from controls, but there was no significant difference between controls and algae-only reef types. A striking feature of the reef comparisons is that no single species in this species-rich system contributed more than 8.86% to the dissimilarity between the reef types. Thus, k-dominance curves for species abundances were not effective in revealing differences among the reef types. Our results demonstrate that recent anthropogenic inputs of oysters affect the reef species assemblage more strongly than algal epibionts. In addition, epibionts, especially green algae, alter S. alveolata population structure, causing a reduction in new recruits that over the long run may cause significant damage to the reef structure itself. These results are a first step towards understanding anthropogenic threats to S. alveolata reefs and may be useful in the development of strategies for their protection and management.

AB The relative importance of the factors driving change in the population dynamics of nematodes in the soil is almost completely unknown. Top-down control by micro-arthropod predators may have a significant impact on nematode population dynamics. We report experiments showing that mites and Collembola were capable of reducing nematode numbers in the laboratory and were feeding on a targeted nematode species in the field. A PCR-based approach was developed for the detection of predation on three species of slug- and insect-pathogenic nematodes: Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita, Heterorhabditis megidis and Steinernema feltiae. The collembolan Folsomia candida and the mesostigmatid mite Stratiolaelaps miles were employed as model predators to calibrate post-ingestion prey DNA detection times. Fragments of cytochrome oxidase I (COI) mtDNA were sequenced and species-specific primers were designed, amplifying 154-, 154- and 203-bp fragments for each of the nematode species. Detection times for nematode DNA within the guts of Collembola were longer than in mites, with half-lives (50% of samples testing positive) of 08.75 h and 05.03 h, respectively. F. candida significantly reduced numbers of the nematode H. megidis, with rates of predation of similar to 0.4 nematode infective juveniles per collembolan per hour over 10 h. Four taxa of field-caught micro-arthropod that had been exposed to the nematode P. hermaphrodita for a period of 12 h were analysed and significant numbers of three taxa tested positive. This is the first application of PCR techniques for the study of nematophagy and the first time these techniques have been used to measure predation on nematodes in the field.

AB The structure and dynamics of small eukaryotes (cells with a diameter less than 5 mu m) were studied over two consecutive years in an oligomesotrophic lake (Lake Pavin in France). Water samples were collected at 5 and 30 in below the surface; when the lake was stratified, these depths corresponded to the epilimnion and hypolimnion. Changes in small-eukaryote structure were analyzed using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and cloning and sequencing of the 18S rRNA genes. Terminal restriction fragments from clones were used to reveal the dominant taxa in T-RFLP profiles of the environmental samples. Spumella-like cells (Chrysophyceae) did not dominate the small eukaryote community identified by molecular techniques in lacustrine ecosystems. Small eukaryotes appeared to be dominated by heterotrophic cells, particularly Cercozoa, which represented nearly half of the identified phylotypes, followed by the Fungi-LKM11 group (25%), choanoflagellates (10.3%) and Chrysophyceae (8.9%). Bicosoecida, Cryptophyta, and ciliates represented less than 9% of the community studied. No seasonal reproducibility in temporal evolution of the small-eukaryote community was observed from I year to the next. The T-RFLP patterns were related to bottom-tip (resources) and top-down (grazing) variables using canonical correspondence analysis. The results showed a strong top-down regulation of small eukaryotes by zooplankton, more exactly, by cladocerans at 5 in and copepods at 30 m. Among bottom-up factors, temperature had a significant effect at both depths. The concentrations of nitrogenous nutrients and total phosphorus also had an effect on small-eukaryote dynamics at 5 m, whereas bacterial abundance and dissolved oxygen played a more important structuring role in the deeper zone.

AB Regulation of resource allocation in plants is the key to integrate understanding of metabolism and resource flux across the whole plant. The challenge is to understand tradeoffs as plants balance allocation between different and conflicting demands, e.g., for staying competitive with neighbours and ensuring defence against parasites. Related hypothesis evaluation can, however, produce equivocal results. Overcoming deficits in understanding underlying mechanisms is achieved through integrated experimentation and modelling the various spatio-temporal scaling levels, from genetic control and cell metabolism towards resource flux at the stand level. An integrated, interdisciplinary research concept on herbaceous and woody plants and its outcome to date are used, while drawing attention to currently available knowledge. This assessment is based on resource allocation as driven through plant-pathogen and plant-mycorrhizosphere interaction, as well as competition with neighbouring plants in stands, conceiving such biotic interactions as a "unity" in the control of allocation. Biotic interaction may diminish or foster effects of abiotic stress on allocation, as changes in allocation do not necessarily result from metabolic re-adjustment but may obey allometric rules during ontogeny. Focus is required on host-pathogen interaction under variable resource supply and disturbance, including effects of competition and mycorrhization. Cost/benefit relationships in balancing resource investments versus gains turned out to be fundamental in quantifying competitiveness when related to the space, which is subject to competitive resource exploitation. A space-related view of defence as a form of prevention of decline in competitiveness may promote conversion of resource turnover across the different kinds of biotic interaction, given their capacity in jointly controlling whole plant resource allocation.

AB Explaining patterns of latitudinal and seasonal trends in clutch size are two of the oldest and most fundamental endeavors in avian life history research. Underlying the majority of studies regarding any type of clutch size variation (i.e., individual, seasonal, latitudinal) of altricial birds is the premise that the primary cost of reproduction stems from feeding offspring. However, both altricial and precocial species of birds display latitudinal and seasonal variation in clutch size. Additionally, individual variation in costs of laying and incubation, recently demonstrated, indicates that understanding latitudinal and seasonal clutch size trends will require increased attention to earlier phases of reproduction.
   Given the strength and ubiquity of the clutch size patterns, many environmental factors, such as food supply and predation, have been proposed to account for the patterns, but temperature has been largely overlooked. Gradients in many variables may be important because the primacy of selection pressures may also vary in space and time. Furthermore, physiological systems may constrain responses to selection pressures. Thus, it is possible that intraspecific geographic and seasonal patterns in clutch size are at least partially influenced by temperature-dependent physiological processes. Therefore, we suggest that it is important to examine physiological responses of birds (e.g., embryo development, incubation energetics) directly influenced by physical properties of the environment, which exhibit predictable types of spatial and temporal variation (e.g., temperature, humidity, day length). We review two recently proposed, complementary hypotheses that are excellent candidates for this approach. By one mechanism, the thermal inertia of large clutches makes them favorable in cooler weather (the clutch-cooling hypothesis of J.M. Reid et al.). By the other, the reduction in egg viability under warm temperatures favors small clutches (the egg-viability hypothesis of S. H. Stoleson and S. R. Beissinger). Using general linear mixed models, we found that large-scale nesting patterns of Eastern Bluebirds and Red-winged Blackbirds are consistent with the egg-viability hypothesis in that females appear to initiate incubation before clutch completion when they lay large clutches at low latitudes. Although attempts have been made to overcome the logistical obstacles associated with studying large-scale phenomena through meta-analyses and multiple small-scale study sites, we demonstrate the significant potential of new technologies combined with volunteer-based studies to validate these hypotheses as we outline directions for future research.

AB Geographic variation in the mtDNA haplotypes (cytochrome b gene) of 127 European pond turtles from Italy was investigated. Thirty-eight of the Italian samples were also studied by nuclear fingerprinting (ISSR PCR) and compared with samples from other parts of the range representing all nine currently known mtDNA lineages of Emys orbicularis. Our genetic findings were compared against morphological data sets (measurements, colour pattern) for 109 adult turtles from southern Italy. Italy is displaying on a small geographical scale the most complicated variation known over the entire distributional area of Emys (North Africa over Europe and Asia Minor to the Caspian and Aral Seas). The Tyrrhenic coast of the Apennine Peninsula, the Mt. Pollino area and Basilicata are inhabited by Emys orbicularis galloitalica, a subspecies harbouring a distinct mtDNA lineage. The same lineage is also found in Sardinia. Along the Adriatic coast of Italy and on the Salentine Peninsula (Apulia, southern Italy), another morphologically distinctive subspecies (Emys orbicularis hellenica) occurs, which also bears a different mtDNA lineage. A higher diversity of mtDNA haplotypes in the south of the Apennine Peninsula suggests that the glacial refugia of E. o. galloitalica and E. o. hellenica were located here. A further refuge of E. o. hellenica probably existed in the southern Balkans. The west coasts of the Balkans and Corfu have probably been colonized from Italy and not from the geographically closer southern Balkanic refuge. In Sicily, a third mtDNA lineage is distributed, which is sister to all other known lineages of Emys. Morphologically, Sicilian pond turtles resemble E. o. galloitalica. However, nuclear fingerprinting revealed a clear distinctiveness of the Sicilian taxon, whereas no significant divergence was detected between representatives of the other eight mtDNA lineages of Emys. Furthermore, nuclear fingerprinting provided no evidence for current or past gene flow between the Sicilian taxon and the mainland subspecies of E. orbicularis. Therefore, Sicilian pond turtles are described here as a species new to science. Some populations in Calabria and on the Salentine Peninsula comprise individuals of different mtDNA lineages. We interpret this as a natural contact. However, we cannot exclude that these syntopic occurrences are the result of human activity. For example, in other parts of Italy, the natural distribution pattern of Emys is obscured by allochthonous turtles. This could also be true for southern Italy. The discovery of the complex taxonomic differentiation in southern Italy requires reconsidering conservation strategies.

Here we present a Bayesian analysis of species-abundance data that yields a full joint probability distribution of each model's parameters plus a relatively parameter-independent criterion, the posterior Bayes factor, to compare these models. We illustrate our approach by comparing three classical distributions: the zero-sum multinomial (ZSM) distribution, based on Hubbell's neutral model, the multivariate Poisson lognormal distribution (MPLN), based on niche arguments, and the discrete broken stick (DBS) distribution, based on MacArthur's broken stick model. We give explicit formulas for the probability of observing a particular species-abundance data set in each model, and argue that conditioning on both sample size and species count is needed to allow comparisons between the two distributions. We apply our approach to two neotropical communities (trees, fish). We find that DBS is largely inferior to ZSM and MPLN for both communities. The tree data do not allow discrimination between ZSM and MPLN, but for the fish data ZSM (neutral model) overwhelmingly outperforms MPLN (niche model), suggesting that dispersal plays a previously underestimated role in structuring tropical freshwater fish communities. We advocate this approach for identifying the relative importance of dispersal and niche-partitioning in determining diversity of different ecological groups of species under different environmental conditions.

AB 1. When prey occur at high densities, energy assimilation rates are generally constrained by rates of digestion rather than by rates of collection (i.e. search and handle). As predators usually select patches containing high prey densities, rates of digestion will play an important role in the foraging ecology of a species.
   2. The red knot Calidris canutus shows tremendous inter- and intra-individual variation in maximum rates of digestion due to variation in the size of the processing machinery (gizzard and intestine), which makes it a suitable species to study the effects of digestive processing rate on foraging decisions.
   3. Here we report on patch use, prey choice, and daily foraging times as a function of gizzard size in free-ranging, radio-marked, red knots. As knots crush their bulky bivalve prey in their gizzard, the size of this organ, which we measured using ultrasonography, determines digestive processing rate.
   4. Using the digestive rate model, we a priori modelled patch use, prey choice, and daily foraging times as a function of gizzard mass. Focusing on two contrasting patches, birds with small gizzards were expected to feed on high-quality (soft-bodied) prey found in low densities in the one patch, while birds with large gizzards were expected to feed on low-quality (hard-shelled) prey found in high densities in the other patch. Assuming that red knots aim to balance their energy budget on a daily basis, we expected daily foraging time to decline with gizzard mass.
   5. Observed patch and prey choices were in quantitative agreement with these theoretical predictions. Observed daily foraging times were only in qualitative agreement: they declined with gizzard mass but less steeply than predicted.
   6. We discuss that red knots might be aiming for a slightly positive energy budget in order to (i) refuel their stores depleted during migration, and (ii) to insure against unpredictability in supply and demand during winter. Red knots arriving from their breeding grounds with small gizzards are only able to realize this aim when densities of soft-bodied prey are high, which is the case in late July and early August. Rapidly declining soft-bodied prey densities throughout late summer pose a major penalty for individuals arriving late at their wintering grounds.
   7. The long daily foraging periods required by knots with small gizzards are only feasible through 'tide-extension'. In our study area, birds can and do raise the daily low tide period from 12 h to almost 17 h by moving along with the tide in an easterly direction, subsequently flying back to their starting point at the high tide roost.

AB Light use efficiency (LUE) models are often used with remotely sensed data products to estimate net primary production (NPP) from local to global scales. However, data on the variability of the LUE coefficient, epsilon, on the landscape are minimal and sometimes conflicting. The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify and compare the variability of LUE among five forest cover types: aspen, northern hardwoods, red pine, forested wetland, and upland conifer; and (2) quantify the variability of epsilon between two years, 1999 and 2000, and relate differences to environmental conditions. The study site was in a northern temperate forest in Wisconsin, USA. Northern hardwood forests, primarily consisting of sugar maple, had the highest epsilon each year followed by aspen, red pine, forested wetlands, and upland conifer. NPP was estimated using radial growth measurements and published allometric equations. Absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) was estimated optically using a Li-Cor Plant Canopy Analyzer. Growing season - of all forest cover types increased significantly from 0.42 in 1999 to 0.47 (gC MJ(-1)) in 2000. Annual E of all forest cover types increased significantly from 0.33 in 1999 to 0.36 (gC MJ(-1)) in 2000. Growing season and annual g differed significantly (p less than or equal to 0.001) among forest cover types for each year. Future research should consider variations in LUE among mixtures of many land cover types, especially forested wetlands. Results from this study show that LUE models should consider species-specific efficiency factors rather than biome-specific factors. Remote sensing-based land cover classifications should also reflect species differences for this area if the classification map is used in estimating NPP with an LUE model. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB Maternal effects, in which differences in parental state cause differences in offspring fitness, are important in trade-offs influencing an individual's optimal reproductive strategy. In zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) we manipulated the nutritional state for four weeks before the start of breeding through protein supplementation. Zebra finches were kept on identical diets during the rest of the experiment. We then tested the effects of maternal state on offspring size, survival and fecundity. In order to separate the effects of maternal state occurring through egg production, incubation and chick-rearing, we used a cross-fostering experiment. We show that a protein-rich diet prior to laying improved maternal body weight prior to breeding compared with birds on a protein-poor diet. Poorer maternal state prior to breeding gave rise to offspring with lower fecundity than offspring from birds in a better nutritional state. Maternal state is thought to affect the conditions developing offspring experience through the bird's ability to produce and incubate eggs. Male and female embryos differed in their responses to conditions at different developmental stages. This shows that embryonic developmental conditions and sex differences in vulnerability to these conditions need to be incorporated into future models of selection, life-history evolution and sex-ratio theory.

   HYPOTHESIS
AB Viviparity (live bearing) has evolved from egg laying (oviparity) in many lineages of lizards and snakes, apparently in response to occupancy of cold climates. Explanations for this pattern have focused on the idea that behaviorally thermoregulating (sun-basking) pregnant female reptiles can maintain higher incubation temperatures for their embryos than would be available in nests under the soil surface. This is certainly true at very high elevations, where only viviparous species occur. However, comparisons of nest and lizard temperatures at sites close to the upper elevational limit for oviparous reptiles (presumably, the selective environment where the transition from oviparity to viviparity actually occurs) suggest that reproductive mode has less effect on mean incubation temperatures than on the diet distribution of those temperatures. Nests of the oviparous scincid lizard Bassiana duperreyi showed smooth diet cycles of heating and cooling. In contrast, body temperatures of the viviparous scincid Eulamprus heatwolei rose abruptly in the morning, were high and stable during daylight hours, and fell abruptly at night. Laboratory incubation experiments mimicking these patterns showed that developmental rates of eggs and phenotypic traits of hatchling B. duperreyi were sensitive to this type of thermal variance as well as to mean temperature. Hence, diel distributions as well as mean incubation temperatures may have played an important role in the selective forces for viviparity. More generally, variances as well as mean values of abiotic factors may constitute significant selective forces on life-history evolution.

AB In order to assess the utility of microsatellite DNA markers for detecting changes of genetic diversity in hatchery strains and for estimating their genetic relationships, we used six microsatellite markers to estimate the level of genetic diversity within three hatchery strains and two wild populations of Pacific abalone, and compared the degree of genetic differentiation between them. High polymorphism, at the microsatellite loci was found within both hatchery and wild abalone populations. Compared to wild populations, all the hatchery strains showed less genetic variation as revealed in lower number of alleles and lower expected heterozygosity, indicating that bottleneck effects occurred when each strain was founded. Significant differentiation was found between the hatchery strains, and between the hatchery strains and wild populations (F-st range: 0.059-0.427; R-st range: 0.056-0.351), and no obvious difference was detected between the wild populations (F-st =0.004; R-st = 0.007). According to the neighbor-joining tree topology constructed on the basis of genetic distances among individuals, almost all individuals from each hatchery strain were closely clustered, demonstrating the feasibility of microsatellite analysis for discrimination between hatchery strains. The results obtained in this study indicate that it is necessary to genetically characterize the abalone strains that are being released every year in order to monitor the effect on the genetic diversity of wild populations.

AB Climate change may strongly influence species distribution and, thus, the structure and function of ecosystems. This paper describes simulated changes in the position of the upper treeline in the Swedish mountains in response to predicted climate change. Data on predicted summer temperature changes, the current position of the treeline, and a digital elevation model were used to predict the position of the treeline over a 100-year timeframe. The results show the treeline advancing upward by 233-667 m, depending on the climate scenario used and location within the mountain chain. Such changes hypothetically caused a 75-85% reduction in treeless alpine heaths, with 60-93% of the remaining areas being scree slopes and boulder fields. For this change to occur, the migration rate of the trees would be in the order of 23-221 m yr(-1), which is well within published migration rates for wind-dispersed deciduous trees. The remaining alpine areas would be strongly fragmented. These drastic changes would influence all aspects of mountain ecosystems, including biodiversity conservation and human land-use patterns.

AB Large mammalian herbivores are notorious for their propensity towards population irruptions and crashes, yet many herbivore populations remain relatively stable. I explore how resource heterogeneity within landscapes dampens population instability, using a metaphysiological modelling approach considering patch state distributions. Resource heterogeneity is functionally stabilizing through spreading consumption away from preferred resources before these become critically depleted. Lower-quality resources act as a buffer against starvation during critical periods of the seasonal cycle. Enriching resource quality is destabilizing, even if patch diversity is maintained, because food quantity then becomes the limitation. The potential consequences of landscape fragmentation are explored using the Serengeti ecosystem, characterised by broadscale resource gradients, as a hypothetical example. Further insights provided by the model are illustrated with specific examples concerning the effects of patch scales and waterpoint distribution. A metaphysiological modelling approach enables the basic consequences of landscape heterogeneity to be distinguished from further effects that may arise from specific patch scales and configurations, without the distracting detail of spatially explicit models.

AB Mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla, Meliaceae) is the most valuable and intensively exploited Neotropical tree. No information is available regarding the genetic structure of mahogany in South America, yet the region harbours most of the unlogged populations of this prized hardwood. Here we report on the genetic diversity within and the differentiation among seven natural populations separated by up to 2100 km along the southern arc of the Brazilian Amazon basin. We analysed the variation at eight microsatellite loci for 194 adult individuals. All loci were highly variable, with the number of alleles per locus ranging from 13 to 27 (mean = 18.4). High levels of genetic diversity were found for all populations at the eight loci (mean H-E = 0.781, range 0.754-0.812). We found moderate but statistically significant genetic differentiation among populations considering both estimators of F-ST and R-ST, theta = 0.097 and rho = 0.147, respectively. Estimates of theta and rho were significantly greater than zero for all pairwise population comparisons. Pairwise rho-values were positively and significantly correlated with geographical distance under the isolation-by-distance model. Furthermore, four of the populations exhibited a significant inbreeding coefficient. The finding of local differentiation among Amazonian mahogany populations underscores the need for in situ conservation of multiple populations of S. macrophylla across its distribution in the Brazilian Amazon. In addition, the occurrence of microgeographical genetic differentiation at a local scale indicates the importance of maintaining populations in their diverse habitats, especially in areas with mosaics of topography and soil.

AB We analyzed data from riffle and snag habitats for 39 small cold water streams with different levels of watershed urbanization in Wisconsin and Minnesota to evaluate the influences of urban land use and instream habitat on macroinvertebrate communities. Multivariate analysis indicated that stream temperature and amount of urban land use in the watersheds were the most influential factors determining macroinvertebrate assemblages. The amount of watershed urbanization was nonlinearly and negatively correlated with percentages of Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera (EPT) abundance, EPT taxa, filterers, and scrapers and positively correlated with Hilsenhoff biotic index. High quality macroinvertebrate index values were possible if effective imperviousness was less than 7 percent of the watershed area. Beyond this level of imperviousness, index values tended to be consistently poor. Land uses in the riparian area were equal or more influential relative to land use elsewhere in the watershed, although riparian area consisted of only a small portion of the entire watershed area. Our study implies that it is extremely important to restrict watershed impervious land use and protect stream riparian areas for reducing human degradation on stream quality in low level urbanizing watersheds. Stream temperature may be one of the major factors through which human activities degrade cold-water streams, and management efforts that can maintain a natural thermal regime will help preserve stream quality.

AB Riparian areas in western North America have been characterized as centers of avian diversity, yet little is known about the ways that native species in streamside habitats are affected by development nearby. To address this issue, we examined patterns of habitat use by birds during the 1995-1997 breeding seasons at 16 lowland riparian sites representing an urban-to-rural gradient. As development increased, riparian woodlands tended to have fewer native. trees and shrubs, less ground and shrub. cover, higher tree densities, and greater canopy closure. Bird species richness also declined as urbanization increased in the surrounding landscape. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that measures of settlement intensity best explained variation in habitat use by riparian birds, although some residual variation was accounted for by differences in woodland understory features. Migrant and low-nesting species were associated with lower-than-average levels of development, whereas resident and cavity-nesting species tended to increase with urbanization. In partial CCA analyses, however, local habitat variables explained twice the variation that measures of settlement did; nearly half of all explained variation could be attributed to local and landscape variables simultaneously. For avian guilds based on migratory; nesting, and foraging behavior, regression analyses showed that the best variables for explaining patterns of habitat use were usually those that reflected levels of urbanization, particularly at broad scales. When the effects of local habitat variation were removed, however, the best variables for explaining residual variation in habitat use tended to describe development at relatively fine scales, especially for species that nested or foraged low for insects or seeds. These species were also the most sensitive to human trail use. Our analyses indicated that bird communities and local habitat conditions in riparian areas were both affected by development in the surrounding landscape. It may be possible to mitigate the negative impacts of human settlement on native birds in streamside woodlands by maintaining or restoring vegetation structure and composition, and by imposing limits on human recreational activity in these habitats.

AB To better elucidate the ecological effects of naphthenic acids and major ions liberated in oil sands development, the summer-time composition of phytoplankton communities in ten water bodies near Fort McMurray (northeastern Alberta) was studied in 1997. The water bodies varied in degree of process water influence, and in age, size and ancillary chemical characteristics. Community biomass of phytoplankton was not systematically related to naphthenic acid or major ion concentrations, even though the higher naphthenate concentrations exceeded published EC50's for acute effects on several different aquatic species. Chlorophyta were frequently dominant, particularly where naphthenate and major ion concentrations were highest. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) revealed gradients in taxonomic composition at a finer (genus and species) taxonomic level. Despite the simultaneous and uncontrolled variation of other environmental factors, naphthenate and major ion concentrations (as indexed by conductivity) explained a highly-significant 40% of the variation in taxonomic composition. Systems with naphthenates <6.5 mg 1(-1) and conductivity < 800 PhiS cm(-1) were clustered together near the origin of the CCA plots, suggesting little ecological effect at such concentrations. Taxa associated with elevated naphthenate and/or major ion concentrations were derived from six different algal divisions and included many that were identified as tolerant in previous bioassay experiments. Over the range of concentrations encountered (1.5-45 and 100-3000 mg 1(-1) for naphthenates and ions, respectively), CCA indicated that the ecological effect of major ions appeared to be at least as great as that of naphthenates.

AB Nutrients obtained by epiphytes may either be of atmospheric origin or from organic matter in the canopy, which decomposes to form canopy soil on large branches. We hypothesised that the N supply for epiphytes on small branches was lower, and a larger proportion provided by rainwater, than for epiphytes rooting in canopy soil. We tested this by measuring the N concentration and isotopic composition in terrestrial and canopy soil and in various canopy compartments of a Costa Rican cloud forest. In general, epiphytes on small branches without canopy soil had lower N foliar concentrations and delta(15)N signals than plants rooted in canopy soil, suggesting that the former receive a higher proportion of N directly from the rain. Epiphytes on small branches also had less negative delta(13)C values, indicating more frequent water stress. Epiphytes had lower delta(15)N values (-3.9 +/- 2.3parts per thousand) than ground-rooted trees (-1.1 +/- 1.6parts per thousand), and canopy soil had lower values (0.7 +/- 1.2parts per thousand) than terrestrial soil (3.8 +/- 0.7parts per thousand). Assuming that the isotopic effect of terrestrial and canopy soil organic matter formation is similar, our findings support earlier results showing that canopy soil is derived mainly from epiphytes, with only minor inputs from host tree matter. Thus, the epiphyte N cycle appears to be largely detached from the tree-soil cycle. Epiphylls on leaves of understorey shrubs had higher delta(15)N signals than cryptogams in the upper canopy, as a result of either N-15 accumulation in throughfall or increased N-2 fixation. The correlation between epiphyll and understorey host leaf delta(15)N suggests some exchange of N between epiphylls and host leaves. Differences between epiphyte groups also appear to be related to uptake of N through mycorrhizas or N-2 fixation. Thus, the source and quantity of N supply is highly variable, depending on the systematic group and canopy position.

AB Studies of sexual selection have mostly focused on female choice and male-male competition. However, when a male contributes substantially to a breeding attempt, he would benefit from choosing a female whose reproductive potential is high in order to maximize his reproductive success. We examined male mate choice in zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, with respect to experimental manipulation of female fecundity. This was enhanced by a dietary supplement prior to contact with the males. When housed with females of differing fecundity, male zebra finches preferentially direct their courtship towards more fecund females. This outcome could be a consequence of female-female interactions or direct male preference. In this experiment, we gave males a choice between standard and supplemented females in an experimental arena where the females were spatially segregated, and could not interact with each other, thereby excluding the possibility of female-female competition. Males spent significantly more time with the more fecund female, they hopped more times on the perch opposite that female and were twice as likely to choose her than the standard female. The standard females were not, however, unreceptive to males, nor did they appear to differ in their activity patterns in response to the male. These results show that males are able to distinguish females that have higher fecundity, and that this is not the result of relative female competitiveness or dominance status.

AB When individuals receive different returns from their reproductive investment dependent on mate quality, they are expected to invest more when breeding with higher quality mates. A number of studies over the past decade have shown that females may alter their reproductive effort depending on the quality/attractiveness of their mate. However, to date, despite extensive work on parental investment, such a differential allocation has, not been demonstrated in fish. Indeed, so far only two studies from any taxon have suggested that females alter the quality of individual offspring according to the quality/attractiveness of their mate. The banggai cardinal fish is an obligate paternal mouth brooder where females lay few large eggs. It has previously been shown that male size determines clutch weight irrespective of female size in this species. In this study,. I investigated whether females perform more courtship displays towards larger males and whether females allocate their reproductive effort depending on the size of their mate by experimentally assigning females to either large or small males. I found that females displayed more towards larger males, thereby suggesting a female preference for larger males. Further, females produced heavier eggs and heavier clutches but not more eggs when paired with large males. My experiments show that females in this species adjust their offspring weight and, thus, presumably offspring quality according to the size of their mate.

AB 1 We tested the hypothesis that competitive hierarchies are invariant with respect to changing nutrient supply.
   2 The competitive performance of 26 shoreline plant species was determined experimentally as the relative ability to suppress the growth of a common indicator (phytometer) species, Penthorum sedoides. Each species was grown with the phytometer under each of two nutrient treatments created with different concentrations of a modified Hoagland's solution (n = 5 replicates per species/treatment), for two growing seasons.
   3 Although shifts in ranking of relative competitive performance were apparent between nutrient levels, competitive performance under high and low nutrient conditions was significantly correlated in both year 1 (r = 0.65) and year 2 (r = 0.76), when all species were considered.
   4 At the broad community scale, the outcome of competitive interactions thus appears to be relatively predictable and independent of the environment, and therefore provides a useful tool for exploring and understanding community pattern. These results cannot address questions related to the outcome of competitive interactions between similar species or the effects of fine-scale pattern.

AB The spatial arrangement of seagrass beds varies from scales of centimeters to meters (rhizomes, shoot groups), meters to tens of meters (patches), to tens of meters to kilometers (seagrass landscapes). In this study we examine the role of patch scale (patch size, seagrass % cover, seagrass biomass), landscape scale (fractal geometry, patch isolation) and wave exposure (mean wind velocity and exceedance) variables in influencing benthic community composition in seagrass beds at three intertidal sites in northern New Zealand (two sites in Manukau Harbour and one site in Whangapoua Harbour). Analysis of univariate community measures (numbers of individuals and species, species richness, diversity and evenness) and multivariate analyses indicated that there were significant differences in community composition inside and outside of seagrass patches at each of the three sites. Partialling out the spatial and temporal components of the ecological variation indicated that seagrass patch variables explained only 3-4% of the patch scale variation in benthic community composition at each of the sites. The temporal component was more important, explaining 12-14% of the variation. The unexplained variation was high (about 75%) at all three sites, indicating that other factors were influencing variation in community composition at the scale of the patches, or that there was a large amount of stochastic variation. Landscape and wave exposure variables explained 62.5% of the variation in the species abundance data, and the unexplained variation at the landscape level was correspondingly low (12%). Canonical correspondence analysis produced an ordination that suggests that, while mean wind velocity and exceedance were important in explaining the differences between the communities in the two harbours, spatial patterning of the habitat, primarily fractal dimension, and secondarily patch isolation (or some factors that were similarly correlated), were important in contributing to variability in community composition at the two sites in Manukau Harbour. This study suggests that spatial patterning of seagrass habitat at landscape scales, independent of the patch scale characteristics of the seagrass beds, can affect benthic community composition. Community composition inside and outside seagrass habitats involves responses to seagrass bed structure at a series of hierarchical levels, and we need to consider more than one spatial scale if we are to understand community dynamics in seagrass habitats.

AB Polymorphism at six microsatellite loci was used to study genetic variability and population structure in six geographically distant natural populations of European hake (Merluccius merluccius L.). Four hundred and eighty-three individuals were sampled from Trondheimsfjord in Norway, the Celtic Sea, the southern Bay of Biscay, Fare off Portugal, the Mediterranean Sea north of the coast of Tunisia and the Adriatic Sea. Population subdivision was found between Mediterranean and Atlantic samples, theta = 0.029 (P < 0.001). No substructuring was found between samples within the Mediterranean Sea, theta = 0.003 and R-ST = 0.007 (P > 0.05). The Atlantic population structure appears to be more complex than previously suggested by the placement of stock boundaries by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES). Analyses based on various models of microsatellite evolution all suggest that differentiation exists between Bay of Biscay and Portugese samples, theta = 0.013 (P < 0.001), R-ST = 0.036 (P < 0.001) which are currently managed as one stock. By contrast, fixation indices indicated no differentiation between southern Bay of Biscay samples and Celtic Sea samples, theta = 0.003 (P = 0.02), phi(ST) = 0.007 (P = 0.10) which are managed as separate stocks. These results suggest that if the observed trends are stable through time, current management policy of European hake may need revision.

AB We compared predation by wild-trapped, caged white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) on eggs of Japanese Quail (Coturnix coturnix) and Zebra Finches (Poephila guttata) to test the effect of egg size. Nine male and nine female mice were weighed, acclimated to cages for 24 h, and presented with two wicker nests, one containing a Japanese Quail egg (33 x 23 mm) and the other a Zebra Finch egg (16 x 12 mm). Nests were checked at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 h; after 24 h, no quail eggs were depredated, but 16 of 18 finch eggs were destroyed. Given their ability to consume small eggs and their ubiquity and abundance, white-footed mice are potentially significant nest predators.

AB The spatiotemporal dynamics of the ichthyoplankton assemblage structure were investigated in Mississippi Sound, a northern Gulf of Mexico estuary. The study was based on a comprehensive survey constituting 528 collections from 22 stations over 12 months at two tow depths. Important environmental correlates of assemblage structure were identified using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). A wide taxonomic diversity was encountered during the ichthyoplankton survey, including 152 taxa distributed among 48 families. Strong physical gradients in water temperature, dissolved oxygen and salinity correlated predominantly with ichthyoplankton assemblage structure, and reflected substantial spatiotemporal variation. The CCA results were interpreted in light of adult life-style characteristics. Ecological groups of larvae, as defined by adult life-style characteristics for respective taxa, showed distinctive dispersion patterns in 2-dimensional canonical space. A diverse group of offshore demersal taxa clustered as larvae in a region of CCA space corresponding spatiotemporally with stations located in passes and outside of the Sound during late summer and autumn. Other ecological groups, such as the inshore nektonic and offshore pelagic fishes, were widely dispersed as larvae in canonical space, with member taxa occurring under dissimilar physical conditions. Estuarine embayments in the north-central Gulf of Mexico, like Mississippi Sound, might: be viewed appropriately as landwardmost sections of the wider, highly productive nursery grounds of this region.

AB Of 22 lizard species studied in eastern Ecuador, 21 were diurnal. Ten were active foragers and 12 were sit-and-wait foragers. Considerable variation existed in habitat and microhabitat distribution and body temperatures among species. Body size varied over an order of magnitude (20-270 mm snout-vent length). Most morphological (size-free) variation among species (77%) was accounted for by two principal component axes and appears tied to phylogeny. Prey size was correlated with lizard size and species were separated by prey size. Low overlaps in microhabitat, habitat, and prey type also separated species. Pseudocommunity analysis indicated structure in the consumer-resource matrix. In some comparisons, prey overlaps among species were greater within than between higher taxa, and closely related species tended to be found in similar habitat patches and microhabitats, suggesting that resource-use patterns are determined to some extent by phylogeny. Ecology, morphology, and phylogeny appear tied together in a complex manner, with resource partitioning contributing to maintenance of structure. Historical interactions among closely related species may have been important in determining which species within particular clades invaded and persisted within local assemblages in lowland forest.

AB Ecological land classification systems have recently been developed at continental, regional, state, and landscape scales. In most cases, the map units of these systems result from subjectively drawn boundaries, often derived by consensus and with unclear choice and weighting of input data. Such classifications are of variable accuracy and are not reliably repeatable. We combined geographic information systems (GIS) with multivariate statistical analyses to integrate climatic, physiographic, and edaphic databases and produce a classification of regional landscape ecosystems on a 29 340-km(2) quadrangle of northwestern Wisconsin. Climatic regions were identified from a high-resolution climatic database consisting of 30-yr mean monthly temperature and precipitation values interpolated over a 1-km(2) grid across the study area. Principal component analysis (PCA) coupled with an isodata clustering algorithm was used to identify regions of similar seasonal climatic trends. Maps of Pleistocene geology and major soil morphosequences were used to identify the major physiographic and soil regions within the landscape. Climatic and physiographic coverages were integrated to identify regional landscape ecosystems, which potentially differ in characteristic forest composition, successional dynamics, potential productivity, and other ecosystem-level processes. Validation analysis indicated strong correspondence between forest cover classes from an independently derived Landsat Thematic Mapper classification and ecological region. The development of more standardized data sets and analytical methods for ecoregional classification provides a basis for sound interpretations of forest management at multiple spatial scales.

ID DIVIDE RESOURCES; SIZE
AB Species are by definition different from each other.  This fact favours ranking rather than additive indices.  In addition, new methods show how the degree of difference between species can be included in an index.  The functional aspect of species diversity measurement is strengthened by incorporating other differences between species (such as body size, predator or parasite) as a component of diversity.  The choice of index and measurement of diversity are influenced by these developments.

AB Vegetation impacts on ecosystem functioning are mediated by mycorrhizas, plant-fungal associations formed by most plant species. Ecosystems dominated by distinct mycorrhizal types differ strongly in their biogeochemistry. Quantitative analyses of mycorrhizal impacts on ecosystem functioning are hindered by the scarcity of information on mycorrhizal distributions. Here we present global, high-resolution maps of vegetation biomass distribution by dominant mycorrhizal associations. Arbuscular, ectomycorrhizal, and ericoid mycorrhizal vegetation store, respectively, 241 +/- 15, 100 +/- 17, and 7 +/- 1.8 GT carbon in aboveground biomass, whereas non-mycorrhizal vegetation stores 29 +/- 5.5 GT carbon. Soil carbon stocks in both topsoil and subsoil are positively related to the community-level biomass fraction of ectomycorrhizal plants, though the strength of this relationship varies across biomes. We show that human-induced transformations of Earth's ecosystems have reduced ectomycorrhizal vegetation, with potential ramifications to terrestrial carbon stocks. Our work provides a benchmark for spatially explicit and globally quantitative assessments of mycorrhizal impacts on ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical cycling.

AB Severe insect declines make headlines, but they are rarely based on systematic monitoring outside of Europe. We estimate the rate of change in total butterfly abundance and the population trends for 81 species using 21 years of systematic monitoring in Ohio, USA. Total abundance is declining at 2% per year, resulting in a cumulative 33% reduction in butterfly abundance. Three times as many species have negative population trends compared to positive trends. The rate of total decline and the proportion of species in decline mirror those documented in three comparable long-term European monitoring programs. Multiple environmental changes such as climate change, habitat degradation, and agricultural practices may contribute to these declines in Ohio and shift the makeup of the butterfly community by benefiting some species over others. Our analysis of life-history traits associated with population trends shows an impact of climate change, as species with northern distributions and fewer annual generations declined more rapidly. However, even common and invasive species associated with human-dominated landscapes are declining, suggesting widespread environmental causes for these trends. Declines in common species, although they may not be close to extinction, will have an outsized impact on the ecosystem services provided by insects. These results from the most extensive, systematic insect monitoring program in North America demonstrate an ongoing defaunation in butterflies that on an annual scale might be imperceptible, but cumulatively has reduced butterfly numbers by a third over 20 years.

AB Monitoring grassland plant communities is crucial for understanding and managing biodiversity. Previous studies indicate that mapping these natural habitats from single-date remotely sensed imagery remains challenging because some communities have similar physiognomy. The recently launched Sentinel-2 satellites are a promising opportunity for monitoring vegetation. This article assesses the advantages of Sentinel-2 time-series for discriminating plant communities in wet grasslands. An annual Sentinel-2 time-series was compared respectively to single-date and single-band datasets derived from this time-series for mapping grassland plant communities in a temperate floodplain located near Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, which is included in the long-term ecological research network "ZA Armorique" (France). At this 475 ha site, 123 vegetation releves were collected and assigned to seven plant communities to calibrate and validate the Sentinel-2 data. Satellite images were classified using support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers. Results show that the SVM classifier performs slightly better than the RF classifier (overall accuracy 0.78 and 0.71, respectively). They highlight that accuracy is lower when using single-date (0.67) or single-band images (0.70). The results also reveal that discrimination of plant communities is more sensitive to temporal resolution (Delta = 0.34 in overall accuracy) than spectral resolution (Delta = 0.12 in overall accuracy).

AB Resilience underpins the sustainability of both ecological and social systems. Extensive loss of reef corals following recent mass bleaching events have challenged the notion that support of system resilience is a viable reef management strategy. While resilience-based management (RBM) cannot prevent the damaging effects of major disturbances, such as mass bleaching events, it can support natural processes that promote resistance and recovery. Here, we review the potential of RBM to help sustain coral reefs in the 21st century. We explore the scope for supporting resilience through existing management approaches and emerging technologies and discuss their opportunities and limitations in a changing climate. We argue that for RBM to be effective in a changing world, reef management strategies need to involve both existing and new interventions that together reduce stress, support the fitness of populations and species, and help people and economies to adapt to a highly altered ecosystem.

AB A general report on the use of the Allium test as cytotoxicological and genotoxicological assay is proposed, with particular emphasis about the standardization of the test in several common applications. The intraspecific variation in Allium cepa has been overlooked, as in most investigations no mention is made about origin and denomination of the onion cultivar used. A standardization of the used material would allow a better generalization of the results, since we cannot be sure that all cultivars would give the same response. A more frequent use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation is proposed. Even if relatively time consuming and not available in all laboratories, it may help to better understand the mechanism of cytotoxicity, since many morphological characters may appear similar but be arisen from different processes observable only with TEM. About statistical testing, tests other than chi-squared may be used in case of a lower amount of data. The most commonly used statistical tests are the parametric tests ANOVA and Student's t, and the nonparametric tests Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U, for analysis of variance. Tests should be used also to assess the minimal sample dimension for obtaining significance, since data collection (microscope observation) appears to be one of the main bottle necks of the test. Also the use of the Allium test for testing liposomes and other nanovectors for drug delivery is proposed, in order to assess the cytotoxicity of these types of medium and the possible increase in cytotoxicity of the associated drug.

AB The pine weevil (Hylobius abietis), a major pest of conifer forests throughout Europe, feeds on the bark and cambium, tissues rich in terpenoid resins that are toxic to many insect herbivores. Here, we report the ability of the pine weevil gut microbiota to degrade the diterpene acids of Norway spruce. The diterpene acid levels present in ingested bark were substantially reduced on passage through the pine weevil gut. This reduction was significantly less upon antibiotic treatment, and supplementing the diet with gut suspensions from untreated insects restored the ability to degrade diterpenes. In addition, cultured bacteria isolated from pine weevil guts were shown to degrade a Norway spruce diterpene acid. In a metagenomic survey of the insect's bacterial community, we were able to annotate several genes of a previously described diterpene degradation (dit) gene cluster. Antibiotic treatment disrupted the core bacterial community of H. abietis guts and eliminated nearly all dit genes concordant with its reduction in diterpene degradation. Pine weevils reared on an artificial diet spiked with diterpenes, but without antibiotics, were found to lay more eggs with a higher hatching rate than weevils raised on diets with antibiotics or without diterpenes. These results suggest that gut symbionts contribute towards host fitness, but not by detoxification of diterpenes, as these compounds do not show toxic effects with or without antibiotics. Rather the ability to thrive in a terpene-rich environment appears to allow gut microbes to benefit the weevil in other ways, such as increasing the nutritional properties of their diet.

Here, we use data from a large-scale biodiversity experiment with 24 subtropical tree species to show that neighbourhood tree species richness generally promotes individual tree productivity. We found that the underlying mechanisms depend on a focal tree's functional traits: For species with a conservative resource-use strategy diversity effects were brought about by facilitation, and for species with acquisitive traits by competitive reduction. Moreover, positive diversity effects were strongest under low competition intensity (quantified as the total basal area of neighbours) for acquisitive species, and under high competition intensity for conservative species. Our findings demonstrate that net biodiversity effects in tree communities can vary over small spatial scales, emphasising the need to consider variation in local neighbourhood interactions to better understand effects at the community level.

AB Forest soils represent a substantial portion of the terrestrial carbon (C) pool, and changes to soil C cycling are globally significant not only for C sequestration but also for sustaining forest productivity and ecosystem services. To quantify the effect of harvesting on soil C, we used meta-analysis to examine a database of 945 responses to harvesting collected from 112 publications from around the world. Harvesting reduced soil C, on average, by 11.2% with 95% CI [14.1%, 8.5%]. There was substantial variation between responses in different soil depths, with greatest losses occurring in the O horizon (30.2%). Much smaller but still significant losses (3.3%) occurred in top soil C pools (0-15 cm depth). In very deep soil (60-100+ cm), a significant loss of 17.7% of soil C in was observed after harvest. However, only 21 of the 945 total responses examined this depth, indicating a substantial need for more research in this area. The response of soil C to harvesting varies substantially between soil orders, with greater losses in Spodosol and Ultisol orders and less substantial losses in Alfisols and Andisols. Soil C takes several decades to recover following harvest, with Spodosol and Ultisol C recovering only after at least 75 years. The publications in this analysis were highly skewed toward surface sampling, with a maximum sampling depth of 36 cm, on average. Sampling deep soil represents one of the best opportunities to reduce uncertainty in the understanding of the response of soil C to forest harvest.

AB Codigesting fats, oils, and greases with municipal wastewater sludge can greatly improve biomethane recovery at wastewater treatment facilities. Process loading rates of fats, oils, and greases have been previously tested with little knowledge of the digester microbial community structure, and high transient fat loadings have led to long chain fatty acid (LCFA) accumulation and digester upsets. This study utilized recently-developed quantitative PCR assays for syntrophic LCFA-degrading bacteria along with 16S amplicon sequencing to relate changes in microbial community structure to LCFA accumulation during transient loading increases to an anaerobic codigester receiving waste restaurant oil and municipal wastewater sludge. The 16S rRNA gene concentration of the syntrophic beta-oxidizing genus Syntrophomonas increased to similar to 15% of the Bacteria community in the codigester, but stayed below 3% in the control digester that was fed only wastewater sludge. Methanosaeta and Methanospirillum were the dominant methanogenic genera enriched in the codigester, and together comprised over 80% of the Archaea community by the end of the experimental period. Constrained ordination showed that changes in the codigester Bacteria and Archaea community structures were related to measures of digester performance. Notably, the effluent LCFA concentration in the codigester was positively correlated to the specific loading rate of waste oil normalized to the Syntrophomonas 16S rRNA concentration. Specific loading rates of 0-1.5 x 10(-12) g VS oil/16S gene copies-day resulted in LCFA concentrations below 30 mg/g TS, whereas LCFA accumulated up to 104 mg/g TS at higher transient loading rates. Based on the community-dependent loading limitations found, enhanced biomethane production from high loadings of fats, oils and greases can be achieved by promoting a higher biomass of slow-growing syntrophic consortia, such as with longer digester solids retention times. This work also demonstrates the potential for controlling the loading rate of fats, oils, and greases based on the analysis of the codigester community structure, such as with quantitative PCR measurements of syntrophic LCFA-degrading bacteria abundance.

AB Taxonomic diversity considers all species being equally different from each other and thus disregards species' different ecological functions. Exploring taxonomic and functional aspects of biodiversity simultaneously can better understand the processes of community assembly. We analysed taxonomic and functional alpha and beta diversities of breeding bird assemblages on land-bridge islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China. Given the high dispersal ability of most birds at this spatial scale (several kilometres), we predicted (i) selective extinction driving alpha and beta diversities after the creation of land-bridge islands of varying area and (ii) low taxonomic and functional beta diversities that were not correlated to spatial distance. Breeding birds were surveyed on 37 islands annually from 2007 to 2014. We decomposed beta diversity of breeding birds into spatial turnover and nestedness-resultant components, and related taxonomic and functional diversities to island area and isolation using power regression models (for alpha diversity) and multiple regression models on distance matrices (for beta diversity). We then ran simulations to assess the strength of the correlations between taxonomic and functional diversities. Results revealed that both taxonomic and functional alpha diversities increased with island area. The taxonomic nestedness-resultant and turnover components increased and decreased with difference in area, respectively, but functional counterparts did not. Isolation played a minor role in explaining alpha- and beta-diversity patterns. By partitioning beta diversity, we found low levels of overall taxonomic and functional beta diversities. The functional nestedness-resultant component dominated overall functional beta diversity, whereas taxonomic turnover was the dominant component for taxonomic beta diversity. The simulation showed that functional alpha and beta diversities were significantly correlated with taxonomic diversities, and the observed values of correlations were significantly different from null expectations of random extinction. Our assessment of island bird assemblages validated the predictions of no distance effects and low beta diversity due to pervasive dispersal events among islands and also suggested that selective extinction drives taxonomic and functional alpha and beta diversities. The contrasting turnover and nestedness-resultant components of taxonomic and functional beta diversities demonstrate the importance of considering the multifaceted nature of biodiversity when examining community assembly.

AB Citizen science provides researchers means to gather or analyse large datasets. At the same time, citizen science projects offer an opportunity for non-scientists to be part of and learn from the scientific process. In the Dutch iSPEX project, a large number of citizens turned their smartphones into actual measurement devices to measure aerosols. This study examined participants' motivation and perceived learning impacts of this unique project. Most respondents joined iSPEX because they wanted to contribute to the scientific goals of the project or because they were interested in the project topics (health and environmental impact of aerosols). In terms of learning impact, respondents reported a gain in knowledge about citizen science and the topics of the project. However, many respondents had an incomplete understanding of the science behind the project, possibly caused by the complexity of the measurements.

AB In the past years, stakeholder engagement has become more important in flood risk management. On the one hand stakeholder engagement is often declared as a better way of management, a more successful way to reach consensus in policy discussions. On the other hand is the implementation of increasing stakeholder engagement far away from being as positive, where stakeholder engagement often ends in diverse difficulties and conflicts between political leaders and stakeholder groups. This paper aims to highlight participatory governance in flood risk management to provide an overview of the potential contributions and challenges of a participatory and collaborative governance approach. In this paper, we discuss the role of national authorities and local stakeholders in English flood risk management in three different examples (Bridgwater, Cockermouth and Morpeth). The results show that the Cockermouth and Morpeth flood risk management scheme is characterised by a high level of local self-responsibility in the planning and decision-making process. The study sites with high local capacity (Cockermouth and Morpeth) show a strong leadership at local level and bottom-up concepts and ideas. The local involvement in the discussion and decision-process depends on the local capacity (capacity to act), such as resources (knowledge, financial, time), interest, social and cultural capital. It strongly depends on these aspects, if localities are able to ensure their interests and needs at national level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The seasonal climate drivers of the carbon cycle in tropical forests remain poorly known, although these forests account for more carbon assimilation and storage than any other terrestrial ecosystem. Based on a unique combination of seasonal pan-tropical data sets from 89 experimental sites (68 include aboveground wood productivity measurements and 35 litter productivity measurements), their associated canopy photosynthetic capacity (enhanced vegetation index, EVI) and climate, we ask how carbon assimilation and aboveground allocation are related to climate seasonality in tropical forests and how they interact in the seasonal carbon cycle. We found that canopy photosynthetic capacity seasonality responds positively to precipitation when rainfall is < 2000 mm yr(-1) (water-limited forests) and to radiation otherwise (light-limited forests). On the other hand, independent of climate limitations, wood productivity and litterfall are driven by seasonal variation in precipitation and evapotranspiration, respectively. Consequently, light-limited forests present an asynchronism between canopy photosynthetic capacity and wood productivity. First-order control by precipitation likely indicates a decrease in tropical forest productivity in a drier climate in water-limited forest, and in current light-limited forest with future rainfall < 2000 mm yr(-1).

AB Water temperature governs the distribution and behaviour of fish. Riverine salmonids use discrete cold water patches, termed thermal refuges, when stream temperature exceeds their thermal tolerances. Currently, little is known about the mechanisms driving the spatial distribution of thermal refuges, particularly at large scales. Given the threat posed by climate warming to salmon populations in Europe and North America, thermal refuges are increasingly important for salmonids during summer. In this study, we used airborne thermal infrared (TIR) imagery to characterise the spatial distribution of thermal refuges from similar to 700 km of rivers in an eastern Canada salmon watershed. Thermal refuges were classified into a range of categories, and those identified as being driven by groundwater processes were observed to be both the most abundant and most spatially variable. Spatial analysis was used to assemble a range of landscape metrics that were tested for associations with the spatial distribution of groundwater-driven refuges. Associations between landscape metrics and the individual occurrence of thermal refuges were assessed using Jacobs' selectivity index. Results showed that the occurrence of groundwater thermal refuges was significantly associated with high values of channel curvature and close proximity of incoming tributary valleys (X-2 p < 0.05, df = 9). Regression was used to assess correlations between landscape metrics and the density of thermal refuges (number per river km). Channel confinement was found to correlate strongly with the density of groundwater thermal refuges using a quadratic model (R-2 = 0.83, p < 0.05). Our study is the first to quantify the relationship between the spatial distribution of groundwater thermal refuges and landscape hydromorphology throughout a riverscape. This information can be used to aid conservation efforts and manage critical thermal habitats in rivers and streams. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We know surprisingly little about whole-tree nonstructural carbon (NSC; primarily sugars and starch) budgets. Even less well understood is the mixing between recent photosynthetic assimilates (new NSC) and previously stored reserves. And, NSC turnover times are poorly constrained. We characterized the distribution of NSC in the stemwood, branches, and roots of two temperate trees, and we used the continuous label offered by the radiocarbon (carbon-14, C-14) bomb spike to estimate the mean age of NSC in different tissues. NSC in branches and the outermost stemwood growth rings had the C-14 signature of the current growing season. However, NSC in older aboveground and belowground tissues was enriched in C-14, indicating that it was produced from older assimilates. Radial patterns of C-14 in stemwood NSC showed strong mixing of NSC across the youngest growth rings, with limited mixing in' of younger NSC to older rings. Sugars in the outermost five growth rings, accounting for two-thirds of the stemwood pool, had a mean age <1yr, whereas sugars in older growth rings had a mean age >5yr. Our results are thus consistent with a previously-hypothesized two-pool (fast' and slow' cycling NSC) model structure. These pools appear to be physically distinct.

AB Faecal samples are of great value as a non-invasive means to gather information on the genetics, distribution, demography, diet and parasite infestation of endangered species. Direct shotgun sequencing of faecal DNA could give information on these simultaneously, but this approach is largely untested. Here, we used two faecal samples to characterize the diet of two red-shanked doucs langurs (Pygathrix nemaeus) that were fed known foliage, fruits, vegetables and cereals. Illumina HiSeq produced similar to 74 and 67 million paired reads for these samples, of which similar to 10000 (0.014%) and similar to 44000 (0.066%), respectively, were of chloroplast origin. Sequences were matched against a database of available chloroplast barcodes' for angiosperms. The results were compared with metabarcoding' using PCR amplification of the P6 loop of trnL. Metagenomics identified seven and nine of the likely 16 diet plants while six and five were identified by metabarcoding. Metabarcoding produced thousands of reads consistent with the known diet, but the barcodes were too short to identify several plant species to genus. Metagenomics utilized multiple, longer barcodes that combined had greater power of identification. However, rare diet items were not recovered. Read numbers for diet species in metagenomic and metabarcoding data were correlated, indicating that both are useful for determining relative sequence abundance. Metagenomic reads were uniformly distributed across the chloroplast genomes; thus, if chloroplast genomes were used as reference, the precision of identifications and species recovery would improve further. Metagenomics also recovered the host mitochondrial genome and numerous intestinal parasite sequences in addition to generating data useful for characterizing the microbiome.

AB The adaptive potential of tree species to cope with climate change has important ecological and economic implications. Many temperate tree species experience a wide range of environmental conditions, suggesting high adaptability to new environmental conditions. We investigated adaptation to regional climate in the drought-sensitive tree species Alnus glutinosa (Black alder), using a complementary approach that integrates genomic, phenotypic and landscape data. A total of 24 European populations were studied in a common garden and through landscape genomic approaches. Genotyping-by-sequencing was used to identify SNPs across the genome, resulting in 1990 SNPs. Although a relatively low percentage of putative adaptive SNPs was detected (2.86% outlier SNPs), we observed clear associations among outlier allele frequencies, temperature and plant traits. In line with the typical drought avoiding nature of A.glutinosa, leaf size varied according to a temperature gradient and significant associations with multiple outlier loci were observed, corroborating the ecological relevance of the observed outlier SNPs. Moreover, the lack of isolation by distance, the very low genetic differentiation among populations and the high intrapopulation genetic variation all support the notion that high gene exchange combined with strong environmental selection promotes adaptation to environmental cues.

AB The consideration of information on social values in conjunction with biological data is critical for achieving both socially acceptable and scientifically defensible conservation planning outcomes. However, the influence of social values on spatial conservation priorities has received limited attention and is poorly understood. We present an approach that incorporates quantitative data on social values for conservation and social preferences for development into spatial conservation planning. We undertook a public participation GIS survey to spatially represent social values and development preferences and used species distribution models for 7 threatened fauna species to represent biological values. These spatially explicit data were simultaneously included in the conservation planning software Zonation to examine how conservation priorities changed with the inclusion of social data. Integrating spatially explicit information about social values and development preferences with biological data produced prioritizations that differed spatially from the solution based on only biological data. However, the integrated solutions protected a similar proportion of the species' distributions, indicating that Zonation effectively combined the biological and social data to produce socially feasible conservation solutions of approximately equivalent biological value. We were able to identify areas of the landscape where synergies and conflicts between different value sets are likely to occur. Identification of these synergies and conflicts will allow decision makers to target communication strategies to specific areas and ensure effective community engagement and positive conservation outcomes.

AB Widespread species often occur across a range of climatic conditions, through a combination of local genetic adaptations and phenotypic plasticity. Species with greater phenotypic plasticity are likely to be better positioned to cope with rapid anthropogenic climate changes, while those displaying strong local adaptations might benefit from translocations to assist the movement of adaptive genes as the climate changes. Eucalyptus tricarpa occurs across a climatic gradient in south-eastern Australia, a region of increasing aridity, and we hypothesized that this species would display local adaptation to climate. We measured morphological and physiological traits reflecting climate responses in nine provenances from sites of 460 to 1040mm annual rainfall, in their natural habitat and in common gardens near each end of the gradient. Local adaptation was evident in functional traits and differential growth rates in the common gardens. Some traits displayed complex combinations of plasticity and genetic divergence among provenances, including clinal variation in plasticity itself. Provenances from drier locations were more plastic in leaf thickness, whereas leaf size was more plastic in provenances from higher rainfall locations. Leaf density and stomatal physiology (as indicated by C-13 and O-18) were highly and uniformly plastic. In addition to variation in mean trait values, genetic variation in trait plasticity may play a role in climate adaptation.
   Our study investigates the nature of adaptation to climate in a widespread tree species, a topic of current and growing scientific interest, given the ongoing pressures of climate change. However, surprisingly few studies to date have examined within-species patterns of phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation in climate related traits, in any detail. Our study reveals clinal variation across a rainfall gradient, not only in the values of functional traits, but in the plasticity of several morphological traits. The findings support the hypothesis that the adaptive value of plasticity depends on both the environment and the trait in question, with genetic variation for plasticity itself forming part of local adaptations to climate.

AB AimCarbon use efficiency [net primary production (NPP)/gross primary production (GPP) ratio] is a parameter related to the allocation of photosynthesized products by plants and is commonly used in many biogeochemical cycling models. But how this parameter changes with climates is still unknown. Faced by an aggravated global warming, there is a heightened necessity in unravelling the dependence of the NPP/GPP ratio on climates. The objective of this study was to examine how ongoing climate change is regulating global patterns of change in the NPP/GPP ratio. The study finding would elucidate whether the global vegetation ecosystem is becoming more or less efficient in terms of carbon storage under climatic fluctuation.
   LocationThe global planetary ecosystem.
   MethodsThe annual NPP/GPP ratio of the global terrestrial ecosystem was calculated over a 10-year period based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data and an ecosystem productivity model. The temporal dynamics of the global NPP/GPP ratio and their dependence on climate were investigated.
   ResultsThe global NPP/GPP ratio exhibited a decreasing trend from 2000 to 2009 due to decreasing NPP and stable GPP over this period. The temporal dynamics of the NPP/GPP ratio were strongly controlled by temperature and precipitation. Increased temperature lowered the NPP/GPP ratio, and increased precipitation led to a higher NPP/GPP ratio.
   ConclusionsThe NPP/GPP ratio exhibits a clear temporal pattern associated with climatic fluctuations at a global scale. The associations of the NPP/GPP ratio with climatic variability challenge the conventional assumption that the NPP/GPP ratio should be consistent independent of environmental conditions. More importantly, the findings of this study have fundamental significance for our understanding of ongoing global climatic change. In regions and time periods experiencing drought or increased temperatures, plant ecosystems would suffer a higher ecosystem respiration cost and their net productivity would shrink.

   HABITAT SELECTION; POPULATION-DENSITY; ACTIVITY PATTERNS
AB Large carnivores (LCs), such as bears (Ursidae), are commonly believed to occur near human settlements because they have a learned tolerance of humans (human habituation) and because they associate humans with accessible high-quality foods (food conditioning). Young bears and females with cubs are often overrepresented among problem' bears near settlements. We review the mechanisms underlying the occurrence of brown and black bears (Ursus arctos, Ursus americanus, Ursus thibetanus) near settlements, and consider four hypotheses designed to separate ultimate and proximate mechanisms. Increased occurrence of bears near people or settlements can be explained by (i) the human habituation hypothesis; increased use of human-derived foods can be explained by (ii) the food-conditioning hypothesis. However, both mechanisms are proximate, because they can only apply if bears have earlier experience of people and/or human-derived food. A lack of human experience can explain the increased occurrence of younger bears near people or settlements: (iii) the naivety hypothesis. This is a proximate mechanism, because movements of naive bears are typically triggered by aggression and/or competition among conspecifics. We conclude that the disproportionate occurrence of bears in certain sex, age and reproductive classes near people or settlements can only be explained by predation avoidance and/or interference competition, i.e. by (iv) the despotic distribution hypothesis. Therefore, a despotic distribution must be an ultimate mechanism causing the proximate mechanisms of habituation or conditioning. Thus, bears using settlements as predation refuges should not be considered unnatural', but rather as exhibiting an adaptive behaviour, because of the despotic distribution among conspecifics. Management of LCs includes attractant management, to counteract food conditioning, but failure to consider despotic behaviour among conspecifics may lead to treating only the symptom, e.g. habituation or conditioning. The ultimate cause of attraction to specific settlements may be identified by considering the type of bear involved; the occurrence of large solitary bears near settlements suggests attractive habitat or food shortage in remote areas, whereas subadults and females with cubs suggest lower-quality habitat.

AB 1. Functional diversity (FD) is an important concept for studies of both ecosystem processes and community assembly, so it is important to understand the behaviour of common metrics used to express it.
   2. Data from an existing study of the relationship between FD and environmental drivers were used to simulate the impact of a progressive failure to measure the traits of all the species present under three scenarios: intraspecific variation between sites ignored (i), assessed (ii) or (iii) ignored but with metrics calculated at the sampling unit rather than the site level.
   3. All the FD metrics were highly sensitive to failing to measure the traits of all the species present. Functional dispersion, functional richness and Rao's entropy all generally declined with a reduced proportion of species or cover assessed for traits, whilst functional divergence and evenness increased for some sites and decreased for others. Functional richness was the most sensitive (mean absolute deviation at 70% of species assessed had a range of 11.2-2.82% across scenarios), followed by functional evenness (range 6.4-38.5%), functional divergence (5.2-8.3%), Rao's entropy (1.4-7.0%) and functional dispersion (0.7-3.5%).
   4. It is clear that failing to measure the traits of all species at a site can have a serious impact on the value of any functional trait metric computed and on any conclusions drawn from such data. Future studies of FD need to concentrate on the potential impact of the sampling regime of both traits and species and the scale at which the computations are made on the behaviour of metrics and subsequent robustness of the results.

AB Aim At a global scale, the relationship of leaf longevity (LL) to mean annual temperature (MAT) is positive for deciduous species but negative for evergreen species. The aim of this paper is to understand the mechanisms underlying these contrasting patterns of leaf longevity, from a cost-benefit perspective.
   Location Global.
   Methods We tested our hypothesis that contrasting LL-MAT relationships in evergreen and deciduous species result from differing adaptations to variation in the length of the annual favourable period. We defined f as the portion of the year when monthly temperature and water availability were favourable. We examined whether the contrasting LL patterns with MAT can be also seen with f. Next, we calculated the optimal LL that maximizes carbon gain per unit time across a range of f.
   Results The contrasting LL patterns across MAT were also found across f. Our optimization model successfully reproduced the contrasting LL patterns across f for the evergreen (LL longer than 1 year) and deciduous plants. The model shows that longer LL is required to maximize carbon gain for evergreen plants in shorter f, while LL of deciduous plants decreases with decreasing f. Without any a priori trait association, the model reproduced the well-known LL-leaf mass per area (LMA) relationship. The model also reproduced observed shifts in LL-LMA relationships across MAT or f. Evergreen leaves in long f need greater LMA to maintain LL than those in shorter f.
   Main conclusions Observed contrasting LL-MAT patterns in deciduous and evergreen species can be reproduced via the simple rule of maximizing carbon gain across different lengths of favourable periods. Our model provides a mechanistic explanation for the empirical global patterns of several key leaf traits and their relationships.

AB Actinobacteria engage in defensive symbioses with several insect taxa, but reports of nutritional contributions to their hosts have been exceptionally rare. Cotton stainers (Dysdercus fasciatus) and red firebugs (Pyrrhocoris apterus) (both Hemiptera, Pyrrhocoridae) harbour the actinobacterial symbionts Coriobacterium glomerans and Gordonibacter sp. as well as Firmicutes (Clostridium sp. and Lactococcus sp.) and Proteobacteria (Klebsiella sp. and a Rickettsiales bacterium) in the M3 region of their mid-gut. We combined experimental manipulation with community-level analyses to elucidate the function of the gut symbionts in both pyrrhocorid species. Elimination of symbionts by egg-surface sterilization resulted in significantly higher mortality and reduced growth rates, indicating that the microbial community plays an important role for host nutrition. Fitness of symbiont-deprived bugs could be completely restored by re-infection with the original microbiota, while reciprocal cross-infections of microbial communities across both pyrrhocorid species only partially rescued fitness, demonstrating a high degree of host-symbiont specificity. Community-level analyses by quantitative PCRs targeting the dominant bacterial strains allowed us to link the observed fitness effects to the abundance of the two actinobacterial symbionts. The nutritional mutualism with Actinobacteria may have enabled pyrrhocorid bugs to exploit Malvales seeds as a food source and thereby possibly allowed them to occupy and diversify in this ecological niche.

AB Ecologists often use nonlinear fitting techniques to estimate the parameters of complex ecological models, with attendant frustration. This paper compares three open-source model fitting tools and discusses general strategies for defining and fitting models. R is convenient and (relatively) easy to learn, AD Model Builder is fast and robust but comes with a steep learning curve, while BUGS provides the greatest flexibility at the price of speed. Our model-fitting suggestions range from general cultural advice (where possible, use the tools and models that are most common in your subfield) to specific suggestions about how to change the mathematical description of models to make them more amenable to parameter estimation. A companion web site (https://groups.nceas.ucsb.edu/nonlinear-modeling/projects) presents detailed examples of application of the three tools to a variety of typical ecological estimation problems; each example links both to a detailed project report and to full source code and data.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques are now key tools in the detection of population genomic and gene expression differences in a large array of organisms. However, so far few studies have utilized such data for phylogenetic estimations. Here, we use NGS data obtained from genome-wide restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) (approximate to 66000 SNPs) to estimate the phylogenetic relationships among all 26 species of swordtail and platyfish (genus Xiphophorus) from Central America. Past studies, both sequence and morphology-based, have differed in their inferences of the evolutionary relationships within this genus, particularly at the species-level and among monophyletic groupings. We show that using a large number of markers throughout the genome, we are able to infer the phylogenetic relationships with unparalleled resolution for this genus. The relationships among all three major clades and species within each of them are highly resolved and consistent under maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference and maximum parsimony. However, we also highlight the current cautions with this data type and analyses. This genus exhibits a particularly interesting evolutionary history where at least two species may have arisen through hybridization events. Here, we are able to infer the paternal lineages of these putative hybrid species. Using the RAD-marker-based tree we reconstruct the evolutionary history of the sexually selected sword trait and show that it may have been present in the common ancestor of the genus. Together our results highlight the outstanding capacity that RAD sequencing data has for resolving previously problematic phylogenetic relationships, particularly among relatively closely related species.

AB There is an urgent need for comprehensive national databases on alien plant species, especially in developing countries. Despite the fact that plant invasions are considered a major threat to biodiversity, they have been poorly studied or not considered a conservation priority in South America. We aim to assess alien plant distribution in Chile, using the first comprehensive public alien plant database, and discuss the implications of using herbarium records to develop national databases of alien plants. We used herbarium records to assemble a comprehensive national database of alien plants. We calculated the number of alien and native species and specimens recorded in each 10 x 10 km cell. We evaluated sampling efforts and tested for relationships between alien and native species collections, as well as other spatial patterns along the latitudinal gradient. Alien and native species richness was positively correlated. Alien plants were mostly collected in central Chile, with few species collected in both the extreme north and south. However, native plants were strongly collected in central Chile, as well as in both extremes of the country. Alien and native plants followed the same pattern of accumulation along the latitudinal gradient, with native plants being relatively more collected than alien plants. Herbarium records provide valuable baseline information to evaluate plant species distribution. However, there are important gaps in this database, (e.g. variable sampling effort for alien and native plants, incomplete information on life-history traits). Given scientists and land managers increasing demand for baseline information and the high cost of collecting such data in developing countries, herbarium records should be used more frequently for research and management of plant invasions.

AB Ecological communities show extremely complex patterns of variation in space, and quantifying the relative importance of spatial and environmental factors underpinning patterns of species distributions is one of the main goals of community ecology. Although we have accumulated good knowledge about the processes driving species distributions within metacommunities, we have few insights about whether (and how) environmental and spatial features can actually generate consistent species distributional patterns across multiple metacommunities. In this paper we applied the elements of metacommunity structure (EMS) framework to identify and classify metacommunities according to multiple but discrete patterns of species distributions. Given that each pattern has unique underlying structuring mechanisms, exploring and comparing such patterns across multiple metacommunities spanning large geographical areas provides a way to test the existence of general principles underlying species distributions within metacommunities. In this study, we applied the EMS framework into a data set containing about 9000 lakes distributed across 85 fish metacommunities across Ontario, Canada, and estimated the relative importance of local and spatial factors in explaining their distributional patterns. Nested and Clementsian gradients were the patterns that fitted most metacommunities; nested metacommunities were distributed throughout the province, while Clementsian gradient metacommunities were concentrated in the southeastern region. Sixty-five percent of nested metacommunities were located in low-energy watersheds (i.e., colder climate and shorter growing season), whereas metacommunities representing Clementsian gradients were present in high-energy watersheds (i.e., relatively warmer climate and longer growing season). Taken together, our results reveal that the environmental and spatial properties in which metacommunities are embedded are at least partially responsible for their species distributional patterns.

AB Arable land occupies large areas of global land surface and hence plays an important role in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Therefore agro-ecosystems show a high potential of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions while optimizing agricultural management. Hence, there is a growing interest in analyzing and understanding carbon fluxes from arable land as affected by regional environmental as well as management conditions. The major goal of this study is to use a two year data set of eddy covariance measurements (October 2007 to October 2009) on a winter wheat field located in Western Germany to assess the seasonal and inter-annual variability of carbon fluxes as affected by meteorological variables and land management. During the study period, which was comprised of two full growing seasons, eddy covariance measurements together with measurements of various soil, plant, and meteorological data were performed. Flux partitioning and gap filling methods including uncertainty estimates were applied to derive complete time series of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (R-eco). Despite different management dates and slightly different meteorological conditions, annual NEE resulted in 270 g C m(-2) in both years. Although the period from sowing to harvesting was more than 20 days shorter in the first year, due to the later start of senescence, GPP was higher by 220 g C m(-2). In the annual carbon budget this was compensated by a stronger heterotrophic respiration after the harvest of sugar beet grown on the field before the study period. Taking into account the carbon losses due to removal of biomass during harvest, the winter wheat field acts as a carbon source with respective net biome productivities (NBP) of 246 and 201 g C m(-2) a(-1). To complete the carbon balance, releases due to energy consumption associated with crop production are taken into account. However, the relatively large carbon loss was probably, to a large extent, compensated by carbon input from plant residues left on the field after preceding sugar beet harvest. This underlines the importance of multi-annual measurements taking full crop rotations into account. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The ability to accurately predict patterns of species' occurrences is fundamental to the successful management of animal communities. To determine optimal management strategies, it is essential to understand species-habitat relationships and how species habitat use is related to natural or human-induced environmental changes. Using five years of monitoring data in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, Maryland, USA, we developed four multispecies hierarchical models for estimating amphibian wetland use that account for imperfect detection during sampling. The models were designed to determine which factors (wetland habitat characteristics, annual trend effects, spring/summer precipitation, and previous wetland occupancy) were most important for predicting future habitat use. We used the models to make predictions about species occurrences in sampled and unsampled wetlands and evaluated model projections using additional data. Using a Bayesian approach, we calculated a posterior distribution of receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) values, which allowed us to explicitly quantify the uncertainty in the quality of our predictions and to account for false negatives in the evaluation data set. We found that wetland hydroperiod (the length of time that a wetland holds water), as well as the occurrence state in the prior year, were generally the most important factors in determining occupancy. The model with habitat-only covariates predicted species occurrences well; however, knowledge of wetland use in the previous year significantly improved predictive ability at the community level and for two of 12 species/species complexes. Our results demonstrate the utility of multispecies models for understanding which factors affect species habitat use of an entire community (of species) and provide an improved methodology using AUC that is helpful for quantifying the uncertainty in model predictions while explicitly accounting for detection biases.

AB Seabird populations of the Southern Ocean have been responding to climate change for the last three decades and demographic models suggest that projected warming will cause dramatic population changes over the next century. Shift in species distribution is likely to be one of the major possible adaptations to changing environmental conditions. Habitat models based on a unique long-term tracking dataset of king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) breeding on the Crozet Islands (southern Indian Ocean) revealed that despite a significant influence of primary productivity and mesoscale activity, sea surface temperature consistently drove penguins' foraging distribution. According to climate models of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the projected warming of surface waters would lead to a gradual southward shift of the more profitable foraging zones, ranging from 25 km per decade for the B1 IPCC scenario to 40 km per decade for the A1B and A2 scenarios. As a consequence, distances travelled by incubating and brooding birds to reach optimal foraging zones associated with the polar front would double by 2100. Such a shift is far beyond the usual foraging range of king penguins breeding and would negatively affect the Crozet population on the long term, unless penguins develop alternative foraging strategies.

AB Understanding recent speciation history requires merging phylogenetic and population genetics approaches, taking into account the persistence of ancestral polymorphism and possible introgression. The emergence of a clear phylogeny of hares (genus Lepus) has been hampered by poor genomic sampling and possible occurrence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) introgression from the arctic/boreal Lepus timidus into several European temperate and possibly American boreal species. However, no formal test of introgression, taking also incomplete lineage sorting into account, has been done. Here, to clarify the yet poorly resolved species phylogeny of hares and test hypotheses of mtDNA introgression, we sequenced 14 nuclear DNA and 2 mtDNA fragments (8205 and 1113 bp, respectively) in 50 specimens from 11 hare species from Eurasia, North America, and Africa. By applying an isolation-with-migration model to the nuclear data on subsets of species, we find evidence for very limited gene flow from L. timidus into most temperate European species, and not into the American boreal ones. Using a multilocus coalescent-based method, we infer the species phylogeny, which we find highly incongruent with mtDNA phylogeny using parametric bootstrap. Simulations of mtDNA evolution under the speciation history inferred from nuclear genes did not support the hypothesis of mtDNA introgression from L. timidus into the American L. townsendii but did suggest introgression from L. timidus into 4 temperate European species. One such event likely resulted in the complete replacement of the aboriginal mtDNA of L. castroviejoi and of its sister species L. corsicanus. It is remarkable that mtDNA introgression in hares is frequent, extensive, and always from the same donor arctic species. We discuss possible explanations for the phenomenon in relation to the dynamics of range expansions and species replacements during the climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene.

AB Background: Mitochondrial DNA is a valuable taxonomic marker due to its relatively fast rate of evolution. In Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, the mitochondrial genome has a unique structural organization consisting of 20-50 maxicircles (similar to 20 kb) and thousands of minicircles (0.5-10 kb). T. cruzi is an early diverging protist displaying remarkable genetic heterogeneity and is recognized as a complex of six discrete typing units (DTUs). The majority of infected humans are asymptomatic for life while 30-35% develop potentially fatal cardiac and/or digestive syndromes. However, the relationship between specific clinical outcomes and T. cruzi genotype remains elusive. The availability of whole genome sequences has driven advances in high resolution genotyping techniques and re-invigorated interest in exploring the diversity present within the various DTUs.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To describe intra-DTU diversity, we developed a highly resolutive maxicircle multilocus sequence typing (mtMLST) scheme based on ten gene fragments. A panel of 32 TcI isolates was genotyped using the mtMLST scheme, GPI, mini-exon and 25 microsatellite loci. Comparison of nuclear and mitochondrial data revealed clearly incongruent phylogenetic histories among different geographical populations as well as major DTUs. In parallel, we exploited read depth data, generated by Illumina sequencing of the maxicircle genome from the TcI reference strain Sylvio X10/1, to provide the first evidence of mitochondrial heteroplasmy (heterogeneous mitochondrial genomes in an individual cell) in T. cruzi.
   Conclusions/Significance: mtMLST provides a powerful approach to genotyping at the sub-DTU level. This strategy will facilitate attempts to resolve phenotypic variation in T. cruzi and to address epidemiologically important hypotheses in conjunction with intensive spatio-temporal sampling. The observations of both general and specific incidences of nuclear-mitochondrial phylogenetic incongruence indicate that genetic recombination is geographically widespread and continues to influence the natural population structure of TcI, a conclusion which challenges the traditional paradigm of clonality in T. cruzi.

AB Mountain systems throughout the globe are characterized by high levels of species richness and species endemism. Biodiversity, however, is not distributed evenly with altitude, but often declines from mid to high altitudes. Conversely, endemic species may be over-represented at high altitudes. Upward elevational range shifts of mountain species have been reported in response to ongoing changes in climate, yet the reports are dominated by studies on woody species and mountains at high latitudes. We investigated spatial and temporal changes in the mountain biodiversity in the subtropical island of Taiwan, based on historical survey and resurvey data during the period 19062006. We found that upper altitudinal limits of mountain plant distributions have risen by ca 3.6 m yr-1 during the last century, in parallel with rising temperatures in the region. Although species, genus, and family richness decline with altitude, ca 55% of species at the highest altitudes are endemic to the island. Given the steep decline in land area with increasing elevation, these high altitude areas are disproportionately important for plant biodiversity when richness and endemism are standardized by available land area. We argue that the distributional shift that we report, in combination with the altitudinal distribution of plant diversity, is likely to pose a major threat to high mountain species of this highly biodiverse island, a threat that is becoming increasingly evident for high mountain plants throughout the globe.

AB Sustainable production and biodiversity conservation can be mutually supportive in providing multiple ecosystem services to farmers and society. This study aimed to determine the contribution of agroforestry systems, as tested by family farmers in the Brazilian Rainforest region since 1993, to tree biodiversity and evaluated farmers' criteria for tree species selection. In addition, long-term effects on microclimatic temperature conditions for coffee production and chemical and biological soil characteristics at the field scale were compared to full-sun coffee systems. A floristic inventory of 8 agroforests and 4 reference forest sites identified 231 tree species in total. Seventy-eight percent of the tree species found in agroforests were native. The variation in species composition among agroforests contributed to a greater gamma-diversity than a-diversity. Monthly average maximum temperatures were approximately 6 C higher in full-sun coffee than in agroforests and forests. Total soil organic C,N mineralization and soil microbial activity were higher in forests than in coffee systems, whereas the chemical and biological soil quality in agroforests did not differ significantly from full-sun coffee after 13 years. Given its contribution to the conservation of biodiversity and its capacity to adapt coffee production to future climate change, coffee agroforestry offers a promising strategy for the area.

TI MAESPA: a model to study interactions between water limitation,

AB Process-based models (PBMs) of vegetation function can be used to interpret and integrate experimental results. Water limitation to plant carbon uptake is a highly uncertain process in the context of environmental change, and many experiments have been carried out that study drought limitations to vegetation function at spatial scales from seedlings to entire canopies. What is lacking in the synthesis of these experiments is a quantitative tool incorporating a detailed mechanistic representation of the water balance that can be used to integrate and analyse experimental results at scales of both the whole-plant and the forest canopy. To fill this gap, we developed an individual tree-based model (MAESPA), largely based on combining the well-known MAESTRA and SPA ecosystem models. The model includes a hydraulically-based model of stomatal conductance, root water uptake routines, drainage, infiltration, runoff and canopy interception, as well as detailed radiation interception and leaf physiology routines from the MAESTRA model. The model can be applied both to single plants of arbitrary size and shape, as well as stands of trees. The utility of this model is demonstrated by studying the interaction between elevated [CO2] (eC(a)) and drought. Based on theory, this interaction is generally expected to be positive, so that plants growing in eC(a) should be less susceptible to drought. Experimental results, however, are varied. We apply the model to a previously published experiment on droughted cherry, and show that changes in plant parameters due to long-term growth at eC(a) (acclimation) may strongly affect the outcome of C-a x drought experiments. We discuss potential applications of MAESPA and some of the key uncertainties in process representation.

AB Gene flow is often considered to be one of the main factors that constrains local adaptation in a heterogeneous environment. However, gene flow may also lead to the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. We investigated the effect of gene flow on local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in development time in island populations of the common frog Rana temporaria which breed in pools that differ in drying regimes. This was done by investigating associations between traits (measured in a common garden experiment) and selective factors (pool drying regimes and gene flow from other populations inhabiting different environments) by regression analyses and by comparing pairwise F-ST values (obtained from microsatellite analyses) with pairwise Q(ST) values. We found that the degree of phenotypic plasticity was positively correlated with gene flow from other populations inhabiting different environments (among-island environmental heterogeneity), as well as with local environmental heterogeneity within each population. Furthermore, local adaptation, manifested in the correlation between development time and the degree of pool drying on the islands, appears to have been caused by divergent selection pressures. The local adaptation in development time and phenotypic plasticity is quite remarkable, because the populations are young (less than 300 generations) and substantial gene flow is present among islands.

AB The distribution of species on elevational gradients challenges our understanding of ecological processes, particularly in the context of biotic responses to climate change. We report here the distribution of leaf-litter ants on the Barva Transect, a continuous gradient of wet forest on Costa Rica's Atlantic slope. Seven sites were sampled, distributed from 50 to 2000 m. Worker density and microsite occupancy were high and relatively constant from 50 m to 1500 m and then abruptly dropped to near zero at 2000 m. Species density at the 1 m(2) scale was high and constant to 1070 m and then declined at higher elevations. Species richness of assemblages at the 1 km(2) scale was constant or rose slightly from 50 m to 500 m and then steeply declined. Because assemblage richness and species density declined more rapidly than worker density, density compensation with elevation is suggested and supported by a measure of mean population density. Statistically, temperature was the best predictor of both species richness and worker density. Relative humidity, soil nutrients, elevation-specific regional area, and the mid-domain effect were poor predictors of richness. Sites from 50 m to 500 m were similar in species composition. In contrast, assemblages at 1070 m, 1500 m, and 2000 m were highly differentiated. Thus elevational ranges were narrow for species at mid to upper elevations and broad for those at the lowest elevations.
   Density compensation at higher elevation suggests that if temperature or productivity are influencing the decline in diversity it must be indirectly through speciation and extinction processes, rather than by greater numbers of individuals. The broad ranges of lowland species may be a response to as yet unmeasured environmental factors (e.g., NPP) or to climate changes associated with the current interglacial period. Interglacial warming may have driven species to higher elevations, but the lack of competitors at the lower range margins may have allowed the lowest-elevation species to move upslope without a concomitant contraction of the lower range boundary. Global warming threatens a loss of narrowly-distributed montane species, but lowland biotic attrition may be ameliorated by range expansion among lowland species.

AB P>1. Conservation of declining migratory species is a challenging task, as the factors that may have determined their past distribution may not determine their current and future distribution. Saiga antelope Saiga tatarica populations have massively declined due to poaching. The species is now beginning to recover in Kazakhstan and protected areas are being implemented. Using 25 years of aerial monitoring data, we identified changes in the spring distribution and predicted densities of saiga to prioritize areas for protection under scenarios of climate change together with changes in disturbance and population size. Conserving the spring distribution is critical as spring calving aggregations are of particular importance to population viability.
   2. The current distribution is strongly influenced by disturbance, whereas climate had a stronger influence in the past. The area of highly suitable habitat has halved and become fragmented in the last decade. The existing and proposed protected areas are relatively complementary and perform well under most scenarios of future change. However there is a need to widen the geographical scope of protected area planning if potential future high suitability areas are to be effectively protected.
   3. Climate change interacts with other factors to determine the distribution of suitable habitat within and outside protected areas. Scenarios in which conservation has increased saiga population size and density tend to show limited impacts of climate change, while scenarios in which the saiga population fails to recover and disturbance continues show, worsening patchiness and reduced suitable habitat.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We provide evidence for changing distribution and density of a migratory species over a large spatio-temporal scale, and suggest that future distribution may be more constrained and spatially heterogeneous. These results have important implications for designing future conservation measures for migratory species, such that areas that robustly show high suitability under a range of potential scenarios of change can be included in protected area expansion plans. Protected area placement based only on current, rather than projected distribution risks wasting opportunities for proactive conservation, particularly for a highly disturbed, recovering species likely to be affected by climate change.

AB Studies of rainforest diversification that simultaneously consider the effects of genetic drift and natural selection are rare. We use Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism genome scans of the African rainforest lizard Trachylepis affinis from Cameroon to examine the spatial patterns and environmental associations of both neutrally evolving loci and those thought to be under selection. Bayesian selection scans revealed that approximately 7% of the genome may be under divergent selection. Using non-linear environmental modelling techniques, we fit patterns of genetic differentiation recovered from the pooled neutral data and from individual loci showing a signature of natural selection. Neutral differentiation occurred along a cline from coastal lowland rainforest inland toward the gallery forests-savanna mosaic (ecotone), and was associated with both geographic distance and changing precipitation patterns. Loci under selection were differentiated predominantly along the forest-ecotone gradient-in concordance with morphological divergence in traits related to fitness. A second set of these loci was differentiated between lowland and montane habitats. A third set of loci was indicative of divergent selection between rainforest refugia. Niche models and demographic signals in mitochondrial sequence data support a population expansion out of a core rainforest area into savanna since the last glacial maximum. Our findings indicate adaptive diversification in T. affinis may be taking place along the forest-ecotone gradient during range expansions or contractions, and that refugial isolation augmented by divergent adaptation to different rainforest environments appears to play a less significant role.

AB P>Compensatory or 'catch-up' growth may be an adaptive mechanism that buffers the growth trajectory of young organisms from deviations caused by reduced food availability. Theory generally assumes that rapid juvenile compensatory growth impacts reproduction only through its positive effects on age and size at maturation, but potential reproductive costs to juvenile compensatory growth remain virtually unexplored. We used a food manipulation experiment to examine the reproductive consequences of compensatory growth in Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Compensatory growth did not affect adult growth rates, litter production rates or investment in offspring size. However, compensatory growth had negative effects on litter size, independent of the effects of female body length, resulting in a 20% decline in offspring production. We discuss potential mechanisms behind this observed cost to reproduction.

AB Background: The sulfide-rich Frasassi caves in central Italy contain a rare example of a freshwater ecosystem supported entirely by chemoautotrophy. Niphargus ictus, the sole amphipod species previously reported from this locality, was recently shown to host the first known case of a freshwater chemoautotrophic symbiosis. Since the habitat of N. ictus is highly fragmented and is comprised of streams and lakes with various sulfide concentrations, we conducted a detailed study to examine the potential genetic diversity of this species within Frasassi.
   Results: By sequencing one nuclear (ITS) and two mitochondrial (COI and 12S) regions, we show that four partially sympatric Niphargus clades are present in Frasassi. Morphological and behavioral data obtained for three of these clades are perfectly congruent with this molecular delineation and make it possible to distinguish them in the field. Phylogenetic analyses of 28S ribosomal DNA sequences reveal that, among the four clades, only two are closely related to each other. Moreover, these four clades occupy distinct niches that seem to be related to the chemical properties and flow regimes of the various water bodies within Frasassi.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that four distinct Niphargus species are present in Frasassi and that they originated from three or four independent invasions of the cave system. At least two among the four species harbor Thiothrix epibionts, which paves the way for further studies of the specificity and evolutionary history of this symbiosis.

AB It is often argued that the benefit of eradication of an invasive species-a one-off injection of funds and the problem is solved-far outweighs the cost of a perennial control program. Furthermore, these are very attractive projects for funding agencies as outcomes are clear and easy to assess. Galapagos is in the early stage of the invasion process, with most alien species not yet naturalized and still restricted to gardens and farms. These species should be easy targets for early and cost-effective eradication projects, which would prevent many future problems. We review 30 plant eradication projects covering 23 potentially invasive species with limited distributions on four of the Galapagos Islands. Of the 30 projects, only four were successful: these were all less than 1 ha in net area, on land with a single owner and did not have persistent seed banks. Of the other 26 projects, most failed due to a lack of support from institutions that did not offer continuity of resources, from land owners who denied permission to carry out the work or from being too ambitious. As a result of these problems, 64.3% of the funding secured for the program was spent on discontinued projects. We highlight lessons learned to inform plant eradication programs in the future.

AB We examined the short-term movements of a small temperate fish, the painted comber Serranus scriba (Linnaeus 1758), within the marine protected area (MPA) of Palma Bay (NW Mediterranean) using passive acoustic telemetry, Fifteen adults were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters and monitored between July 2007 and February 2008 for periods of up to 36 d. Interindividual variability was detected for both spatial and temporal patterns. There were 2 principal movement behaviours that were recorded, with some individuals showing high site fidelity and others showing a more mobile behaviour, moving out from the monitoring area. Observation-area curves indicated that a period between 3 and 5 d was required to determine home ranges of the sedentary fish. Home range sizes were small, with a minimum shift of core areas occurring on a daily basis. Total minimum convex polygon (MCP) areas ranged between 0.102 and 0.671 km(2), whereas 95 % kernel utilization distributions (KUD) ranged between 0.760 and 1.333 km(2). Core areas (50% KUD) ranged between 0.175 and 0.294 km(2). There were no significant differences in home range patterns between day and night periods. However, the use of the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) revealed diel rhythms on the detection pattern that could be related to a resting behaviour at night. Estimation of home ranges of S. scriba agrees with the sedentary habits of the Serranidae family and suggests the potential use of MPAs for the sustainable development of the fishery of this small Serranid.

AB Citizen science websites are emerging as a common way for volunteers to collect and report geographic ecological data. Engaging the public in citizen science is challenging and, when involving online participation, data entry, and map use, becomes even more daunting. Given these new challenges, citizen science websites must be easy to use, result in positive overall satisfaction for many different users, support many different tasks, and ensure data quality. To begin reaching these goals, we built a geospatially enabled citizen science website, evaluated its usability, and gained experience by working with and listening to citizens using the website. We sought to determine general perceptions, discover potential problems, and iteratively improve website features. Although the website was rated positively overall, map-based tasks identified a wide range of problems. Given our results, we redesigned the website, improved the content, enhanced the ease of use, simplified the map interface, and added features. We discuss citizen science websites in relation to online Public Participation Geographic Information Systems, examine the role(s) websites may play in the citizen science research model, discuss how citizen science research advances GIScience, and offer guidelines to improve citizen-based web mapping applications.

AB Understanding how urban land-use structure contributes to the abundance and diversity of riparian woody species can inform management and conservation efforts. Yet, previous studies have focused on broad-scale (e.g., urban to exurban) land-use types and have not examined more local-scale changes in land use (e.g., the variation within "urban"), which could be important in urban areas. In this paper we examine how local-scale characteristics or fine-scale urban heterogeneity affect(s) the diversity, composition, and structure of temperate woody riparian vegetation communities in the highly urbanized area of Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. We use an information-theoretic approach to compare vegetation models and canonical correspondence analyses to compare species responses to urban variables. We found that urban riparian areas can harbor a high diversity of native canopy and shrub species (38 and 41, respectively); however, native and exotic woody plant species responded differently to urbanization. Exotic canopy species increased with the level of urbanization while native canopy and understory species declined. Understory species diversity displayed a greater response to urbanization than did canopy diversity, suggesting temporal lags in canopy response to disturbances associated with present and recent land-use changes. Certain native and exotic woody species represent ecological indicators of different levels of urbanization. Native species characteristic of pre-European settlement conditions were restricted to the wide riparian forests with little urban encroachment. Several native early-successional species appear tolerant to urbanization. Two exotic species, the tree Ailanthus altissima and the shrub Lonicera maackii, were the most abundant and ubiquitous woody species and appear to exploit urban disturbances. These exotic species invasions have the potential to modify forest composition and ecological function of urban riparian systems. In addition, altered hydrology may be a contributing factor as canopy and understory stem density of high-moisture-requiring species decreased with an increase in impervious surface and grass cover and with proximity to roads and railroads. In the face of urbanization, maintaining wide riparian forests and limiting building, road and railroad development within these areas may help reduce the invasion of exotic species and benefit hydrological function in temperate riparian areas.

AB In organisms with complex life cycles, environmentally induced plasticity across sequential stages can have important consequences on morphology and life history traits such as developmental and growth rates. However, previous research in amphibians and other ectothermic vertebrates suggests that some morphological traits are generally insensitive to environmental inductions. We conducted a literature survey to examine the allometric responses in relative hind leg length and head shape of post-metamorphic anuran amphibians to induced environmental (temperature, resource level, predation and desiccation risk) variation operating during the larval phase in 44 studies using 19 species. To estimate and compare plastic responses across studies, we employed both an index of plasticity and effect sizes from a meta-analysis. We found contrasting trait responses to different environmental cues. Higher temperatures increased development more than growth rate and induced smaller heads but not overall shifts in hind leg length. In contrast, an increment in resource availability increased growth more than development, with a parallel increase in hind leg length but no change in head shape. Increases in predation risk decreased both development and growth rates and slightly reduced relative hind leg length, but there was no change in head shape. Pond desiccation induced quick development and low growth rates, with no changes in morphology. Across environments, both hind leg and head shape plasticity were positively correlated with growth rate plasticity. However, plasticity of developmental rate was only correlated with head shape plasticity. Overall, these results suggest that environmental trends predicted by global warming projections, such as increasing pond temperature and accelerating pond desiccation, will significantly influence hind leg and head morphology in metamorphic frogs, which may affect performance and, ultimately, fitness.

AB Mechanistic links between top terrestrial predators and biogeochemical processes remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that large carnivores configure landscape heterogeneity through prey carcass distribution. A 50-year record composed of >3600 moose carcasses from Isle Royale National Park, Michigan, USA, showed that wolves modulate heterogeneity in soil nutrients, soil microbes, and plant quality by clustering prey carcasses over space. Despite being well utilized by predators, moose carcasses resulted in elevated soil macronutrients and microbial biomass, shifts in soil microbial composition, and elevated leaf nitrogen for at least 2-3 years at kill sites. Wolf-killed moose were deposited in some regions of the study landscape at up to 12x the rate of deposition in other regions. Carcass density also varied temporally, changing as much as 19-fold in some locations during the 50-year study period. This variation arises, in part, directly from variation in wolf hunting behavior. This study identifies a top terrestrial predator as a mechanism generating landscape heterogeneity, demonstrating reciprocal links between large carnivore behavior and ecosystem function.

AB Samples collected in the deep Nazare Canyon and at the adjacent slope, during the HERMES RRS Discovery D297 cruise (2005), were analysed for metazoan meiofauna, nematode structure and diversity and its relation to quality and quantity of sedimentary organic material. The amount and quality of organic matter available for direct consumption was much higher in the canyon compared to the slope and positively correlated with high nematode abundances (795-1171 ind. 10 cm(-2)) and biomass (93.2-343.5 mu g dry weight 10 cm(-2)). thus leading to higher standing stocks. Canyon nematode assemblages also showed particular adaptations (e.g. higher trophic complexity, variability of nematode morphology, and presence of opportunistic genera) to canyon conditions, particularly in the deeper sediment layers. The Nazare Canyon's nematode diversity was slightly lower than that of the adjacent slope and its assemblages were characterised by a higher dominance of certain genera. Still, the canyon contributes considerably to total Western Iberian Margin diversity due to different assemblages present compared to the slope. Furthermore, the harsh conditions in terms of hydrodynamic disturbance and the high organic matter flux are likely to have a negative impact on the establishment of species rich meiobenthic communities, especially in the canyon axis.

AB Non-indigenous ungulate species pose a problem for conservation. They can be socially and economically valuable, but are also potentially harmful to biodiversity. Therefore, their introduction requires an explicit assessment of risk relative to benefit. To conduct such risk assessments, information regarding the impacts of non-indigenous ungulates on biodiversity is required. Here, we review the available evidence for the biodiversity impacts of non-indigenous ungulates. Hybridization, exploitation and apparent competition, vegetation impacts, predation, facilitation, trophic cascades and soil system functioning were assessed using a hierarchical set of criteria for the strength of the evidence. Strong evidence was lacking for risks posed by competition. Numerous reports exist of hybridization in captivity between ungulate species that normally do not co-occur, but conclusive evidence for introgression in the wild was restricted to one case. Strong evidence (using exclosure experiments) for the impacts of introduced ungulates on vegetation structure and composition was found and in some cases introduced ungulates caused the extirpation of plant species. Predation by Sus scrofa is a substantial threat to island faunas and systems, and impacts on soil system functioning elsewhere have also been found. Facilitation by ungulates has been shown to be substantial in promoting invasive plant species. By contrast, little evidence exists for apparent competition. The largest impacts from introduced ungulates are likely to be in cases where they perform novel functions in the new environment. However, to determine which types of impacts are likely to be most problematic, further evidence is required, ideally from well-designed field experiments.

AB The distribution of predators in urban areas is overlooked by urban planners. Due to the homogenizing power of urbanization, towns are expected to favour the settlement of generalist predators. We compared the frequency of specialist and generalist predators along an urban gradient (centre, inner periphery, outer periphery, and scarcely built areas) in towns of different size (small, medium, large). We obtained data on specialist (diurnal and nocturnal raptors, Dendrocopos major) and generalist (Lotus michahellis, corvids) predators breeding in each square of the grid of 27 urban atlases. The number of species per square of specialist predators decreased in more urbanised sectors, whereas the number of generalist predators either did not change or increased in the same sectors. However, some specialist (nocturnal raptors except Athene noctua) and generalist (Garrulus glandarius, Pica pica) predators did not follow such a pattern of distribution. Town size may affect the distribution of predators. Some species (D. major, G. glandarius, P. pica) were more frequent in the more urbanised sectors in small towns. Data gathered in few towns on a limited number of predator species may not fully represent the complex response by predators to urban gradients. Urban planners should consider the distribution of predators in towns to limit risks for urban wildlife. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study has analysed for the first time fish composition and assemblage structures of three small macrotidal estuaries of the Eastern English Channel (EEC) and has explored the influences of 19 biotic and abiotic variables on the fish assemblages. Fish from Canche, Authie and Somme estuaries were collected during spring (June 2006 and May 2007) and autumn (September 2006) along the estuarine gradients using a 1.5 m beam trawl. Using identical sampling protocols, the study also analysed and compared for the first time taxonomic and functional aspects of the fish assemblages in 15 estuaries located along the Atlantic and English Channel coasts. SIMPER analysis showed high similarities in fish assemblages in the three EEC estuaries and during either spring or autumn periods. However, intraestuary similarities were relatively low, indicating that fish assemblage structures (species richnesses or abundances) were more variable within the estuary (salinity gradient) than between estuaries and/or seasons (spring vs autumn). Although numerous environmental variables were included in the study, only 47% of the variability observed in the fish distribution was explained. Fish spatial variations in the EEC estuaries are mostly driven by abiotic variables as opposed to biological interactions. As indicated by CCA, salinity and muddy sediments were the two most important factors structuring the fish assemblages. The macrobenthos being very abundant in the EEC estuaries (580-1121 ind. m(-2)), the availability of potential prey is probably not a limiting factor in the utilization of estuaries by fish. Contrary to the majority of French estuaries dominated by estuarine species (ES), the fish assemblages of the EEC estuaries are clearly dominated by marine migrant (MM) species (65% on average) with high abundance of juveniles (mostly young-of-the-year). Cluster and SIMPROF's analyses distinguished the functional structure of the 15 estuarine fish assemblages into different clusters. The three EEC estuaries form a similar group with the largest French estuaries (Seine, Loire and Gironde). The latters were characterized by higher MM/ES ratio compared to the other French estuaries. Freshwater flow and tidal range were the main factors associated with this group of estuaries. The results of the present study do not indicate that anthropogenic impacts (chemical contamination) on estuaries affect their ecological functioning as described by the fish ecological guilds. It is suggested that the guild approach may not be useful to provide valuable information on the ecological Status of estuaries. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Plant adaptations to pollinators are usually studied at the species level, but are expected to occur at the local population level and be reflected in fine-scale patterns of floral variation.
   Here, we examined whether a guild of c. 20 South African plant species pollinated by the long proboscid fly Prosoeca ganglbaueri (Nemestrinidae) exhibits fine- scale patterns of geographical covariation and convergent evolution at a local scale.
   Fly proboscis length is highly variable among sites (20-50 mm). Plant adaptation results in floral depths of plants within the guild being closely matched with the proboscis length of their fly pollinator across numerous sites. This results in patterns of divergence among allopatric populations and convergence among species within a site.
   The most likely evolutionary processes driving these patterns include coevolution between the fly and plants with consistent and abundant rewards, as well as onesided evolution in rare and nonrewarding species that do not influence the coevolutionary process. Pollinator-mediated selection on spur length was confirmed for a nonrewarding orchid species in the guild by a reciprocal translocation experiment. Thus, rarer and nonrewarding species in the guild are forced to keep pace with the coevolutionary race between common rewarding flowers and flies.

AB Birdsong is a sexually selected and culturally transmitted multidimensional signal. Sexually selected traits are generally assumed to indicate condition. In oscine songbirds, song is learned early in life. The developmental stress hypothesis proposed that poor early developmental condition can adversely affect song learning. The quality and accuracy of learned song features could thus indicate male quality to conspecifics. Surprisingly, studies testing this hypothesis to date mostly compared adult males' song repertoires without looking at song imitation. The few that did reported inconsistent effects and analyzed a limited number of song features. Here, we examined the effects of early condition (by brood size manipulation) on learned song in zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, in comparing both the number of specific elements copied from an adult song tutor and a great number of previously neglected syntax-, complexity-, and performance-related song features. The treatment did not significantly affect average number of imitated elements, the standard measure of quality of song imitation in this species. However, developmental condition had 2 significant main effects on adult song: birds from large broods (i.e., of poor early condition) in comparison to birds from small broods copied syntactical dependencies of song elements from the song motif of their tutor less accurately and had less consistent sound duration between song motifs. These findings support the developmental stress hypothesis. We discuss how this sheds light on the potential role of such long-term signals of male developmental condition in female mate choice and potential constraints underlying condition-dependent expression of song features.

AB This paper addresses the factors that constrain the assembly of earthworm communities in temperate land use systems. An occurrence matrix containing 44 localities and 20 species was build from data sets of different studies carried out in Haute Normandie (France). The whole data set included species lists from the three main landscape units and from a range of land use types from unmanaged forests and grasslands to intensive pastures and annual crops. We used species pool, multivariate (correspondence analysis) and null model analyse to explore how species occurring in a given community are sorted from the regional species pool. Special attention was paid to identifying non-randomness in co-occurrence and morpho-ecological patterns and to describing community patterns in response to habitat constraints. Twenty species of Lumbricidae were identified in the total species pool. We found no significant effect of landscape units on species richness and density, while land use type had a significant impact on both variables, with the lowest values in crops and forests, and the highest values in grasslands. Correspondence analysis highlighted how broad land use types, soil gradients and land use intensity influence patterns of community composition and ecological coherence. Non-random patterns in guild proportion were found in a few situations, with differences between grasslands and forests. This shows that environmental filters select species at specific scales according to particular ecological traits, resulting in a convergence of these traits between species of a given community. Local species richness never exceeded nine species and species co-occurrence was significantly lower than expected by chance and much lower than described in the literature for other taxa. Although no significant patterns of limiting similarity were observed at the scale of our study, we conclude that earthworm communities are also highly structured by competition. Our study thus agrees with the idea that both habitat and competitive constraints operate simultaneously to determine how community assembly takes place. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim We analysed the variation of species richness in the European freshwater fauna across latitude. In particular, we compared latitudinal patterns in species richness and beta-diversity among species adapted to different habitat types.
   Location Europe.
   Methods We compiled data on occurrence for 14,020 animal species across 25 pre-defined biogeographical regions of European freshwaters from the Limnofauna Europaea. Furthermore, we extracted information on the habitat preferences of species. We assigned species to three habitat types: species adapted to groundwater, lotic (running water) and lentic (standing water) habitats. We analysed latitudinal patterns of species richness, the proportion of lentic species and beta-diversity.
   Results Only lentic species showed a significant species-area relationship. We found a monotonic decline of species richness with latitude for groundwater and lotic habitats, but a hump-shaped relationship for lentic habitats. The proportion of lentic species increased from southern to northern latitudes. beta-Diversity declined from groundwater to lentic habitats and from southern to northern latitudes.
   Conclusions The differences in the latitudinal variation of species richness among species adapted to different habitat types are in part due to differences in the propensity for dispersal. Since lentic habitats are less persistent than lotic or groundwater habitats, lentic species evolved more efficient strategies for dispersal. The dispersal propensity of lentic species facilitated the recolonization of central Europe after the last glaciation. Overall, we stress the importance of considering the history of regions and lineages as well as the ecological traits of species for understanding patterns of biodiversity.

AB Many avian species are negatively impacted by urbanization, but other species survive and prosper in urbanized areas. One factor potentially contributing to the success of some species in urban areas is the reduced presence of predators or parasite vectors in urban compared to rural areas. In addition, urban areas may provide increased food and water resources, which can enhance immune capacity to resist infection and the ability to eliminate parasites. We determined patterns of blood parasitism, body condition, and immune cell profiles in urban and rural populations of five adult male songbird species that vary in their relative abundance within urban areas. Urban birds generally exhibited less blood parasitism than rural birds. This difference was particularly evident for the urban-adaptable Abert's towhee Pipilo aberti. In contrast, no difference in haemoparasitism was seen between urban and rural populations of the curve-billed thrasher Toxostoma curvirostre, a less-urban adaptable species. In two closely related species, the curve-billed thrasher and the northern mockingbird Mimus polyglottos, urban birds had a higher leukocyte count and a higher heterophil to lymphocyte ratio, which is often associated with chronic stress or current infection, than rural birds. Urban northern mockingbirds were in better condition than rural counterparts, but no habitat-related differences in condition were detected for other species. Parasitic infection was correlated with body condition in only one species, the canyon towhee Pipilo fuscus. Parasitic infection in most species was correlated with changes in leukocyte abundance and profile. The findings suggest that interspecific differences in parasitic infection cannot be attributed entirely to differences in vector abundance or body condition. Interactions between immune function, parasite infection risk, and resource availability may contribute to determining the relative ability of certain species to adapt to cities.

AB The evolutionary history of plants in the southeast Tibetan Plateau might be the most complicated around the world because of the area's extremely complex topography and climate induced by strong tectonic activity in recent history. In this research, we implemented a phylogeographical study using chloroplast sequences (psbA-trnH and trnQ-rps16 intergenic spacer) on Dipentodon, a monotypic or ditypic genus (D. sinicus and D. longipedicellatus) distributed in southwest China and adjacent areas including Myanmar (Burma), northeast India and northern Vietnam. A total of 257 samples from 16 populations from the southeast Tibetan Plateau (D. longipedicellatus) and the Yungui Plateau (D. sinicus) were collected. The results revealed that Dipentodon had 11 haplotypes for the two intergenic spacers, high genetic diversity (h(T) = 0.902) and high genetic differentiation (N-ST = 0.987 and G(ST) = 0.948). AMOVA analysis showed that the component of among-population within region/species (55.25%) was unexpectedly larger than the among-species/region component (43.69%), which indicates that there is no justification for recognizing two species in Dipentodon. Correlation of pairwise genetic and geographical distances showed that Dipentodon populations in the southeast Tibetan Plateau may have suffered more habitat fragmentation than populations in the Yungui Plateau because of the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau than populations in the Yungui Plateau have. Nested clade analysis showed that 11 haplotypes formed two 3-level, three 2-level and seven 1-level clades, with eight clades showing significant geographical association. However, clade 2-1 and 2-2 did not cluster together, although they are distributed in the same region (Yungui Plateau) and belong to the same species (D. sinicus). This led not only to incongruence between haplotype network and geographical distribution of 2-level clades, but also to paraphyly of D. sinicus to D. longipedicellatus. We concluded that the incongruence and paraphyly may result from incomplete lineage sorting during the rapid and extreme tectonic events of the Tibetan Plateau. The results reported here will no doubt provide new insights into the evolution of biodiversity on the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas, and a historical framework for the conservation of biodiversity in this area, including Dipentodon.

AB While empirical studies linking biodiversity to local environmental gradients have emphasized the importance of lake trophic status (related to primary productivity), theoretical studies have implicated resource spatial heterogeneity and resource relative ratios as mechanisms behind these biodiversity patterns. To test the feasibility of these mechanisms in natural aquatic systems, the biodiversity of crustacean zooplankton communities along gradients of total phosphorus (TP) as well as the vertical heterogeneity and relative abundance of their phytoplankton resources were assessed in 18 lakes in Quebec, Canada. Zooplankton community richness was regressed against TP, the spatial distribution of phytoplankton spectral groups, and the relative biomass of spectral groups. Since species richness does not adequately capture ecological function and life history of different taxa, features which Lire important for mechanistic theories, relationships between zooplankton functional diversity (FD) and resource conditions were examined. Zooplankton species richness showed the previously established tendency to a unimodal relationship with TP, but functional diversity declined linearly over the same gradient. Changes in zooplankton functional diversity could be attributed to changes in both the spatial distribution and type of phytoplankton resource. In the studied lakes, spatial heterogeneity of phytoplankton groups declined with TP, even while biomass of all groups increased. Zooplankton functional diversity was positively related to increased heterogeneity in cyanobacteria spatial distribution. However, a smaller amount of variation in functional diversity was also positively related to the ratio of biomass in diatoms/chrysophytes to cyanobacteria. In all observed relationships, a greater variation of functional diversity than species richness measures was explained by measured factors, suggesting that functional measures of zooplankton communities will benefit ecological research attempting to identify mechanisms behind environmental gradients affecting diversity.

AB We applied a phenotypic Q(ST) (P-ST) vs. F-ST approach to study spatial variation in selection among great snipe (Gallinago media) populations in two regions of northern Europe. Morphological divergence between regions was high despite low differentiation in selectively neutral genetic markers, whereas populations within regions showed very little neutral divergence and trait differentiation. Q(ST) > F-ST was robust against altering assumptions about the additive genetic proportions of variance components. The homogenizing effect of gene flow (or a short time available for neutral divergence) has apparently been effectively counterbalanced by differential natural selection, although one trait showed some evidence of being under uniform stabilizing selection. Neutral markers can hence be misleading for identifying evolutionary significant units, and adopting the P-ST-F-ST approach might therefore be valuable when common garden experiments is not an option. We discuss the statistical difficulties of documenting uniform selection as opposed to divergent selection, and the need for estimating measurement error. Instead of only comparing overall Q(ST) and F-ST values, we advocate the use of partial matrix permutation tests to analyse pairwise Q(ST) differences among populations, while statistically controlling for neutral differentiation.

AB Increasing pea (Pisum sativum) seed nutritional value and particularly seed protein content, while maintaining yield, is an important challenge for further development of this crop. Seed protein content and yield are complex and unstable traits, integrating all the processes occurring during the plant life cycle. During filling, seeds are the main sink to which assimilates are preferentially allocated at the expense of vegetative organs. Nitrogen seed demand is satisfied partly by nitrogen acquired by the roots, but also by nitrogen remobilized from vegetative organs. In this study, we evaluated the respective roles of nitrogen source capacity and sink strength in the genetic variability of seed protein content and yield. We showed in eight genotypes of diverse origins that both the maximal rate of nitrogen accumulation in the seeds and nitrogen source capacity varied among genotypes. Then, to identify the genetic factors responsible for seed protein content and yield variation, we searched for quantitative trait loci (QTL) for seed traits and for indicators of sink strength and source nitrogen capacity. We detected 261 QTL across five environments for all traits measured. Most QTL for seed and plant traits mapped in clusters, raising the possibility of common underlying processes and candidate genes. In most environments, the genes Le and Afila, which control internode length and the switch between leaflets and tendrils, respectively, determined plant nitrogen status. Depending on the environment, these genes were linked to QTL of seed protein content and yield, suggesting that source-sink adjustments depend on growing conditions.

AB The ecological consequences of logging have been and remain a focus of considerable debate. In this study, we assessed bird species composition within a logging concession in Central Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo. Within the study area (similar to 196 km(2)) a total of 9747 individuals of 177 bird species were recorded. Our goal was to identify associations between species traits and environmental variables. This can help us to understand the causes of disturbance and predict whether species with given traits will persist under changing environmental conditions. Logging, slope position, and a number of habitat structure variables including canopy cover and liana abundance were significantly related to variation in bird composition. In addition to environmental variables, spatial variables also explained a significant amount of variation. However, environmental variables, particularly in relation to logging, were of greater importance in structuring variation in composition. Environmental change following logging appeared to have a pronounced effect on the feeding guild and size class structure but there was little evidence of an effect on restricted range or threatened species although certain threatened species were adversely affected. For example, species such as the terrestrial insectivore Argusianus argus and the hornbill Buceros rhinoceros, both of which are threatened, were rare or absent in recently logged forest. In contrast, undergrowth insectivores such as Orthotomus atrogularis and Trichastoma rostratum were abundant in recently logged forest and rare in unlogged forest. Logging appeared to have the strongest negative effect on hornbills, terrestrial insectivores, and canopy bark-gleaning insectivores while moderately affecting canopy foliage-gleaning insectivores and frugivores, raptors, and large species in general. In contrast, undergrowth insectivores responded positively to logging while most understory guilds showed little pronounced effect. Despite the high species richness of logged forest, logging may still have a negative impact on extant diversity by adversely affecting key ecological guilds. The sensitivity of hornbills in particular to logging disturbance may be expected to alter rainforest dynamics by seriously reducing the effective seed dispersal of associated tree species. However, logged forest represents an increasingly important habitat for most bird species and needs to be protected from further degradation. Biodiversity management within logging concessions should focus on maintaining large areas of unlogged forest and mitigating the adverse effects of logging on sensitive groups of species.

AB Evolutionary biologists have identified several factors that could explain the widespread phenomena of sex and recombination. One hypothesis is that host-parasite interactions favor sex and recombination because they favor the production of rare genotypes. A problem with many of the early models of this so-called Red Queen hypothesis is that several factors are acting together: directional selection, fluctuating epistasis, and drift. It is thus difficult to identify what exactly is selecting for sex in these models. Is one factor more important than the others or is it the synergistic action of these different factors that really matters? Here we focus on the analysis of a simple model with a single mechanism that might select for sex: fluctuating epistasis. We first analyze the evolution of sex and recombination when the temporal fluctuations are driven by the abiotic environment. We then analyze the evolution of sex and recombination in a two-species coevolutionary model, where directional selection is absent (allele frequencies remain fixed) and temporal variation in epistasis is induced by coevolution with the antagonist species. In both cases we contrast situations with weak and strong selection and derive the evolutionarily stable (ES) recombination rate. The ES recombination rate is most sensitive to the period of the cycles, which in turn depends on the strength of epistasis. In particular, more virulent parasites cause more rapid cycles and consequently increase the ES recombination rate of the host. Although the ES strategy is maximized at an intermediate period, some recombination is favored even when fluctuations are very slow. By contrast, the amplitude of the cycles has no effect on the ES level of sex and recombination, unless sex and recombination are costly, in which case high er-amplitude cycles allow the evolution of higher rates of sex and recombination. In the coevolutionary model, the amount of recombination in the interacting species also has a large effect on the ES, with evolution favoring higher rates of sex and recombination than in the interacting species. In general, the ES recombination rate is less than or equal to the recombination rate that would maximize mean fitness. We also discuss the effect of migration when sex and recombination evolve in a metapopulation. We find that intermediate parasite migration rates maximize the degree of local adaptation of the parasite and lead to a higher ES recombination rate in the host.

AB The use of admixed human populations to scan the genome for chromosomal segments affecting complex phenotypic traits has proved a powerful analytical tool. However, its potential in other organisms has not yet been evaluated. Here, we use DNA microsatellites to assess the feasibility of this approach in hybrid zones between two members of the 'model tree' genus Populus: Populus alba (white poplar) and Populus tremula (European aspen). We analyzed samples of both species and a Central European hybrid zone (N = 544 chromosomes) for a genome-wide set of 19 polymorphic DNA microsatellites. Our results indicate that allele frequency differentials between the two species are substantial (mean delta = 0.619 +/- 0.067). Background linkage disequilibrium (LD) in samples of the parental gene pools is moderate and should respond to sampling schemes that minimize drift and account for rare alleles. LD in hybrids decays with increasing number of backcross generations as expected from theory and approaches background levels of the parental gene pools in advanced generation backcrosses. Introgression from P. tremula into P. alba varies strongly across marker loci. For several markers, alleles from P. tremula are slightly over-represented relative to neutral expectations, whereas a single locus exhibits evidence of selection against P. tremula genotypes. We interpret our results in terms of the potential for admixture mapping in these two ecologically divergent Populus species, and we validate a modified approach of studying genotypic clines in 'mosaic' hybrid zones.

AB The climatic fluctuations during glaciations have affected differently arctic and temperate species. In the northern hemisphere, cooling periods induced the expansion of many arctic species to the south, while temperate species were forced to retract in southern refugia. Consequently, in some areas the alternation of these species set the conditions for competition and eventually hybridization. Hares in the Iberian Peninsula appear to illustrate this phenomenon. Populations of Iberian hare (Lepus granatensis), brown hare (Lepus europaeus) and broom hare (Lepus castroviejoi) in Northern Iberia harbour mitochondrial haplotypes from the mountain hare (Lepus timidus), a mainly boreal and arctic species presently absent from the peninsula. To understand the history of this past introgression we analysed sequence variation and geographical distribution of mitochondrial control region and cytochrome b haplotypes of L. timidus origin found in 378 specimens of these four species. Among 124 L. timidus from the Northern Palaearctic and the Alps we found substantial nucleotide diversity (2.3%) but little differentiation between populations. Based on the mismatch distribution of the L. timidus sequences, this could result from an expansion at a time of temperature decrease favourable to this arctic species. The nucleotide diversity of L. timidus mtDNA found in Iberian L. granatensis, L. europaeus and L. castroviejoi (183, 70 and 1 specimens, respectively) was of the same order as that in L. timidus over its range (1.9%), suggesting repeated introgression of multiple lineages. The structure of the coalescent of L. granatensis sequences indicates that hybridization with L. timidus was followed by expansion of the introgressed haplotypes, as expected during a replacement with competition, and occurred when temperatures started to rise, favouring the temperate species. Whether a similar scenario explains the introgression into Iberian L. europaeus remains unclear but it is possible that it hybridized with already introgressed L. granatensis.

   FOREST; COMMUNITIES; MODEL
AB The assembly of an ecosystem such as a tropical forest depends crucially on the species interaction network, and the deduction of its rules is a formidably complex problem(1). In spite of this, many recent studies(2-16) using Hubbell's neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography(2) have demonstrated that the resulting emergent macroscopic behaviour of the ecosystem at or near a stationary state shows a surprising simplicity reminiscent of many physical systems(17). Indeed the symmetry postulate(2), that the effective birth and death rates are species-independent within a single trophic level, allows one to make analytical predictions for various static distributions such as the relative species abundance(3-12), beta-diversity(13-15) and the species - area relationship(16). In contrast, there have only been a few studies of the dynamics and stability of tropical rain forests(18-20). Here we consider the dynamical behaviour of a community, and benchmark it against the exact predictions of a neutral model near or at stationarity. In addition to providing a description of the relative species abundance, our analysis leads to a quantitative understanding of the species turnover distribution and extinction times, and a measure of the temporal scales of neutral evolution. Our model gives a very good description of the large quantity of data collected in Barro Colorado Island in Panama in the period 1990 - 2000 with just three ecologically relevant parameters and predicts the dynamics of extinction of the existing species.

AB [ 1] Oceanic phytoplankton assemblages composed predominantly of picophytoplankton respond to the onset of favorable growth conditions with diatom-dominated blooms, the formation of which involves characteristic growth and accumulation responses by both diatoms and the ambient nondiatom community. Contrary to conventional wisdom, both groups of phytoplankton increase in growth rates and absolute abundance, but the biomass increase of the ambient nondiatom assemblage is modest, especially compared to the order of magnitude or more increase of diatom biomass. This enormous proportional increase in diatom biomass has fostered the misconception that diatoms replace the nondiatom taxa by succession as the bloom matures. However, while the relative abundance of the nondiatom taxa decreases dramatically, their absolute biomass increases modestly and the specific growth rate of picophytoplankton in the bloom increases; at the same time, protistan grazing rate also increases, holding the picophytoplankton assemblage in the bloom to a new steady state biomass concentration. Recent evidence for the ubiquity of the additive response pattern in pelagic diatom blooms comes from observations in many oceanic regions where equatorial upwelling, eddy dynamics, tropical instability waves, and oceanic iron-addition experiments have allowed documentation of the biological response to rapid onset of favorable nutrient, micronutrient or light conditions. The response of diatoms to these favorable conditions is well known; this report offers a more accurate description of the response of the ambient nondiatom taxa to rapid onset of favorable conditions. Realistic representation of the growth dynamics of both the diatoms and nondiatoms in blooms is required to improve forecasting of how future conditions will affect processes that control carbon recycling and export.

AB The genus Boechera is a widespread North American group with great potential for studies of ecology and evolution: Boechera is closely related to Arabidopsis and exhibits different ecological and reproductive strategies. Boechera stricta (previously Arabis drummondii) is a morphologically and genetically well-defined, perennial crucifer species. Fifteen natural populations of diploid individuals from the Rocky Mountains were analysed using 21 microsatellite loci. In accordance with our expectation for this predominately inbreeding species, a high F-IS value (0.89) was observed. Furthermore, populations of B. stricta were highly differentiated, as indicated by F-ST = 0.56. Three clusters were identified using STRUCTURE-the majority of populations belonged to either the Northern or Southern cluster. Together, the north-south partitioning and evenness of genetic variation across the two clusters suggested multiple refugia for this perennial herb in the Rocky Mountains. Pleistocene glaciation, together with the topographically and climatologically heterogeneous cordillera, has profoundly influenced the genetic architecture of B. stricta. Genetic population structure was also influenced by relatively recent genome admixture at two levels: within species (involving individuals from the Northern and Southern clusters) and between species (with the hybridization of B. stricta and Boechera holboellii). This complexity of population structure at presumably neutral microsatellite loci located throughout the genome in B. stricta provides a baseline against which to test whether functional genetic variation is undergoing local adaptive evolution throughout the natural species range.

AB Plants inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi utilize more soluble phosphorus from soil mineral phosphate than noninoculated plants. However, there is no information on the response of soil microflora to mineral phosphate weathering by AM fungi and, in particular, on the catabolic diversity of soil microbial communities.
   The AM fungus, Glomus intraradices was examined for (i) its effect on the growth of Acacia holosericea, (ii) plant-available phosphate and (iii) soil microbial activity with and without added rock phosphate.
   After 4-months culture, AM fungal inoculation significantly increased the plant biomasses (by 1.78 X and 2.23 X for shoot and root biomasses, respectively), while mineral phosphate amendment had no effect in a sterilized soil. After 12-months culture, the biomasses of A. holosericea plants growing in a non-sterilized soil amended with mineral phosphate were significantly higher than those recorded in the control treatment (by 2.5 X and 5 X for shoot and root biomasses, respectively). The fungal inoculation also significantly stimulated plant growth, which was significantly higher than that measured in the mineral phosphate treatment. When G. intraradices and mineral phosphate were added together to the soil, shoot growth were significantly stimulated over the single treatments (inoculation or amendment) (1.45 X). The P leaf mineral content was also higher in the G. intraradices + mineral phosphate treatment than in G. intraradices or rock phosphate amendment. Moreover, the number of fluorescent pseudomonads has been significantly increased when G. intraradices and/or mineral phosphate were added to the soil. By using a specific type of multivariate analysis (co-inertia analysis), it has been shown that plant growth was positively correlated to the metabolization of ketoglutaric acid, and negatively linked to the metabolisation of phenylalanine and other substrates, which shows that microbial activity is also affected.
   G. intraradices inoculation is highly beneficial to the growth of A. holosericea plants in controlled conditions. This AM symbiosis optimises the P solubilization from the mineral phosphate and affects microbial activity in the hyphosphere of A. holosericea plants. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Intraspecific phylogeographical patterns largely depend on the life history traits of a species. Especially species with a high degree of cold tolerance, limited requirements towards habitat preferences, and relatively low active dispersal capacities may have responded in a different way to the Pleistocene climatological fluctuations than the majority of taxa studied so far. To evaluate this possibility, we studied Arion fuscus (Muller, 1774), a common and widespread European terrestrial slug, from 88 locations (N = 964). Sequence variation was assessed for fragments of the mitochondrial 16S rDNA and COI genes by means of single-strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCP) and subsequent DNA sequencing. Additionally, eight allozyme loci were scored in 843 individuals. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of two major evolutionary lineages, one in the Balkan region and another in the Alps and the rest of Europe. The sequence divergence between the two lineages was limited (3.3%), but gene flow between the regions was absent, suggesting that the two regions have been isolated since the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene. Allozyme differentiation among geographical regions and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages was low. The geographical patterns observed in our data showed that (i) haplotype and nucleotide diversities are very low in northern Europe, suggesting that single haplotypes rapidly colonized large areas; (ii) recently expanded haplotype clades have restricted distribution ranges, suggesting that current gene flow is low; and (iii) genetic diversity in the Alps is much higher than in other regions and estimated past gene flow from the Eastern Alps to other regions was high, suggesting that this was a refugial zone during the Pleistocene. This full-range phylogeography suggests the existence of an alternative refugial zone, situated north of the refugial areas currently recognized in most other taxa.

AB Life-history theory predicts that individuals should increase their reproductive effort when the fitness return from reproduction is high. Females mated with high-quality males are therefore expected to have higher investment than females mated with low-quality males, which could bias estimates of paternal effects. Investigating the traits females use in their allocation decisions and the aspects of reproduction that are altered is essential for understanding how sexual selection is affected. We studied the potential for differential female allocation in a captive population of a precocial bird, the Chinese quail, Coturnix chinensis. Females paired with males with large sexual ornaments laid larger, but not more, eggs than females paired with males with small sexual ornaments. Furthermore, female egg mass was also significantly positively affected by male testis size, probably via some unknown effect of testis size on male phenotype. Testis size and ornament size were not correlated. Thus, both primary and secondary male sexual traits could be important components of female allocation decisions. Experimental manipulation of hormone levels during embryonic development showed that both male and female traits influencing female egg size were sensitive to early hormone exposure. Differences in prenatal hormone exposure as a result of maternal steroid allocation to eggs may explain some of the variation in reproductive success among individuals, with important implications for nongenetic transgenerational effects in sexual selection.

ID RANGE-SIZE; DENSITY-DEPENDENCE; PLANTS
AB 1. We explore the relationship between patch occupancy and local abundance in a general model for regional population dynamics. We vary colonization ability and key demographic and habitat characteristics in order to explore the effects on abundance-occupancy relationships.
   2. In populations in which colonization rates are very high, new habitat is rapidly colonized and there is a simple asymptotic relationship between occupancy and abundance, assuming that habitat quality and abundance are linked.
   3. If colonization rates are moderate to low, as in metapopulations, there is similarly a positive relationship between occupancy and abundance, but there is a minimum abundance below which the metapopulation becomes extinct.
   4. These responses are modulated by the occurrence of Allee effects, demographic stochasticity or depensatory effects: when such effects are significant, the metapopulation rescue effect becomes important, and regional occupancy becomes more sensitive to changes in local density.
   5. Finally, in populations in which colonization rates are very low, there is no relationship between occupancy and abundance.
   6. Our results emphasize two aspects of large-scale ecology as being key in generating positive abundance-occupancy relationships: (i) a relationship between average habitat quality and the proportion of habitat that is habitable; and (ii) the nature of colonization. It is important to note that colonization is a function of dispersal, fecundity, and local processes such as Allee effects, as well as the availability and isolation of habitat patches.
   7. When an abundance-occupancy relationship exists there is typically a non-linear scaling from local to total population sizes at low population densities, and we discuss how this may be detected in real data, as well as its implications.

AB Increased atmospheric CO2 concentration (Ca) produces a short-term stimulation of photosynthesis and plant growth across terrestrial ecosystems. However, the long-term response remains uncertain and is thought to depend on environmental constraints. In the longest experiment on natural ecosystem response to elevated Ca, we measured the shoot-density, biomass and net CO2 exchange (NEE) responses to elevated Ca from 1987 to 2003 in a Scirpus olneyi wetland sedge community of the Chesapeake Bay, MD, USA. Measurements were conducted in five replicated open-top chambers per CO2 treatment (ambient and elevated). In addition, unchambered control plots were monitored for shoot density. Responses of daytime NEE, Scirpus plant biomass and shoot density to elevated Ca were positive for any single year of the 17-year period of study. Daytime NEE stimulation by elevated Ca rapidly dropped from 80% at the onset of the experiment to a long-term stimulation average of about 35%. Shoot-density stimulation by elevated Ca increased linearly with duration of exposure (r(2)=0.89), exceeding 120% after 17 years. Although of lesser magnitude, the shoot biomass response to elevated Ca was similar to that of the shoot density. Daytime NEE response to elevated Ca was not explained by the duration of exposure, but negatively correlated with salinity of the marsh, indicating that this elevated-Ca response was decreased by water-related stress. By contrast, circumstantial evidence suggested that salinity stress increased the stimulation of shoot density by elevated Ca, which highlights the complexity of the interaction between water-related stresses and plant community responses to elevated Ca. Notwithstanding the effects of salinity stress, we believe that the most important finding of the present research is that a species response to elevated Ca can continually increase when this species is under stress and declining in its natural environment. This is particularly important because climate changes associated with elevated Ca are likely to increase environmental stresses on numerous species and modify their present distribution. Our results point to an increased resilience to change under elevated Ca when plants are exposed to adverse environmental conditions.

AB Recurrent glacial advances have shaped community histories across the planet. While biogeographic responses to glaciations likely varied with latitude, the consequences for temperate marine communities histories are less clear. By coalescent analyses of multiloci DNA sequence data (mitochondrial DNA control region, alpha-enolase intron, and alpha-tropomyosin intron) collected from a low-dispersing sister pair of rocky intertidal fishes commonly found from southeastern Alaska to California (Xiphister atropurpureus and X. mucosus), we uncover two very different responses to historical glaciations. A variety of methods that include a simulation analysis, coestimates of migration and divergence times, and estimates of minimum ages of populations sampled up and down the North American Pacific coast all strongly revealed a history of range persistence in X. atropurpureus and extreme range contraction and expansion from a southern refugium in X. mucosus. Furthermore, these conclusions are not sensitive to the independent estimates of the DNA substitution rates we obtain. While gene flow and dispersal are low in both species, the widely different histories are rather likely to have arisen from ecological differences such as diet breadth, generation time, and habitat specificity.

AB The differential allocation hypothesis predicts that parents should adjust their current investment in relation to perceived mate attractiveness if this affects offspring fitness. It should be selectively advantageous to risk more of their future reproductive success by investing heavily in current offspring of high reproductive value but to decrease investment if offspring value is low. If the benefits of mate attractiveness are limited to a particular offspring sex we would instead expect relative investment in male versus female offspring to vary with mate attractiveness, referred to as 'differential sex allocation'. We present strong evidence for differential allocation of parental feeding effort in the wild and show an immediate effect on a component of offspring fitness. By experimentally reducing male UV crown coloration, a trait known to indicate attractiveness and viability in wild-breeding blue tits (Parus caeruleus), we show that females, but not males, reduce parental feeding rates and that this reduces the skeletal growth of offspring. However, differential sex allocation does not occur. We conclude that blue tit females use male UV coloration as an indicator of expected offspring fitness and adjust their investment accordingly.

AB While microsatellites have been used to examine genetic structure in local populations of Neotropical trees, genetic studies based on such high-resolution markers have not been carried out for Mesoamerica as a whole. Here we assess the genetic structure of the Mesoamerican mahogany Swietenia macrophylla King (big-leaf mahogany), a Neotropical tree species recently listed as endangered in CITES which is commercially extinct through much of its native range. We used seven variable microsatellite loci to assess genetic diversity and population structure in eight naturally established mahogany populations from six Mesoamerican countries. Measures of genetic differentiation (F-ST and R-ST) indicated significant differences between most populations. Unrooted dendrograms based on genetic distances between populations provide evidence of strong phylogeographic structure in Mesoamerican mahogany. The two populations on the Pacific coasts of Costa Rica and Panama were genetically distant from all the others, and from one another. The remaining populations formed two clusters, one comprised of the northern populations of Mexico, Belize and Guatemala and the other containing the southern Atlantic populations of Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Significant correlation was found between geographical distance and all pairwise measures of genetic divergence, suggesting the importance of regional biogeography and isolation by distance in Mesoamerican mahogany. The results of this study demonstrate greater phylogeographic structure than has been found across Amazon basin S. macrophylla. Our findings suggest a relatively complex Mesoamerican biogeographic history and lead to the prediction that other Central American trees will show similar patterns of regional differentiation.

AB We studied soil organic carbon (C) chemistry at the mountain birch forest-tundra ecotone in three regions of the Fennoscandian mountain range with comparable vegetation cover but contrasting degrees of continentality and latitude. The aim of the study was to identify functional compound classes and their relationships to decomposition and spatial variation across the ecotone and latitudinal gradient. Solid-state (13) C nuclear magnetic resonance (CPMAS (13) C NMR) was used to identify seven functional groups of soil organic C: alkyls , N-alkyls , O-alkyls , acetals , aromatics , phenolics and carboxyls . N-alkyls , O-alkyls and acetals are generally considered labile substrates for a large number of saprotrophic fungi and bacteria, whilst phenolics and aromatics are mainly decomposed by lignolytic organisms and contribute to the formation of soil organic matter together with aliphatic alkyls and carboxyls . All soils contained a similar proportional distribution of functional groups, although relatively high amounts of N-alkyls , O-alkyls and acetals were present in comparison to earlier published studies, suggesting that large amounts of soil C were potentially vulnerable to microbial degradation. Soil organic matter composition was different at the most southerly site (Dovrefjell, Norway), compared with the two more northerly sites (Abisko, Sweden, and Joatka, Norway), with higher concentrations of aromatics and phenolics , as well as pronounced differences in alkyl concentrations between forest and tundra soils. Clear differences between mountain birch forest and tundra heath soil was noted, with generally higher concentrations of labile carbon present in tundra soils. We conclude that, although mesic soils around the forest-tundra ecotone in Fennoscandia are a potential source of C to the atmosphere in a changing environment, the response is likely to vary between comparable ecosystems in relation to latitude and continentality as well as soil properties especially soil nitrogen content and pH.

AB Since the early 1970s, high levels of long-transported organochlorine pollutants (OCs) such as PCBs and DDE have been found in seabirds in the European Arctic, especially in the Glaucous Gull, Larus hyperboreus. However, the potential ecological effects of these contaminants have not been studied. We measured the concentrations of 15 different OCs (HCB, three HCHs, oxychlordane, DDE, and nine PCB congeners) in the blood of 111 Glaucous Gulls and related the concentrations to fitness components of the same individuals. Blood samples were taken in 1997, and individuals were followed until 2000. We first conducted a principal component analysis (PCA) on all OCs and related reproductive traits and survival. to the first and second PCA axes, which represented persistent compounds and more volatile compounds, respectively. We then related reproductive traits and survival to all OCs separately, except for persistent PCB congeners (for which we used their sum), to test if some compounds were more consistently related to negative fitness effects than others. Females with high circulating levels of persistent OCs were more likely to lay nonviable eggs than were females with low levels, whereas levels of more volatile OCs were not related to egg viability. Moreover, there was a negative relationship between PC1, in addition to female blood concentration of both persistent and some volatile OCs, and the hatching condition of the chick from the first egg laid in clutches. The hatching condition of the second chick in clutches was significantly negatively related to PC1, and specifically to female blood concentrations of HCB, beta-HCH, and PCB-28. Apart from a negative association between OC concentrations and laying date in both sexes, no other reproductive parameters (clutch size, egg size, incubation time, nest predation, and early, chick survival) showed associations with any of the OCs measured. Hence, reproductive effects were most likely related to maternal transfer of persistent OCs to eggs. Adult survival was negatively related to blood concentration of DDE, persistent PCBs and HCB, and especially to oxychlordane. Survival probability was reduced by 29% in females and 16% in males as oxychlordane concentrations in the blood increased 10-fold (from 5 to 50 ng/k wet mass). In long-lived birds, adult survival probability is the parameter to which the population growth rate is most sensitive, suggesting that persistent OCs have the potential for causing considerable effects on the population dynamics of Arctic-breeding Glaucous Gulls.

AB Community genetics synthesizes community ecology and population genetics and yields fresh insights into the interplay between evolutionary and ecological processes. A community genetics framework proves especially valuable when strong selection on traits results from or impinges on interspecific interactions, an increasingly common phenomenon as more communities are subject to direct management or anthropogenic disturbances. We draw illustrations of this perspective from our ongoing studies of three representative communities, two managed and one natural, that have recently undergone large perturbations. The studied communities are: (1) insect pests of crop plants genetically engineered to produce insecticidal toxins; (2) insect-pollinated plants in habitats severely fragmented by agriculture and urbanization; and (3) a pathogen and its crop host now grown extensively outside their native ranges. We demonstrate the value of integrating genetic and ecological processes to gain a full understanding of community dynamics, particularly in nonequilibrium systems that are subject to strong selection.

AB 1. A functional growth analysis was used to determine the duration of strict dependency on seed reserves for energy and nitrogen in three woody Bignoniaceae species (Tabebuia rosea DC., Challichlamys latifolia K. Schum. and Pithecoctenium crucigerum A. Gentry) which differed in cotyledon function (photosynthetic, semi-photosynthetic and storage) and shade tolerance (probability of seedling establishment and survival in the understorey).
   2. Seedlings were raised from seeds in sand culture under combinations of three nitrogen levels (daily supply of nutrient solution containing 100, 10 and 0% of 2.6 mm N) and two irradiances (27 and 1% full sun). Time course of biomass, non-cotyledonous biomass and leaf area for 40 days post-germination were compared to identify when the external availability of nitrogen or light began to affect seedling growth.
   3. Seedlings of all species became dependent on external energy supply earlier than they did on nitrogen supply. In all species seed nitrogen was sufficient to support positive seedling growth for 40 days in shade, but not in sun.
   4. Tabebuia rosea with photosynthetic cotyledons responded to light availability earlier than more shade-tolerant species with storage cotyledons. Challichlamys latifolia , the most shade-tolerant species, had the highest nitrogen concentration in seeds and was the last to respond to external nitrogen availability. Thus seedlings of the most shade-tolerant species depended on seed reserves for the longest period for both energy and nitrogen.
   5. Relative growth rate after seedlings initiated autotrophic growth was in a trade-off relationship with seedling survivorship in the understorey across the three species. Tabebuia rosea , the least shade-tolerant species, had the highest positive net carbon balance in sun and shade.
   6. Functional morphology of cotyledons and concentration of seed nitrogen deserve as much attention as seed size as correlates of contrasting seedling regeneration strategies.

AB We explored statistical relationships between the composition of littoral diatom assemblages and 21 chemical and physical environmental variables in 69 lakes and 15 river sites in the lowland of northeastern Germany. Canonical correspondence analysis with single treatment and with forward selection of environmental variables was used to detect 11 important ecological variables (dissolved inorganic carbon [DIC], Na+, total phosphorus [TP], dissolved organic carbon [DOC], total nitrogen [TN], pH, oxygen saturation, dissolved iron, SO42-, NH4+, soluble reactive silicium) and maximum water depth or Ca2+ or soluble reactive phosphorus that most independently explain major proportions of the total diatom variance among the habitats. Monte Carlo permutation tests showed that each contributed a significant additional proportion (P < 0.05) of the variance in species composition. Together, these 11 most important environmental variables explained 34% of the total variance in species composition among the sites and captured 73% of the explained variance from the full 21 parameters model. Weighted-averaging regression and calibration of 304 indicator taxa with tolerance down-weighting and classic deshrinking was used to develop transfer functions between littoral diatoms and DIC, pH, TP, TN, and Cl-. The DOC:TP ratio was introduced and a weighted-averaging model was developed to infer allochthonous DOC effects in freshwater ecosystems. This diatom-DOC/TP model was significant (P < 0.001) and explained 7.6% of the total diatom variance among the sites, surpassing the inferential power of the diatom-TP-transfer function (7.3% explained variance). The root-mean-square errors of prediction of the models were estimated by jack-knifing and were comparable with published data sets from surface sediment diatom samples. The data set of littoral diatoms and environmental variables allows use of the diatom-environmental transfer functions in biomonitoring and paleolimnological approaches across a broad array of natural water resources (such as floodplains, flushed lakes, estuaries, shallow lakes) in the central European lowland ecoregion.

AB The Laurentian Great Lakes have an extensive history of species introductions, many of which occurred as a result of ballast water discharge by trans-oceanic ships. Most nonindigenous species (NIS) of animals and protozoans that established in the Great Lakes since 1985 are native to the Black, Azov and Caspian Seas or other regions of Eurasia. Analysis of vector strength from global port regions indicates that these NIS, which include amphipods, crustacean zooplankton, mussels and fishes, have been transported principally along dominant shipping routes from native or introduced habitats in northern and western Europe to the Great Lakes. A large group of additional taxa, many of which have extensive invasion histories, is available for transfer to the Great Lakes from key European ports. Thus, joint consideration of invasion corridors and the NIS species established in key donor ports provides an indication of taxa that may colonize the Great Lakes in future. Recent studies indicate that risk assessment may be extended even further for inland lakes subject to NIS invasion from the Great Lakes in cases where invasion vectors can be identified and quantified. Identification of invasion corridors and quantification of vector pathways, using lakes as model systems, provide a promising opportunity for the evolution of invasion biology from a largely descriptive science into a more predictive and quantitative discipline.

AB We compared reproductive allocation and variation in condition and survivorship of two heritable female throat color morphs (orange and yellow) in a free-living population of side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana). Using path analysis and structural equation modeling, we investigated how variation in the social environment affected clutch size and egg mass and two condition traits (postlaying mass, immunological condition) and how these traits in turn affected female field survival. In the presence of many neighbors, both morphs increased their clutch sizes, although these effects were only significant in yellow females. In addition, yellow females increased their egg mass in the presence of many orange neighbors. Orange females surrounded by many orange neighbors showed sign of stress in the form of immunosuppression, whereas this effect was less pronounced in yellow females. The morphs also differed in the impact of variation in clutch size and egg mass on both condition traits. Finally, female morphotype and immune responsiveness affected fitness interactively, and hence these two traits showed signs of fitness epistasis: Selection gradients on this trait were opposite in sign in the two morphs. The correlational selection gradient (gamma (throatxantibody) (response)) between female throat color and antibody responsiveness was -0.365. Our data thus reveal important interactive effects such as genotype-by-environment interaction toward the social environment and morph-specific trade-offs as well as the occurrence of correlational selection. We discuss the use of naturally occurring and conspicuous genetic polymorphisms in field studies of selection and life-history allocation.

AB Physical-chemical variables, phytoplankton biomass, species composition and photosynthesis-irradiance (P-I) parameters were analysed during 1 year in the Santo Andre Lagoon, Southwest Portugal - a land-locked coastal ecosystem with temporary connections with the sea. When the lagoon stayed closed the observed phytoplankton blooms were mainly caused by Prorocentrum minimum, a potentially toxic dinoflagellate. It was dominant during most of the year but the seawater inflow to the lagoon triggered a decrease in phytoplankton biomass and an abrupt shift in species composition. ph I The maximum photosynthetic rate (P(max)) ranged from 2.0 to 22.5 mg C (mg chlorophyll a)(-1) h(-1) and the light saturation index (I(k)), ranged from 5.2 to 335.0 muE m (2) s(-1), with winter minima and summer maxima. P(max) and I(k) were both positively correlated to temperature. Abundance of P minimum was associated with high nitrate concentrations whereas diatoms appear when ammonium, salinity and wind velocity are high. A mathematical model to describe photosynthetic rate as a function of irradiance and temperature [P (I, t)] was applied to the samples in which P minimum was the dominant species.

AB We investigated whether an increase in begging levels delays growth of chicks. In experiment 1, we hand-reared nine pairs of ring dove squabs, divided into a control and a begging group. All squabs received similar amounts of food, but those in the begging group had to beg for a prolonged period in order to be fed, while squabs in the control group received food without begging. Squabs stopped responding to the treatment after 10 days and, at that time, there was no effect of induced begging on their body mass. In experiment 2, we hand-reared 27 pairs of magpie chicks for 3 days. The design of experiment 2 was similar to that of experiment 1. Daily food intake and begging affected growth rates. On average, chicks in the begging group grew 0.8 g/day less than control chicks, which represents a decrease of 8.15% in growth rate. Because growth is usually positively associated with expected fitness, this demonstrates that begging is a costly behavior, an assumption routinely made in models of begging behavior.

AB Birds living in fragmented habitat may occupy territories comprising more than one patch. This paper uses a theoretical model to investigate the costs (in terms of time and energy) of crossing gaps between patches for birds feeding young in the nest, using the great tit (Parus major) as an example. When the proportion of foraging trips involving gap-crossing was small (25%), gaps of about 300-550 m (depending on body mass and flight speed) could be crossed without exceeding likely maximum sustainable daily energy expenditure (DEEmax). However, a penalty of time lost in crossing gaps of about one hour was incurred. For more gap-crossing (due to larger brood size and/or a greater proportion of gap-crossing trips), distances that could be crossed decreased rapidly to about 50-100 m and time lost increased to more than six hours. Crossing gaps at maximum range speed, rather than at the slower minimum power speed, reduced flight times by 42% and slightly reduced overall daily energy expenditure because the higher flight costs per minute were more than off-set by the shorter flight times. Smaller body mass (17 g versus 19 g) was advantageous for gap-crossing, the distances which could be crossed without exceeding DEEmax being almost doubled for the smaller mass. The influence of changes in wing morphology, fat load and prey load size on the energetics of gap-crossing were also considered. Although the model was constructed for a woodland bird, problems of time and energy expenditure associated with gap-crossing will affect many species which exploit patchy resources, especially when the spacing of the patches increases, for example due to habitat loss and modification. In landscapes where semi-natural habitat is highly fragmented and most surviving patches are small (e.g., many farming landscapes) the costs of multiple patch use may represent another mechanism by which habitat fragmentation reduces the reproductive potential of the inhabitants of habitat patches which are of acceptable or even good quality, but are small.

AB Mediterrranean regions are characterized by high spatiotemporal heterogeneity of vegetation patterns. Understanding the dynamic nature of these environments requires detailed data for wide regions regarding changes in their phyto-ecology, biomass and productivity. This article assesses the current status of satellite remote sensing in this field of application. Mapping the five main life-forms (physiognomic classes) in Mediterranean regions (forests, woodlands, scrub, dwarf shrubs and herbaceous growth) has attracted major attention in recent years. Methodologies developed for this purpose are based on the spectral, temporal and spatial (textural) information domains provided by satellite data. Wide regional vegetation mapping was achieved using phenological classification of vegetation indices derived mainly from NOAA AVHRR images. More detailed mapping was conducted with multispectral techniques in local areas using mainly Landsat TM images. Assessments of multispectral and multitemporal categories have shown limitations in their applicability over wide regions due mainly to the heterogeneity of Mediterranean regions. This heterogeneity cannot be regarded as a simple mixing of life-forms over large areas but, rather, the formation of transitional zones of varying mixtures resulting from disturbance and recovery cycles. Productivity and biomass monitoring has been found to be an active methodological development due to the introduction of new off-nadir viewing sensors in the visible and infrared spectral bands, and because of the development of methodologies for the retrieval of biophysical information from Synthetic Aperature Radar (SAR) data. Studies of ecosystem evolution using satellite data were conducted mainly in the fields of fire disturbance and desertification. Further progress in the remote sensing of Mediterranean vegetation ecology requires a better synergy of sensors, methods and ancillary data.

AB The understanding of the relationships between environmental factors and evolutionary forces is of importance to preserve opportunities for the continuation of dynamic evolutionary and ecological processes. This involves the identification and quantification of the relative importance of environmental factors that may influence these processes. Nevertheless, environmental factors are generally interpreted in terms of hypothetical inferences as relationships between environmental and genetic variables are often difficult to quantify. In this study, we used a statistical framework based on canonical correspondence analysis in order to determine the relative contribution of drainage pattern and environmental factors in structuring inter- and intrapopulational genetic diversity among brook charr populations as depicted by microsatellite analysis. These procedures simultaneously analyse several sets of variables and determine their relative contribution. The results revealed the influence of drainage pattern, altitude and human-induced factors on the pattern of genetic diversity and, particularly, the important role of historical events in explaining patterns of contemporary genetic diversity among populations. The statistical framework used in this study provides an efficient way to empirically relate variations of genetic diversity and descriptive variables in general.

AB Immigration patterns and the frequency of breeding dispersal in tree squirrels are predicted to be related to the amount of temporal and spatial variation in tree seed crops, their primary food supply. We studied Eurasian red squirrel, Sciurus vulgaris, dispersal patterns in a stable habitat with predictable food supply and a variable habitat with large temporal and spatial variations in food availability. In both habitats, we observed a male-biased immigration in spring and a female-biased immigration in autumn. However, there were more adults among immigrating red squirrels in the variable (66%) than the stable (31%) habitat and large differences in the extent of site fidelity between the two squirrel populations. Multivariate analyses indicate that food availability appeared to be the main factor affecting female dispersal behaviour. The data also suggest that female red squirrel dispersal patterns are an adaptive response to the predictability of food resources in space and time. Male dispersal behaviour seemed to be influenced by the distribution of the females. Their level of site fidelity was high in the stable habitat, whereas they appeared to track the movement of females in the variable habitat.

AB In nature, seagrass beds can occur as a mosaic of differently sized patches in a matrix of unvegetated sediments. While continuous, extensive seagrass meadows are recognized far their importance in providing refuge for a variety of organisms, the refuge potential of smaller (1-10 m across) vegetated patches has not been widely investigated. The degree of protection afforded by small seagrass patches may vary with patch size due to changes in edge to interior ratios and/or changes in plant characteristics. In mark-recapture experiments conducted at three separate sites, survivorship (i.e., those not lost to predation) of juvenile hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) varied among sites and increased with the areal extent of natural seagrass cover at all sites. At least 40% more clams were recovered live from one site than from the other two sites. Twice as many clams were recovered live from large patches of seagrass (5-10 m across) than from small (ca 1 m across), 18 times more were recovered live from large patches than from unvegetated sediments, and approximately eight times as many were recovered live from small patches than from unvegetated sediments. These patterns in clam survivorship were positively, but not significantly, correlated to patterns in below-ground biomass and shoot density among sites and seagrass patch-size treatments. When below-ground biomass and overall shoot density were held constant by using artificial seagrass mats there was no significant difference in the proportion of clams recovered live between 1 x 2 m and 4 x 4 m patches of seagrass. These results suggest that the refuge potential of natural patches of seagrass for infaunal prey species changes with patch size due to differences in the structural characteristics of the vegetation, not changes in the areal extent of the habitat.

AB An approach to combining remote sensing spectral measurements with an ecosystem process model is presented. In this approach, the ecosystem model is not bound by the sole use of satellite data, but integrates the latter in an explicit formulation of the main processes of vegetation functioning. A close analysis of the relationships between processes described by the model and spectral measurements can therefore be carried out, and the capability of the model to be driven by remote sensing can also be investigated. This first article presents a regional ecosystem process model for Sahelian regions. The model describes a herbaceous layer composed of only annual species. The processes of the soil-plant-atmosphere system, such as water fluxes in the soil, evaporation, transpiration, photosynthesis, respiration, senescence, bitter production, and litter decomposition at the soil surface, are modeled. Moreover, structural parameters such as vegetation cover fraction, LAI, and canopy height, which are essential parameters for coupling with physical models of reflectivity, are also simulated. Comparison with aboveground biomass measured between 1976 and 1992 at a regional scale in two different regions of the Sahel, namely, Ferlo in Senegal and Gourma in Mall, shows that the model is able to simulate the temporal evolution of the aboveground biomass components.

AB The epiphytic lichen flora and diversity on basal trunks of large Populus tremula trees was studied on 22 sample plots in 11 forest areas in southern and middle boreal Finland. The sample plots were divided into four main groups according to the location and human impact on the stand: (A) middle boreal (7 plots), (B) southern boreal old-growth (7), (C) southern boreal slightly managed (5) and (D) southern boreal strongly managed plots (3). The mean values of both the total number of lichen species (31) and the average number of lichen species per tree (13.4) were relatively low on P. tremula, but the composition of the flora was more unique than on other forest trees. The dominance of crustose lichens and bryophytes, as well as the abundance of cyanobacterial lichens, such as Lobaria pulmonaria, Nephroma spp. and Peltigera spp., were the most distinct features of the flora. The proportion of habitat specialists was high on Populus, whereas widespread foliose lichens, such as Hypogymnia physodes and Platismatia glauca, were sparse. The low lichen species numbers could best be explained by the abundance of bryophytes, the dominance of strong competitor species, the high average bark pH that favours few lichens and small variation in the microhabitat structure of the basal trunk. Several differences could be detected in the epiphyte flora between the four sample plot groups, although they were not completely separated by NMDS-ordination. Most of the middle boreal plots formed a distinct group, whereas the other plots were more scattered in the ordination space. The flora of the middle boreal plots was strongly dominated by the crustose lichens Biatora carneoalbida and B, epixanthoides. The southern boreal plots had higher species richness and diversity than the middle boreal ones. The flora of the southern boreal old-growth plots was mostly dominated by bryophytes (Ptilidium pulcherrimum, Sanionia uncinata), whereas the crustose lichen Phlyctis argena was most common on most of the managed plots. The contribution of Populus tremula to the total epiphyte diversity of boreal forests proved to be most significant.

AB The structure of ant communities was studied by sampling with pitfall traps in 24 mixed coniferous old-growth fragments (>140 yrs old), their edges, and managed surroundings of different ages in southern Finland. The old-forest ant community consisted of only three common shade-tolerant species, Formica aquilonia, Myrmica ruginodis and Camponotus herculeanus, whereas most of the ant species inhabited the early stages of forest succession. The size of the fragment affected only slightly the ant community. The most common territorial wood ant, F. aquilonia, structured the ant community by suppressing other species, although not equally so. The ant-community structure in the context of forest succession and landscape structure is discussed, and the successions in managed forests compared to those occurring after more natural disturbances. Forestry has changed the dynamics of succession and structural characteristics of the forest stands. Important changes of the landscape affecting forest-ant species are age-distribution of the forests and the fragmentation of old-growth forests accompanied by an increased proportion of edge habitats: open-country species have gained a greater inhabitable area and the relative abundances of the territorial wood-ant species (Formica s. str.) have changed. The multinest supercolonies of F. aquilonia have decreased, whereas species such as F. lugubris, which in our study area tend to be monodomous, have benefitted.

AB Poor establishment and reduced seedling growth of Scots pine (Pinus silvestris L.) in northern Sweden is related to an allelopathic inhibition by the dwarf shrub Empetrum hermaphroditum Hagerup. Indoor bioassays with green and brown leaves of Empetrum have strong negative effects on rooting ability, radicle elongation, and growth of Scots pine seedlings. Bioassays with soil samples show that phytotoxic substances leached from Empetrum foliage accumulate in the soil. Field experiments reveal that chemical inhibition by Empetrum, causing high mortality and slow growth of pine seedlings, can be reduced by adding activated carbon to the soil.

AB 1. The vascular flora of 65 raised bogs was determined across climatic gradients in eastern North America. The major geographic patterns in species richness and floristic composition were analysed using linear regression, detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA).
   2. The vascular bog flora consists of 81 species in this region. Four major floristic regions distinguished by DCA correspond to the geographic zonation of bog land-forms. Each of these floristic regions is characterized by a different mean value for species richness.
   3. Raised bogs in the southern-continental floristic region (I) contain fewer than 20 species and have the most impoverished vascular floras in eastern North America. In the transitional-continental (II) and northern-continental (III) regions, the bog flora is slightly larger, although the mean number of species remains below 26.
   4. The richest bog floras are found in the maritime region (IV), where species richness declines along a latitudinal gradient from 50 species in the south (subregion IV.1) to 32 in the north (subregion IV.2).
   5. The relationship of species richness to various environmental factors was analysed using linear regression. The most important factors are mean annual precipitation (MAP) and annual freezing degree-days (FDD) with a base temperature of 0-degrees-C. Factors that are also significantly related to species richness are mean annual temperature (MA T), the number of wet-to-dry habitats, and the concentration of magnesium and sodium in the surface water. No significant relationship was found for growing degree-days (base temperature = 5-degrees-C.), mean annual snow depth, or spatial dimensions of bogs.
   6. The regressions indicate that a climatic threshold of 1000 mm of annual precipitation and 1000 freezing degree-days separates the floristically rich maritime bogs from the floristically impoverished bogs of northern and continental regions.
   7. The relative importance of these environmental factors is supported by CCA. In addition, the CCA ordination identifies two groups of species on the basis of their response to these environmental factors. Species that are generally restricted to the maritime region (IV) have weighted averages that are above average for MAP and MA T, but below average for FDD. Species that are common to all bogs or that are more continental in their distribution have the reverse relationship.
   8. The tolerance of the regional bog flora to the acidic, anoxic rooting zone changes across this climatic gradient. One third of the species that grow on bogs in the southern maritime region are restricted to fens or mineral uplands in continental or northern regions. This shift in ecological tolerance may be related to (i) slower rates of peat accumulation on the maritime bogs, (ii) longer time available for the evolution of local tolerant populations on maritime bogs, or (iii) a physiological adaptation to the maritime climate.

AB Latitudinal patterns of biodiversity have been studied for centuries, but it is only during the last decades that species interaction networks have been used to examine the proposed latitudinal gradient of biotic specialization. These studies have given idiosyncratic results, which may either be because of genuine biological differences between systems, different concepts and scales used to quantify biotic specialization or because the methodological approaches used to compare interaction networks were inappropriate. Here we carefully examine the latitudinal specialization gradient using a global dataset of avian plant-frugivore assemblages and interaction networks. In particular, we test whether network-derived specialization patterns differ from patterns based on assemblage-level information on avian dietary preferences on specific food types. We found that network-derived measures of specialization (complementary specialization H-2 and < d'>, modularity Q) increased with latitude, i.e. frugivorous birds divide the niche of fruiting plants most finely at high latitudes where they also formed more modular interaction networks than at tropical latitudes. However, the strength and significance of the relationship between specialization metrics and latitude was influenced by the methodological approach. On the other hand, assemblage-level information on avian specialization on fruit diet (i.e. the proportion of obligate frugivorous bird species feeding primarily on fruit) revealed an opposed latitudinal pattern as more bird species were specialized on fruit diet in tropical than in temperate assemblages. This difference in the latitudinal specialization gradient reflects that obligate frugivores require a high diversity of fruit plants, as observed in tropical systems, and fulfil more generalized roles in plant-frugivore networks than bird species feeding on different food types. Future research should focus on revealing the underlying ecological, historical and evolutionary mechanisms shaping these patterns. Our results highlight the necessity of comparing different scales of biotic specialization for a better understanding of geographical patterns of specialization in resource-consumer interactions.

AB Untangling the spatial and temporal processes that influence population dynamics of migratory species is challenging, because changes in abundance are shaped by variation in vital rates across heterogeneous habitats and throughout the annual cycle. We developed a full-annual-cycle, integrated, population model and used demographic data collected between 2011 and 2014 in southern Indiana and Belize to estimate stage-specific vital rates of a declining migratory songbird, the Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina). Our primary objective was to understand how spatial and temporal variation in demography contributes to local and regional population growth. Our full-annual-cycle model allowed us to estimate (1) age-specific, seasonal survival probabilities, including latent survival during both spring and autumn migration, and (2) how the relative contribution of vital rates to population growth differed among habitats. Wood Thrushes in our study populations experienced the lowest apparent survival rates during migration and apparent survival was lower during spring migration than during fall migration. Both mortality and high dispersal likely contributed to low apparent survival during spring migration. Population growth in high-quality habitat was most sensitive to variation in fecundity and apparent survival of juveniles during spring migration, whereas population growth in low-quality sites was most sensitive to adult apparent breeding-season survival. These results elucidate how full-annual-cycle vital rates, particularly apparent survival during migration, interact with spatial variation in habitat quality to influence population dynamics in migratory species.

AB Information on the spatial incidence of fire ignition density and burnt area, trends and drivers of wildfires is vitally important in providing support for environmental and civil protection policies, designing appropriate prevention measures and allocating firefighting resources. The key objectives of this study were to analyse the geographical incidence and temporal trends for wildfires, as well as the main drivers of fire ignition and burnt area in Portugal on a municipal level. The results show that fires are not distributed uniformly throughout Portuguese territory, both in terms of ignition density and burnt area. One spot in the north-western area is well defined, covering 10% of the municipalities where more than one third of the total fire ignitions are concentrated. In >80% of Portuguese municipalities, ignition density has registered a positive trend since the 1980s. With regard to burnt area, 60% of the municipalities had a nil annual trend, 35% showed a positive trend and 5%, located mainly in the central region, revealed negative trends. Geographically weighted regression proved more efficient in identifying the most relevant physical and anthropogenic drivers of municipal wildfires in comparison with simple linear regression models. Topography, density of population, land cover and livestock were found to be significant in both ignition density and burnt area, although considerable variations were observed in municipal explanatory power.

AB The Bayesian Network (BBN) has been a popular method for risk assessment especially for the modeling of rare accidents. It could make use of experts' domain knowledge when historical data were not enough to support the use of other statistical methods. In the maritime domain, the Bayesian Network has been widely used for risk prediction by modeling the causal relationship of shipping accidents where a lot of human and organizational factors are involved. Most of the models depend on experts' elicitation for model construction and parameterization. The involvement of experts' judgment brings uncertainty and biases. In contrast, data-driven BBN is considered more objective since it is learnt from empirical data. However, even though researchers started to explore the application of data-driven BBN in recent years, its application is still constrained due to the rare occurrence of maritime accidents and the incompatibility of accident databases. As a result, experts' knowledge continues to be an important source for modeling. Reducing the elicitation worldoad and facilitating the elicitation of individual conditional probability are the two most important tasks for BBN modeling with experts' knowledge. Different techniques that facilitate experts' elicitation process were reviewed in this paper. Some of these methods have been applied in the maritime risk model while new techniques should be developed and applied as well to address the uncertainty and improve accuracy of modeling shipping accidents.

AB A key challenge in contemporary ecology and conservation is the accurate tracking of the spatial distribution of various human impacts, such as fishing. While coastal fisheries in national waters are closely monitored in some countries, existing maps of fishing effort elsewhere are fraught with uncertainty, especially in remote areas and the High Seas. Better understanding of the behavior of the global fishing fleets is required in order to prioritize and enforce fisheries management and conservation measures worldwide. Satellite-based Automatic Information Systems (S-AIS) are now commonly installed on most ocean-going vessels and have been proposed as a novel tool to explore the movements of fishing fleets in near real time. Here we present approaches to identify fishing activity from S-AIS data for three dominant fishing gear types: trawl, longline and purse seine. Using a large dataset containing worldwide fishing vessel tracks from 2011-2015, we developed three methods to detect and map fishing activities: for trawlers we produced a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) using vessel speed as observation variable. For longliners we have designed a Data Mining (DM) approach using an algorithm inspired from studies on animal movement. For purse seiners a multi-layered filtering strategy based on vessel speed and operation time was implemented. Validation against expert-labeled datasets showed average detection accuracies of 83% for trawler and longliner, and 97% for purse seiner. Our study represents the first comprehensive approach to detect and identify potential fishing behavior for three major gear types operating on a global scale. We hope that this work will enable new efforts to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of global fishing effort and make global fisheries activities transparent to ocean scientists, managers and the public.

AB The use of trait-based approaches to detect effects of land use and climate change on terrestrial plant and aquatic phytoplankton communities is increasing, but such a framework is still needed for benthic stream algae. Here we present a conceptual framework of morphological, physiological, behavioural and life-history traits relating to resource acquisition and resistance to disturbance. We tested this approach by assessing the relationships between multiple anthropogenic stressors and algal traits at 43 stream sites. Our "natural experiment" was conducted along gradients of agricultural land-use intensity (0-95% of the catchment in high-producing pasture) and hydrological alteration (0-92% streamflow reduction resulting from water abstraction for irrigation) as well as related physicochemical variables (total nitrogen concentration and deposited fine sediment). Strategic choice of study sites meant that agricultural intensity and hydrological alteration were uncorrelated. We studied the relationships of seven traits (with 23 trait categories) to our environmental predictor variables using general linear models and an information-theoretic model-selection approach. Life form, nitrogen fixation and spore formation were key traits that showed the strongest relationships with environmental stressors. Overall, FI (farming intensity) exerted stronger effects on algal communities than hydrological alteration. The large-bodied, non-attached, filamentous algae that dominated under high farming intensities have limited dispersal abilities but may cope with unfavourable conditions through the formation of spores. Antagonistic interactions between FI and flow reduction were observed for some trait variables, whereas no interactions occurred for nitrogen concentration and fine sediment. Our conceptual framework was well supported by tests of ten specific hypotheses predicting effects of resource supply and disturbance on algal traits. Our study also shows that investigating a fairly comprehensive set of traits can help shed light on the drivers of algal community composition in situations where multiple stressors are operating. Further, to understand non-linear and non-additive effects of such drivers, communities need to be studied along multiple gradients of natural variation or anthropogenic stressors.

AB Although precipitation interannual variability is projected to increase due to climate change, effects of changes in precipitation variance have received considerable less attention than effects of changes in the mean state of climate. Interannual precipitation variability effects on functional diversity and its consequences for ecosystem functioning are assessed here using a 6-year rainfall manipulation experiment. Five precipitation treatments were switched annually resulting in increased levels of precipitation variability while maintaining average precipitation constant. Functional diversity showed a positive response to increased variability due to increased evenness. Dominant grasses decreased and rare plant functional types increased in abundance because grasses showed a hump-shaped response to precipitation with a maximum around modal precipitation, whereas rare species peaked at high precipitation values. Increased functional diversity ameliorated negative effects of precipitation variability on primary production. Rare species buffered the effect of precipitation variability on the variability in total productivity because their variance decreases with increasing precipitation variance.

AB Phenotypic flexibility in physiological, morphological and behavioural traits can allow organisms to cope with environmental challenges. Given recent climate change and the degree of habitat modification currently experienced by many organisms, it is therefore critical to quantify the degree of phenotypic variation present within populations, individual capacities to change and what their consequences are for fitness. Flexibility in standard metabolic rate (SMR) may be particularly important since SMR reflects the minimal energetic cost of living and is one of the primary traits underlying organismal performance. SMR can increase or decrease in response to food availability, but the consequences of these changes for growth rates and other fitness components are not well known. We examined individual variation in metabolic flexibility in response to changing food levels and its consequences for somatic growth in juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta). SMR increased when individuals were switched to a high food ration and decreased when they were switched to a low food regime. These shifts in SMR, in turn, were linked with individual differences in somatic growth; those individuals that increased their SMR more in response to elevated food levels grew fastest, while growth at the low food level was fastest in those individuals that depressed their SMR most. Flexibility in energy metabolism is therefore a key mechanism to maximize growth rates under the challenges imposed by variability in food availability and is likely to be an important determinant of species' resilience in the face of global change.

AB An increasing degree of attention is being given to the ecosystem services which insect pollinators supply, and the economic value of these services. Recent research suggests that a range of factors are contributing to a global decline in pollination services, which are often used as a "headline" ecosystem service in tel of communicating the concept of ecosystem services, and how this ties peoples' wellbeing to the condition of ecosystems and the biodiversity found therein. Our paper offers a conceptual framework for measuring the economic value of changes in insect pollinator populations, and then reviews what evidence exists on the empirical magnitude of these values (both market and non-market). This allows us to highlight where the largest gaps in knowledge are, where the greatest conceptual and empirical challenges remain, and where research is most needed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB It has long been recognized that plant species and soil microorganisms are tightly linked, but understanding how different species vary in their effects on soil is currently limited. In this study, we identified those plant characteristics (identity, specific functional traits, or resource acquisition strategy) that were the best predictors of nitrification and denitrification processes. Ten plant populations representing eight species collected from three European grassland sites were chosen for their contrasting plant trait values and resource acquisition strategies. For each individual plant, leaf and root traits and the associated potential microbial activities (i.e., potential denitrification rate [DEA], maximal nitrification rate [NEA], and NH4+ affinity of the microbial community [NHScom]) were measured at two fertilization levels under controlled growth conditions. Plant traits were powerful predictors of plant-microbe interactions, but relevant plant traits differed in relation to the microbial function studied. Whereas denitrification was linked to the relative growth rate of plants, nitrification was strongly correlated to root trait characteristics (specific root length, root nitrogen concentration, and plant affinity for NH4+) linked to plant N cycling. The leaf economics spectrum (LES) that commonly serves as an indicator of resource acquisition strategies was not correlated to microbial activity. These results suggest that the LES alone is not a good predictor of microbial activity, whereas root traits appeared critical in understanding plant-microbe interactions.

AB Although extensive research has demonstrated host-retrovirus microevolutionary dynamics, it has been difficult to gain a deeper understanding of the macroevolutionary patterns of host-retrovirus interactions. Here we use recent technological advances to infer broad patterns in retroviral diversity, evolution, and host-virus relationships by using a large-scale phylogenomic approach using endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Retroviruses insert a proviral DNA copy into the host cell genome to produce new viruses. ERVs are provirus insertions in germline cells that are inherited down the host lineage and consequently present a record of past host-viral associations. By mining ERVs from 65 host genomes sampled across vertebrate diversity, we uncover a great diversity of ERVs, indicating that retroviral sequences are much more prevalent and widespread across vertebrates than previously appreciated. The majority of ERV clades that we recover do not contain known retroviruses, implying either that retroviral lineages are highly transient over evolutionary time or that a considerable number of retroviruses remain to be identified. By characterizing the distribution of ERVs, we show that no major vertebrate lineage has escaped retroviral activity and that retroviruses are extreme host generalists, having an unprecedented ability for rampant host switching among distantly related vertebrates. In addition, we examine whether the distribution of ERVs can be explained by host factors predicted to influence viral transmission and find that internal fertilization has a pronounced effect on retroviral colonization of host genomes. By capturing the mode and pattern of retroviral evolution and contrasting ERV diversity with known retroviral diversity, our study provides a cohesive framework to understand host-virus coevolution better.

AB Controlling infectious diseases at the wildlife/livestock interface is often difficult because the ecological processes driving transmission between wildlife reservoirs and sympatric livestock populations are poorly understood. Thus, assessing how animals use their environment and how this affects interspecific interactions is an important factor in determining the local risk for disease transmission and maintenance. We used data from concurrently monitored GPS-collared domestic cattle and wild boar (Sus scrofa) to assess spatiotemporal interactions and associated implications for bovine tuberculosis (TB) transmission in a complex ecological and epidemiological system, Donana National Park (DNP, South Spain). We found that fine-scale spatial overlap of cattle and wild boar was seasonally high in some habitats. In general, spatial interactions between the two species were highest in the marsh-shrub ecotone and at permanent water sources, whereas shrub-woodlands and seasonal grass-marshlands were areas with lower predicted relative interactions. Wild boar and cattle generally used different resources during winter and spring in DNP. Conversely, limited differences in resource selection during summer and autumn, when food and water availability were limiting, resulted in negligible spatial segregation and thus probably high encounter rates. The spatial gradient in potential overlap between the two species across DNP corresponded well with the spatial variation in the observed incidence of TB in cattle and prevalence of TB in wild boar. We suggest that the marsh-shrub ecotone and permanent water sources act as important points of TB transmission in our system, particularly during summer and autumn. Targeted management actions are suggested to reduce potential interactions between cattle and wild boar in order to prevent disease transmission and design effective control strategies.

AB Darwinian sexual selection can now be seen in the broader context of social selection, or social competition for resources (under sexual selection, mates or fertilization success). The social-interaction aspects of sexually selected traits give them special evolutionary properties of interest for neurobiological studies of stimulus-response systems because they can account for highly complex systems with little information content other than stimulatory effectiveness per se. But these special properties have a long history of being forgotten when other factors dominate the analysis of male-female interactions, such as the mistaken belief that differential responsiveness to signals produced by competing rivals ("female choice") requires an esthetic sense; that species recognition explains all species-specific sexual signals; and, more recently, that successful signals must reflect good survival genes; or that male-female conflict involves female resistance rather than stimulus evaluation. A "conflict paradox" results when male-female conflict is seen as driven by natural selection, whose costs should often move the hypothesized "sexually antagonistic co-evolution" of sensory-response systems toward the powerful domain of sexually synergistic co-evolution under sexual selection. Special properties of sexual selection apply to other forms of social competition as well, showing the wisdom of Darwin's setting it apart from natural selection as an explanation of many otherwise puzzling and extreme traits.

AB Drought affects vegetation photosynthesis and growth. Many studies have used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is calculated as the normalized ratio between near infrared and red spectral bands in satellite images, to evaluate the response of vegetation to drought. In this study, we examined the impacts of drought on three vegetation indices (NDVI, enhanced vegetation index, EVI, and land surface water index, LSWI) and CO2 flux from three tallgrass prairie eddy flux tower sites in the U.S. Gross primary production (GPP) was also modeled using a satellite-based Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), and the modeled GPP (GPP(VPM)) was compared with the GPP (GPP(EC)) derived from eddy covariance measurements. Precipitation at two sites in Oklahoma was 30% below the historical mean in both years of the study period (2005-2006), while the site in Illinois did not experience drought in the 2005-2007 study period. The EVI explained the seasonal dynamics of GPP better than did NDVI. The LSWI dropped below zero during severe droughts in the growing season, showing its potential to track drought. The result shows that GPP was more sensitive to drought than were vegetation indices, and EVI and LSWI were more sensitive than NDVI. We developed a modified function (Wsailar), calculated as a function of LSWI, to account for the effect of severe droughts on GPP in VPM. The GPP(VPM) from the modified VPM accounted for the rapid reduction in GPP during severe droughts and the seasonal dynamics of GPPvpm agreed reasonably well with GPP(EC). Our analysis shows that 8-day averaged values (temperature, vapor-pressure deficit) do not reflect the short-term extreme climate events well, suggesting that satellitebased models may need to be run at daily or hourly scales, especially under unfavorable climatic conditions.

AB Stability is an important concern during human walking and can limit mobility in clinical populations. Mediolateral stability can be efficiently controlled through appropriate foot placement, although the underlying neuromechanical strategy is unclear. We hypothesized that humans control mediolateral foot placement through swing leg muscle activity, basing this control on the mechanical state of the contralateral stance leg. Participants walked under Unperturbed and Perturbed conditions, in which foot placement was intermittently perturbed by moving the right leg medially or laterally during the swing phase (by similar to 50-100 mm). We quantified mediolateral foot placement, electromyographic activity of frontal-plane hip muscles, and stance leg mechanical state. During Unperturbed walking, greater swing-phase gluteus medius (GM) activity was associated with more lateral foot placement. Increases in GM activity were most strongly predicted by increased mediolateral displacement between the center of mass (CoM) and the contralateral stance foot. The Perturbed walking results indicated a causal relationship between stance leg mechanics and swing-phase GM activity. Perturbations that reduced the mediolateral CoM displacement from the stance foot caused reductions in swing-phase GM activity and more medial foot placement. Conversely, increases in mediolateral CoM displacement caused increased swing-phase GM activity and more lateral foot placement. Under both Unperturbed and Perturbed conditions, humans controlled their mediolateral foot placement by modulating swing-phase muscle activity in response to the mechanical state of the contralateral leg. This strategy may be disrupted in clinical populations with a reduced ability to modulate muscle activity or sense their body's mechanical state.

AB Many animals use variation in their alarm calls to warn conspecifics about different predatory threats. Information about predators can be encoded by producing discrete types of alarm calls and/or through graded variation in a single call type (i.e. calling rate or note repetitions). Another way to encode predator information is to combine different types of calls or notes into longer structured sequences. However, few studies have examined how individuals use discrete, graded and combinatorial variation in alarm calls to denote specific risks. I investigated the acoustic structure and information content of alarm calls in Japanese great tits, Parus major minor, by exposing their nests to three predator species (snakes, crows and martens) and a nonpredator species (doves). Great tits produced acoustically discrete alarm calls for the different nest predators: 'jar' calls for snakes and 'chicka' calls for crows and martens. The adults further discriminated between crows and martens by altering the calling rate and note number of the 'chicka' calls. A total of 175 types of note combinations were observed in the 'chicka' calls, and the tits used these combination types differently for the crows and martens. These results provide the first demonstration that birds can encode information about predator type by using production specificity, graded features and note combinations of discrete alarm calls. Previous studies have shown that parent and nestling Japanese great tits can respond in different, adaptive ways to discrete alarm calls. However, further playback studies are required to determine whether and how conspecifics can extract predator information from graded and combinatorial variation in alarm calls.

AB In recent years, research in invasion biology has focused increasing attention on understanding the role of phenology in shaping plant invasions. Multiple studies have found non-native species that tend to flower distinctly early or late in the growing season, advance more with warming or have shifted earlier with climate change compared with native species. This growing body of literature has focused on patterns of phenological differences, but there is a need now for mechanistic studies of how phenology contributes to invasions. To do this, however, requires understanding how phenology fits within complex functional trait relationships. Towards this goal, we review recent literature linking phenology with other functional traits, and discuss the role of phenology in mediating how plants experience disturbance and stress-via climate, herbivory and competition-across the growing season. Because climate change may alter the timing and severity of stress and disturbance in many systems, it could provide novel opportunities for invasion-depending upon the dominant climate controller of the system, the projected climate change, and the traits of native and non-native species. Based on our current understanding of plant phenological and growth strategies-especially rapid growing, early-flowering species versus later-flowering species that make slower-return investments in growth-we project optimal periods for invasions across three distinct systems under current climate change scenarios. Research on plant invasions and phenology within this predictive framework would provide a more rigorous test of what drives invader success, while at the same time testing basic plant ecological theory. Additionally, extensions could provide the basis to model how ecosystem processes may shift in the future with continued climate change.

However, evidence for how the nitrogen cycle was operating during the middle Precambrian is, so far, rare. More specifically, it is unknown which steps in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle, e.g. nitrogen fixation, nitrification or ammonification, were rate-limiting and thus controlling microbial community structures. The Mesoproterozoic Belt Supergroup in western Montana hosts a variety of facies ranging from shallow to deep water and thus offers the opportunity to address this issue. Bulk delta N-15 values show a clear trend from -1 parts per thousand in the deepest part of the basin to +5 parts per thousand along basin margins, which suggests that coastal areas were sufficiently oxygenated for aerobic nitrogen cycling. The total fractionation of carbon isotopes between carbonate and organic carbon (Delta C-13) increases from 20 parts per thousand to 32 parts per thousand in the same direction, possibly indicating an ecological response to redox stratification and nitrogen speciation. Evidence from the Belt Supergroup is thus consistent with the idea that nutrient availability may have restricted early eukaryotic organisms to a narrow range of habitats, which thus prevented a global rise to ecological dominance until concentrations of fixed nitrogen increased in the global open ocean.

AB The study of multimodal communication has become an active and vibrant field. This special issue of Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology brings together new developments in this rapidly expanding area. In this final contribution to the special issue, I look to the future and discuss ten questions in need of further work, touching on issues ranging from theoretical modeling and the evolution of behavior to molecular mechanisms and the development of behavior. In particular, I emphasize that the use of multimodal communication allows animals to switch between sensory channels when one channel becomes too noisy, and suggest that a better understanding of this process may help us both to understand the evolution of multisensory signaling and to predict the success of species facing environmental changes that affect signaling channels, such as urbanization and climate change. An expanded section is included on the effects of climate change on animal communication across sensory channels, urging researchers to pursue this topic due to the rapidity with which the environment is currently transforming.

AB Aim To test our hypothesis that trees change the allocation and the proportion of different nutrients between leaves and wood to maximize growth along climatic gradients. Location Catalonia, Iberian Peninsula. Methods We tested the relationships of total forest nutrient content, stoichiometry and allocation between leaves and wood in trees with growth along environmental gradients using data from the Catalan Forest Inventory and a suite of multivariate mixed models, ANOVAs and principal components analyses. Results The aboveground growth of trees and the nutrient content of leaves and wood were positively correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP). The changes in C:nutrient ratios were proportionally higher in leaves than in wood, mainly in deciduous forests. Higher MAP was also related to a lower N:P content ratio in leaves and wood but was not related to a greater allocation of P than N in leaves relative to wood (N:PL/W). Conifers, which presented the highest relative aboveground growth, had the lowest N:PL/W (0.99 +/- 0.02), whereas the slow-growing evergreens had the highest N:PL/W (2.26 +/- 0.23). Main conclusions In all forest types, growth was related to a higher allocation of nutrients to leaves than to wood, especially of P, coinciding with better climatic conditions for growth (higher MAP in this Mediterranean context). The highest rates of growth were linked to the lowest N:P ratios. The allocation of P relative to N in leaves is higher in conifers than in evergreen and deciduous trees.

AB Whereas global patterns and predictors of species diversity are well known for numerous terrestrial taxa, our understanding of freshwater diversity patterns and their predictors is much more limited. Here, we examine spatial concordance in global diversity patterns for five freshwater taxa (i.e. aquatic mammals, aquatic birds, fishes, crayfish and aquatic amphibians) and investigate the environmental factors driving these patterns at the river drainage basin grain. We find that species richness and endemism patterns are significantly correlated among taxa. We also show that cross-taxon congruence patterns are often induced by common responses of taxa to their contemporary and historical environments (i.e. convergent patterns). Apart from some taxa distinctiveness (i.e. fishes), the climate/productivity' hypothesis is found to explain the greatest variance in species richness and endemism patterns, followed by factors related to the history/dispersion' and area/environmental heterogeneity' hypotheses. As aquatic amphibians display the highest levels of congruency with other taxa, this taxon appears to be a good surrogate' candidate for developing global freshwater conservation planning at the river drainage basin grain.

TI Characterisation of Gut Microbiota in Ossabaw and Gottingen Minipigs as

AB Background: Recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiota is an important contributing factor to obesity and obesity related metabolic disorders, known as the metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study was to characterise the intestinal microbiota in two pig models of obesity namely Gottingen minipigs and the Ossabaw minipigs.
   Methods and Findings: The cecal, ileal and colonic microbiota from lean and obese Osabaw and Gottingen minipigs were investigated by Illumina-based sequencing and by high throughput qPCR, targeting the 16S rRNA gene in different phylogenetic groups of bacteria. The weight gain through the study was significant in obese Gottingen and Ossabaw minipigs. The lean Gottingen minipigs' cecal microbiota contained significantly higher abundance of Firmicutes (P<0.006), Akkermensia (P<0.01) and Methanovibribacter (P<0.01) than obese Gottingen minipigs. The obese Gottingen cecum had higher abundances of the phyla Spirochaetes (P<0.03), Tenericutes (P<0.004), Verrucomicrobia (P<0.005) and the genus Bacteroides (P<0.001) compared to lean minipigs. The relative proportion of Clostridium cluster XIV was 7.6-fold higher in cecal microbiota of obese Gottingen minipigs as compared to lean. Obese Ossabaw minipigs had a higher abundance of Firmicutes in terminal ileum and lower abundance of Gottingen in colon than lean Ossabaw minipigs (P<0.01). Obese Ossabaws had significantly lower abundances of the genera Prevotella and Lactobacillus and higher abundance of Clostridium in their colon than the lean Ossabaws. Overall, the Gottingen and Ossabaw minipigs displayed different microbial communities in response to diet-induced obesity in the different sections of their intestine.
   Conclusion: Obesity-related changes in the composition of the gut microbiota were found in lean versus obese Gottingen and Ossabaw minipigs. In both pig models diet seems to be the defining factor that shapes the gut microbiota as observed by changes in different bacteria divisions between lean and obese minipigs.

AB Daphnia pulex is quickly becoming an attractive model species in the field of ecological genomics due to the recent release of its complete genome sequence, a wide variety of new genomic resources, and a rich history of ecological data. Sequences of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 genes were used to assess the global phylogeography of this species, and to further elucidate its phylogenetic relationship to other members of the Daphnia pulex species complex. Using both newly acquired and previously published data, we analyzed 398 individuals from collections spanning five continents. Eleven strongly supported lineages were found within the D. pulex complex, and one lineage in particular, panarctic D. pulex, has very little phylogeographical structure and a near worldwide distribution. Mismatch distribution, haplotype network, and population genetic analyses are compatible with a North American origin for this lineage and subsequent spatial expansion in the Late Pleistocene. In addition, our analyses suggest that dispersal between North and South America of this and other species in the D. pulex complex has occurred multiple times, and is predominantly from north to south. Our results provide additional support for the evolutionary relationships of the eleven main mitochondrial lineages of the D. pulex complex. We found that the well-studied panarctic D. pulex is present on every continent except Australia and Antarctica. Despite being geographically very widespread, there is a lack of strong regionalism in the mitochondrial genomes of panarctic D. pulex - a pattern that differs from that of most studied cladocerans. Moreover, our analyses suggest recent expansion of the panarctic D. pulex lineage, with some continents sharing haplotypes. The hypothesis that hybrid asexuality has contributed to the recent and unusual geographic success of the panarctic D. pulex lineage warrants further study.

AB 1. Adaptive maternal programming occurs when mothers alter their offspring's phenotype in response to environmental information such that it improves offspring fitness. When a mother's environment is predictive of the conditions her offspring are likely to encounter, such transgenerational plasticity enables offspring to be better-prepared for this particular environment. However, maternal effects can also have deleterious effects on fitness. 2. Here, we test whether female threespined stickleback fish exposed to predation risk adaptively prepare their offspring to cope with predators. We either exposed gravid females to a model predator or not, and compared their offspring's antipredator behaviour and survival when alone with a live predator. Importantly, we measured offspring behaviour and survival in the face of the same type of predator that threatened their mothers (Northern pike). 3. We did not find evidence for adaptive maternal programming; offspring of predator-exposed mothers were less likely to orient to the predator than offspring from unexposed mothers. In our predation assay, orienting to the predator was an effective antipredator behaviour and those that oriented survived for longer. 4. In addition, offspring from predator-exposed mothers were caught more quickly by the predator on average than offspring from unexposed mothers. The difference in antipredator behaviour between the maternal predator-exposure treatments offers a potential behavioural mechanism contributing to the difference in survival between maternal treatments. 5. However, the strength and direction of the maternal effect on offspring survival depended on offspring size. Specifically, the larger the offspring from predator-exposed mothers, the more vulnerable they were to predation compared to offspring from unexposed mothers. 6. Our results suggest that the predation risk perceived by mothers can have long-term behavioural and fitness consequences for offspring in response to the same predator. These stress-mediated maternal effects can have non-adaptive consequences for offspring when they find themselves alone with a predator. In addition, complex interactions between such maternal effects and offspring traits such as size can influence our conclusions about the adaptive nature of maternal effects.

AB Biodiversity is a measure of the total difference within a biological system. It is understood to arise at genetic, species and multiple levels of community organisation, hence is multidimensional in nature. Biodiversity indices have proliferated in attempts to capture this complexity but may now have confounded it. Here we attempt a reduction to the minimal set of metrics needed to describe biodiversity (often by default taken to be species richness). 1000 model communities with realistic taxonomic composition were synthesised using databases of marine benthic species. A battery of 19 biodiversity indices were calculated for every community and analysed by PCA to show inter-dependence and sensitivity to variation in taxonomic (a surrogate for genetic), functional (based on ecological roles) and structural (based on species abundance) diversity. We found the three major axes of biodiversity were (a) structural complexity, and (b) two different mixtures of taxonomic and functional diversity: it was well approximated by a three-dimensional space of these variables. A scalar distance from the origin of this space could serve as a single valued summary where needed, for example in economic valuations. The most widely used single biodiversity measure - species richness - missed 88.6% of the diversity, emphasising the importance of additional characters and the need for species databases to record functional traits, presence and abundance in communities, and phylogenetic information.

AB Aim While ecologists have long been interested in diversity in mountain regions, elevational patterns in beta diversity are still rarely studied across different life forms ranging from micro- to macroorganisms. Also, it is not known whether the patterns in turnover among organism groups are affected by the degree to which the environment is modified by human activities. Location Laojun Mountain, Yunnan Province, China. Methods The beta diversity patterns of benthic microorganisms (i.e. diatoms and bacteria) and macroorganisms (i.e. macroinvertebrates) in a stony stream were simultaneously investigated between elevations of 1820 and 4050 m. Data were analysed by using a distance-based approach and variation partitioning based on canonical redundancy analysis. Results Analyses of community dissimilarities between adjacent sampling sites showed comparable small-scale beta diversity along the elevational gradient for the organism groups. However, bacteria clearly showed the lowest elevational turnover when analyses were conducted simultaneously for all pairwise sites. Variation partitioning indicated that species turnover was mostly related to environmental heterogeneity and spatial gradients including horizontal distance and elevation, while purely human impacts were shown to be less important. Main conclusions The elevational beta diversity at large scales was lower for bacteria than for eukaryotic microorganisms or macroorganisms, perhaps indicative of high dispersal ability and good adaptability of bacteria to harsh environmental conditions. However, the small-scale beta diversity did not differ among the groups. Elevation was the major driver for the turnover of eukaryotic organisms, while the turnover of bacteria was correlated more with environmental variation.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate associations between acute exercise-induced hormone responses and adaptations to high intensity resistance training in a large cohort (n = 56) of young men. Acute post-exercise serum growth hormone (GH), free testosterone (fT), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and cortisol responses were determined following an acute intense leg resistance exercise routine at the midpoint of a 12-week resistance exercise training study. Acute hormonal responses were correlated with gains in lean body mass (LBM), muscle fibre cross-sectional area (CSA) and leg press strength. There were no significant correlations between the exercise-induced elevations (area under the curve-AUC) of GH, fT and IGF-1 and gains in LBM or leg press strength. Significant correlations were found for cortisol, usually assumed to be a hormone indicative of catabolic drive, AUC with change in LBM (r = 0.29, P < 0.05) and type II fibre CSA (r = 0.35, P < 0.01) as well as GH AUC and gain in fibre area (type I: r = 0.36, P = 0.006; type II: r = 0.28, P = 0.04, but not lean mass). No correlations with strength were observed. We report that the acute exercise-induced systemic hormonal responses of cortisol and GH are weakly correlated with resistance training-induced changes in fibre CSA and LBM (cortisol only), but not with changes in strength.

AB Despite considerable progress in ecotoxicology, it has become clear that this discipline cannot answer its central questions, such as, "What are the effects of toxicants on biodiversity?" and "How the ecosystem functions and services are affected by the toxicants?". We argue that if such questions are to be answered, a paradigm shift is needed. The current bottom-up approach of ecotoxicology that implies the use of small-scale experiments to predict effects on the entire ecosystems and landscapes should be merged with a top-down macroecological approach that is directly focused on ecological effects at large spatial scales and consider ecological systems as integral entities. Analysis of the existing methods in ecotoxicology, ecology, and environmental chemistry shows that such integration is currently possible. Therefore, we conclude that to tackle the current pressing challenges, ecotoxicology has to progress using both the bottom-up and top-down approaches, similar to digging a tunnel from both ends at once.

AB Aim Species with deciduous and evergreen leaf habits typically differ in leaf life span (LLS). Yet quantification of the response of LLS, within each habit, to key environmental conditions is surprisingly lacking. The aim of this study is to quantify LLS strategies of the two leaf habits under varying temperature, moisture and nutrient conditions, using a global database. We hypothesize that deciduous LLS reflects the length of the growing season, avoiding unfavourable conditions regardless of the cause. Evergreen species adjust to unfavourable periods and amortize lower net carbon gains over several growing seasons, with increasing LLS associated with increasingly short favourable versus unfavourable season lengths.
   Location Global.
   Methods Data on LLS and environmental variables were compiled from global datasets for 189 deciduous and 506 evergreen species across 83 study locations. Individual and combined effects of measures of seasonality of temperature, water and nutrient availability on length of the growing season and on LLS were quantified using linear mixed models. The best models for predicting LLS were obtained using Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and DAIC.
   Results The LLS of deciduous and evergreen species showed opposite responses to changes in environmental conditions. Under unfavourable conditions, deciduous LLS decreases while evergreen LLS increases. A measure of temperature alone was the best predictor of the growing season. The LLS of deciduous species was independent of environmental conditions after expressing LLS in relation to the number of growing seasons. Evergreen species, on the other hand, adjusted to unfavourable conditions by increasing LLS up to four growing seasons. Contrary to expectations, variation in LLS was best explained solely by temperature, instead of by combined measures of temperature, moisture and nutrient availability. Shifts in the photosynthesis to respiration balance might provide a physiological explanation.
   Main conclusions Temperature, and not drought or nutrient availability, is the primary driver of contrasting responses of LLS for different leaf habit types.

AB 1. The potential resorption of substantial amounts of nutrients from all vegetative organs of plants has large implications for the plant nutrient economy and for biogeochemical cycles. So far, most studies have focused on leaf nutrient resorption only. Besides, while evidence is growing that soil fertility changes impact on leaf nutrient resorption at a large spatial scale, hardly anything is known of such coupling at a small spatial scale.

AB Background: The mesic habitats of eastern Australia harbour a highly diverse fauna. We examined the impact of climatic oscillations and recognised biogeographic barriers on the evolutionary history of the delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata), a species that occurs in moist habitats throughout eastern Australia. The delicate skink is a common and widespread species whose distribution spans 26 degrees of latitude and nine major biogeographic barriers in eastern Australia. Sequence data were obtained from four mitochondrial genes (ND2, ND4, 12SrRNA, 16SrRNA) for 238 individuals from 120 populations across the entire native distribution of the species. The evolutionary history and diversification of the delicate skink was investigated using a range of phylogenetic (Maximum Likelihood, Bayesian) and phylogeographic analyses (genetic diversity, Phi(ST), AMOVA, Tajima's D, Fu's F statistic).
   Results: Nine geographically structured, genetically divergent clades were identified within the delicate skink. The main clades diverged during the late Miocene-Pliocene, coinciding with the decline and fragmentation of rainforest and other wet forest habitats in eastern Australia. Most of the phylogeographic breaks within the delicate skink were concordant with dry habitat or high elevation barriers, including several recognised biogeographic barriers in eastern Australia (Burdekin Gap, St Lawrence Gap, McPherson Range, Hunter Valley, southern New South Wales). Genetically divergent populations were also located in high elevation topographic isolates inland from the main range of L. delicata (Kroombit Tops, Blackdown Tablelands, Coolah Tops). The species colonised South Australia from southern New South Wales via an inland route, possibly along the Murray River system. There is evidence for recent expansion of the species range across eastern Victoria and into Tasmania, via the Bassian Isthmus, during the late Pleistocene.
   Conclusions: The delicate skink is a single widespread, but genetically variable, species. This study provides the first detailed phylogeographic investigation of a widespread species whose distribution spans virtually all of the major biogeographic barriers in eastern Australia.

AB North American and European grasslands consist of relatively young communities that have evolved under human influences. These communities are uniformly sensitive to top-down controls and exhibit rapid changes in plant composition when the intensity and frequency of these controls are altered. These changes are intensifying due to the suite of global change factors, including the continued presence and introduction of new plant species. Establishment of nonnative plant species into grasslands requires resource opportunities generated by natural and human-induced disturbances and by niche differences of the new species. Persistence and spatial expansion require that the traits of the introduced species be compatible with a new regime of competitors, predators, pathogens, and symbionts. Plant traits of the invaders may then further facilitate the invasion process by preempting resources or by restructuring the soil microbial community and trophic food web in ways that directly or indirectly benefit the invading species.

AB The Permian/Triassic (P/Tr) transition is ecologically assessed based on examining 23 shelly communities from five shallow platform, ramp and shelf basin facies Permian-Triassic boundary (FTB) sections in South China. The shelly communities have undergone two major collapses coinciding with the two episodes of the end-Permian mass extinction. The first P/Tr extinction event devastated shelly communities in all types of settings to some extent. The basin communities have been more severely impacted than both platform and ramp communities. The survival faunas have rebounded more rapidly in shallow niches than in relatively deep habitats. The second P/Tr crisis destroyed the survival communities in shallow setting and had little impact on the basin communities in terms of community structures. The early Griesbachian communities are overall low-diversity and high-dominance. The governorship switch from brachiopods to bivalves in marine communities has been facilitated by two pulses of the end-Permian mass extinction and the whole takeover process took about 200 ka across the P/Tr boundary. Bivalve ecologic takeover initially occurred immediately after the first P/Tr extinction in shallow water habitats and was eventually completed in all niches after the second P/Tr event. Some post-extinction communities have the irregular rarefaction curves due to the unusual community structures rather than sampling intensities. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Body condition is important because it is correlated with population and habitat quality parameters. Since the direct measurements are either lethal or unreliable, a wide range of non-lethal body condition indices has been proposed. The aim of our study was to apply and compare three body condition indices (Fulton's index, relative body condition mass index and residual index) using body size indicator - body mass data for 24 populations of the yellow bellied toad (Bombina variegata). The condition index should be independent of body size indicator, in this case snout vent length (SVL). Therefore we tested all three indices for the statistical independence of SVL and for the normality of distribution. Fulton's index violated the independence assumption, whereas the relative body condition mass index did not have a normal distribution. Residual index was found both independent of SVL and normally distributed. Moreover, the residual index highlighted biological significant differences on the basis of altitude and season. Our results recommend the residual index as a useful tool in amphibian monitoring and conservation.

AB Many applications of diversity indices are only valid if they are first transformed into their equivalent number of species. These equivalent numbers of species can be multiplicatively partitioned into independent alpha, beta and gamma components, and can be formed into mathematically consistent similarity measures. The utility of beta diversity and similarity measures that incorporate information about the degree of ecological dissimilarity between species is becoming increasingly recognized. The concept of equivalent number of species is here extended to Rao's quadratic entropy, opening the way to methods of diversity partitioning that take into account taxonomic or ecological differences between species.

AB The mechanisms that determine population structure in highly mobile marine species are poorly understood, but useful towards understanding the evolution of diversity, and essential for effective conservation and management. In this study, we compare putative sperm whale populations located in the Gulf of Mexico, western North Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea and North Sea using mtDNA control region sequence data and 16 polymorphic microsatellite loci. The Gulf of Mexico, western North Atlantic and North Sea populations each possessed similar low levels of haplotype and nucleotide diversity at the mtDNA locus, while the Mediterranean Sea population showed no detectable mtDNA diversity. Mitochondrial DNA results showed significant differentiation between all populations, while microsatellites showed significant differentiation only for comparisons with the Mediterranean Sea, and at a much lower level than seen for mtDNA. Samples from either side of the North Atlantic in coastal waters showed no differentiation for mtDNA, while North Atlantic samples from just outside the Gulf of Mexico (the western North Atlantic sample) were highly differentiated from samples within the Gulf at this locus. Our analyses indicate a previously unknown fidelity of females to coastal basins either side of the North Atlantic, and suggest the movement of males among these populations for breeding.

AB The role of biodiversity in mediating ecosystem processes has been the subject of focused theoretical and empirical attention since the mid-1990s. Theory predicts that the balance between species richness and identity effects will critically depend on the degree of environmental heterogeneity, which dictates the extent to which differences between species in patterns of resource use can be expressed. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to explicitly test this hypothesis. We manipulated the richness and identity of intertidal molluscan grazers, as well as the spatial heterogeneity of the substrate upon which they grazed. The magnitude of algal consumption was used as our focal ecosystem process. The grazer treatments consisted of three monocultures and a single polyculture including all three species; heterogeneity was represented as the proportion of topographically complex and flat substrate. Species identity had strong effects on homogeneous substrates, with the identity of the best-performing species dependent on the substrate. On the heterogeneous substrate, suitable conditions for all three species were represented, allowing the expression of spatial complementarity of resource use and the enhancement of total algal consumption. Our findings provide the first explicit experimental evidence that spatial heterogeneity of the physical environment can play a key role in mediating effects of species diversity.

AB The gas-exchange and radial growth responses of conifer forests to climatic warming and increasing atmospheric CO2 have been widely studied. However, the modulating effects of variables related to stand structure (e.g., tree-to-tree competition) on those responses are poorly explored. The basal-area increment (BAI) and C isotope discrimination (C stable isotope ratio; delta C-13) in the Mediterranean fir Abies pinsapo were investigated to elucidate the influences of stand competition, atmospheric CO2 concentrations and climate on intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi). We assessed the variation in delta C-13 of tree-rings from dominant or co-dominant trees subjected to different degrees of competition. A high- (H) and a low-elevation (L) population with contrasting climatic constraints were studied in southern Spain. Both populations showed an increase in long-term WUEi. However, this increase occurred more slowly at the L site, where a decline of BAI was also observed. Local warming and severe droughts have occurred in the study area over the past 30 years, which have reduced water availability more at lower elevations. Contrastingly, trees from the H site were able to maintain high BAI values at a lower cost in terms of water consumption. In each population, trees subjected to a higher degree of competition by neighboring trees showed lower BAI and WUEi than those subjected to less competition, although the slopes of the temporal trends in WUEi were independent of the competitive micro-environment experienced by the trees. The results are consistent with an increasing drought-induced limitation of BAI and a decreasing rate of WUEi improvement in low-elevation A. pinsapo forests. This relict species might not be able to mitigate the negative effects of a decrease in water availability through a reduction in stomatal conductance, thus leading to a growth decline in the more xeric sites. An intense and poorly asymmetric competitive environment at the stand level may also act as an important constraint on the adaptive capacity of these drought-sensitive forests to climatic warming.

AB Climate change is expected to drive species ranges towards the poles and to have a strong influence on species distributions. In this study, we focused on diadromous species that are of economical and ecological importance in the whole of Europe. We investigated the potential distribution of all diadromous fish regularly encountered in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East (28 species) under conditions predicted for twenty-first century climate change. To do so, we investigated the 1900 distribution of each species in 196 basins spread across all of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Four levels were used to semiquantitatively describe the abundance of species, that is missing, rare, common and abundant. We then selected five variables describing the prevailing climate in the basins, the physical nature of the basins and reflecting historical events known to have affected freshwater fish distribution. Logistic regressions with a four-level ordinal response variable were used to develop species-specific models. These predictive models related the observed distribution of these species in 1900 to the most explanatory combination of variables. Finally, we selected the A2 SRES scenario and the HadCM3 (Hadley Centre Coupled Model version 3) global climate model (GCM) to obtain climate variables (temperature and precipitation) at the end of this century. We used these 2100 variables in our models and obtained maps of climatically suitable and unsuitable basins, percentages of contraction or expansion for each species. Twenty-two models were successfully built, that is there were five species for which no model could be established because their distribution range was too narrow and the Acipenser sturio model failed during calibration. All the models selected temperature or/and precipitation as explanatory variables. Responses to climate change were species-specific but could be classified into three categories: little or no change in the distribution (five species), expansion of the distribution range (three species gaining suitable basins mainly northward) and contraction of the distribution (14 species losing suitable basins). Shifting ranges were in accordance with those found in other studies and underlined the high sensitivity of diadromous fish to modifications in their environment.

AB Recent empirical and theoretical studies suggest that regions of restricted recombination play an important role in the formation of new species. To test this idea, we studied nucleotide variation in two parapatric subspecies of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). We Surveyed five loci near centromeres, where recombination is expected to be suppressed, and five loci near telomeres, where recombination is expected to be higher. We analyzed this multilocus data set using a divergence-with-gene flow framework and we report three main findings. First, we estimated that these subspecies diverged similar to 1.8 MYA and maintained large effective population sizes (O. c. algirus N-e approximate to 1,600,000 and O. c. cuniculus N-e approximate to 780,000). Second, we rejected a strict allopatric model of divergence without gene flow; instead, high rates of gene flow were inferred in both directions. Third, we found different patterns between loci near centromeres and loci near telomeres. Loci near centromeres exhibited higher levels of linkage disequilibrium than loci near telomeres. In addition, while all loci near telomeres showed little differentiation between subspecies, three of five loci near centromeres showed strong differentiation. These results support a view of speciation in which regions of low recombination can facilitate species divergence in the presence of gene flow.

AB Our aim was to identify natural and anthropogenic influences on the stress physiology of large African carnivores, using wild spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) as model animals. With both longitudinal data from a single social group, and cross-sectional data from multiple groups, we used fecal glucocorticoids (fGC) to examine potential stressors among spotted hyenas. Longitudinal data from adult members of a group living on the edge of the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, revealed that fGC concentrations were elevated during two periods of social upheaval among adults, especially among younger females; however, prey availability, rainfall, and presence of lions did not influence fGC concentrations among hyenas. Our results suggested that anthropogenic disturbance in the form of pastoralist activity, but not tourism, influenced fGC concentrations among adult male hyenas; rising concentrations of fGC among males over 12 years were significantly correlated with increasing human population density along the edge of the group's home range. As hyenas from this social group were frequently exposed to anthropogenic disturbance, we compared fGC concentrations among these hyenas with those obtained concurrently from hyenas living in three other groups undisturbed by pastoralist activity. We found that fGC concentrations from the undisturbed groups were significantly lower than those in the disturbed group, and we were able to rule out tourism and ecological stressors as sources of variation in fGC among the populations. Thus it appears that both social instability and anthropogenic disturbance, but not the ecological variables examined, elevate fGC concentrations and represent stressors for wild spotted hyenas. Further work will be necessary to determine whether interpopulation variation in stress physiology predicts population decline in groups exposed to intensive anthropogenic disturbance.

AB The influence of ambient noise in shaping birdsong attributes has received much attention lately. Recent work shows that some birds sing higher-pitched songs in noisy areas, which may allow them to avoid acoustic interference; yet it is not clear how this is achieved. Higher-pitched songs may be produced either by using the same syllable types in quiet and noisy areas, but singing them at a higher frequency in the latter (syllable pitch plasticity), or by using different syllable types in silent and in noisy circumstances (differential syllable use). Here we explored both strategies in the Mexico City population of house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus), a species known to possess a repertoire of several hundreds of syllable types. Birds produced songs with higher minimum frequencies in noisy than in quiet areas. This was mostly due to the minimum frequency of some syllable types being higher in noisy areas than in quiet locations. Also, males modulated the minimum frequency of the same syllable type during momentary increases of noise. Our results can help explain the high success of house finches at colonizing urban areas, while providing evidence of syllable pitch plasticity.

AB 1. We used a mesocosm experiment to determine the how both the intensity and relative importance of root and shoot competition, and their interactions, influence the structure of plant communities. Experimental communities of nine grassland plant species were planted under different levels of soil fertility. Root, shoot, and total competition intensity and relative importance, along with plant community structure (evenness) were measured in each mesocosm. Structural equation modelling was used to separate the direct and indirect influences of root, shoot and total competition on species evenness.
   2. Increasing shoot competition intensity and importance reduced plant community evenness, while increases in root competition intensity and importance had no direct effects on evenness. Root competition intensity and importance indirectly reduced plant community evenness because increased root competition intensity increased shoot competition intensity.
   3. We propose that the separate influences of shoot competition and root-shoot competition interactions on community structure can be integrated through a new state variable: the total size-asymmetry of competition. We propose that there is a direct relationship between the overall size-asymmetry of competition and the influence of competition on plant community structure.
   4. Synthesis. This study provides the first experimental evidence that, even though there are no direct links between the intensity or relative importance of root competition and plant community structure, root competition may indirectly structure communities through root-shoot competition interactions. Integrating root and shoot competition as competitive size-asymmetry can explain why intense root competition can be unimportant for community structure, while relatively less intense shoot competition and root-shoot competition interactions can have strong effects on plant community composition and diversity.

TI Quasicycles in a spatial predator-prey model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID VOLTERRA; EQUATIONS; ECOLOGY
AB We use spatial models of simple predator-prey interactions to predict that predator and prey numbers oscillate in time and space. These oscillations are not seen in the deterministic versions of the models, but are due to stochastic fluctuations about the time-independent solutions of the deterministic equations which are amplified due to the existence of a resonance. We calculate the power spectra of the fluctuations analytically and show that they agree well with results obtained from stochastic simulations. This work extends the analysis of these quasicycles from that previously developed for well-mixed systems to spatial systems, and shows that the ideas and methods used for nonspatial models naturally generalize to the spatial case.

AB Resource selection is a fundamental ecological process impacting population dynamics and ecosystem structure. Understanding which factors drive selection is vital for effective species- and landscape-level management. We used resource selection probability functions (RSPFs) to study the influence of two forms of wolf (Canis lupus) predation risk, snow conditions and habitat variables on white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), elk (Cervus elaphus) and moose (Alces alces) resource selection in central Ontario's mixed forest French River-Burwash ecosystem. Direct predation risk was defined as the frequency of a predator's occurrence across the landscape and indirect predation risk as landscape features associated with a higher risk of predation. Models were developed for two winters, each at two spatial scales, using a combination of GIS-derived and ground-measured data. Ungulate presence was determined from snow track transects in 64 16- and 128 1-km(2) resource units, and direct predation risk from GPS radio collar locations of four adjacent wolf packs. Ungulates did not select resources based on the avoidance of areas of direct predation risk at any scale, and instead exhibited selection patterns that tradeoff predation risk minimization with forage and/or mobility requirements. Elk did not avoid indirect predation risk, while both deer and moose exhibited inconsistent responses to this risk. Direct predation risk was more important to models than indirect predation risk but overall, abiotic topographical factors were most influential. These results indicate that wolf predation risk does not limit ungulate habitat use at the scales investigated and that responses to spatial sources of predation risk are complex, incorporating a variety of anti-predator behaviours. Moose resource selection was influenced less by snow conditions than cover type, particularly selection for dense forest, whereas deer showed the opposite pattern. Temporal and spatial scale influenced resource selection by all ungulate species, underlining the importance of incorporating scale into resource selection studies.

AB The evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis predicts that release from natural enemies in the introduced range favors exotic plants evolving to have greater competitive ability and lower herbivore resistance than conspecifics from the native range. We tested the EICA hypothesis in a common garden experiment with Sapium sebiferum in which seedlings from native (China) and invasive (USA) populations were grown in all pairwise combinations in the native range (China) in the presence of herbivores. When paired seedlings were from the same continent, shoot mass and leaf damage per seedling were significantly greater for plants from invasive populations than those from native populations. Despite more damage from herbivores, plants from invasive populations still outperformed those from native populations when they were grown together. Increased competitive ability and higher herbivory damage of invasive populations relative to native populations of S. sebiferum support the EICA hypothesis. Regression of biomass against percent leaf damage showed that plants from invasive populations tolerated herbivory more effectively than those from native populations. The results of this study suggest that S. sebiferum has become a faster-growing, less herbivore-resistant, and more herbivore-tolerant plant in the introduced range. This implies that increased competitive ability of exotic plants may be associated with evolutionary changes in both resistance and tolerance to herbivory in the introduced range. Understanding these evolutionary changes has important implications for biological control strategies targeted at problematic invaders.

AB The loss of connectivity of forest landscapes is seriously hindering dispersal of many forest-dwelling species, which may be critical for their viability and conservation. In this context, explicitly incorporating connectivity considerations is an important challenge in current forest planning and management, but as yet there is a lack of operative methods for appropriate decision making in this respect. We describe a new methodology based on graph structures and a habitat availability index (integral index of connectivity) that integrates forest attributes (like habitat quality) and network connectivity in a single measure. We apply this methodology to examine the connectivity of the highly fragmented habitat of capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) in Catalonia (NE Spain), where the threatened status of this forest bird species calls for landscape-level forest planning solutions. We analyse data on the distribution of capercaillie forest habitat at 1 km spatial resolution obtained from the recent Catalan Breeding Bird Atlas. We determine the functionally connected regions existing within its habitat distribution and identify the forest habitat areas that are more important for the maintenance of overall landscape connectivity for this species. Based on these results, we provide recommendations on certain critical public forests where management oriented to the conservation of capercaillie habitat is more necessary. These results highlight the potential and practical interest of the proposed methodology for successfully integrating landscape connectivity in broad scale forest planning.

AB 1. We investigated patterns in the dispersion (i.e. spread and spacing) of plant species traits that are frequently associated with competitive ability, in an old-field plant community. In contrast with previous studies, we found no evidence for significant over- or under-dispersion of maximum plant height, maximum plant biomass, or seed mass.
   2. These findings hold across three plot sizes (10 x 10 cm, 30 x 30 em, 50 x 50 cm), and when plot size is measured in terms of number of ramets (50 ramets, 250 ramets or 500 ramets) rather than per unit area. Plot size, however, significantly affected the direction of dispersion observed across test statistics, supporting previous studies that have observed that trait dispersion patterns are sensitive to plot size.
   3. While no significant dispersion was detected, dispersion direction, measured as the tendency for a two-tailed test to indicate trends for a given trait, was more frequently observed when analyses were weighted by abundance. Abundance weighted analyses had significantly different dispersion directions compared with presence/absence analyses for one of three traits considered. These findings suggest that abundance weighted analyses may yield more consistent trait dispersion patterns.
   4. Synthesis. Our results may be interpreted as evidence for limited, if any, functional niche partitioning between co-occurring species via size-mediated differences in rooting depth or physical space niches (i.e. limiting similarity). Alternatively, some species with large differences in competitive traits may avoid competition through niche separation, while others may simply compete asymmetrically, leading to overall patterns of dispersion that cannot be distinguished from random. This interpretation supports recent perspectives that niche and neutral theoretical concepts are not mutually exclusive; both, working together, can be applied to the interpretation of plant community assembly and structure.

AB Animal breeding research, reproductive biology, and cellular biogerontology show that fertilization rates and zygote viability critically depend on sperm age. Sexual selection research focuses on differences between male genotypes in sperm performance, such as motility, competitive ability, or compatibility with eggs, but without considering sperm age. A combined view ( that the thermodynamically inevitable decline in sperm performance selects for traits in diploid individuals to prevent fertilization with aged sperm) has received very little attention. In this paper, I correct this bias and show that many male and female traits affect sperm aging or the sperm age distribution at any reproductive event. Such traits coincide well with condition-dependent traits considered sexually selected: multiple mating by both sexes, high sperm production rates, the delivery of dense ejaculates containing many sperm ( including nonfertilizing types), the packaging of sperm into spermatophores, male and female sperm ejection, sexual coercion, as well as the production of showy antioxidants and various cellular and nuclear repair mechanisms. I conclude that altering the sperm age distribution at any step during reproduction can be an origin of sexually selected traits, and may explain presently observed paternity variation without assuming genetic incompatibility of gametes.

AB The neutral theory of biodiversity as put forward by Hubbell in his 2001 monograph has received much criticism for its unrealistic simplifying assumptions. These are the assumptions of functional equivalence among different species (neutrality), the assumption of point mutation speciation, and the assumption that resources are continuously saturated, such that constant resource availability implies constant community size (zero-sum assumption). Here we focus on the zero-sum assumption. We present a general theory for calculating the probability of observing a particular species-abundance distribution (sampling formula) and show that zero-sum and non-zero-sum formulations of neutral theory have exactly the same sampling formula when the community is in equilibrium. Moreover, for the nonzero-sum community the sampling formula has this same form, even out of equilibrium. Therefore, the term "zero-sum multinomial (ZSM)" to describe species abundance patterns, as coined by Hubbell [2001. The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography, Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ], is not really appropriate, as it also applies to non-zero-sum communities. Instead we propose the term "dispersal-limited multinomial (DLM)", thus making explicit one of the most important contributions of neutral community theory, the emphasis on dispersal limitation as a dominant factor in determining species abundances.

AB European black pine (Pinus nigra Arn.) is a widely distributed Mediterranean conifer. To test the hypothesis that fragmented populations in western Europe survived in situ during the last glacial rather than having been re-colonized in the postglacial period, genetic variation was assessed using a suite of 10 chloroplast DNA microsatellites. Among 311 individuals analysed, 235 haplotypes were detected revealing high levels of chloroplast haplotype diversity in most populations. Bayesian analysis using a model of linked loci, with no prior assumption of population structure, assigned individuals to 10 clusters that corresponded well with the six predefined sampling regions, while an analysis carried out at the population level and assuming unlinked loci, recovered the original six sampling regions. This regional structure was supported by a biogeographical analysis that detected five barriers, with the two most significant separating Alps from Corsica and southern Italy, and southern Spain from the Pyrenees. No signals of demographic expansion were detected, and comparisons of R-ST with pR(ST) suggested that a stepwise mutational model was important in regional differentiation, but not in population-within-region differentiation. These tests support long-term persistence of the species within the six regions. The temporal depth estimate, assuming a high mutation rate in coalescent modelling, placed the deepest split between the Alps and the other regions at about 150 000 years ago, and the most recent split of Pyrenees from southern France at about 30 000 years ago. Taken together, the data suggest that chloroplast DNA is structured in black pine and disjunct populations in western Europe are likely to have been present during the Last Glacial Maximum.

AB Objective: To present a non-classificatory technique of map representation of compositional patterns of vegetation as no two plant species assemblages are completely alike and gradations often occur. Variation is depicted as continuous fields instead of classes.
   Location: Murnauer Moos, Bavaria.
   Methods: The study combined vegetation ecology and remote sensing methods. The gradual representation of compositional patterns was based on techniques of ordination and regression, instead of mapping class fractions. The floristic field data were collected in releves and subjected to three-dimensional non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS). The reflectance information corresponding to plots was gathered from remotely sensed imagery with a high spectral resolution. Reflectance values in numerous wavelengths were related to NMS axes scores by partial least squares regression analysis. The regression equations were applied to the imagery and yielded three grey-scale images, one for each ordination axis. These three images were transformed into a red, green, and blue colour map with a specific colour for each position in the ordination space. Similar colours corresponded to similar species compositions.
   Results: Compositional variation was mapped accurately (R-2 = 0.79), using continuous fields. The results took account of various types of stand transitions and of heterogeneities within stands. The map representation featured relatively homogeneous stands and abrupt transitions between stands as well as within-stand heterogeneity and gradual transitions.
   Conclusions: The use of NMS in combination with imaging spectroscopy proved to be an expedient approach for non-classificatory map representations of compositional patterns. Ordination is efficiently extended into the geographic domain. The approach in abandoning pre-defined plant communities is able to reconcile mapping practice and complex reality.

AB This study examines the role of surface geomorphic features in tree establishment at the alpine treeline in Glacier National Park, Montana, through the presentation of a multiscale, conceptual model of biogeomorphic relationships at alpine treeline. Empirical observations gathered through a multiscale field methodology over three summers serve as a base for the model. The model highlights the importance of surface geomorphic features, specifically boulders and terrace risers, in creating favorable local site conditions, largely by protecting seedlings from wind. The sheltering effect of surface features enables initial seedling establishment, and in some cases survival, above current treeline locations, thereby initiating a positive feedback effect that encourages subsequent tree establishment. Geomorphic features are therefore important in linking scales of pattern and process at the alpine treeline ecotone.

AB Here I present an integrated framework for species abundance distributions (SADs) that goes beyond the neutral theory without relying on complex mechanistic models. I give some general mathematical results on the relationship between SADs and their underlying dynamics, and analyse an extensive set of marine phytoplankton data in order to test the neutral theory against this broader framework.
   The main theoretical and empirical results are: (i) the logseries, which is the SAD produced by simple neutral models without migration, is quite robust in response to additional factors, including some forms of niche segregation; (ii) when there is a small but significant deviation from a logseries, the SAD will generally have the form of a power law, regardless of the specific mechanisms; (iii) when the deviation is moderate, the SAD will generally have the form of a lognormal, regardless of the specific mechanisms; (iv) although in a wide range of situations neutral and non-neutral dynamics cannot be distinguished from the SAD alone, some empirical SADs do have the fingerprint of non-neutrality: this is the case of marine dinoflagellates, in contrast to marine diatoms, which adjust to neutral theory predictions. The results for marine phytoplankton illustrate that both neutral and non-neutral mechanisms coexist in nature, and seem to have different weights in different groups of organisms.
   In addition to the above findings, I discuss several related contributions and point out some important pitfalls in the literature.

AB Evolutionary lineages differ with regard to the variety of forms they exhibit. We investigated whether comparisons of morphological diversity can be used to identify differences in ecological diversity in two sister clades of centrarchid fishes. Species in the Lepomis clade (sunfishes) feed on a wider range of prey items than species in the Micropterus clade (black basses). We quantified disparity in morphology of the feeding apparatus as within-clade variance on principal components and found that Lepomis exhibits 4.4 and 7.4 times more variance than Micropterus on the first two principal components. However, lineages are expected to diversify morphologically and ecologically given enough time, and this pattern could have arisen due to differences in the amount of time each clade has had to accumulate variance. Despite being sister groups, the age of the most recent common ancestor of Lepomis is approximately 14.6 million years ago and its lineages have a total length of 86.4 million years while the age of the most recent common ancestor of Micropterus is only about 8.4 million years ago, and it has a total branch length of 42.9 million years. We used the Brownian motion model of character evolution to test the hypothesis that time of independent evolution of each clade's lineages accounts for differences in morphological disparity and determined that the rates of evolution of the first two principal components are 4.4 and 7.7 times greater in Lepomis. Thus, time and phylogeny do not account for the differences in morphological disparity observed in Lepomis and Micropterus, and other diversity-promoting mechanisms should be investigated.

AB In this review we argue that theories and methodology arising from the field of complex systems form a new paradigm for ecology. Patterns and processes resulting from interactions between individuals, populations, species and communities in landscapes are the core topic of ecology. These interactions form complex networks, which are the subject of intense research in complexity theory, informatics and statistical mechanics. This research has shown that complex natural networks often share common structures such as loops, trees and clusters. The observed structures contribute to widespread processes including feedback, non-linear dynamics, criticality and self-organisation. Simulation modelling is a key tool in studying complex networks and has become popular in ecology, especially in adaptive management. Important techniques include cellular automata and individual-based models. The complex systems paradigm has led to advances in landscape ecology, including a deeper understanding of the dynamics of spatial pattern formation, habitat fragmentation, epidemic processes, and genetic variation. Network analysis reveals that underlying patterns of interactions, such as small worlds and clusters, in food webs and ecosystems have strong implications for their stability and dynamics. These investigations illustrate how complexity theory and associated methodologies are transforming ecological research, providing new perspectives on old questions as well as raising many new ones.

AB Achillea, a temperate genus of herbaceous allogamous perennials, is a model for evolutionary radiation through hybridization and polyploidization.
   AFLP analyses were performed on 300 individuals of 66 populations and 27 taxa/cytotypes, mainly from the polyploid A. millefolium aggregate and its suspected hybrid links with other clades of the genus.
   The mosaic genetic structure of hybrids and polyploids is revealed by specific AFLP bands shared with their assumed parents. In E Asia, A. alpina-4x and A. wilsoniana-4x are allotetraploids between A. acuminata-2x (sect. Ptarmica) and A. asiatica-2x (sect. Achillea-A. millefolium agg.). A. virescens-4x is a hybrid species linking A. nobilis agg. and A. millefolium agg. in S Europe. The hybrid swarm A. clypeolata-2x $ A. collina-4x recently formed in Bulgaria shows no AFLP bands additive to its parents; by contrast, other more ancient allopolyploids exhibit genetic innovations. Relationships within A. millefolium agg. are complex. Five 2x-taxa, mostly well separated and regressive, are limited to Eurasia; seven 4x- and 6x-taxa are intimately linked by hybridization, are expansive, and through A. asiatica-2x/4x have formed the N American polyploids.
   All these results from AFLPs correspond well to other evidence, and indicate a long history of reticulate evolution in Achillea.

AB The rationale behind this research concerns the need to better understand relationships between vegetation characteristics and hydrological processes. Changes in vegetation patterns could provide sensitive indicators of both desertification and water availability. This paper presents a methodology to use vegetation-bare soil patterns as indicators for identifying the extent, distribution and connectivity of runoff and sediment source and sink areas. During field studies it has been found that biological indicators can be used as evidence that areas are functioning as a source or sink for runoff and sediment. It has also been found that the locations of such source and sink areas are tightly linked to the spatial distribution of vegetation patches within the vegetation-bare soil mosaic. Therefore, patterns in vegetation and soil can be important indicators for ecosystem health and hillslope hydrology. Four pattern indices are introduced to describe the degree of contagion and bare area distribution within the vegetation mosaic and the degree of connectivity between different source areas. Binary pattern maps retrieved from a digital aerial photograph are used as examples to illustrate the behaviour of the indices. It is concluded that the indices yield important information on the spatial structure of the patterns studied and can be used to understand the interactions between pattern and its underlying processes.

ID PLANT DIVERSITY; COEXISTENCE
AB Question: How do lawn floras compare with those of semi-natural grasslands? Are the compositions of lawn floras determined by local, within-garden factors (e.g. lawn management and size) or by regional factors (e.g. climate and location)? Are lawn floras nested (like semi-natural grasslands) or not (like cultivated parts of gardens)? Are there gradients of species composition within lawns?
   Location: Sheffield, UK.
   Methods: We examined the composition of the floras of entire lawns and of two 1-m(2) lawn quadrats in 52 gardens.
   Results: A total of 159 species of vascular plants was recorded, 60 of them only once. Most lawn species were forbs, but most lawn cover consisted of grasses. Lawn species were predominantly natives. Bigger lawns had more species, but richness was not closely linked to other environmental or management variables. Composition of lawn floras varied with altitude, with woodland and wetland plants more common in the higher west of the city, and weeds of waste ground in the east. The species-area curve derived from 1-m(2) lawn quadrats was very similar to that of semi-natural grasslands. Lawn quadrats were significantly nested, with rarer species mostly confined to more species-rich quadrats. Trampling-tolerant Poa annua was more abundant in the part of the lawn nearer the house.
   Conclusions: In most respects, lawns behaved much more like semi-natural grasslands than like cultivated flower beds and borders. Species composition of lawns is strongly influenced by local climate. Most lawns show an internal gradient of composition, linked to a gradient of intensity of use.

AB We report a detailed analysis of the population genetic structure, mating system, and gene flow of heart of palm (Euterpe edulis Mart.-Arecaceae) in central Brazil. This palm is considered a keystone species because it supplies fruits for birds and rodents all year and is intensively harvested for culinary purposes. Two populations of this palm tree were examined, using 18 microsatellite loci. The species displays a predominantly outcrossed mating system (t(m) = 0.94), with a probability of full sibship greater than 70% within open-pollinated families. The following estimates of interpopulation genetic variation were calculated and found significant: F-IT = 0.17, F-IS = 0.12, F-ST = 0.06, and R-ST = 0.07. This low but significant level of interpopulation genetic variation indicates high levels of gene flow. Two adult trees were identified as likely seed parents (P > 99.9%) of juveniles located at a distance of 22 km. Gene flow over such distances has not been reported before for tropical tree species. The establishment and management of in situ genetic reserves or ex situ conservation and breeding populations for E. edulis should contemplate the collection of several hundreds open-pollinated maternal families from relatively few distant populations to maximize the genetic sampling of a larger number of pollen parents.

AB Genetic diversity and population genetic structure of natural Oryza rufipogon populations in China were studied based on ten microsatellite loci. For a total of 237 individuals of 12 populations collected from four regions, a moderate to high level of genetic diversity was observed at population levels with the number of alleles per locus (A) ranging from 2 to 18 (average 10.6), and polymorphic loci (P) from 40.0% to 100% (average 83.3%). The observed heterozygosity (H-O) varied from 0.163 to 0.550 with the mean of 0.332, and the expected heterozygosity (H-E) from 0.164 to 0.648 with the mean of 0.413. The level of genetic diversity for Guangxi was the highest. These results are in good agreement with previous allozyme and RAPD studies. However, it was unexpected that high genetic differentiation among populations was found (R-ST = 0.5199, theta = 0.491), suggesting that about one-half of the genetic variation existed between the populations. Differentiation (pairwise theta) was positively correlated with geographical distance (r = 0.464), as expected under the isolation by distance model. The habitat destruction and degradation throughout the geographic range of O. rufipogon may be the main factor attributed to high genetic differentiation among populations of O. rufipogon in China.

AB Here we report on a mesocom study performed to compare the top-down impact of microphagous and macrophagous zooplankton on phytoplankton. We exposed a species-rich, summer phytoplankton assemblage from the mesotrophic Lake Schohsee (Germany) to logarithmically scaled abundance gradients of the microphagous cladoceran Daphnia hyalinaxgaleata and of a macrophagous copepod assemblage. Total phytoplankton biomass, chlorophyll a and primary production showed only a weak or even insignificant response to zooplankton density in both gradients. In contrast to the weak responses of bulk parameters, both zooplankton groups exerted a strong and contrasting influence on the phytoplankton species composition. The copepods suppressed large phytoplankton, while nanoplanktonic algae increased with increasing copepod density. Daphnia suppressed small algae, while larger species compensated in terms of biomass for the losses. Autotrophic picoplankton declined with zooplankton density in both gradients. Gelatinous, colonial algae were fostered by both zooplankton functional groups, while medium-sized (ca. 3,000 mum(3)), non-gelatinous algae were suppressed by both. The impact of a functionally mixed zooplankton assemblage became evident when Daphnia began to invade and grow in copepod mesocosms after ca. 10 days. Contrary to the impact of a single functional group, the combined impact of both zooplankton groups led to a substantial decline in total phytoplankton biomass.

AB Thirteen estuaries in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, were assigned to one of four types of estuaries (river-dominated permanently open, marine-dominated permanently open, medium-sized temporarily open/closed and small temporarily open/closed), and macrobenthic zonation patterns were compared using multivariate statistics. Three major habitat zones were identified: two relating to substrate (a sand zone and a mud zone), and a third zone characterised by water of low salinity (less than or equal to2.2). These zones are inhabited by four major groups of macrobenthos. The distribution of two of these (estuarine endemic sand fauna and estuarine endemic mud fauna) is limited by the nature of the substratum, whereas the distribution of the other two (fauna originating from the marine habitat and oligohaline fauna) is limited by salinity. Estuarine endemics were present in all four types of estuaries. Marine fauna was numerically important only in permanently open systems, while oligohaline fauna was abundant only in the upper reaches of river dominated open systems. Medium-sized temporarily open/closed estuaries lacked both marine and oligohaline forms, but these were present to a limited extent in small temporarily open/closed estuaries. Hence, salinity is not the primary environmental variable determining zonation patterns in Eastern Cape estuaries, and particularly in temporarily open/closed estuaries, it is of minor importance.

AB Population genetics theory predicts that genetic drift should eliminate shared polymorphism, leading to monophyly or exclusivity of populations, when the elapsed time between lineage-splitting events is large relative to effective population size. We examined patterns of nucleotide variation in introns at four nuclear loci to relate processes affecting the history of genes to patterns of divergence among natural populations and species. Ancestral polymorphisms were shared among three recognized species, Gryllus firmus, G. pennsylvanicus, and G. ovisopis, and genealogical patterns suggest that successive speciation events occurred recently and rapidly relative to effective population size. High levels of shared polymorphism among these morphologically, behaviorally, and ecologically distinct species indicate that only a small fraction of the genome needs to become differentiated for speciation to occur. Among the four nuclear gene loci there was a 10-fold range in nucleotide diversity, and patterns of polymorphism and divergence suggest that natural selection has acted to maintain or eliminate variation at some loci. While nuclear gene genealogies may have limited applications in phylogeography or other approaches dependent on population monophyly, they provide important insights into the historical, demographic, and selective forces that shape speciation.

AB Alien species invasions have already caused substantial ecological and economic damage and will likely have even greater negative consequences in the future. Thus, it is imperative to improve our basic ecological understanding of these invasions and enhance our ability to reverse or mitigate their often devastating effects. Invasions by fire-promoting alien grasses have played a particularly important role in the destruction, of tropical dry forests and are a major reason why these ecosystems are now among the most endangered in the world. We investigated how light availability (full sun and 50% shade), alien grass control (bulldoze, herbicide, plastic mulch, and trim treatments), and native species additions (outplanting and direct-seeding) affected the establishment of native plants and the suppression of a dominant invasive bunchgrass (fountain grass, Pennisetum setaceum) within a highly degraded fenced dry forest remnant on the island of Hawaii. The percent cover of. native species increased in all light, grass control, and species addition treatments throughout the 20 mo of the experiment, and was greatest in the shade, bulldoze, and outplant treatments. Although fountain grass cover also increased over time in all grass control treatments, the three more aggressive techniques all significantly reduced grass cover relative to the more moderate trim treatment. In addition, there was a significant overall negative correlation between the final cover of fountain grass and native species, suggesting that these native species may successfully compete with fountain grass for water and/or nutrients. Outplant survival and the number of individuals established from direct-seeding differed significantly among the grass control treatments, and in each case, the response was highly species specific. Photosynthetic rates of established outplanted individuals and fountain grass did not differ significantly across most experimental environments, indicating that the local dominance of fountain grass may not be due to superior physiological attributes-The results of this experiment highlight the importance of investigating species- and treatment-specific responses before attempting larger-scale restoration projects, particularly when using rare and endangered species. This study also suggests that relatively simple techniques may be used to simultaneously establish populations of vigorous understory native species and suppress alien grasses at relatively large spatial scales, and that remnant or newly created favorable microsites may be exploited to facilitate the establishment of rarer native overstory species.

AB Understanding how the competition varies with productivity is essential for differentiating among alternative models of plant community organization. Prior attempts to explain shifts in root and shoot competition along gradients have generally assumed an additive interaction between the two competitive forms, using an experimental design which does not fully separate both above- and belowground processes. At the most basic level, few field studies have separated root and shoot competition, and we have limited knowledge about both the relative importance of these processes, and how they interact to affect plant growth in the field. Presented here are findings front a field study in which root and shoot competition were experimentally separated by using root exclusion tubes and neighbor tiebacks in an early successional community. Individuals of four species (Abutilon theophrasti, Amaranthus retroflexus, Rumex crispus, and Plantago lanceolata) were grown at two levels of fertilization with full competition, aboveground competition only, belowground competition only, or neither above- nor belowground competition. Competition was measured as competitive response, which is the natural log of the relative biomass of a target plant grown with competition compared to growth without competition. In contrast to predictions from current models of productivity-competition relationships, but in agreement with other experimental studies, there was no change in the strengths or root, shoot, or total competition with a modest increase in productivity. Despite no effect of fertilization on the strength of competition, the form of interaction between root and shoot competition varied both as a function of species identity and fertilization. For both of the rosette forming species, the combined effects of root and shoot competition were less than predicted assuming no interaction (a "negative interaction"), with one species switching from a negative to an additive interaction with fertilization. The fact that fertilization caused a shift in the root-shoot interaction, but not in the total strength of root and shoot competition, suggests that the root-shoot interaction is itself a highly labile variable. If root-shoot interactions are common in natural systems, then simply measuring the strength of one form of competition in no way provides any information about the overall importance of that competitive form to plant growth.

AB Determining the habitat requirements of a species is fundamental to effective conservation, particularly if the species is declining in areas where its habitat is being modified. Multi-scaled investigations of habitat use are essential because different selection processes may operate at different scales. I examined the habitat use of a declining woodland passerine, the rufous treecreeper (Climacteris rufa), at three spatial scales (landscape, woodland and territory) in the wheatbelt of Western Australia. Preferential habitat use was exhibited at all scales. At the landscape scale, wandoo (Eucalyptus wandoo) woodland was used at a significantly greater rate than three other common vegetation types. Territory use within woodlands was positively related to the density of hollow-bearing logs, the density of nest sites, and tree age. Within an individual territory, nest sites (hollows) were favoured if they had a spout angle of greater than or equal to50degrees to the horizontal and an entrance size of between 5 and 10 cm. The rufous treecreeper preferentially used habitat with traits characteristic of old-growth wandoo woodland. Degradation of wandoo through habitat modification (e.g. grazing, logging, fire and removal of deadwood) represents a significant threat to the persistence of treecreepers.

AB We studied the influence of extra-pair paternity on heritability estimates of morphological traits in a population of the Medium Ground Finch (Geospiza fortis) on Isla Daphne Major, Galapagos. Data from eight microsatellite loci were used to determine parentage. Six morphological traits measured on each finch were represented by two separate principal components analyses, one for the three bill measurements and one for the body size measurements. Heritabilities were calculated using weighted regressions of offspring on their parents and also offspring on their grandparents. We found that 20% of all offspring were extra-pair young but all offspring matched their mothers. Heritabilities derived from midparent-offspring regressions were all high and significantly different from zero. Removing all extra-pair young from the data set increased father-offspring regressions by an average of 21%, but mother-offspring resemblance still exceeded father-offspring resemblance by up to 42%. These results and grandparent-offspring regressions provide evidence for maternal effects, comparable in magnitude to those reported in other studies of wild birds.

AB Ecoregional differences in geology and hydrology may affect physical and chemical conditions in streams and, consequently, the species composition of algal assemblages. Stresses resulting from human disturbance, however, may constrain species membership in algal assemblages and reduce regional diversity. We expected that ecoregional differences in diatom assemblages, if they were present, would be more evident in relatively undisturbed sites than in randomly selected sites. Benthic diatom and water chemistry samples were collected from streams in 7 ecoregions of the Mid-Atlantic Highlands to evaluate correspondence between ecoregional classification and diatom assemblages. Ecoregional differences were assessed using 196 randomly selected stream sites (probability sites) and 60 sites with less disturbance by humans (reference sites). Multivariate analyses showed that significant ecoregional differences in diatom assemblages were observed only in probability sites and not in reference sites. Water chemistry was significantly different among ecoregions, both for probability sites and for reference sites. Significant differences in diatom assemblages and water chemistry were, however, evident only among ecoregions grouped by topography (i.e., montane, high plateau, and low plateau/valley). Ecoregional differences between montane regions or low plateau/valley regions were subtle. Stream sites grouped by catchments were also significantly different in water chemistry but not in diatom assemblages, both for probability sites and for reference sites. Our data suggest that diatom assemblages respond to land use, especially agricultural activities, and thus may correspond to the ecoregional classification when land use differs significantly among these ecoregions (e.g, montane vs valley ecoregions). Diatom assemblages that lack a region-specific feature may be ideal as unbiased indicators of stream water quality.

AB Architecture and leaf display were compared in saplings of six rain forest tree species differing in shade tolerance. Saplings were selected along the whole light range encountered in a forest environment. Species differed largely in realized height and crown expansion per unit support biomass, but this could not be related to differences in shade tolerance. The results demonstrate that there exist various solutions to an effective expansion of plant height and crown area. It is argued that choice of the study species and the ontogenetic trajectory regarded determine to a large extent the outcome of interspecific comparisons. No evidence was found that pioneers were characterized by a multilayered and shade tolerants by a monolayered leaf distribution. Yet, sun plants had a similar crown area, a deeper crown, and a higher leaf area index compared to shade plants and their leaves were more evenly distributed along the stem. This suggests that differences in leaf layering are found between plants growing in different light environments, rather than between species differing in shade tolerance.

AB Nest predation, if density dependent, may structure avian communities by selecting for nest-site characteristics that dilute the predators' perception of nest density (e.g., by increasing the number and types of potential nest sites) thereby reducing losses to predators. We tested for density dependent nest predation at a site dominated by predation from raccoons, Procyon lotor, and blue jays, Cyanocitta cristata. We used cohorts of 20 artificial ground nests placed on experimental grids at four densities (1.7, 7, 65, and 167 nests/ha). Predation was density dependent for one of two temporal replicates. In a second experiment, we tested for density dependent predation on both ground and shrub nests using more realistic nest densities (3.5 and 8.9 nests/ha) and excluding avian and small mammal predators by placing nylon screening over the nests. Predation was density dependent on artificial ground nests and density independent on shrub nests. Finally, we analyzed predation on natural shrub nests separating out avian (i.e., jays) and large mammalian predation based on disturbance to the depredated nest. In each of three years there was no evidence for density dependent predation. An outbreak of periodic cicadas in the first experiment and the maturation of a large mulberry crop during the second experiment demonstrated the importance of the distribution and abundance of alternative foods on the response of predators toward heterogeneity in nest abundance.

AB To examine models of evolution for Coregonus from the Central Alpine region of Europe, 20 populations from nine lakes were assessed for variation at six microsatellite DNA loci. Patterns of variation were tested against three evolutionary models: phenotypic plasticity, multiple invasions of lakes by divergent forms, and within-lake radiation of species flocks. All sympatric and all but one allopatric pairs of populations were significantly divergent in allele frequencies. Pairwise F-statistics indicated reduced gene flow among phenotypically divergent sympatric populations. These results reject the hypothesis that within-lake morphological and ecological diversity reflects phenotypic plasticity within a single gene pool. Genetic similarity was higher among forms within lakes than between populations of the same form in different lakes. Among-lake divergence was primarily a product of allele size differences. Mantel tests contrasting patterns of genetic divergence against patterns predicted from the multiple invasions and species flocks models indicated that the latter is the best explanation of the observed genetic variation. Thus, reproductively isolated species diverged within lakes, with similar patterns repeatedly emerging among lakes. While this study argues for a particular mode of evolution in Central Alpine Coregonus, the taxonomy of these forms remains unresolved.

AB We have designed an automated procedure to cut a protein into compact hydrophobic folding units. The hydrophobic units are large enough to contain tertiary non-local interactions, reflecting potential nucleation sites during protein folding. The quality of a hydrophobic folding unit is evaluated by four criteria. The first two correspond to visual characterization of a structural domain, namely, compactness and extent of isolation. We use the definition of Zehfus and Rose (Zehfus MH, Rose GD, 1986, Biochemistry 25:335-340) to calculate the compactness of a cut protein unit. The isolation of a unit is based on the solvent accessible surface area (ASA) originally buried in the interior and exposed to the solvent after cutting. The third quantity is the hydrophobicity, equivalent to the fraction of the buried non-polar ASA with respect to the total non-polar ASA. The last criterion in the evaluation of a folding unit is the number of segments it includes. To conform with the rationale of obtaining hydrophobic units, which may relate to early folding events, the hydrophobic interactions are implicitly and explicitly applied in their generation and assessment. We follow Helm and Sander (Helm L, Sander C, 1994, Proteins 19:256-268) to reduce the multiple cutting-point problem to a one-dimensional search for all reasonable trial cuts. However, as here we focus on the hydrophobic cores, the contact matrix used to obtain the first non-trivial eigenvector contains only hydrophobic contacts, rather than all, hydrophobic and hydrophilic, interactions. This dataset of hydrophobic folding units, derived from structurally dissimilar single chain monomers, is particularly useful far investigations of the mechanism of protein folding. For cases where there are kinetic data, the one or more hydrophobic folding units generated for a protein correlate with the two or with the three-state folding process observed. We carry out extensive amino acid sequence order independent structural comparisons to generate a structurally non-redundant set of hydrophobic folding units for fold recognition and for statistical purposes.

AB In the River Great Ouse, 0+ roach, bream, chub, bleak and gudgeon were each divided into three 'ecospecies' on the basis of their morphology: young larvae, old larvae and juveniles. Ecologically similar species were positively associated and dissimilar species were negatively associated. All ecospecies, except juvenile bleak preferred water <1 m deep, within 6 m of the bank with some plant cover. Habitat use was similar for all species. It is suggested that this habitat offers increased growth rate, reduced predation risk and increased food abundance to all species, and that species overlap is due to complementary habitat use rather than aggregation. During the early larval period all species fed predominantly upon rotifers and diatoms. During the late larval period there was a switch to Cladocera, primarily Chydoridae and Ceriodaphnia sp., and chironomid larvae. Species-specific dietary selection was evident during the juvenile period, with roach feeding primarily upon aufwuchs, bream upon Cladocera, chub upon Diptera, and gudgeon upon Copepoda.

AB Microhabitat preferences of brown trout and grayling were studied in the upper portion of the River Vojman, northern Sweden in 1990-1993. Microhabitat preference was quantified for open water fish during the day and at dusk and for fish residing under stones during the day. In total, measurements were made for 665 trout and 230 grayling, ranging in size from 2 . 5 to 50 cm total length. Relationships were found between most microhabitat variables and fish length. Consequently, fish were divided into three size groups for each species. For diurnally active open water fish, small brown trout and grayling preferred slower moving water with finer substrates than large brown trout and grayling. In addition, small trout preferred shallower water than large trout, whereas grayling showed no size segregation with respect to depth. Interspecific microhabitat segregation for diurnally active open water fish was pronounced, with distance to instream cover, distance to shore and depth the major segregating factors. Brown trout that occurred under stones were generally less than or equal to 12 cm in length and preferred faster mean currents than similar sized trout in the open water. Trout had stronger preferences for bedrock and slightly faster mean current velocities at dusk than during the day. Grayling did not occur under stones and relatively few individuals were observed at dusk. These results indicate that microhabitat preferences vary with body size, species and time of day. Consequently, when developing water regulation strategies it is important to maintain a broad diversity of microhabitats at different flows, at least until we know more about the mechanisms responsible for this variation in microhabitat preference.

AB All ecosystems require constituent species to survive against a backcloth of biotic and abiotic scenery. How this scenery shapes the life-history strategies of the players and how they in turn shape the scenery are important themes of the play of life. Species surviving in temperate and Arctic shelf seas do so against a scenery dominated by seasonal changes in the size-spectrum of other players. Successful survival in such an environment requires species to ride the big wave of annual productivity as it rolls through the extended size spectrum from phytoplankton to large fish. This wave flattens and broadens as it moves towards higher sizes.
   We speculate that in a seasonal shelf seas environment the wave shape is such that the Sheldon-Sutcliffe spectrum of equal biomass per log size interval is approximately true as an annual average although it may not be true at any particular moment in the year. Such spectra are structured by biomass being moved up the size spectrum mainly by predation processes, with growth of individuals being a second order process. However, the problem for an individual is to grow up through a size spectrum from its size at birth to its size at reproduction. Hence species need to find survival paths through the fluctuating scenery. This scenery is composed of the biomass of the prey, that of animals of a similar size, and larger predators. The paths followed dictate the life-history strategies of the species.
   This central problem for sea dwellers in temperate and Arctic shelf seas generates a broad similarity in the choice of life-history strategy for many key players over quite wide geographic areas of the globe. In these seas, strategies of high fecundity, high mortality and high growth rate are particularly common while strategies of low fecundity and parental care are rare for much of the size range. These seas also seem to favour longer trophic chains than terrestrial systems and either several generations per year or multiannual life cycles rather than annual cycles.

   RELATION TO BOREAL FOREST SUCCESSION
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Sympatric forest grouse in intensively managed conifer-dominated forests of the southern boreal zone in Sweden occupied different forest successional stages. Black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) selected forest stands 0 - 20 years old, hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia) selected those 20 - 50 years old, and capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) selected those greater-than-or-equal-to 90 years old. Moreover, hazel grouse also selected stands with 1 - 10% deciduous trees, whereas capercaillie selected stands with no deciduous trees. The relative numbers of each grouse species were similar in two areas of intensively managed industrial forest, but differed in an area where forestry was less intensive and where forests had old-growth characteristics, i.e., they were old and multilayered. Black grouse dominated in the intensively managed areas, whereas hazel grouse dominated in the less intensively managed area. We suggest that under natural conditions, black grouse inhabited the early-successional stages of forest following burns, hazel grouse inhabited the next, denser, successional stage and also old-growth spruce-dominated forests in fire refugia, and capercaillie inhabited stands of open, old, pine-dominated forest maintained by forest fire. The black grouse appears to be preadapted to the modern system of clearcut forest management. However, this system is clearly detrimental to the hazel grouse and capercaillie. To maintain all three species in a managed landscape, forest managers must strive to mimic more closely the natural variation in types and sizes of forest stands.

AB The abundance and composition of the submerged macrophyte seed bank in the Donana marsh (southwestern Spain) was evaluated to assess its relationship with the overlying vegetation. The results obtained demonstrate the existence of a dense seed-bank, both in terms of the number of seeds and their biomass, which represented about 10 % (5 % for angiosperms and > 20 % for Charophyta) of the total plant biomass, which ensures the maintenance of the annual submerged macrophyte populations of the seasonally inundated Donana marsh. Seed bank and established vegetation were coupled, as reflected in the existence of significant correlations between their structure and abundance. This coupling was lacking for Charophyta, whose oospores are widespread and abundant across the marsh, even at locations where they are absent, or rare, in the established vegetation. These differences between the seed bank of annual angiosperms and Charophyta appear to reflect, in part, structural differences between angiosperm seeds and Charophyta oospores, with important ecological consequences. An important aspect of these differences is the allocation of Charophyta reproductive effort to many small propagules lacking embryo storage, compared to those of angiosperms, which ensures their efficient dispersal and numerical abundance in the seed bank.

AB The central role of energy in all life processes has led to the development of numerous hypotheses, conjectures and theories on the relationships between thermodynamics and ecological processes. In this paper we examine the theoretical and empirical support for these developments, and in particular for the widely published set of thermodynamic conjectures developed by H.T. Odum, in which the maximum power principle is put forward as a generic feature of evolution in ecosystems. Although they are widely used, we argue that many of the ecological studies that have adopted the ideas encapsulated in Odum's work have done so without being aware of some of the fundamental problems underlying this approach. We discuss alternative ways in which a general available-work concept could be constructed for use as a numeraire in an energy-centered ecological theory or paradigm. In so doing, we examine what is meant by material accessibility and energy stocks and flows with respect to traditional food web and food chain theories, and relate these to results from the evolutionary dynamics of ecosystems. We conclude that the various forms and uses of energy bound up in essential ecosystem processes present a formidable obstacle to obtaining an operational definition of a general, aggregated available-work concept, a prerequisite for the systems approach of Odum and others. We also show that the prototypical derivations of the maximum power principle, and its interpretation, are contradicted on many scales both by empirical data and models, thereby invalidating the maximum power principle as a general principle of ecological evolution. The conclusions point to the fundamental problem of trying to describe ecosystems in a framework which has a one-dimensional currency.

AB We studied the effect of a severe drought on the population dynamics and community structure of grassland birds in western North Dakota. During the spring and summer of 1988 the northern Great Plains suffered one of the warmest, driest periods in its recorded history. We compared the changes in bird populations and nesting productivity over a 3-yr period before, during, and after the drought. Total grassland bird density declined 61% (P < .05) between June 1987 and June 1988. Densities of six of eight common species declined significantly during the drought. Populations of all but two species recovered in 1989 and total bird density in June 1989 did not differ significantly from June 1987. Species richness and species diversity both declined significantly during the drought and recovered to predrought levels in 1989. Species richness declined more on fair condition than on good condition range during the drought.
   Vesper Sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus) hatching success, number of young fledged per successful nest, and nesting success were significantly lower in 1988 than either 1987 or 1989. Clutch size did not differ among the three years. The decline in nesting success in 1988 was primarily due to nest abandonment during incubation. Nesting of Vesper Sparrows, Homed Larks (Eremophila alpestris), and Western Meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta) ended abruptly in mid-June 1988 during a period of extremely hot weather. In 1987 and 1989, nesting continued into July.
   Despite substantial reductions in bird density and productivity during the drought, many species recovered to predrought levels 1 yr following the drought. This suggests that year-to-year fluctuations in densities of some of these species may not be tightly linked to short-term changes in local productivity. However, sequential years of low productivity may have more substantial effects on these short-lived species. Thus, if drought conditions in North American grasslands become more frequent, as some climate models predict, there could be related changes in the avifauna of the region.

AB The feeding and ranging patterns of a troop of hanuman langurs (Presbytis entellus, Colobinae) were studied in Kanha Tiger Reserve, central Indian Highlands for 1850 hr (1981-1982), in a mosaic of moist deciduous forest and anthropogenic meadow. The location, size, and species of each tree within the 74.5-ha troop annual range was known and the phenology of all tree species was sampled. According to scan sampling, the troop spent 25.7% of the daytime feeding, with range use concentrated on an island of dry deciduous forest. Whereas adjacent troops occupied only the periphery of the focal troop's range, all-male bands occupied its center, especially during takeover and infanticidal attacks. The troop consumed items from 60 of the 67 species of trees and woody climbers available; mature leaves (34.9% of feeding time), fruits (24.4%), leaf buds (10.6%), flowers and flower buds (9.5%), young leaves (3.6%), insects (3.0%), and gum (1%). The monthly utilization of fruit, open leaf buds, and flower buds is correlated significantly with their abundance, and the troop spent significantly more time feeding and less time moving when consuming mature leaves. Comparison of tree dispersion and langur ranging patterns suggests that the distribution of the most important food trees is a major influence on their range use.

AB Ecological disturbance is fundamental to the dynamics of biological communities, yet a conceptual framework for understanding the responses of faunal communities to disturbance remains elusive. Here, I propose five principles for understanding the disturbance dynamics of ants-a globally dominant faunal group that is widely used as bioindicators in land management, which appear to have wide applicability to other taxa. These principles are as follows: (1) The most important effects of habitat disturbance on ants are typically indirect, through its effects on habitat structure, microclimate, resource availability and competitive interactions; (2) habitat openness is a key driver of variation in ant communities; (3) ant species responses to disturbance are to a large degree determined by their responses to habitat openness; (4) the same disturbance will have different effects on ants in different habitats, because of different impacts on habitat openness; and (5) ant community responses to the same disturbance will vary according to ant functional composition and biogeographical history in relation to habitat openness. I illustrate these principles using results primarily from studies of ant responses to fire, a dominant agent of disturbance globally, to provide a common disturbance currency for comparative analysis. I argue that many of the principles also apply to other faunal groups and so can be considered as general ecological "laws." As is the case for ants, many impacts of habitat disturbance on other faunal groups are fundamentally related to habitat openness, the effects of disturbance on it and the functional composition of species in relation to it.

AB Mutualistic interactions repeatedly preserved across fragmented landscapes can scale-up to form a spatial metanetwork describing the distribution of interactions across patches. We explored the structure of a bird seed-dispersal (BSD) metanetwork in 16 Neotropical forest fragments to test whether a distinct subset of BSD-interactions may mediate landscape functional connectivity. The metanetwork is interaction-rich, modular and poorly connected, showing high beta-diversity and turnover of species and interactions. Interactions involving large-sized species were lost in fragments < 10000 ha, indicating a strong filtering by habitat fragmentation on the functional diversity of BSD-interactions. Persistent interactions were performed by small-seeded, fast growing plant species and by generalist, small-bodied bird species able to cross the fragmented landscape. This reduced subset of interactions forms the metanetwork components persisting to defaunation and fragmentation, and may generate long-term deficits of carbon storage while delaying forest regeneration at the landscape level.

AB AmeriFlux scientists were early adopters of a network-enabled approach to ecosystem science that continues to transform the study of land-atmosphere interactions. In the 20 years since its formation, AmeriFlux has grown to include more than 260 flux tower sites in the Americas that support continuous observation of ecosystem carbon, water, and energy fluxes. Many of these sites are co-located within a similar climate regime, and more than 50 have data records that exceed 10 years in length. In this prospective assessment of AmeriFlux's strengths in a new era of network-enabled ecosystem science, we discuss how the longevity and spatial distribution of AmeriFlux data make them exceptionally well suited for disentangling ecosystem response to slowly evolving changes in climate and land-cover, and to rare events like droughts and biological disturbances. More recently, flux towers have also been integrated into environmental observation networks that have broader scientific goals; in North America these include the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), Critical Zone Observatory network (CZO), and Long-Term Ecological Research network (LTER). AmeriFlux stands apart from these other networks in its reliance on voluntary participation of individual sites, which receive funding from diverse sources to pursue a wide, transdisciplinary array of research topics. This diffuse, grassroots approach fosters methodological and theoretical innovation, but also challenges network-level data synthesis and data sharing to the network. While AmeriFlux has had strong ties to other regional flux networks and FLUXNET, better integration with networks like NEON, CZO and LTER provides opportunities for new types of cooperation and synergies that could strengthen the scientific output of all these networks.

AB Hybridization is increasingly recognized as a significant evolutionary process, in particular because it can lead to introgression of genes from one species to another. A striking pattern of discordance in the amount of introgression between mitochondrial and nuclear markers exists such that substantial mitochondrial introgression is often found in combination with no or little nuclear introgression. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain this discordance, including positive selection for introgressing mitochondrial variants, several types of sex-biases, drift, negative selection against introgression in the nuclear genome, and spatial expansion. Most of these hypotheses are verbal, and have not been quantitatively evaluated so far. We use individual-based, multilocus, computer simulations of secondary contact under a wide range of demographic and genetic scenarios to evaluate the ability of the different mechanisms to produce discordant introgression. Sex-biases and spatial expansions fail to produce substantial mito-nuclear discordance. Drift and nuclear selection can produce strong discordance, but only under a limited range of conditions. In contrast, selection on the mitochondrial genome produces strong discordance, particularly when dispersal rates are low. However, commonly used statistical tests have little power to detect this selection. Altogether, these results dismiss several popular hypotheses, and provide support for adaptive mitochondrial introgression.

AB Establishing trait-environment relationships has become routine in community ecology. Here, we demonstrate that the community weighted means correlation (CWM) and its parallel approach in linking trait variation to the environment, the species niche centroid correlation (SNC), have important shortcomings, arguing against their continuing application. Using mathematical derivations and simulations, we show that the two major issues are inconsistent parameter estimation and unacceptable significance rates when only the environment or only traits are structuring species distributions, but they themselves are not linked. We show how both CWM and SNC are related to the fourth-corner correlation and propose to replace all by the Chessel fourth-corner correlation, which is the fourth-corner correlation divided by its maximum attainable value. We propose an appropriate hypothesis testing procedure that is not only unbiased but also has much greater statistical power in detecting trait-environmental relationships. We derive an additive framework in which trait variation is partitioned among and within communities, which can be then modeled against the environment. We finish by presenting a contrast between methods and an application of our proposed framework across 85 lake-fish metacommunities.

AB The escalating illegal wildlife trade (IWT) is one of the most high-profile conservation challenges today. The crisis has attracted over US$350 million in donor and government funding in recent years, primarily directed at increased enforcement. There is growing recognition among practitioners and policy makers of the need to engage rural communities that neighbor or live with wildlife as key partners in tackling IWT. However, a framework to guide such community engagement is lacking. We developed a theory of change (ToC) to guide policy makers, donors, and practitioners in partnering with communities to combat IWT. We identified 4 pathways for community-level actions: strengthen disincentives for illegal behavior, increase incentives for wildlife stewardship, decrease costs of living with wildlife, and support livelihoods that are not related to wildlife. To succeed the pathways, all require strengthening of enabling conditions, including capacity building, and of governance. Our ToC serves to guide actions to tackle IWT and to inform the evaluation of policies. Moreover, it can be used to foster dialogue among IWT stakeholders, from local communities to governments and international donors, to develop a more effective, holistic, and sustainable community-based response to the IWT crisis.

AB Physiological and ecological mechanisms that define treelines are still debated. It has been suggested that the absence of trees above the treeline is caused by low temperatures that limit growth. Thus, we hypothesized that there is a critical minimum temperature (CTmin) preventing xylogenesis at treeline. We tested this hypothesis by examining weekly xylogenesis across three and four growing seasons in two natural Smith fir (Abies georgei var. smithii) treeline sites on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Despite differences in the timing of cell differentiation among years, minimum air temperature was the dominant climatic variable associated with xylem growth; the critical minimum temperature (CTmin) for the onset and end of xylogenesis occurred at 0.7 +/- 0.4 degrees C. A process-based modelling chronology of tree-ring formation using this CTmin was consistent with actual tree-ring data. This extremely low CTmin permits Smith fir growing at treeline to complete annual xylem production and maturation and provides both support and a mechanism for treeline formation.

AB Biotic homogenization goes beyond the increase in taxonomic similarity among communities. It also involves the loss of biological differences in any organizational level (e.g., populations or communities) in terms of functional, taxonomic or genetic features. There are many ways to measure biotic homogenization, and the results depend on temporal and spatial scales, the biological group, and the richness of the communities. In freshwater ecosystems, the main investigated causes of biotic homogenization correspond to the introduction of non-native species, damming, and changes in land use. However, other natural and anthropogenic causes also increase similarity among aquatic biota, such as climatic change, changes in productivity, and flood and drought events. The consequences of biotic homogenization in freshwater ecosystems are less explored than its causes, despite its severe implications, such as lesser resistant/resilient communities, loss of ecosystem functions, and higher vulnerability to diseases. Finally, biotic homogenization is a complex process that requires attention in conservation strategies, especially because forecasts suggest that freshwater biotas will continue to become more homogeneous in the future.

AB Microorganisms have shaped our planet and its inhabitants for over 3.5 billion years. Humankind has had a profound influence on the biosphere, manifested as global climate and land use changes, and extensive urbanization in response to a growing population. The challenges we face to supply food, energy, and clean water while maintaining and improving the health of our population and ecosystems are significant. Given the extensive influence of microorganisms across our biosphere, we propose that a coordinated, cross-disciplinary effort is required to understand, predict, and harness microbiome function. From the parallelization of gene function testing to precision manipulation of genes, communities, and model ecosystems and development of novel analytical and simulation approaches, we outline strategies to move microbiome research into an era of causality. These efforts will improve prediction of ecosystem response and enable the development of new, responsible, microbiome-based solutions to significant challenges of our time.

AB Range shifts are among the most ubiquitous ecological responses to anthropogenic climate change and have large consequences for ecosystems. Unfortunately, the ecophysiological forces that constrain range boundaries are poorly understood, making it difficult to mechanistically project range shifts. To explore the physiological mechanisms by which drought stress controls dry range boundaries in trees, we quantified elevational variation in drought tolerance and in drought avoidance-related functional traits of a widespread gymnosperm (ponderosa pine - Pinus ponderosa) and angiosperm (trembling aspen - Populus tremuloides) tree species in the southwestern USA. Specifically, we quantified tree-to-tree variation in growth, water stress (predawn and midday xylem tension), drought avoidance traits (branch conductivity, leaf/needle size, tree height, leaf area-to-sapwood area ratio), and drought tolerance traits (xylem resistance to embolism, hydraulic safety margin, wood density) at the range margins and range center of each species. Although water stress increased and growth declined strongly at lower range margins of both species, ponderosa pine and aspen showed contrasting patterns of clinal trait variation. Trembling aspen increased its drought tolerance at its dry range edge by growing stronger but more carbon dense branch and leaf tissues, implying an increased cost of growth at its range boundary. By contrast, ponderosa pine showed little elevational variation in drought-related traits but avoided drought stress at low elevations by limiting transpiration through stomatal closure, such that its dry range boundary is associated with limited carbon assimilation even in average climatic conditions. Thus, the same climatic factor (drought) may drive range boundaries through different physiological mechanisms - a result that has important implications for process-based modeling approaches to tree biogeography. Further, we show that comparing intraspecific patterns of trait variation across ranges, something rarely done in a range-limit context, helps elucidate a mechanistic understanding of range constraints.

AB The collaboration between laypeople and professional scientists known as "citizen science" is an important trend in research and data gathering. Citizen science offers important benefits to science and society. For example, citizens can help scientists with data collection and provide advice on research design and implementation. Citizens can also gain a better understanding of scientific concepts and methods. Additionally, citizens can help scientists better understand and address issues of concern to their families and communities. However, citizen science also raises ethical issues that should be addressed when projects begin and throughout the course of scientific investigation. To promote ethical research, scientists should develop guidelines for involvement of citizens in research, communicate effectively with participants and local communities at the outset of their involvement in research projects, carefully oversee their work, develop appropriate publication practices, and provide lay-volunteers with education and training on the responsible conduct of research. Researchers also need to be cognizant of clarifying these roles and responsibilities as well as promoting appropriate and safe citizen participation and transparency of the study methods, data analysis, and communication of results.

AB Public and stakeholder participation in environmental planning is often assumed to enhance effectiveness through improving the environmental quality of decisions and enhancing implementation. We draw on the literature on participatory environmental governance in order to derive key participation-related factors that are hypothesized to impact on decision quality and implementation. We then outline four cases of decision-making processes in local environmental planning in Germany, representing a variety of forms of public participation, and what we suggest can be seen as four different pathways to 'success' in participatory planning. The case studies, recounted on the basis of stakeholder interviews and secondary research, are subjected to a cross-case analysis in order to examine the influence of participation in each case. We consider how key participation-related factors played out across the cases, and assess both decision quality and implementation against counterfactual non-participatory, or less-participatory, scenarios. In moving beyond accounts of 'what happened', and considering how participation changed the order of things relative to 'what would have happened' under different scenarios, the research highlights how very different pathways may lead to 'success' in participatory environmental planning from the viewpoint of process organizers and planners sympathetic to environmental issues. We conclude that, given the significance of context and surprises, planners and process organizers must be open to different pathways to the successful conclusion of participatory planning processes.

AB To predict how forests will respond to rising temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentrations, we need to understand how trees respond to both of these environmental factors. In this review, we discuss the importance of scaling, moving from leaf-level responses to those of the canopy, and from short-term to long-term responses of vegetation to climate change. While our knowledge of leaf-level, instantaneous responses of photosynthesis, respiration, stomatal conductance, transpiration and water-use efficiency to elevated CO2 and temperature is quite good, our ability to scale these responses up to larger spatial and temporal scales is less developed. We highlight which physiological processes are least understood at various levels of study, and discuss how ignoring differences in the spatial or temporal scale of a physiological process impedes our ability to predict how forest carbon and water fluxes forests will be altered in the future. We also synthesize data from the literature to show that light respiration follows a generalized temperature response across studies, and that the light compensation point of photosynthesis is reduced by elevated growth CO2. Lastly, we emphasize the need to move beyond single factorial experiments whenever possible, and to combine both CO2 and temperature treatments in studies of tree performance.

AB Drought-induced forest mortality is an increasing global problem with wide-ranging consequences, yet mortality mechanisms remain poorly understood. Depletion of non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) stores has been implicated as an important mechanism in drought-induced mortality, but experimental field tests are rare. We used an ecosystem-scale precipitation manipulation experiment to evaluate leaf and twig NSC dynamics of two co-occurring conifers that differ in patterns of stomatal regulation of water loss and recent mortality: the relatively desiccation-avoiding pinon pine (Pinus edulis) and the relatively desiccation-tolerant one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma). Pinon pine experienced 72% mortality after 13-25 months of experimental drought and juniper experienced 20% mortality after 32-47 months. Juniper maintained three times more NSC in the foliage than twigs, and converted NSC to glucose and fructose under drought, consistent with osmoregulation requirements to maintain higher stomatal conductance during drought than pinon. Despite these species differences, experimental drought caused decreased leaf starch content in dying trees of both species (P<0.001). Average dry-season leaf starch content was also a good predictor of drought-survival time for both species (R-2=0.93). These results, along with observations of drought-induced reductions to photosynthesis and growth, support carbon limitation as an important process during mortality of these two conifer species.

AB Empirical phylogeographic studies have progressively sampled greater numbers of loci over time, in part motivated by theoretical papers showing that estimates of key demographic parameters improve as the number of loci increases. Recently, next-generation sequencing has been applied to questions about organismal history, with the promise of revolutionizing the field. However, no systematic assessment of how phylogeographic data sets have changed over time with respect to overall size and information content has been performed. Here, we quantify the changing nature of these genetic data sets over the past 20years, focusing on papers published in Molecular Ecology. We found that the number of independent loci, the total number of alleles sampled and the total number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per data set has improved over time, with particularly dramatic increases within the past 5years. Interestingly, uniparentally inherited organellar markers (e.g. animal mitochondrial and plant chloroplast DNA) continue to represent an important component of phylogeographic data. Single-species studies (cf. comparative studies) that focus on vertebrates (particularly fish and to some extent, birds) represent the gold standard of phylogeographic data collection. Based on the current trajectory seen in our survey data, forecast modelling indicates that the median number of SNPs per data set for studies published by the end of the year 2016 may approach similar to 20000. This survey provides baseline information for understanding the evolution of phylogeographic data sets and underscores the fact that development of analytical methods for handling very large genetic data sets will be critical for facilitating growth of the field.

AB Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) are increasingly used by ecologists to project species potential future distribution. However, the application of such models may be challenging, and some caveats have already been identified. While studies have generally shown that projections may be sensitive to the ENM applied or the emission scenario, to name just a few, the sensitivity of ENM-based scenarios to General Circulation Models (GCMs) has been often underappreciated. Here, using a multi-GCM and multi-emission scenario approach, we evaluated the variability in projected distributions under future climate conditions. We modeled the ecological realized niche (sensu Hutchinson) and predicted the baseline distribution of species with contrasting spatial patterns and representative of two major functional groups of European trees: the dwarf birch and the sweet chestnut. Their future distributions were then projected onto future climatic conditions derived from seven GCMs and four emissions scenarios using the new Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR5 report. Uncertainties arising from GCMs and those resulting from emissions scenarios were quantified and compared. Our study reveals that scenarios of future species distribution exhibit broad differences, depending not only on emissions scenarios but also on GCMs. We found that the between-GCM variability was greater than the between-RCP variability for the next decades and both types of variability reached a similar level at the end of this century. Our result highlights that a combined multi-GCM and multi-RCP approach is needed to better consider potential trajectories and uncertainties in future species distributions. In all cases, between-GCM variability increases with the level of warming, and if nothing is done to alleviate global warming, future species spatial distribution may become more and more difficult to anticipate. When future species spatial distributions are examined, we propose to use a large number of GCMs and RCPs to better anticipate potential trajectories and quantify uncertainties.

AB Allopolyploidization accounts for a significant fraction of speciation events in many eukaryotic lineages. However, existing phylogenetic and dating methods require tree-like topologies and are unable to handle the network-like phylogenetic relationships of lineages containing allopolyploids. No explicit framework has so far been established for evaluating competing network topologies, and few attempts have been made to date phylogenetic networks. We used a four-step approach to generate a dated polyploid species network for the cosmopolitan angiosperm genus Viola L. (Violaceae Batch.). The genus contains ca 600 species and both recent (neo-) and more ancient (meso-) polyploid lineages distributed over 16 sections. First, we obtained DNA sequences of three low-copy nuclear genes and one chloroplast region, from 42 species representing all 16 sections. Second, we obtained fossil-calibrated chronograms for each nuclear gene marker. Third, we determined the most parsimonious multilabeled genome tree and its corresponding network, resolved at the section (not the species) level. Reconstructing the "correct" network for a set of polyploids depends on recovering all homoeologs, i.e., all subgenomes, in these polyploids. Assuming the presence of Viola subgenome lineages that were not detected by the nuclear gene phylogenies ("ghost subgenome lineages") significantly reduced the number of inferred polyploidization events. We identified the most parsimonious network topology from a set of five competing scenarios differing in the interpretation of homoeolog extinctions and lineage sorting, based on (i) fewest possible ghost subgenome lineages, (ii) fewest possible polyploidization events, and (iii) least possible deviation from expected ploidy as inferred from available chromosome counts of the involved polyploid taxa. Finally, we estimated the homoploid and polyploid speciation times of the most parsimonious network. Homoploid speciation times were estimated by coalescent analysis of gene tree node ages. Polyploid speciation times were estimated by comparing branch lengths and speciation rates of lineages with and without ploidy shifts. Our analyses recognize Viola as an old genus (crown age 31 Ma) whose evolutionary history has been profoundly affected by allopolyploidy. Between 16 and 21 allopolyploidizations are necessary to explain the diversification of the 16 major lineages (sections) of Viola, suggesting that allopolyploidy has accounted for a high percentage-between 67% and 88%-of the speciation events at this level. The theoretical and methodological approaches presented here for (i) constructing networks and (ii) dating speciation events within a network, have general applicability for phylogenetic studies of groups where allopolyploidization has occurred. They make explicit use of a hitherto underexplored source of ploidy information from chromosome counts to help resolve phylogenetic cases where incomplete sequence data hampers network inference. Importantly, the coalescent-based method used herein circumvents the assumption of tree-like evolution required by most techniques for dating speciation events.

AB The impact of limited water and nitrogen (N) supply on maize productivity and on the utilisation efficiency of key production resources (radiation, water and N) was quantified in two field experiments during consecutive seasons in Canterbury, New Zealand. In experiment 1 crops were subjected to five N treatment rates (0-400 kg N/ha) and, in experiment 2, to three N (0 to 250 kg/ha N) and two water regimes (dryland and fully irrigated) using a rain-shelter structure. Limited N and water reduced yield and affected resource-use efficiencies. Total biomass ranged from 8 Mg DM/ha for dryland nil N crops to up to 28 Mg DM/ha for fully irrigated and N fertilised crops. Radiation use efficiency declined with N and water limitation from a maximum of 1.4 g DM/MJ to 0.6 g DM/MJ. Transpiration water use efficiency was higher in water stressed crops than irrigated crops (50-70 kg DM/ha/mm) and increased linearly with N fertilizer rates in proportion to the increase in radiation use efficiency. The crop conductance decreased from 0.19 mm/MJ in irrigated crops to 0.07 mm/MJ in dryland crops with negligible response to N fertilizer rates. Nitrogen use efficiency declined with N input rates from 100 to 150 kg DM/kg N, being inversely related to the efficiency of both water and radiation use. Dryland crops recovered 25% less N from applied fertilizer than irrigated crops. These results highlight that benchmarks of resource efficiency need to consider the level of intensification of the production system and illustrate trade-offs between yield targets and the efficiency of water and N use, that depend on the scale of analysis. To establish a balance between economic returns and environmental impacts, these trade-offs need to be managed depending on the relative values assigned to the use-efficiency of each input resource in relation to crop productivity.

AB Traits that mediate species interactions are evolutionarily shaped by biotic and abiotic drivers, yet we know relatively little about the relative importance of these factors. Herbivore pressure, along with resource availability and third-party' mutualists, are hypothesized to play a major role in the evolution of plant defence traits. Here, we used the model system Plantago lanceolata, which grows along steep elevation gradients in the Swiss Alps, to investigate the effect of elevation, herbivore pressure, mycorrhizal inoculation and temperature on plant resistance. Over a 1200 m elevation gradient, the levels of herbivory and iridoid glycosides (IGs) declined with increasing elevation. By planting seedlings at three different elevations, we further showed that both low-elevation growing conditions and mycorrhizal inoculation resulted in increased plant resistance to herbivores. Finally, using a temperature-controlled experiment comparing high- and low-elevation ecotypes, we showed that high-elevation ecotypes are less resistant to herbivory, and that lower temperatures impair IGs deployment after herbivore attack. We thus propose that both lower herbivore pressure, and colder temperatures relax the defense syndrome of high elevation plants.

AB Hybrid zones are geographic regions where differentiated taxa meet and potentially exchange genes. Increasingly, genomic analyses have demonstrated that many hybrid zones are semipermeable boundaries across which introgression is highly variable. In some cases, certain alleles penetrate across the hybrid zone in only one direction, recombining into the alternate genome. We investigated this phenomenon using genomic (genotyping-by-sequencing) and morphological (plumage reflectance spectrophotometry) analyses of the hybrid zone between two subspecies of the red-backed fairy-wren (Malurus melanocephalus) that differ conspicuously in a sexual signal, male back plumage color. Geographic cline analyses revealed a highly variable pattern of differential introgression, with many narrow coincident clines combined with several significantly wider clines, suggesting that the hybrid zone is a semipermeable tension zone. The plumage cline was shifted significantly into the genomic background of the orange subspecies, consistent with sexual selection driving asymmetrical introgression of red plumage alleles across the hybrid zone. This interpretation is supported by previous experimental work demonstrating an extra-pair mating advantage for red males, but the role of genetic dominance in driving this pattern remains unclear. This study highlights the potential for sexual selection to erode taxonomic boundaries and promote gene flow, particularly at an intermediate stage of divergence.

AB The stress-dominance hypothesis (SDH) is a model of community assembly predicting that the relative importance of environmental filtering increases and competition decreases along a gradient of increasing environmental stress. Tests of the SDH at limited spatial scales have thus far demonstrated equivocal support and no prior study has assessed the generality of the SDH at continental scales. We examined over 53 000 tree communities spanning the eastern United States to determine whether functional trait variation and phylogenetic diversity support the SDH for gradients of water and soil nutrient availability. This analysis incorporated two complementary datasets, those of the U. S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis National program and the Carolina Vegetation Survey, and was based on three ecologically important traits: leaf nitrogen, seed mass, and wood density. We found that mean trait values were weakly correlated with water and soil nutrient availability, but that trait diversity did not vary consistently along either gradient. This did not conform to trait variation expected under the SDH and instead suggested that environmental filters structure tree communities throughout both gradients, without evidence for an increased role of competition in less stressful environments. Phylogenetic diversity of communities was principally driven by the ratio of angiosperms to gymnosperms and therefore did not exhibit the pattern of variation along stress gradients expected under the SDH. We conclude that the SDH is not a general paradigm for all eastern North American tree communities, although it may operate in certain contexts.

AB Land-surface models use different formulations of stomatal conductance and plant hydraulics, and it is unclear which type of model best matches the observed surface-atmosphere water flux. We use the North American Carbon Program data set of latent heat flux (LE) measurements from 25 sites and predictions from 9 models to evaluate models' ability to resolve subdaily dynamics of transpiration. Despite overall good forecast at the seasonal scale, the models have difficulty resolving the dynamics of intradaily hysteresis. The majority of models tend to underestimate LE in the prenoon hours and overestimate in the evening. We hypothesize that this is a result of unresolved afternoon stomatal closure due to hydrodynamic stresses. Although no model or stomata parameterization was consistently best or worst in terms of ability to predict LE, errors in model-simulated LE were consistently largest and most variable when soil moisture was moderate and vapor pressure deficit was moderate to limiting. Nearly all models demonstrate a tendency to underestimate the degree of maximum hysteresis which, across all sites studied, is most pronounced during moisture-limited conditions. These diurnal error patterns are consistent with models' diminished ability to accurately simulate the natural hysteresis of transpiration. We propose that the lack of representation of plant hydrodynamics is, in part, responsible for these error patterns.

AB Repeatable behavioural traits ('personality') have been shown to covary with fitness, but it remains poorly understood how such behaviour-fitness relationships come about. We applied a multivariate approach to reveal the mechanistic pathways by which variation in exploratory and aggressive behaviour is translated into variation in reproductive success in a natural population of blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus. Using path analysis, we demonstrate a key role for provisioning behaviour in mediating the link between personality and reproductive success (number of fledged offspring). Aggressive males fed their nestlings at lower rates than less aggressive individuals. At the same time, their low parental investment was associated with increased female effort, thereby positively affecting fledgling production. Whereas male exploratory behaviour was unrelated to provisioning behaviour and reproductive success, fast-exploring females fed their offspring at higher rates and initiated breeding earlier, thus increasing reproductive success. Our findings provide strong support for specific mechanistic pathways linking components of behavioural syndromes to reproductive success. Importantly, relationships between behavioural phenotypes and reproductive success were obscured when considering simple bivariate relationships, underlining the importance of adopting multivariate views and statistical tools as path analysis to the study of behavioural evolution.

AB Other than some classical ideas, large-scale approaches to understand variation in organismal traits (or the trait composition of an ecological community) across stream ecosystems are rather recent. Recent case studies and review papers show clear evidence for the usefulness of trait-based analyses in bioassessment, but how community traits vary along natural gradients at large scales has not yet been synthesised. Here, we attempt to fill this gap by providing a synthesis of trait patterns of stream communities from a macroecological perspective. We argue that although both natural and anthropogenic filters shape community traits, examination of poorly understood natural filters, including those acting at large scales, should receive increasing attention. Such knowledge is vital for reliably inferring anthropogenic impacts on stream communities and ecosystems. We synthesise knowledge of two large-scale spatial patterns of stream communities: among drainage basins (i.e. geographical variation) and within drainage basins (i.e. longitudinal variation). We also examine the temporal dimension of organismal traits. Our review highlights clear evidence for large-scale influences on the trait composition in stream systems. For example, despite previous contentions that organismal traits should vary negligibly across large geographical gradients, there is actually clear geographical variation across near-pristine systems. Furthermore, in accordance with theory, organismal traits in actual data sets vary along the longitudinal gradient of stream systems. We provide an overview of empirical and statistical approaches to understanding the trait composition of stream communities in macroecological studies and conclude that the methodology should be carefully considered in comparisons among studies, because contrasting results may reflect not only ecological differences but also differences in methodology (e.g. choice of species traits, trait quantification and analytical methods). We conclude that the question of how the trait composition of stream communities varies along geographical and environmental gradients is far from settled. A challenge for large-scale stream ecology is to provide a more specific view of trait variation in multiple taxonomic groups (e.g. do traits vary similarly in different organisms groups?), along major environmental gradients (e.g. is trait variation similar along the same environmental gradients in different regions?) and among different regional entities (e.g. do the traits vary, on average, among different regions?).

AB The bark beetles of the genus Dendroctonus feed on phloem that is a nitrogen-limited source. Nitrogen fixation and nitrogen recycling may compensate or alleviate such a limitation, and beetle-associated bacteria capable of such processes were identified. Raoultella terrigena, a diazotrophic bacteria present in the gut of Dendroctonus rhizophagus and D. valens, exhibited high acetylene reduction activity in vitro with different carbon sources, and its nifH and nifD genes were sequenced. Bacteria able to recycle uric acid were Pseudomonas fluorescens DVL3A that used it as carbon and nitrogen source, Serratia proteomaculans 2A CDF and Rahnella aquatilis 6-DR that used uric acid as sole nitrogen source. Also, this is the first report about the uric acid content in whole eggs, larvae, and adults (male and female) samples of the red turpentine beetle (Dendroctonus valens). Our results suggest that the gut bacteria of these bark beetles could contribute to insect N balance.

AB Since the 1970s, increase in fire frequency has been observed in all European Mediterranean regions. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the effects of wildfire frequency on the recovery at short- and long-term of soil chemical and microbial properties and (2) to identify the mechanisms underlying the recovery of these sites properties. Soils from 17 plots (Maures mountains range, Var, France) were classified into 5 wildfire regimes (i.e. not burned since at least 57 years ago, infrequently and frequently burned-with time since fire between 4 and 17 years). Soil samples from these plots were analysed for their nutrient content, chemical functions of soil organic matter (SOM) using FT-MIR spectroscopy and microbial mineralising activities. Our results showed that the frequent wildfire regime slowed down the recovery in the short term of SOM spectroscopic properties and nutrient availability. Both low quantity and low quality (i.e. high percentage of aromatic and phenolic organic forms) of soil organic matter were found to be related to soil microbial recovery at 4 years after frequent wildfires. The frequent wildfires improved the recovery in net nitrification and nitrate content, leading to an increase in catabolic evenness and a recovery in microbial C-substrate utilisation profiles between 4 and 17 years. However, frequent wildfires slowed down the recovery of hydrolytic enzyme pool (i.e. FDA hydrolases) and phenol oxidase activity, both involved in soil C cycling. Overall, our observations suggest that 4 fires in 50 years is a threshold beyond which soil quality may be endangered. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We investigated here the demographical history of Tabebuia impetiginosa (Bignoniaceae) to understand the dynamics of the disjunct geographical distribution of South American seasonally dry forests (SDFs), based on coupling an ensemble approach encompassing hindcasting species distribution modelling and statistical phylogeographical analysis. We sampled 17 populations (280 individuals) in central Brazil and analysed the polymorphisms at chloroplast (trnS-trnG, psbA-trnH, and ycf6-trnC intergenic spacers) and nuclear (ITS nrDNA) genomes. Phylogenetic analyses based on median-joining network showed no haplotype sharing among population but strong evidence of incomplete lineage sorting. Coalescent analyses showed historical constant populations size, negligible gene flow among populations, and an ancient time to most recent common ancestor dated from 4.7 +/- 1.1 Myr BP. Most divergences dated from the Lower Pleistocene, and no signal of important population size reduction was found in coalescent tree and tests of demographical expansion. Demographical scenarios were built based on past geographical range dynamic models, using two a priori biogeographical hypotheses (Pleistocene Arc and Amazonian SDF expansion) and on two additional hypotheses suggested by the palaeodistribution modelling built with several algorithms for distribution modelling and palaeoclimatic data. The simulation of these demographical scenarios showed that the pattern of diversity found so far for T. impetiginosa is in consonance with a palaeodistribution expansion during the last glacial maximum (LGM, 21 kyr BP), strongly suggesting that the current disjunct distribution of T. impetiginosa in SDFs may represent a climatic relict of a once more wide distribution.

TI Gaps in Border Controls Are Related to Quarantine Alien Insect Invasions
   in Europe

   INTERCEPTIONS; DISPERSAL; TRANSPORT; ENTRY; PLANT
AB Alien insects are increasingly being dispersed around the world through international trade, causing a multitude of negative environmental impacts and billions of dollars in economic losses annually. Border controls form the last line of defense against invasions, whereby inspectors aim to intercept and stop consignments that are contaminated with harmful alien insects. In Europe, member states depend on one another to prevent insect introductions by operating a first point of entry rule - controlling goods only when they initially enter the continent. However, ensuring consistency between border control points is difficult because there exists no optimal inspection strategy. For the first time, we developed a method to quantify the volume of agricultural trade that should be inspected for quarantine insects at border control points in Europe, based on global agricultural trade of over 100 million distinct origin-commodity-species-destination pathways. This metric was then used to evaluate the performance of existing border controls, as measured by border interception results in Europe between 2003 and 2007. Alarmingly, we found significant gaps between the trade pathways that should be inspected and actual number of interceptions. Moreover, many of the most likely introduction pathways yielded none or very few insect interceptions, because regular interceptions are only made on only a narrow range of pathways. European countries with gaps in border controls have been invaded by higher numbers of quarantine alien insect species, indicating the importance of proper inspections to prevent insect invasions. Equipped with an optimal inspection strategy based on the underlying risks of trade, authorities globally will be able to implement more effective and consistent border controls.

AB Fire is a major force driving the evolution of plants and the structure and function of ecosystems globally. It thus likely operates as an important environmental filter that selects for species that have evolved to tolerate and depend on fire. Across a 40-year experimental fire gradient from frequently burned open savanna to unburned dense woodland in Minnesota, USA, we examined the relationships among community assembly, evolutionary history, and functional trait composition. Close relatives had similar abundance patterns across the fire gradient, providing evidence for phylogenetic conservatism in fire adaptation and highlighting the importance of shared ancestry in predicting species responses to fire.
   Phylogenetic beta diversity was greatest between the most extreme fire treatments across the gradient, indicating that species in the most contrasting fire regimes were most distantly related. Fire strongly influenced diversity, co-occurrence patterns, and leaf trait means and variances within communities. The most frequently burned communities had the highest species richness, exhibited the most resource-conservative leaf traits, and spanned the greatest number of phylogenetic lineages but harbored more close relatives within those lineages than other communities. In contrast, unburned communities had the lowest species diversity, the most acquisitive leaf traits, and the fewest phylogenetic lineages, but close relatives co-occurred less frequently. The largest difference in abundance between treatments occurred within the Rosales, Asteraceae, Vitaceae, and the Poaceae; woody Rosales were strongly selected for in unburned communities, while composites and grasses of the Poaceae were strongly selected for under frequent burning.
   A major climatic perturbation of consecutive hot, dry summers in the late 1980s prompted a significant shift in the functional and phylogenetic composition of communities. Greater than expected turnover in species composition occurred following the drought years, and then again during the subsequent five-year rebound period. Just after the drought year, turnover was greatest among recently diverged taxa, whereas during the rebound period turnover was greater among taxa that diverged deep in the phylogeny. The drought years also caused a short-term shift in functional traits, including declines in specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen content and an increase in leaf length. These results indicate that the phylogenetic and functional trait composition of communities are responsive both to fire gradients and to shocks to the system, such as climatic perturbation.

AB Understanding the interplay between environmental factors contributing to treeline formation and how these factors influence different life stages remains a major research challenge. We used an afforestation experiment including 92 000 trees to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of tree mortality and growth at treeline in the Swiss Alps. Seedlings of three high-elevation conifer species (Larix decidua, Pinus mugo ssp. uncinata, and Pinus cembra) were systematically planted along an altitudinal gradient at and above the current treeline (2075 to 2230 m above sea level [a.s.l.]) in 1975 and closely monitored during the following 30 years. We used decision-tree models and generalized additive models to identify patterns in mortality and growth along gradients in elevation, snow duration, wind speed, and solar radiation, and to quantify interactions between the different variables. For all three species, snowmelt date was always the most important environmental factor influencing mortality, and elevation was always the most important factor for growth over the entire period studied. Individuals of all species survived at the highest point of the afforestation for more than 30 years, although mortality was greater above 2160 m a.s.l., 50-100 m above the current treeline. Optimal conditions for height growth differed from those for survival in all three species: early snowmelt (ca. day of year 125-140 [where day 1 is 1 January]) yielded lowest mortality rates, but relatively later snowmelt (ca. day 145-150) yielded highest growth rates. Although snowmelt and elevation were important throughout all life stages of the trees, the importance of radiation decreased over time and that of wind speed increased. Our findings provide experimental evidence that tree survival and height growth require different environmental conditions and that even small changes in the duration of snow cover, in addition to changes in temperature, can strongly impact tree survival and growth patterns at treeline. Further, our results show that the relative importance of different environmental variables for tree seedlings changes during the juvenile phase as they grow taller.

AB Does hybridization play a broad innovative role in evolution? Many studies have shown hybrid origins of individual species, particularly in major adaptive radiations, but this may be a consequence, rather than a cause, of the existence of many closely related species. Cases of hybridization in the early stages of major adaptive radiations are comparatively rare. Here, we report phylogenetic evidence for ancient introgression between distinct lineages of the species-rich Lake Malawi haplochromine cichlid fishes. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences indicated surprisingly close relationships between the shallow-water rocky habitat "Mbuna" species and a group of dark-adapted "Deep-Benthic" species specialized for feeding in low-light conditions (dawn/dusk, under overhangs, and deep water). By contrast, analyses of nuclear amplified fragment length polymorphism data demonstrated that these Deep-Benthic cichlids were more closely related to shallow water "Shallow-Benthic" soft-sediment feeders, a group that shares similar head and body morphology. A coalescent-based computer simulation indicated that the mtDNA similarity of rocky habitat Mbuna species and dark-adapted Deep-Benthic species was due to hybridization rather than incomplete lineage sorting. Comparisons of morphology indicated that some Deep-Benthic species possessed novel morphology not present in other Lake Malawi species groups. Thus, these analyses support the hypothesis that ancient hybridization occurred within the Lake Malawi cichlid radiation, that the event occurred before the radiation of a species group adapted to low-light benthic habitats, and that this group went on to dominate the deep-water regions of Lake Malawi. The results of this study contribute to a growing literature consistent with a creative role of hybridization in the evolution of species diversity and adaptive radiations.

AB Satellite-based measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; an index of vegetation greenness and photosynthetic capacity) indicate that tundra environments are generally greening and becoming more productive as climates warm in the Arctic. The greening, however, varies and is even negative in some parts of the Arctic. To help interpret the space-based observations, the International Polar Year (IPY) Greening of the Arctic project conducted ground-based surveys along two >1500 km transects that span all five Arctic bioclimate subzones. Here we summarize the climate, soil, vegetation, biomass, and spectral information collected from the North America Arctic transect (NAAT), which has a more continental climate, and the Eurasia Arctic transect (EAT), which has a more oceanic climate. The transects have broadly similar summer temperature regimes and overall vegetation physiognomy, but strong differences in precipitation, especially winter precipitation, soil texture and pH, disturbance regimes, and plant species composition and structure. The results indicate that summer warmth and NDVI increased more strongly along the more continental transect.

AB Recent studies suggest that selection can allow coexistence in situations where ecological dynamics lead to competitive exclusion, provided that there is a trade-off between traits optimal for interacting with conspecifics and traits optimal for interacting with heterospecifics. Despite compelling empirical evidence, there is no general framework for elucidating how and when selection will allow coexistence in natural communities. Here we develop such a framework for a mechanism that we term "neighbor-dependent selection." We show that this mechanism can both augment coexistence when ecological conditions allow for niche partitioning and enable coexistence when ecological conditions lead to competitive exclusion. The novel insight is that when ecological conditions lead to exclusion, neighbor-dependent selection can allow coexistence via cycles driven by an intransitive loop; selection causes one species to be a superior interspecific competitor when it is rare and an inferior interspecific competitor when it is abundant. Our framework predicts the conditions under which selection can enable coexistence, as opposed to merely augmenting it, and elucidates the effects of heritability on the eco-evolutionary feedbacks that drive coexistence. Given increasing evidence that evolution operates on ecological timescales, our approach provides one means for evaluating the role of selection and trait evolution in species coexistence.

AB Question
   Which weed traits respond to the community assembly filters imposed by cropping regimes and how do they respond? Which crop characteristics (traits or aspects of field management) represent the strongest filters on weed traits?
   Location
   France.
   Methods
   In 561 arable fields, we measured associations between crop characteristics and (i) mean values of quantitative weed traits at each site and (ii) composition of optimally defined weed functional types, based on both qualitative and quantitative weed traits and typologies. The crop characteristics included crop height, propagule size, family and sowing date; we also used basic types (winter wheat, maize, etc.) for comparison.
   Results
   Crop sowing date was strongly related to many weed traits, whereas crop type was not the strongest predictor of any trait. With later sowing of crops, weeds started flowering later, germinated later and had shorter flowering periods. Sowing date was also associated with the distribution of Raunkiaer life forms, while crop architecture was associated with the distribution of weed heights and a C-S-R classification.
   Conclusions
   Cropping regimes can usefully be summarized by the crop sowing date. Phenological traits of weeds as well as classifications based on life form and C-S-R are important descriptors of weed community composition. Such findings may help predict the effects of particular crop rotations, novel crop varieties and invasive weed species.

AB Weather and climate simulations are critically dependent on an accurate representation of land surface exchange processes. The present study tests the performance of the Noah land surface model (LSM) for energy partitioning and soil water dynamics on a winter wheat stand in southwest Germany. The model was parameterized field-specifically, i.e., data on leaf area index, green vegetation fraction, albedo, and soil texture were derived from measurements, and tested against a set of eddy covariance (EC) and soil water data collected in the 2009 season. With respect to energy partitioning, the field-specific parameterization performed fairly well during the main vegetation period. During ripening, starting in mid-July until harvest on 6 August, however, the sensible heat flux was distinctly underestimated. In August, the bias increased to -105.5 W m(-2). As a consequence, evapotranspiration was overestimated during this period. After introducing a time-variable minimum stomata! resistance (R-c,R-min), the model performed much better. The model also delivered acceptable results during crop maturing. The Noah LSM was unable to simulate the observed soil water dynamics. While the measured soil water content profiles showed a distinct gradient with depth, the Noah LSM tended to deplete the soil profile uniformly.
   Our study shows that for cereal-dominated croplands phenology and crop development play a crucial role in energy partitioning, especially during the ripening stage. Disregarding the dynamics of the physiological properties of the crops in the Noah LSM leads to significant bias in energy partitioning. Finally, we critically discuss the current approach to correct measured EC flux data for the energy residual based on the Bowen ratio with regard to LSM calibration and performance.

AB An ecosystem is a complex composition of physical, chemical and biological components. This complex system remains in a healthy state if the system can maintain the ecological equilibrium among its components. Anthropogenic disturbances are the prime stressors that affect this equilibrium through creating fragmentation, ecosystem sensitivity, loosening landscape connectivity and disrupting ecological integrity. As different types of ecosystem are interconnected, a comprehensive monitoring and evaluating criteria is needed for measuring its integrity at regional level for conservation planning. A Regional Index of Ecological Integrity can be a suitable approach for sustainable management of regional ecosystem. Therefore, this paper presents (i) the characteristics of ecological integrity, (ii) the spatial processes induced by anthropogenic stressors and (iii) an approach to develop a composite Regional Index of Ecological Integrity (RIEI). The prime objective is to establish a thought and a way to develop a composite index of ecological integrity at the regional level. Here, we demonstrate different compositional, structural and functional indicators/indices related to fragmentation, representativeness of protected area, ecosystem sensitivity, and landscape connectivity for the development of a Regional Index of Ecological Integrity (RIEI).

AB 1. Surprisingly little is known about the relationship between functional traits and demographic rates of tree species under field conditions, particularly for non-tropical species.
   2. We studied the interspecific relationship between key functional traits (wood density (WD), maximum tree height, specific leaf area, nitrogen (N) content of leaves, leaf size and seed mass), demographic rates (relative growth rate (RGR) and mortality rate (MR)) and climatic niche for the 44 most abundant tree species in Spain.
   3. Demographic data were derived from the Spanish Forest Inventory, a repeated-measures scheme including c. 90 000 permanent plots spread over a territory of c. 500 000 km 2. Functional traits data came primarily from a more detailed forest inventory carried out in Catalonia, NE Spain.
   4. Our study region covers a wide range of climatic conditions and, not surprisingly, the studied species differed markedly in their climatic niche. Despite that fact, our results showed that the variability in demographic rates across species was much more related to differences in functional traits than to differences in the average climate among species.
   5. Maximum tree height and, particularly, WD, emerged as key functional traits, and were the best predictors of demographic rates in our study. These two variables also mediated the marginally significant relationship between RGR and MR, suggestive of a weak trade-off between growth and survival.
   6. The main aspects of our results were not altered by the explicit incorporation of phylogenetic effects, suggesting that the observed relationships are not due to divergences between a few major clades.
   7. Synthesis. Our study gives support to the notion that variation in functional traits across species allows them to perform largely independently of climatic conditions along environmental gradients.

AB Birdsong is a well-known sexually selected trait that plays a major role in female choice and male e male interactions. Although birdsong has been studied for many years, it has only recently been suggested that it is a multifaceted signal that could encompass multiple sexually selected traits. According to the theories on the evolution and maintenance of multiple sexually selected signals, the different components of birdsong may signal multiple, redundant or unreliable information on male quality. We used a cross-sectional approach to examine whether the expression of song in the great tit was differentially related to any of three measures of quality: age, condition and survival. We analysed several informative characteristics in great tit song concerning diversity, output, performance and consistency to see whether different traits were simultaneously related to the studied quality parameters, or if, in contrast, each song trait was related to only one of the measures of quality. Song consistency and repertoire size were strongly related to only one of the studied parameters (age and survival, respectively), indicating that different song traits signal specific quality characteristics, and providing, therefore, evidence to support the multiple-signal hypothesis. Moreover, measures of song performance and song output (phrase and strophe rate) correlated positively with repertoire size, which might indicate that, at the same time, great tit song is signalling redundant information. In addition, some song characteristics did not correlate with any of the quality parameters measured, suggesting that those song traits might provide unreliable information.

AB We analyzed patterns of paternity and male dominance rank in the Sonso community of wild East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in the Budongo Forest, Uganda. Our major objective was to determine whether and how social rank influenced paternity success. We successfully genotyped 52 individuals at up to nine microsatellite loci, using DNA extracted from fecal samples. Of 24 offspring analyzed, we identified sires for 21. Paternity success was significantly correlated with social rank, with alpha males siring a disproportionate number of offspring. However, both middle- and low-ranking males also fathered offspring, and the priority-of-access model provided a relatively poor prediction of which males would be successful and under what circumstances. The concentration of paternities among only seven males and the tendency for high-ranking males to sire offspring of multiparous females suggest that both individual variation in male quality and the resource value of particular females may be mediating factors. In comparison with other chimpanzee studies, our results support the hypothesis that larger male cohort size reduces the ability of the alpha male to monopolize females, though within our study, male number did not affect the success of the alpha. Successful sires were not necessarily those who achieved the highest mating success with the females whose offspring they sired, but were those who demonstrated higher investment by spending significantly more time in association with these females. Finally, we estimate extra-group paternity at 0-5%, supporting other evidence that the community serves as the primary reproductive unit in chimpanzees. Am J Phys Anthropol 142:417-428, 2010.

AB P>1. The issue of freshwater species being threatened by invasion has become central in conservation biology because inland waters exhibit the highest species richness per unit area, but apparently have the highest extinctions rates on the planet.
   2. In this article, we evaluated the effects of an exotic, invasive aquatic grass (Urochloa subquadripara- tropical signalgrass) on the diversity and assemblage composition of native macrophytes in four Neotropical water bodies (two reservoirs and two lakes). Species cover was assessed in quadrats, and plant biomass was measured in further quadrats, located in sites where tropical signalgrass dominated (D quadrats) and sites where it was not dominant or entirely absent (ND quadrats). The effects of tropical signalgrass on macrophyte species richness, Shannon diversity and number of macrophyte life forms (a surrogate of functional richness) were assessed through regressions, and composition was assessed with a DCA. The effects of tropical signalgrass biomass on the likelihood of occurrence of specific macrophyte life forms were assessed through logistic regression.
   3. Tropical signalgrass had a negative effect on macrophyte richness and Shannon and functional diversity, and also influenced assemblage composition. Emergent, rooted with floating stems and rooted submersed species were negatively affected by tropical signalgrass, while the occurrence of free-floating species was positively affected.
   4. Our results suggest that competition with emergent species and reduction of underwater radiation, which reduces the number of submersed species, counteract facilitation of free-floating species, contributing to a decrease in plant diversity. In addition, homogenisation of plant assemblages shows that tropical signalgrass reduces the beta diversity in the macrophyte community.
   5. Although our results were obtained at fine spatial scales, they are cause for concern because macrophytes are an important part of freshwater diversity.

AB Aim To describe the phylogeographic patterns of the black rat, Rattus rattus, from islands in the western Indian Ocean where the species has been introduced (Madagascar and the neighbouring islands of Reunion, Mayotte and Grande Comore), in comparison with the postulated source area (India).
   Location Western Indian Ocean: India, Arabian Peninsula, East Africa and the islands of Madagascar, Reunion, Grande Comore and Mayotte.
   Methods Mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome b, tRNA and D-loop, 1762 bp) was sequenced for 71 individuals from 11 countries in the western Indian Ocean. A partial D-loop (419 bp) was also sequenced for eight populations from Madagascar (97 individuals), which were analysed in addition to six previously published populations from southern Madagascar.
   Results Haplotypes from India and the Arabian Peninsula occupied a basal position in the phylogenetic tree, whereas those from islands were distributed in different monophyletic clusters: Madagascar grouped with Mayotte, while Reunion and Grand Comore were present in two other separate groups. The only exception was one individual from Madagascar (out of 190) carrying a haplotype that clustered with those from Reunion and South Africa. 'Isolation with migration' simulations favoured a model with no recurrent migration between Oman and Madagascar. Mismatch distribution analyses dated the expansion of Malagasy populations on a time-scale compatible with human colonization history. Higher haplotype diversity and older expansion times were found on the east coast of Madagascar compared with the central highlands.
   Main conclusions Phylogeographic patterns supported the hypothesis of human-mediated colonization of R. rattus from source populations in either the native area (India) or anciently colonized regions (the Arabian Peninsula) to islands of the western Indian Ocean. Despite their proximity, each island has a distinct colonization history. Independent colonization events may have occurred simultaneously in Madagascar and Grande Comore, whereas Mayotte would have been colonized from Madagascar. Reunion was colonized independently, presumably from Europe. Malagasy populations may have originated from a single successful colonization event, followed by rapid expansion, first in coastal zones and then in the central highlands. The congruence of the observed phylogeographic pattern with human colonization events and pathways supports the potential relevance of the black rat in tracing human history.

AB We asked the following question: Is the lack of attention given to testate amoebae, and other protists, in studies of nutrient cycling justified by their relative unimportance or are we ignoring key players in nutrient cycling and other ecological processes? We review various aspects of the ecology of testates relevant to their role in nutrient cycling. These include their food sources, their population sizes and production ecology, the rate of test breakdown ( and hence recycling of material from testates to other organisms) and non-feeding interactions with other organisms (e.g., mychorrhizae). Much of the relevant published literature dates from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, presumably due to the interest in production ecology and other aspects of ecosystem ecology at this time. There was a reduction in relevant research during the 1980s and 1990s, but there has recently been signs of renewed interest in this area. In addition to reviewing the past literature we suggest new speculations about the role of the evolution of grasses and the rise of the euglyphid testates-mediated by the silica cycle. Our main conclusion is that we currently do not know enough to answer our question about their potential importance! However, there are hints in these data which suggest that testates may be important and should be targeted by future research. Some of the main questions that should be targeted are outlined.

AB Background: For decades cichlid fishes (Perciformes: Cichlidae) of the East African cichlid radiations (Teleostei: Cichlidae) have served as natural experimental subjects for the study of speciation processes and the search for potential speciation key factors. Despite numerous phylogenetic studies dealing with their intragroup relationships, surprisingly little is known about the phylogenetic placement and time of origin of this enigmatic group. We used multilocus DNA-sequence data from five nuclear and four mitochondrial genes and refined divergence time estimates to fill this knowledge gap.
   Results: In concordance with previous studies, the root of the East African cichlid radiations is nested within the so called "Tilapias", which is a paraphyletic assemblage. For the first time, we clarified tilapiine intragroup relationships and established three new monophyletic groups:"Oreochromini", "Boreotilapiini" and a group with a distribution center in East/Central Africa, the "Austrotilapiini". The latter is the founder lineage of the East African radiations and emerged at the Miocene/Oligocene boundary at about 14 to 26 mya.
   Conclusion: Our results provide the first resolved hypothesis for the phylogenetic placement of the megadiverse East African cichlid radiations as well as for the world's second most important aquaculture species, the Nile Tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. Our analyses constitute not only a robust basis for African cichlid phylogenetics and systematics, but provide a valid and necessary framework for upcoming comparative phylogenomic studies in evolutionary biology and aquaculture.

AB Recent studies show that intraspecific genetic variation in asexual species may have large effects on community and ecosystem functions, increasing their stability, productivity, and species richness. However, major questions regarding its population-level impact remain empirically unanswered: (a) How does intraspecific genetic diversity affect the ecological characteristics of sexual species, in which recombination can alter the outcome of causal mechanisms such as selection and niche diversification? (b) Does genetic diversity increase population dynamic stability? (c) Is the impact of genetic diversity dependent on the selective environment? To answer these questions, I founded replicate flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) populations with different degrees of ecologically relevant, heritable trait variation and monitored their dynamics for approximately eight generations. I show that population stability and persistence increased with greater genetic variation but that the stabilizing effect was independent of the selective habitat (different proportions of ancestral and novel resources). Alleles from a single founding strain underwent a selective sweep in the homogeneous ancestral habitat but not in a novel heterogeneous habitat. These results expand current understanding of the ecological impacts of genetic diversity by showing that genetically more diverse sexual populations persist longer and are more stable but that the selective environment determines the mechanistic basis of increased stability.

AB Determining the relative roles of vicariance and selection in restricting gene flow between populations is of central importance to the evolutionary process of population divergence and speciation. Here we use molecular and morphological data to contrast the effect of isolation (by mountains and geographical distance) with that of ecological factors (altitudinal gradients) in promoting differentiation in the wedge-billed woodcreeper, Glyphorynchus spirurus, a tropical forest bird, in Ecuador. Tarsus length and beak size increased relative to body size with altitude on both sides of the Andes, and were correlated with the amount of moss on tree trunks, suggesting the role of selection in driving adaptive divergence. In contrast, molecular data revealed a considerable degree of admixture along these altitudinal gradients, suggesting that adaptive divergence in morphological traits has occurred in the presence of gene flow. As suggested by mitochondrial DNA sequence data, the Andes act as a barrier to gene flow between ancient subspecific lineages. Genome-wide amplified fragment length polymorphism markers reflected more recent patterns of gene flow and revealed fine-scale patterns of population differentiation that were not detectable with mitochondrial DNA, including the differentiation of isolated coastal populations west of the Andes. Our results support the predominant role of geographical isolation in driving genetic differentiation in G. spirurus, yet suggest the role of selection in driving parallel morphological divergence along ecological gradients.

AB Global food and feed demands have been projected to double in the 21st century, which will further increase the pressure on the use of land, water and nutrients. At the same time, the political decisions to support renewable energy sources are accelerating the use of biomass, including grain, sugar, oilseed, and lignocellulosic crops for biofuel and power generation. Government directives - incited by climate change, high oil prices and geo-political tensions - promote partial replacement of fossil fuel by biofuels. Prices and availability of commodities used as staple food and feed are becoming already affected by the growing demand for bioenergy. Many implications of this demand for biofuel on the resource base (land, water, biodiversity), environment, rural economy, food prices and social impacts are unknown. The present study reviews and discusses the opportunities and limits of crops and resources for food, feed and biofuel production. There are gaps in our knowledge regarding the global capacity for sustainable plant-based bioenergy production, while maintaining food security; commercial biomass production will compete with food crops for arable land and scarce fresh water resources. The rapidly growing demand for food, feed and fuel will require a combination of further increases in crop yields (ca. 2% per annum) and a doubling or tripling of resource-use efficiencies, especially of nitrogen-use efficiency and water productivity in production systems with high external inputs, over the next 20 to 30 years. Adaptation of cropping systems to climate change and a better tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses by genetic improvement and by managing diverse cropping systems in a sustainable way will be of key importance. An integrated assessment of resource-use efficiencies, ecological services and economic profitability may guide the choice of crop species and cultivars to be grown in a target environment and region, depending on the added value for specific purposes: food, feed or fuel. To avoid negative impacts on food security, governments should give high priority to 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation technologies for bioenergy.

AB One of the major concerns about global warming is the potential for an increase in decomposition and soil respiration rates, increasing CO2 emissions and creating a positive feedback between global warming and soil respiration. This is particularly important in ecosystems with large belowground biomass, such as grasslands where over 90% of the carbon is allocated belowground. A better understanding of the relative influence of climate and litter quality on litter decomposition is needed to predict these changes accurately in grasslands. The Long-Term Intersite Decomposition Experiment Team (LIDET) dataset was used to evaluate the influence of climatic variables (temperature, precipitation, actual evapotranspiration, and climate decomposition index), and litter quality (lignin content, carbon : nitrogen, and lignin : nitrogen ratios) on leaf and root decomposition in the US Great Plains. Wooden dowels were used to provide a homogeneous litter quality to evaluate the relative importance of above and belowground environments on decomposition. Contrary to expectations, temperature did not explain variation in root and leaf decomposition, whereas precipitation partially explained variation in root decomposition. Percent lignin was the best predictor of leaf and root decomposition. It also explained most variation in root decomposition in models which combined litter quality and climatic variables. Despite the lack of relationship between temperature and root decomposition, temperature could indirectly affect root decomposition through decreased litter quality and increased water deficits. These results suggest that carbon flux from root decomposition in grasslands would increase, as result of increasing temperature, only if precipitation is not limiting. However, where precipitation is limiting, increased temperature would decrease root decomposition, thus likely increasing carbon storage in grasslands. Under homogeneous litter quality, belowground decomposition was faster than aboveground and was best predicted by mean annual precipitation, which also suggests that the high moisture in soil accelerates decomposition belowground.

AB Biological invasions severely impact native plant communities, causing dramatic shifts in species composition and the restriction of native species to spatially isolated refuges. Competition from resident species and the interaction between resource limitation and competition have been overlooked as mechanisms of community resistance in refugia habitats. We examined the importance of these factors in determining the resistance of California serpentine plant communities to invasion by three common European grasses, Avena barbata, Bromus diandrus, and Hordeum murinum. We added seeds of each of these grasses to plots subjected to six levels of resource addition (N, P, Ca, H2O, all resources together, and a no-addition control) and two levels of competition (with resident community present or removed). Resource limitation and competition had strong effects on the biomass and reproduction of the three invaders. The addition of all resources together combined with the removal of the resident community yielded individual plants that were fourfold to 20-fold larger and sixfold to 20-fold more fecund than plants from control plots. Competitor removal alone yielded invaders that were twofold to sevenfold larger and twofold to ninefold more fecund. N addition alone or in combination with other resources led to a twofold to ninefold increase in the biomass and fecundity of the invaders. No other resource alone significantly affected native or invader performance, suggesting that N was the key limiting resource during our experiment. We found a significant interaction between abiotic and biotic resistance for Bromus, which experienced increased competitive suppression in fertilized plots. The threefold increase in resident biomass with N addition was likely responsible for this result. Our results confirm that serpentine plant communities are severely N limited, which, in combination with competition from resident species, promotes the resistance of these systems to invasions. Our work suggests that better understanding the relative sensitivities of invaders and residents to the physical environment is critical to predicting how abiotic and biotic factors interact to determine community resistance.

AB The light-use efficiency (LUE) of a mature Canadian Douglas-fir forest (DF49) was studied using high-resolution in situ temporal, spatial, and spectral measurements in conjunction with fluxes acquired from an instrumented tower. We examined the photochemical reflectance index (PRI), a spectral index responsive to high light conditions that alters reflectance at 531 nm, in combination with several alternative reference bands at 551, 570, and 488 nm. These indices were derived from directional reflectance spectra acquired by a hyperspectral radiometer system mounted on the DF49 tower, viewing the canopy through almost 360 rotations multiple times an hour daily throughout the 2006 growing season. From canopy structure information, three foliage sectors within the canopy were delineated according to instantaneous illumination conditions (sunlit, shaded, and mixed shaded-sunlit). On sunny days, the PRI indices for the sunlit foliage sector captured high light-induced stress responses, expressed as significantly different PRI values for sunlit versus shaded foliage. This difference was not observed on highly diffuse or overcast days. PRIs on sunny days tracked the diurnal photoregulation responses throughout the growing season in concert with illumination intensity. We computed the effective instantaneous LUE for the three foliage groups (LUEfoliage) using modeled and measured information. We provide convincing evidence that LUEfoliage can be well described and strongly related to all variations of the PRI within this coniferous forest under relatively clear skies (0.59 > r(2) > 0.80, P < 0.0001). LUEfoliage varied through the growing season between 0.015 and 0.075 mu mol C mu mol(-1) absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), and the lowest daily values were associated with the sunlit foliage group. The mixed sunlit-shaded foliage was the only group to exhibit monthly averages close to the maximum ecosystem LUE parameter (epsilon(max)) used in LUE models for evergreen needle forests (0.0196 mu mol C mu mol(-1) APAR). Implications for remote sensing of carbon uptake dynamics and the interaction of canopy structure and physiology are discussed.

AB To identify the relative roles of climatic, edaphic and management factors in controlling the weighted mean traits of vegetation.
   Eleven sites in Europe and one in Israel undergoing transitions in land use.
   Standardised methods were used to collect information on species traits and attributes from plots covering a range of land uses at each site. This was combined with abundance data to create a plot x trait matrix. Variance partitioning was used to identify the relative roles of climate, soil and management on the weighted and unweighted mean traits of the vegetation in the full data set, and the data set divided into vegetative traits (including life-form, clonality, defence and a range of leaf traits) and traits linked to regeneration via seeds (including seed mass, dispersal and pollination mechanism).
   Variance partitioning of the full data set showed that climate (18.7%), explained more variance in the weighted mean traits of the vegetation than climate and soil together (9.2), soil (6.9) and management (6.1). There was a similar distribution of variance explained for both vegetative and regeneration via seed traits, although more variance was explained for the latter. This restricted set of climatic, edaphic and management variables could explain 45-50% of the variance in the weighted mean traits of the vegetation between plots. There were only small differences between analyses of the weighted and unweighted data.
   Despite large variations in climate and soils between sites, there was still a separate and recognisable impact of management on the mean weighted traits of the vegetation. There was also a degree of shared variation between the three groups of factors, indicating that the response of plant traits to one group of factors may not be predictable because they may be modulated by their response to other groups.

AB We examined thermoregulatory behaviors in a wild population of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) inhabiting a highly seasonal dry forest in Santa Rosa National Park (SRNP), Costa Rica. The dry season in SRNP lasts similar to 5 months and is characterized by high ambient temperatures regularly exceeding 37 degrees C, low relative humidity, and the near absence of precipitation. This study demonstrates that capuchins rest more and travel shorter distances during the hottest and driest hours of the day, and suggests that they extend their tongues to lower body temperature via evaporative cooling. Seasonal weather patterns and group movement data reported here are based on 940 h of observations on three social groups of capuchins (wet season: 370 h, dry season: 570 h). In the dry season, the proportion of time spent resting increased at higher temperatures whereas the proportion of time spent traveling decreased. Distance traveled between location points taken at half-hour intervals decreased significantly as temperature increased, although the correlation was not strong. Capuchins exposed their tongues during hot, dry, windy conditions, and this behavior was much more frequent in the dry season. Temperature was significantly higher and humidity significantly lower for "tongue-out" events than expected for a random event in the dry season. Finally, as surface water became scarce, home-range areas of. heavy use became increasingly centered on the remaining permanent water sources. These results suggest that heat stress and water scarcity are significant influences on the behavior of capuchins in hot, dry conditions. Am J Phys Anthropol 138:101-111, 2009.

AB Domestic gardens make substantial contributions to the provision of green space in urban areas. However, the ecological functions provided by such gardens depend critically on their configuration and composition. Here, we present the first detailed analysis of variation in the composition of urban gardens, in relation to housing characteristics and the nature of the surrounding landscape, across different cities in the United Kingdom. In all five cities studied (Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leicester, and Oxford), garden size had an overwhelming influence on garden composition. Larger gardens supported more of the land-use types recorded, in greater extents, and were more likely to contain particular features, including tall trees and mature shrubs, areas of unmown grass and uncultivated land, vegetable patches, ponds, and composting sites. The proportional contribution of non-vegetated land-uses decreased as garden area increased. House age was less significant in determining the land-use within gardens, although older houses, which were more likely to be found further from the urban edge of the city, contained fewer hedges and greater areas of vegetation canopy > 2 m in height. Current UK government planning recommendations will ultimately reduce the area of individual gardens and are thus predicted to result in fewer tall trees and, in particular, less vegetation canopy > 2 m. This might be detrimental from ecological, aesthetic, social, and economic stand points.

AB 1. Plant communities in natural ecosystems are changing and species are being lost due to anthropogenic impacts including global warming and increasing nitrogen (N) deposition. We removed dominant species, combinations of species and entire functional types from Alaskan tussock tundra, in the presence and absence of fertilization, to examine the effects of non-random species loss on plant interactions and ecosystem functioning.
   2. After 6 years, growth of remaining species had compensated for biomass loss due to removal in all treatments except the combined removal of moss, Betula nana and Ledum palustre (MBL), which removed the most biomass. Total vascular plant production returned to control levels in all removal treatments, including MBL. Inorganic soil nutrient availability, as indexed by resins, returned to control levels in all unfertilized removal treatments, except MBL.
   3. Although biomass compensation occurred, the species that provided most of the compensating biomass in any given treatment were not from the same functional type (growth form) as the removed species. This provides empirical evidence that functional types based on effect traits are not the same as functional types based on response to perturbation. Calculations based on redistributing N from the removed species to the remaining species suggested that dominant species from other functional types contributed most of the compensatory biomass.
   4. Fertilization did not increase total plant community biomass, because increases in graminoid and deciduous shrub biomass were offset by decreases in evergreen shrub, moss and lichen biomass. Fertilization greatly increased inorganic soil nutrient availability.
   5. In fertilized removal treatments, deciduous shrubs and graminoids grew more than expected based on their performance in the fertilized intact community, while evergreen shrubs, mosses and lichens all grew less than expected. Deciduous shrubs performed better than graminoids when B. nana was present, but not when it had been removed.
   6. Synthesis. Terrestrial ecosystem response to warmer temperatures and greater nutrient availability in the Arctic may result in vegetative stable-states dominated by either deciduous shrubs or graminoids. The current relative abundance of these dominant growth forms may serve as a predictor for future vegetation composition.

AB Alkenone-based Cenozoic records of the partial pressure of atmospheric carbon dioxide (PCO2) are founded on the carbon isotope fractionation that occurred during marine photosynthesis (epsilon(p37:2)). However, the magnitude of epsilon(p37:2) is also influenced by phytoplankton cell size - a consideration lacking in previous alkenone-based CO2 estimates. In this study, we reconstruct cell size trends in ancient alkenone-producing coccolithophores (the reticulofenestrids) to test the influence that cell size variability played in determining epsilon(p37:2) trends and PCO2 estimates during the middle Eocene to early Miocene. At the investigated deep-sea sites, the reticulofenestrids experienced high diversity and largest mean cell sizes during the late Eocene, followed by a long-term decrease in maximum cell size since the earliest Oligocene. Decreasing haptophyte cell sizes do not account for the long-term increase in the stable carbon isotopic composition of alkenones and associated decrease in epsilon(p37:2) values during the Paleogene, supporting the conclusion that the secular pattern of epsilon(p37:2) values is primarily controlled by decreasing CO2 concentration since the earliest Oligocene. Further, given the physiology of modern alkenone producers, and considering the timings of coccolithophorid cell size change, extinctions, and changes in reconstructed pCO(2) and temperature, we speculate that the selection of smaller reticulofenestrid cells during the Oligocene primarily reflects an adaptive response to increased [CO2(aq)] limitation.

SO SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY

AB Under a coalescent model for within-species evolution, gene trees may differ from species trees to such an extent that the gene tree topology most likely to evolve along the branches of a species tree can disagree with the species tree topology. Gene tree topologies that are more likely to be produced than the topology that matches that of the species tree are termed anomalous, and the region of branch-length space that gives rise to anomalous gene trees (AGTs) is the anomaly zone. We examine the occurrence of anomalous gene trees for the case of five taxa, the smallest number of taxa for which every species tree topology has a nonempty anomaly zone. Considering all sets of branch lengths that give rise to anomalous gene trees, the largest value possible for the smallest branch length in the species tree is greater in the five-taxon case (0.1934 coalescent time units) than in the previously studied case of four taxa (0.1568). The five-taxon case demonstrates the existence of three phenomena that do not occur in the four-taxon case. First, anomalous gene trees can have the same unlabeled topology as the species tree. Second, the anomaly zone does not necessarily enclose a ball centered at the origin in branch-length space, in which all branches are short. Third, as a branch length increases, it is possible for the number of AGTs to increase rather than decrease or remain constant. These results, which help to describe how the properties of anomalous gene trees increase in complexity as the number of taxa increases, will be useful in formulating strategies for evading the problem of anomalous gene trees during species tree inference from multilocus data.

AB Whether general patterns of signal evolution can be explained by selection for signal efficacy (detectability) has yet to be established. To establish the importance of signal efficacy requires evidence that both signals and their detectability to receivers have evolved in response to habitat shifts in a predictable fashion. Here, we test whether habitat structure has predictable effects on the evolution of male and female display coloration in 21 lineages of African dwarf chameleon (Bradypodion), based on a phylogenetic comparative analysis. We used quantitative measures of display coloration and estimated signal detectability as the contrast of those colors among body regions or against the background vegetation as perceived by the chameleon visual system. Both male and female display colors varied predictably with different aspects of habitat structure. In several (but not all) instances, habitat-associated shifts in display coloration resulted in habitat-associated variation in detectability. While males exhibit a remarkable variety of colors and patterns, female display coloration is highly conserved, consisting in all populations of contrasting dark and light elements. This color pattern may maximize detectability across all habitat types, potentially explaining female conservatism. Overall, our results support the view that selection for signal efficacy plays an important role in the evolution of animal signals.

AB In vertebrates, the well established increase in plasma corticosterone in response to food shortage is thought to mediate adjustments of foraging behavior and energy allocation to environmental conditions. However, investigating the functional role of corticosterone is often constrained by the difficulty to track time-activity budget of free-ranging animals. To examine how an experimental increase in corticosterone affects the activity budget of male Black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), we used miniaturized activity loggers to record flying/foraging, presence on the sea surface and nest attendance. To investigate how corticosterone affects allocation processes between self-foraging and foraging devoted to the brood, we monitored body mass change of males from capture (day 0) to recapture (day 3). Among control birds, males in poor condition at day 0 spent significantly more time flying/foraging and less time attending the nest site than did males in good condition. Corticosterone treatment affected time spent flying/foraging in interaction with body condition at day 0: corticosterone-implanted males in good condition spent more time flying foraging than control ones; this was not observed in poor condition males. In control birds, change in body mass was negatively correlated with body condition at day 0. This was reinforced by corticosterone treatment and, on average, corticosterone-implanted males gained much more mass than controls. These results suggest that in Black-legged kittiwakes, body condition and corticosterone levels can interact to mediate foraging decisions and possibly energy allocation: when facing stressful environmental conditions, birds in good body condition may afford to increase the time spent foraging probably to maintain brood provisioning, whereas poor body condition birds seemed rather to redirect available energy from reproduction to self-maintenance.

AB A wildfire burned through previously established research plots, allowing comparisons of pre- and post-fire nutrient pools and fluxes. The Gondola fire resulted in the loss of 30.9 mg ha(-1) of C and 510 kg ha(-1) of N, mostly by the combustion of forest floor and vegetation. Mineral N leaching was accelerated for 3 years after the fire, but accounted for only 19 kg ha(-1) of the total N loss. Potential inputs of P by ash were small relative to soil extractable pools and no significant changes in soil extractable P were noted. No changes in exchangeable K+ were noted, even though inputs by ash could have been detected, suggesting that K was lost either during or after the fire. Similarly, decreases in soil exchangeable Mg2+ were noted even though ash inputs should have caused notable increases, suggesting Mg loss either during or after the fire. The increases in soil-exchangeable Ca2+ were large, but only marginally significant (P = 0.09) and fell within the error bounds of what could have been input from ash. Comparisons with a nearby site that burned >20 years previously suggest that ecosystem C pools will not be made up for until trees are re-established at the Gondola fire, whereas N losses could be more than made up for within 20 years if N-fixing vegetation colonized the site.

   EVIDENCE
AB 1. Anadromous salmon transport marine-derived nutrients and carbon to freshwater and riparian ecosystems upon their return to natal spawning systems. The ecological implications of these subsidies on the trophic ecology of resident fish remain poorly understood despite broad recognition of their potential importance.
   2. We studied the within-year changes in the ration size, composition and stable isotope signature of the diets of two resident salmonids (rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss; Arctic grayling, Thymallus arcticus) before and after the arrival of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) to their spawning grounds in the Bristol Bay region of southwest Alaska.
   3. Ration size and energy intake increased by 480-620% for both species after salmon arrived. However, the cause of the increases differed between species such that rainbow trout switched to consuming salmon eggs, salmon flesh and blowflies that colonized salmon carcasses, whereas grayling primarily ate more benthic invertebrates that were presumably made available because of physical disturbances by spawning salmon.
   4. We also observed an increase in the delta N-15 of rainbow trout diets post-salmon, but not for grayling. This presumably led to the observed increase in the delta N-15 of rainbow trout with increasing body mass, but not for grayling.
   5. Using a bioenergetics model, we predicted that salmon-derived resources contributed a large majority of the energy necessary for growth in this resident fish community. Furthermore, the bioenergetics model also showed how seasonal changes in diet affected the stable isotope ratios of both species. These results expand upon a growing body of literature that highlights the different pathways whereby anadromous salmon influence coastal ecosystems, particularly resident fish.

AB 1. Many current biodiversity theories assume that resource competition determines niche segregation and thus coexistence within communities (i.e. at the alpha-scale). However, the action of disturbance, creating heterogeneous environments and suppressing potential dominants, may also be important for biodiversity maintenance.
   2. Hypothesis: subordinate species exhibit primarily opportunistic (ruderal) survival strategies, with increasing disturbance intensity constraining dominant species - favouring opportunistic strategies and thus functional and species diversity.
   3. The diversity, character and frequency of strategies in an alpine sedge-dominated vascular plant community were quantified in situ using CSR (competitor, stress-tolerator, ruderal) classification, and compared with a pasture in the same alpine vegetation belt (i.e. with additional disturbance). Adaptive trends were confirmed by independent multivariate analysis [detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)].
   4. The extremely stress-tolerant sedge Carex curvula (C : S : R = 17.2 : 72.9 : 9.9%) dominated the relatively undisturbed community (frequency = 52%), with 32 subordinates (typically < 5%) exhibiting a functional spectrum encompassing stress tolerance to ruderalism, but not competitive strategies. With grazing, the community exhibited weaker co-dominance by five species, greater biodiversity (76 species) and greater functional diversity, characterized by larger numbers of ruderals and some competitive-ruderals. The principal variation in both DCA1 and NMDS1 for both communities directly reflected CSR strategy spectra, confirmed by Spearman's correlation.
   5. Dominance by stress-tolerators and restricted functional diversity demonstrates habitat-level (beta-scale) functional convergence in response to stress. A spectrum of S to R strategies demonstrates alpha-scale functional divergence in response to differential stress and disturbance. Grazing suppresses potentially dominant species and favours diversity, with the additional presence of competitive-ruderals suggestive of a more intricate niche topology including more relaxed abiotic opportunities.
   6. Natural communities are not necessarily structured according to the rules of resource competition models, as these fail to account for disturbance and facilitation processes.

AB In this study, we investigated whether bird feathers can be used as a non-destructive biomonitor for organic pollutants. We analysed the outermost tail feathers of 8 terrestrial and aquatic bird species from Belgium (8 species, n = 108) for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Every compound class could be quantified in one single tail feather of the birds under study (sum PCBs ranging from 5.5 to 5 10 ng/g feather, sum PBDEs from 0.33 to 53 ng/g feather, sum DDTs from 1.5 to 730 ng/g feather), except for PBDEs in feathers of the common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus). Further, we calculated Pearson correlations between concentrations of organic pollutants in feathers and concentrations in corresponding muscle or liver tissue from the birds. Correlations were found significant in half of the cases of the terrestrial species, but were found not significant for the aquatic species, with the exception of a significant correlation of sum PCBs in the common moorhen. Only for the common buzzard (Buteo buteo) (n=43) all correlations were found significant (0.32 < r < 0.77). In order to cope for low statistical power, we performed a meta-analysis on all bird species together. This led to significant correlations between levels in feathers and corresponding levels in muscle or liver for all terrestrial birds (p < 0.05 in all cases, effect size 0.59 (p,p'-DDE) to 0.71 (Sigma PCB) for levels in feather and muscle). When correlations were recalculated excluding the birds that had died due to starvation, correlation coefficients for the terrestrial birds were found even higher (effect size up to 0.83 (Sigma PCB)). These results have important implications for non-destructive and retrospective biomonitoring. Although our results suggest that exact concentrations in the body cannot be predicted using feathers, bird feathers can give a good estimate of contamination levels in a population and as such are a potential non-destructive biomonitoring tool for organic pollutants.
   Outermost tail feathers and muscle tissue were also examined for nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) stable isotope content in the different bird species. However, delta N-15/delta C-13 signatures in feather or muscle were not significantly correlated with the corresponding levels of organic pollutants in these tissues. Various confounding factors (such as habitat, condition, age, sex) may have masked a relationship between delta N-15 values and organic pollutant levels in the birds under study.

AB The reconstruction of the climate in the Miocene Shanwang basin is an important link in understanding past climate and environmental changes in East Asia. A recent study showed that the mean annual temperature (MAT) estimates derived from leaf margin analysis (LMA) and the Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP) conflicted with and were remarkably lower than those estimated by the coexistence approach (CA). Overlapping distribution analysis (ODA), a new method introduced here, is used to reconstruct the Shanwang Miocene climate based explicitly on local plant distribution data and associated meteorological stations. The Shanwang flora (17-15.2 Ma) suggests a MAT of 10.9-14.5 degrees C and a mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 1107.3-1880.0 mm. This result is closer to the values derived from CLAMP and LMA than that obtained by CA. This report is the first comprehensive intercomparison of foliar physiognomic and nearest living relative climate proxies in a Chinese context and provides important cross validation of results.

AB Sperm competition is thought to be a major force driving the evolution of sperm shape and function. However, previous studies investigating the relationship between the risk of sperm competition and sperm morphometry revealed inconclusive results and marked differences between taxonomic groups. In a comparative study of two families of passerines (Fringillidae and Sylviidae) and also across species belonging to different passerine families, we investigated the relative importance of the phylogenetic background on the relationship between sperm morphometry and the risk of sperm competition. The risk of sperm competition was inferred from relative testis mass as an indicator of investment in sperm production. We found: (i) a significant positive association between both midpiece length and flagellum length and relative testis mass in the Fringillidae, (ii) a significant negative association between sperm trait dimensions and relative testis mass in the Sylviidae, and (iii) no association across all species. Despite the striking difference in the patterns shown by the Sylviidae and the Fringillidae, the relationship between midpiece length and flagellum length was positive in both families and across all species with positive allometry. Reasons for the differences and similarities between passerine families are discussed.

AB Using new tools (boosted regression trees) in predictive biogeography, with extensive spatial 23 distribution data for > 19 000 species, we developed predictive models for South African plant species richness patterns. Further, biome level analysis explored possible functional determinants of country-wide regional species richness. Finally, to test model reliability independently, we predicted potential alien invasive plant species richness with an independent dataset. Amongst the different hypotheses generally invoked to explain species 30 diversity (energy, favorableness, topographic heterogeneity, irregularity and seasonality), results revealed topographic heterogeneity as the most powerful single explanatory variable for indigenous South African plant species richness. Some biome-specific responses were observed, i.e. two of the five analyzed biomes (Fynbos and Grassland) had richness best explained by the "species-favorableness" hypothesis, but even in this case, topographic heterogeneity was also a primary predictor. This analysis, the largest conducted on an almost exhaustive species sample in a species-rich region, demonstrates the preeminence of topographic heterogeneity in shaping the spatial pattern of regional plant species richness. Model reliability was confirmed by the considerable predictive power for alien invasive species richness. It thus appears that topographic heterogeneity controls species richness in two main ways: firstly, by providing an abundance of ecological niches in contemporary space (revealed by alien invasive species richness relationships) and secondly, by facilitating the persistence of ecological niches through time. The extraordinary richness of the South African Fynbos biome, a world-renowned hotspot of biodiversity with the steepest environmental gradients in South Africa, may thus have arisen through both mechanisms. Comparisons with similar regions of the world outside South Africa are needed to confirm the generality of topographic heterogeneity and favorableness as predictors of plant richness.

AB Through non-genetic maternal effects, mothers can tailor offspring phenotype to the environment in which young will grow up. If juvenile and adult ecologies differ, the conditions mothers experienced as juveniles may better predict their offspring's environment than the adult environment of mothers. In this case maternal decisions about investment in offspring quality should already be determined during the juvenile phase of mothers. I tested this hypothesis by manipulating juvenile and adult maternal environments independently in a cichlid fish. Females raised in a poor environment produced larger young than females raised without food limitations, irrespective of the feeding conditions experienced during adulthood. This maternal boost was due to a higher investment in eggs and to faster larval growth. Apparently, mothers prepare their offspring for similar environmental conditions to those they encountered as juveniles. This explanation is supported by the distribution of these fishes under natural conditions. juveniles live in a different and much narrower range of habitats than adults. Therefore, the habitat mothers experienced as juveniles will allow them to predict their offspring's environment better than the conditions in the adult home range.

AB Many life-history characteristics of large mammals are scale sensitive. We provide examples where varying temporal and spatial scales can affect interpretation of data concerning life-history characteristics in large herbivores and carnivores and offer recommendations for selecting the most appropriate sampling scale or scales. We also document that some animals make decisions concerning their spatial distribution at scales well beyond the size of the home range. Conversely, other decisions involving sexual segregation of sexes, or where to give birth, may be made at scales below the level of the habitat patch. Such differences in behaviour affect our understanding of habitat selection in large herbivores, and interpreting tradeoffs between acquiring essential resources and avoiding predators. Moreover, some landscape attributes may be selected at one scale, whereas other characteristics of the environment may be selected at another. We argue that even sophisticated models for explaining the ecology and behaviour of mammals benefit from framing specific hypotheses that are related to the to the life-history characteristics of those animals. We also believe that the failure to consider and select the most appropriate scale, or suite of scales, may lead to the mismanagement of critical natural resources. We forge relationships among scale, life-history characteristics of mammals, and biodiversity. Finally, we synthesize the literature on scale for large mammals and make recommendations for future research.

AB This study deals with spatio-temporal variations in the distribution of living benthic foraminiferal assemblages in the Vie estuary (W France), through monthly samplings ( 12 months) at 14 selected sites, in the estuary and adjacent areas. Its objective was to identify distribution patterns and to establish statistically the relationships between living assemblages and environmental parameters. Living populations, dominated by the typical estuarine species Ammonia tepida, Cribroelphidium excavatum and Haynesina germanica, react within less than I month to environmental changes, mainly related to the seasonal shift of oceanic influence. The bipolarity between oceanic and continental end members, resulting from variations of salinity and of all the parameters linked to the penetration of seawater into the estuary (Ca2+, SO42-, Mg2+, K+, Br-), is the major trend in the estuary. The sharp increase of H. germanica associated with the decrease of the standing crop of the less tolerant C. excavatum in the middle estuary corresponds to a major hydrodynamic limit. Foraminiferat assemblages behave differently in the adjacent areas, depending on particular conditions that prevail in each basin and marsh area. Two reproduction periods occur in spring and early autumn in the lower estuary. During later spring and summer, the area of reproduction progressively shifts upstream, with decreasing fresh water input, before shifting down again during autumn. Conversely, species living mainly in the upper reaches (e.g., Trochammina inflata) may grow in the middle estuary in winter and spring. Tidal currents are strong enough for passive dispersal of "embryonic" juveniles throughout the whole estuary. Transported juveniles of species from the lower estuary may settle and grow when conditions (environmental parameter, competing species) are favourable. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rising levels of atmospheric CO2 can alter plant growth and partitioning to secondary metabolites. The protein competition model (PCM) and the extended growth/differentiation balance model (GDB(e)) are similar but alternative models that address ontogenetic and environmental effects on whole-plant carbon partitioning to the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway, making many divergent predictions. To test the validity of the models, we compare plant responses to one key prediction: if CO2 enrichment simultaneously stimulates both photosynthesis and growth, then PCM predicts that partitioning to phenolic compounds will decline, whereas GDB(e) generally predicts the opposite. Elevated CO2 (at 548 ppm) increased the biomass growth (ca 23%) as well as the net photosynthesis (ca 13%) of 1-year-old potted paper birch, Betula papyrifera Marsh., in a free air carbon dioxide enrichment study (FACE) in northern Wisconsin. Concomitantly, elevated CO2 increased carbon partitioning to all measured classes of phenolics (Folin-Denis phenolics, HPLC low molecular weight phenolics (i.e. cinnamic acid derivatives, flavonol glycosides, and flavon-3-ols), condensed tannins, and acid-detergent lignin) in leaves. In stem tissues, tannins and lignin increased, but F-D phenolics did not. In root tissues, F-D phenolics, and tannins increased, but lignin did not. The data suggest that CO2 enrichment stimulated pathway-wide increase in carbon partitioning to phenylpropanoids. High CO2 plants had 11.8% more F-D phenolics, 19.3% more tannin, and 10% more lignin than ambient plants after adjusting for plant mass via analysis of covariance. In general, the results unequivocally support the predictions of the GDB(e) model. By way of contrast, results from many parallel studies on FACE trembling aspen, Populus tremuloides Michx., suggest that although CO2 enrichment has consistently stimulated both photosynthesis and growth, it apparently did not generally stimulate pathway-wide increases, or decreases, in carbon partitioning to phenylpropanoids in leaves and wood, but rather has specifically, though not consistently, increased partitioning to foliar phenolic glycosides. Likewise, in this case, GDB(e)'s predictions better accord with the FACE aspen data than PCM's. If further tests of the two models also support GDB rather than PCM, then PCM's main assumption (whole-plant N rather than C is limiting partitioning to phenolic synthesis) may be incorrect.

AB Intraspecific phylogeography has been used widely as a tool to infer population history. However, little attention has been paid to Southeast Asia despite its importance in terms of biodiversity. Here we used the cytochrome oxidase I gene of mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) for a phylogeographic study of 147 individuals of the black fly Simulium tani from Thailand. The mtDNA revealed high genetic differentiation between the major geographical regions of north, east and central/south Thailand. Mismatch distributions indicate population expansions during the mid-Pleistocene and the late Pleistocene suggesting that current population structure and diversity may be due in part to the species' response to Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. The genealogical structure of the haplotypes, high northern diversity and maximum-likelihood inference of historical migration rates, suggest that the eastern and central/southern populations originated from northern populations in the mid-Pleistocene. Subsequently, the eastern region had had a largely independent history but the central/southern population may be largely the result of recent ( c. 100 000 years ago) expansion, either from the north again, or from a relictual population in the central region. Cytological investigation revealed that populations from the south and east have two overlapping fixed chromosomal inversions. Since these populations also share ecological characteristics it suggests that inversions are involved in ecological adaptation. In conclusion both contemporary and historical ecological conditions are playing an important role in determining population genetic structure and diversity.

AB Understanding spatial ecology is fundamental to effectively managing large, wide-ranging carnivores such as the leopard (Panthera pardus). While numerous studies have been conducted on leopards within protected areas, more information regarding leopard ecology is needed outside such areas for effective conservation. This study examined the spatial ecology of leopards living on commercial Namibian farmlands, and assessed information from other studies to investigate which factors appeared to influence leopard range size and density. Home range sizes were particularly large in Namibia, with high range overlap, and neither sex exhibited exclusive home range use. There were no significant differences in range size between males and females, or between wet and dry seasons for either sex. Rainfall did not directly affect range size, but exerted an influence via prey biomass. Leopard density was positively correlated with prey biomass and negatively related to range size. Leopards showed marked variation in range size and land tenure systems between studies, reflecting their remarkable ecological flexibility. Nevertheless, large home range sizes and low population densities mean that leopards require large, contiguous tracts of suitable habitat, and that more conservation efforts must be extended beyond protected areas to ensure the long-term viability of leopard populations in such areas.

AB 1. Additive partitioning of three measures of diversity (species richness, Shannon's diversity index H and Simpson's diversity D) was used to study the relationship between local and regional diversity of benthic macroinvertebrate communities of boreal lakes (littoral habitats) and streams (riffle habitats) across three spatial scales (sampling sites, ecoregions and biogeographic regions).
   2. Alpha (alpha) and beta (beta) diversity are defined as within-habitat and between-habitat diversity, respectively. According to the concept of additive partitioning, diversity can be partitioned across multiple spatial scales such that the total (gamma) diversity on one spatial scale becomes within-habitat (alpha) diversity at the next higher scale. Hence, the total diversity at one scale is determined by the alpha diversity and the between-habitat diversity (beta) at the next lower scale. Consequently, one of the advantages of additive partitioning is that it is possible to study simultaneously beta diversity and the regional-local species relationship and the scale dependence of alpha and beta components.
   3. For both lakes and streams alpha diversity was low for sites and ecoregions, whereas beta diversity was high, indicating that among-site factors are important in describing the variability among the lakes and streams studied here.
   4. Weak, albeit significant, evidence was found for regional and local species saturation patterns. Multiple stepwise regression indicated that local processes might be more important in structuring lake-littoral and stream-riffle species assemblages than regional processes. From these results we conclude that environmental heterogeneity may act as an important factor contributing to species coexistence, resulting in the observed saturation patterns.
   5. Our study supports the use of additive partitioning for identifying specific patterns of macroinvertebrate diversity on multiple spatial scales and the underlying processes generating these patterns. This information is needed to improve understanding of the relation between patterns and processes affecting (decreasing) trends in aquatic biodiversity.

AB Timber harvesting, and especially clear-cutting followed by soil scarification, has altered boreal forest ecosystems in important ways. For example, loss of decaying wood in many parts of boreal forests has reduced habitats for saproxylic species. Several methods have recently been introduced, however, to reduce the negative impacts of forestry on the natural biota. Use of controlled burning and green-tree retention in restoration and management of forests is growing rapidly, especially in Fennoscandia, but the effects of these measures on forest biota remain hypothetical. We performed a large-scale field experiment to study impacts of burning and green-tree retention on beetles in the Scots pine dominated forests of Eastern Finland. The factorial study design included a total of 24 sites (3-5 ha each), with three tree retention levels (0, 10 and 50 m(3)/ha) and uncut controls. Twelve of the 24 sites were burned. Each treatment combination was replicated three times. Beetles were sampled with window traps before and after the treatments in 2000 and 2001 to study short-term impacts of treatments on beetle assemblages. The data consisted of 34,175 beetle individuals, representing 740 species. The assemblages were greatly affected by the treatments, especially on the burned sites, while on the unburned sites higher tree retention level maintained assemblages closer to the pre-treatment structure. In general, the number of species increased with harvesting and burning. Burning had a significant effect on number of red-listed species, whereas harvesting intensity affected saproxylic, non-saproxylic and red-listed species. The numbers of individuals of red-listed and rare saproxylic species increased more on the burned than on the unburned sites. The results show that living conditions of many declined forest species, in particular saproxylics, can be enhanced in commercial forests by increasing the number of retained trees and by controlled burning. At least close to source areas not only strictly pyrophilous species but also many other rare and threatened species seem to be able to locate new resources quite effectively. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) is an ecologically and economically important forest tree species of northeastern North America and is considered one of the most genetically depauperate conifer species in the region. We have isolated and characterized 13 nuclear microsatellite loci by screening a partial genomic library with di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide repeat oligonucleotide probes. In an analysis of over 500 individuals representing 17 red pine populations from Manitoba through Newfoundland, five polymorphic inicrosatel lite loci with an average of nine alleles per locus Were identified. The mean expected and observed heterozygosity Values were 0.508 and 0.185, respectively. Significant departures front Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with excess homozygosity indicating high levels of in-breeding were evident in all populations Studied. The Population differentiation was high with 28-35% of genetic variation partitioned among Populations. The genetic distance analysis showed that three northeastern (two Newfoundland and one New Brunswick) populations are genetically distinct from the remaining populations. The coalescence-based analysis Suggests that "northeastern" and "main" Populations likely became isolated during, the most recent Pleistocene glacial period, and severe population bottlenecks may have led to the evolution of a highly selfing mating system in red pine.

AB The soil-microbe system is one of the most diverse components of the terrestrial ecosystem. The origin of this diversity, and its relation to the life-sustaining processes that are mediated by the resident microbial community, is still poorly understood. The inherent complexities necessitate a theoretical framework that integrates ecological and evolutionary approaches and which embraces the physical heterogeneity of the soil environment. Such a framework is currently lacking, although recent advances in theory and experimentation are beginning to identify the essential ingredients. Here, we review and evaluate the relevance of current modelling approaches, and propose a new synthesis of an evolutionary ecology of life in soil. Key elements include an account of dispersal, horizontal gene transfer, and the consideration of the physical and biological components of soil as an integrated complex adaptive system.

AB Identifying how habitat. rise is influenced by environmental heterogeneity at different scales is central to understanding ungulate population dynamics on complex landscapes. We used resource selection functions (RSF) to study summer habitat use in a reintroduced and expanding elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) population in the Chequamegon National Forest, Wisconsin, USA. Factors were examined that influenced where elk established home ranges and that influenced habitat use within established home ranges. We also determined grain sizes over which elk responded to environmental heterogeneity and the number of categories of habitat selection from low to high that the elk distinguished. At a large spatial extent, elk home-range establishment was largely explained by the spatial distribution of wolf (Canis lupus) territories. Forage abundance was also influential but was relatively more important at a small spatial extent when elk moved within established home ranges. Areas near roads were avoided when establishing a home-range, but areas near roads were selected for use within the established home range. Elk distinguished among 4 different categories of habitat selection when establishing and moving within home ranges. Spatial and temporal cross validation demonstrated that to improve the predictive strength of habitat models in areas of low inter-annual variability in the environment, it is better to follow more individuals across diverse environmental conditions than to follow the same individuals over a longer time period. Last, our results show that the effects of environmental variables on habitat use were scale-dependent and reemphasize the necessity of analyzing habitat use at multiple scales that are fit to address specific research questions.

AB Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen are increasingly used in marine ecosystems, for ecological and environmental studies. Here, we examine some applications of stable isotopes as ecological integrators or tracers in seagrass ecosystem studies. We focus on both the use of natural isotope abundance as food web integrators or environmental tracers and on the use of stable isotopes as experimental tools. As ecosystem integrators, stable isotopes have helped to elucidate the general structure of trophic webs in temperate, Mediterranean and tropical seagrass ecosystems. As environmental tracers, stable isotopes have proven their utility in sewage impact measuring and mapping. However, to make such environmental studies more comprehensible, future works on understanding of basic reasons for variations of N and C stable isotopes in seagrasses should be encouraged. At least, as experimental tracers, stable isotopes allow the study of many aspects of N and C cycles at the scale of a plant or at the scale of the seagrass ecosystem. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB According to the good-genes hypothesis, females choose among males to ensure the inheritance of superior paternal genes by their offspring. Despite increasing support for this prediction, in some cases differential (non-genetic) maternal effects may obscure or amplify the relationship between paternal attractiveness and offspring quality. Artificial insemination controls such effects because it uncouples mate choice from copulation, therefore denying females the opportunity of assessing male attractiveness. We adopted this technique in the live-bearing fish Poecilia reticulata and examined whether paternal coloration was associated with the behavioural performance of newborn offspring. Sexually receptive virgin females were inseminated with sperm taken individually from donor males that exhibited high variation in the area of orange pigmentation, a trait known to influence female choice in the study population. Our analysis of offspring performance focused on the anti-predator behaviour of newborn fish, including schooling by sibling pairs, the response (swimming speed) of these fishes to a simulated avian predator, and the time taken for a naive investigator to capture the offspring. Although we found no significant effect of sire coloration on either schooling or swimming speed, our analysis revealed a significant positive association between sire coloration and the ability of newborn offspring to evade capture. This finding supports the view that at least one aspect of anti-predator behaviour in newborn offspring is influenced by sire genotype, which in turn is revealed by the expression of secondary sexual traits.

AB Earlier arrival to reproductive sites of males relative to females (protandry) is widespread among migratory organisms. Diverse mechanisms have been proposed that may select for protandry, including competition for limiting resources (e.g., territories) or mates. In species with large variation in male reproductive success, such as polygamous species and those with intense sperm competition, early arriving males may accrue a fitness advantage because they acquire more mates or have larger chances of paternity. Comparative studies of birds have shown that sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is positively associated with the level of polygyny, whereas intense sperm competition is associated with sexual dichromatism (SD). Positive correlations between protandry and SSD or SD can therefore be expected to exist across avian species. Because large males are predicted to be better able to cope with adverse ecological conditions early in the breeding season, selection for protandry, in turn, may have a correlated response on SSD among migratory species breeding in boreal latitudes. Although previous studies of birds have analyzed the association between SSD and protandry, none has analyzed SD in relation to protandry. Here we analyze the association between protandry during spring migration, SSD, and SD in 21 trans-Saharan monogamous migratory bird species. The difference in median migration dates between females and males, reflecting protandry, was positively associated with SD but not with SSD. Because dichromatism is positively related to sperm competition across species, present results are consistent with predictions derived from sexual selection hypotheses for the evolution of protandry mediated by sperm competition.

   DYNAMICS; RISK
AB Analysing the persistence and viability of small populations is a key issue in extinction theory and population viability analysis. However, there is still no consensus on how to quantify persistence and viability. We present an approach to evaluate any simulation model concerned with extinction. The approach is devised from general Markov models of stochastic population dynamics. From these models, we distil insights into the general mathematical structure of the risk of extinction by time t, P-0(t). From this mathematical structure, we devise a simple but effective protocol - the ln(1-P-0)-plot - which is applicable for situations including environmental noise or catastrophes. This plot delivers two quantities which are fundamental to the assessment of persistence and viability: the intrinsic mean time to extinction, T-m, and the probability c(1) of the population reaching the established phase. The established phase is characterized by typical fluctuations of the population's state variable which can be described by quasi-stationary probability distributions. The risk of extinction in the established phase is constant and given by 1/T-m. We show that T-m is the basic currency for the assessment of persistence and viability because T-m is independent of initial conditions and allows the risk of extinction to be calculated for any time horizon. For situations where initial conditions are important, additionally c(1) has to be considered.

AB Although the variation in natural N-15 abundance in plants and soils is well characterized, mechanisms controlling N isotopic composition of organic matter are still poorly understood. The primary goal of this study was to examine the role of NH3 volatilization from ungulate urine patches in determining N-15 abundance in grassland plants and soil in Yellowstone National Park. We additionally used isotopic measurements to explore the pathways that plants in urine patches take up N. Plant, soil, and volatilized NH3 delta(15)N were measured on grassland plots for 10 days following the addition of simulated urine. Simulated urine increased N-15 of roots and soil and reduced N-15 of shoots. Soil enrichment was due to the volatilization of isotopically light NH3. Acid-trapped NH3 delta(15)N increased from -28% (day 1) to -0.3% (day 10), and was lighter than the original urea-N added (1.2%). A mass balance analysis of urea-derived N assimilated by plants indicated that most of the N taken up by plants was in the form of ammonium through roots. However, isotope data also showed that shoots directly absorbed N-15-depleted NH3-N that was volatilized from simulated urine patches. These results indicate that NH3 volatilization from urine patches enriches grassland soil with N-15 and shoots are a sink for volatilized NH3, which likely leads to accelerated cycling of excreted N back to herbivores.

AB 1. The capercaillie Tetrao urogallus is widely valued as a game bird and an indicator of forest ecosystem quality. In Scotland, its numbers have declined since the 1970s, due primarily to poor breeding success. We investigated whether differences in breeding success among forests are related to predator abundance or to aspects of forest structure, with a view to identifying beneficial management practices.
   2. Capercaillie breeding success was estimated in 7-14 forest areas in Scotland each year during 1991-2001. Forest habitat, including ground vegetation, and indices of predator abundance were assessed in each of the 14 areas in 1995.
   3. Capercaillie breeding success increased with increasing bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus ground cover, but did not improve further above 15-20% cover.
   4. The main predators were carrion crow Corvus corone, fox Vulpes vulpes and raptors. Indices of their abundance were confounded such that their respective effects on capercaillie breeding success could not readily be distinguished. However, capercaillie breeding success was negatively related to a principal component score that represented the combined abundance of crows, foxes and, to a lesser extent, raptors.
   5. A management trial in one forest showed that capercaillie bred better when most crows and some foxes were killed than when they were not.
   6. An index of pine marten abundance was related neither to the other predator indices nor to capercaillie breeding success.

AB Many species exist as metapopulations in balance between local population extinction and recolonization. The effect of these processes on average population differentiation, within-deme diversity, and specieswide diversity has been considered previously. In this paper, coalescent simulations of Slatkin's propagule-pool and migrant-pool models are used to characterize the distribution of neutral genetic diversity within demes (pi(S)), diversity in the metapopulation a whole (pi(T)), the ratio F-ST = (pi(T) - pi(S))/pi(T), Tajima's D statistic, and several ratios of gene-tree branch lengths. Using these distributions, power to detect differences in key metapopulation parameter values is determined under contrasting sampling regimes. The results indicate that it will be difficult to use sequence data from a single locus to detect a history of extinctions and recolonizations in a metapopulation because of high genealogical variance, the loss of diversity due to reductions in effective population size, and the fact that a genealogy of lineages from different demes under Slatkin's model differs from a neutral coalescent only in its time scale. Genetic indices of gene-tree shape that capture the effects of extinction/recolonization on both external branches and the length of the genealogy as a whole will provide the best indication of metapopulation dynamics if several lineages are sampled from several different demes.

AB Greater fibre yields may be possible in commercial forests through an increased application of post-harvest silvicultural techniques. In Canadian boreal forests, while basic silvicultural regeneration techniques such as planting, seeding, scarifying, and tending, have been employed since the 1940's, more intensive techniques (intensive forest management (IFM)) such as increased area planted, pre-commercial and commercial thinning, extra tending events, fertilizing, and short rotations may soon be used. There may be effects of basic and more intensive silviculture on biodiversity in the long-term, compared to natural regeneration following logging or especially stand development following natural disturbances. We reviewed approximately 50 papers that reported studies of the long-term effects of post-harvest silviculture on vertebrate wildlife. In particular, large impacts to biodiversity universally occur when native forest types are replaced by rapidly-growing exotic tree species. However, in boreal forests, native tree species are usually planted, and so any effects on associated wildlife communities may be considerably less than in non-native species plantations. Limited long-term information is available, but published studies of effects of basic silviculture and IFM suggested that loss of structures in forest stands was an important common impact that resulted in vertebrate species responses. Fewer structural features in managed forests compared to in natural forests likely results in reduced numbers of animal species dependent on those structures, such as cavity-using species and species for which large decaying woody debris is important. Simplifying stand structures and species composition may result in systems with low connectivity, making them vulnerable to insect and mammalian herbivory. Concentration of IFM in stands on highly productive sites could exacerbate effects (positive or negative), owing to the positive relationship between forest productivity and animal and plant diversity. Species such as black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) may be reduced over large areas by stand conversion to mixedwoods, stand structural changes and especially age-class truncation. On the other hand, IFM may contribute increased habitats to species favoring young to mature coniferous-dominated forests, that normally decline across a landscape following clearcutting in boreal mixed and upland conifer stands. An aspatial model, based on published and local information and expert opinion, suggested that IFM and post-harvest silviculture in Ontario's boreal forests would produce positive and negative species-specific effects on the vertebrates that we modeled. However, IFM appeared to result in little increased effect over basic post-harvest silviculture. We also expect that stand-level effects of IFM on species would accumulate through time over landscapes, as more stands come under intensive management and the level of effects will be cumulative.

AB Genetic analyses of bird subspecies designated as conservation units can address whether they represent units with independent evolutionary histories and provide insights into the evolutionary processes that determine the degree to which they are genetically distinct. Here we use mitochondrial DNA control region sequence and six microsatellite DNA loci to examine phylogeographical structure and genetic differentiation among five North American grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum ) populations representing three subspecies, including a population of the endangered Florida subspecies (A. s. floridanus ). This federally listed taxon is of particular interest because it differs phenotypically from other subspecies in plumage and behaviour and has also undergone a drastic decline in population size over the past century. Despite this designation, we observed no phylogeographical structure among populations in either marker: mtDNA haplotypes and microsatellite genotypes from floridanus samples did not form clades that were phylogenetically distinct from variants found in other subspecies. However, there was low but significant differentiation between Florida and all other populations combined in both mtDNA (F (ST) = 0.069) and in one measure of microsatellite differentiation (theta = 0.016), while the non-Florida populations were not different from each other. Based on analyses of mtDNA variation using a coalescent-based model, the effective sizes of these populations are large (similar to80 000 females) and they have only recently diverged from each other (< 26 000 ybp). These populations are probably far from genetic equilibrium and therefore the lack of phylogenetic distinctiveness of the floridanus subspecies and minimal genetic differentiation is due most probably to retained ancestral polymorphism. Finally, levels of variation in Florida were similar to other populations supporting the idea that the drastic reduction in population size which has occurred within the last 100 years has not yet had an impact on levels of variation in floridanus . We argue that despite the lack of phylogenetic distinctiveness of floridanus genotypes the observed genetic differentiation and previously documented phenotypic differences justify continued designation of this subspecies as a protected population segment.

AB Forest fragmentation has been implicated as a cause of population declines of several Neotropical migrant bird species. Fragmentation increases the amount of habitat edge, and reduced nesting success rates near forest edges are well documented in agricultural landscapes ("edge effects"). However, edge effects in predominantly forested landscapes, particularly those related to timber harvest, are poorly understood. This study examines nesting success of ground nesting birds in relation to clearcut edges in a forest-dominated landscape in north-central Minnesota. A total of 383 nests of seven species of ground nesting birds were found and monitored during 1992-1998. Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilus; n = 318) and Hermit Thrush (Catharus guttatus; n = 44) nests composed the majority of the sample. Predation accounted for 94% of all nest failures. Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism was low (1.8% for all ground nests). Using proportional hazards regression, distance to nearest clearcut edge was the best predictor of nest failure. For all ground nests, nesting success was 0.18 at 0-100 m, 0.39 at 101-500 m, and 0.52 at 501-954 m from nearest clearcut edge. Source-sink modeling indicated that distances less than or equal to100 m from clearcut edges were sink habitats for Ovenbirds (i.e. recruitment was lower than survival). These results provide strong evidence of a negative edge effect on ground nests, extending 100 m or more from clearcut edges in a forest-dominated area of north-central Minnesota.

AB Light use efficiency (LUE) algorithms are a potentially effective approach to monitoring global net primary production (NPP) using satellite-borne sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, these algorithms are applied at relatively coarse spatial resolutions 1 km, which may subsume significant heterogeneity in vegetation LUE (epsilon(n), g MJ(-1) and, hence, introduce error. To examine the effects of spatial heterogeneity on a LUE algorithm, imagery from the Advanced very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) at 1-km resolution was used to implement a LUE approach for NTP estimation over a 25-km(2) area of corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max Merr.) in central Illinois, USA. Results from several E. formulations were compared with a NIPP reference surface based on measured NPPs and a high spatial resolution land cover surface derived from Landsat ETM+. Determination of E. based on measurements of biomass production and monitoring of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) revealed that E of soybean was 68% of that for corn. When a LUE algorithm for estimating NTPP was implemented in the study area using the assumption of homogeneous cropland and the En for corn, the estimate for total biomass production was 126% of that from the NPP reference surface. Because of counteracting errors, total biomass production using the soybean epsilon(n) was closer (86%) to that from the NPP reference surface. Retention of high spatial resolution land cover to assign epsilon(n) resulted in a total NPP very similar to the reference NPP because differences in leaf phenology between the crop types were small except early in the growing season. These results suggest several alternative approaches to accounting for land cover heterogeneity in E. when implementing LUE algorithms at coarse resolution. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Vertebrates have an immature immune system soon after birth, and parasites can therefore be particularly virulent to young hosts. Transfer of immune factors via the egg can give rise to early maternal effects with important consequences for offspring fitness, as maternally derived immunity confers anti-parasite protection. Mothers are expected to allocate immunity differentially to the eggs according to the reproductive value of their offspring as influenced by the quality of their father. In this study, we analysed transmission to the yolk of antibodies specific to an antigen (Newcastle disease virus vaccine, NDV) by vaccinated female barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) mated to males whose secondary sexual characteristics had been manipulated. Concentration of anti-NDV antibodies in the yolk positively covaried with that in maternal plasma. Anti-NDV antibodies were more concentrated in the first but not the fourth eggs laid by females mated with tail-elongated males compared with those mated with tail-shortened and control males. This experiment shows that allocation of maternal immune factors to the eggs is affected by quality of the male, as signalled by its secondary sexual characteristic. Thus, early maternal effects are influenced by sexual attractiveness of male mates and are mediated by immunity.

AB The response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate warming has important implications to potential feedbacks to climate. The interactions between topography, climate, and disturbance could alter recruitment patterns to reduce or offset current predicted positive feedbacks to warming at high latitudes. In northern Alaska the Brooks Range poses a complex environmental and ecological barrier to species migration. We use a spatially explicit model (ALFRESCO) to simulate the transient response of subarctic vegetation to climatic warming in the Kobuk/Noatak River Valley (200 x 400 km) in northwest Alaska. The model simulations showed that a significantly warmer (+6 degreesC) summer climate would cause expansion of forest through the Brooks Range onto the currently treeless North Slope only after a period of 3000-4000 yr. Substantial forest establishment on the North Slope did not occur until temperatures warmed 9 degreesC, and only following a 2000 yr time lag. The long time lags between change in climate and change in vegetation indicate current global change predictions greatly over-estimate the response of vegetation to a warming climate in Alaska. In all the simulations warming caused a steady increase in the proportion of early successional deciduous forest. This would reduce the magnitude of the predicted decrease in regional albedo and the positive feedback to climate warming. Simulation of spruce forest refugia on the North Slope showed forest could survive with only a 4 degreesC warming and would greatly reduce the time lag of forest expansion under warmer climates. Planting of spruce on the North Slope by humans could increase the likelihood of large-scale colonization of currently treeless tundra. Together, the long time lag and deciduous forest dominance would delay the predicted positive regional feedback of vegetation change to climatic warming. These simulated changes indicate the Brooks Range would significantly constrain regional forest expansion under a warming climate, with similar implications for other regions possessing major east-west oriented mountain ranges.

AB The effect of plant species diversity on productivity and competitive ability was studied in an experiment carried out simultaneously in five European countries: Czech Republic (CZ), the Netherlands (NL), Sweden (SE), Spain (SP), and United Kingdom (UK). The aim was to separate the 'chance' or 'sampling effect' (increasing the number of sown species increases the probability that a species able 'to do a job' will be included) from the complementarity effect (species-rich communities are better able to exploit resources and to take care of ecosystem functions than species-poor communities). In the experiment, low diversity (LD) and high diversity (HD) mixtures of grassland species were sown into fields taken out of arable cultivation. The HD mixture consisted of five grass species, five legumes and five other forbs. The LD mixtures consisted of two grasses, one legume and one other forb, with different plant species combinations in each replicate block. The design of the experiment was constructed in such a way that the total number of seeds of each species over all the replications was exactly the same in HD and LD treatments, and the total number of grass seeds, leguminous seeds and other forb seeds were the same in both LD and HD. The responses measured were the total above-ground biomass las a measure of productivity) and the average number of naturally establishing species in a plot las a measure of the competitive ability of the mixture), both measured in the third year of the experiment. The results show that, on average, the HD plots performed better (i.e., attained higher biomass, had better weed suppression), but that the best LD mixture was as good as the best HD mixture. On the contrary, the worst LD mixture was always less successful than the worst HD replicate. The performance of particular species in the HD mixtures was a good predictor of the success of a certain species combination in a LD mixture (explaining 61% of variability between particular LD mixtures). In all sites, the LD mixture composed of species which were the most abundant in HD mixtures was as efficient in suppressing weeds as the HD mixture itself. It is argued that the performance of a species assemblage is influenced mostly by the identity of species and the diversity effect is mainly due to the 'chance' or 'sampling' effect with increasing number of species the probability that an important species will be included in the mixture increases. Caution is urged in interpreting experiments with manipulated diversity and the possible limitations of such experiments are discussed.

AB Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control-region sequences and microsatellite loci length polymorphisms were used to estimate phylogeographical patterns (historical patterns underlying contemporary distribution), intraspecific population structure and gender-biased dispersal of Phocoenoides dalli dalli across its entire range. One-hundred and thirteen animals from several geographical strata were sequenced over 379 bp of mtDNA, resulting in 58 mtDNA haplotypes. Analysis using Fs, values (based on haplotype frequencies) and Phi(ST) values (based on frequencies and genetic distances between haplotypes) yielded statistically significant separation (bootstrap values P < 0.05) among most of the stocks currently used for management purposes. A minimum spanning network of haplotypes showed two very distinctive clusters, differentially occupied by western and eastern populations, with some common widespread haplotypes. This suggests some degree of phyletic radiation from west to east, superimposed on gene flow. Highly male-biased migration was detected for several population comparisons. Nuclear microsatellite DNA markers (119 individuals and six loci) provided additional support for population subdivision and gender-biased dispersal detected in the mtDNA sequences. Analysis using Fs, values (based on allelic frequencies) yielded statistically significant separation between some, but not all, populations distinguished by mtDNA analysis. R-ST values (based on frequencies of and genetic distance between alleles) showed no statistically significant subdivision. Again, highly male-biased dispersal was detected for all population comparisons, suggesting, together with morphological and reproductive data, the existence of sexual selection. Our molecular results argue for nine distinct dalli-type populations that should be treated as separate units for management purposes.

AB A grassland formation has been subjected to pollution generated by the Ventanas copper smelter since 1964 (Puchuncavi Valley, central zone of Chile) with extensive damage to local vegetation and important changes in soil characteristics. The aims of the study were (1) to detect soil parameters that best explain changes observed in plant species richness and abundance and (2) to determine if pollution-derived stresses have also affected regeneration capabilities of plant communities from the soil seed bank. The grassland was quantitatively analysed in terms of physicochemical soil characteristics, plant species diversity and abundance, and soil seed bank species composition and abundance. Results showed that a decrease in total soil nitrogen explained 13% of the changes detected in plant abundance while soil pH and 0.05 M EDTA extractable copper explained 10% and 7%, respectively, of the vegetation change. It was also found that the pollution has already affected plant species regeneration capabilities from the soil seed bank and the microsite distribution of the seeds in soils.

AB We describe three highly polymorphic microsatellite loci which have been isolated from the giant tiger prawn Penaeus monodon. The number of alleles present among 312 samples at the loci Pmo9, Pmo25 and Pmo27 were 84, 34 and 35, respectively, with heterozygosities all > 90%. Analyses of the distribution of length variation at three microsatellite loci among five Australian P. monodon populations revealed strong differentiation between populations from the west and those from the northern and eastern coasts. Tests for population differentiation (F-ST) values and an analogous measure for microsatellite loci (R-ST) all demonstrated that Western Australian P. monodon are a separate genetic stock which exhibits reduced genetic variation relative to the other populations. Reduced variability is consistent with a recent population bottleneck or colonization by a small founding population from the east when sea links between Indonesia, New Guinea and Australia were re-established following the last ice age. The results of this study are in agreement with previous surveys of P. monodon conducted with allozymes and mtDNA.

AB With renewed interest in the use of ecologically-designed, sustainable agricultural systems for temperate regions of the world, agroforestry is being proposed as an alternative to intensive production of crops in monocultures. However, the knowledge-base for understanding and managing complex, multi-strata systems worldwide is limited, particularly so for temperate regions. We examined an alley cropping system in the midwestern US where maize (Zea mays L.) is grown in alleys between tree rows of either black walnut (Juglans nigra L.) or red oak (Quercus rubra L.). During a course of ten years, crop yields in rows adjacent to tree rows declined by 50% or more. With the experimental introduction of barriers to separate tree and crop root systems, yields in the rows near trees were equal to those of the center row (and monoculture). Irrespective of a high correlation between photosynthetically active radiation and net photosynthesis, shading did not have a major influence on crop yield. At this stage of system development (11 year old trees), influence of incident PAR on crop yield seems to be minimal. Subsequent papers in this series examine the sharing of belowground resources between trees and crops to quantify the competitive interactions that impact crop yields and their implications for economic return to the farmer.

AB This article presents the concepts and models of diversity-oriented silviculture in the Boreal Zone of Europe based on literature, Finnish national forest inventories and field experiment data. The basic idea following the natural processes of forest ecosystems in silvicultural practices has been known since the last century but appropriate comparison materials for modelling have been scanty previously. Stand structure classification used in this study is based on the range and shape of stem distribution. The two main groups are even-sized and uneven-sized. A subclass of the latter, regularly all-sized, with dbh distribution resembling a reversed J, forms the primary basis for treatment models. This kind of structure, following the development and dynamics of natural mixed stands, fulfils the requirements for biodiversity according to international resolutions. Single tree selection and group selection are primarily the main treatments and seed tree and shelterwood cuttings are secondary treatments in diversity-oriented silviculture. In addition, regimes aiming to diversify even-sized stands in different development stages are discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Individuals are expected to balance the costs and benefits underlying the trade-off between current and future reproduction. If starting to breed does not seriously lower future reproductive output, individuals that start breeding early in their life should have a higher fitness than individuals that postpone their breeding career. We studied how the fluctuations in food supply interacted with Ural owl's age at first breeding, lifetime reproductive success (LRS) and fitness.
   2. During the period 1977-95, 126 Ural owl females started and ended their breeding career in a study area in southern Finland. Voles, the owls' main food source, showed a 3-year cycle of low, increase and peak population numbers. We recorded when the females started to breed and how many fledglings they produced. For 57 females the age at first breeding was known.
   3. LRS of female Ural owls varied from 0 to 33 fledglings (mean 6.7 +/- 0.52 SE). The variance in LRS was explained by variation in the components: breeding lifespan (97%); nest success (23%); and average clutch size (15%).
   4. Survival of breeding females was low (62%) after a peak year, when the vole population crashed. In other phases the survival was 85-95%. Females that started breeding in a peak year had half the LRS of females that started in an increase year.
   5. There was a strong interaction between the vole cycle and age at first breeding. 1-year-olds started in a peak and 2-year-olds in an increase year.
   6. There was no effect of age at first breeding on LRS for females that started breeding in the same phase of the vole cycle.
   7. Females that started breeding at age 1-3 years had equal fitness, whereas females that started at age greater than or equal to 4 had a lower fitness. Females that postponed first breeding as a two-year-old in an increase year had a lower fitness than females that did not do so. Females that postponed first breeding as a 1-year-old in a peak year had equal fitness to females that did not do so.
   8. Cyclic fluctuation in food supply clearly constrains the option as to during what phase and at what age to start breeding. In terms of fitness, the optimal age to start breeding depends on the phase of the vole cycle at hatching.

AB We studied the spatial covariation of breeding success of black grouse and capercaillie and densities of mammalian generalist predators in Finland. Our study was based on six years' data from the Finnish wildlife triangle censuses (1989-1994).
   At the nation-wide level (100 x 100 km grids), the proportion of hens with a brood in August covaried regionally in the two species and decreased towards southern Finland, whereas the brood sizes were not related to latitude. The relative densities of red fox and pine marten correlated negatively with the proportion of grouse hens with a brood and were two- to three-fold higher in southernmost Finland than elsewhere in the country. The relative density of stoat, however, increased with latitude. The results support the hypothesis that higher generalist predator densities are responsible for lower breeding success of forest dwelling grouse moving southwards in Fennoscandia. The results also suggest that the stoat is of minor importance as nest and brood predator compared to red fox and pine marten.
   In northern Finland, on a smaller spatial scale (about 25 km(2)), the increasing red fox density decreased the probability of an observed grouse hen being with a brood in low vole years, whereas in years of high vole densities no effect was detected in logistic regression analysis. In contrast to northern results, the red fox density in southern Finland, although generally higher, did not predict the spatial variation in breeding success of grouse either in high or in low vole years. The brood size of grouse was not related to red fox density. Our results agree with the alternative prey hypothesis in northern, but not in southern Finland. In addition to higher amplitude of vole cycles in northern than in southern Finland, this inconsistency can probably be related to regional differences in both prey and predator communities.

AB The study of the relationship between species richness of a plant community and its productivity has received much attention, recently renewed by the concern on the loss of biological diversify at a global scale. Here, we briefly review some indices widely used in agronomic and competition experiments to compare monocultures and mixtures, and compare them to other, more recently designed ones. These various indices are then calculated for two experiments. In the first experiment, two grass and two legume species were grown at six levels of nitrogen availability, either in monocultures or in mixtures of the four species in a substitutive design; in the second experiment, five grass species were grown at 16 levels of total nutrient availability, either in monocultures or in mixtures of the live species in an additive design. These data clearly show that the conclusions drawn from the experiments depend on the index used to compare the experimental communities. We argue that a clear test of whether the productivity of communities increases with species richness requires that: (1) all species present in the multispecies assemblages also be grown in monocultures under the same environmental conditions, and (2) the productivity of these assemblages be compared to the most productive monoculture. We conclude that there are as yet very few cases where superior productivity of multispecies assemblages as compared to monocultures has been clearly shown.

AB A coupled carbon and water flux model (BIOME2) captures the broad-scale environmental controls on the natural distribution of vegetation structural and phenological types in Australia. Model input consists of latitude, soil type, and mean monthly climate (temperature, precipitation, and sunshine hours) data on a 1/10 degrees grid. Model output consists of foliage projective cover (FPC) for the quantitative combination of plant types that maximizes net primary production (NPP). The model realistically simulates changes in FPC along moisture gradients as a consequence of the trade-off between light capture and water stress. A two-layer soil hydrology model also allows simulation of the competitive balance between grass and woody vegetation including the strong effects of soil texture.

AB Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in the dynamics of metapopulations, where a number of local populations are coupled via dispersal. The importance of movement for the persistence of an ensemble of locally unstable patches has been established in many studies. In this paper, we present analytical and simulation results concerning the effects of spatial structure on the equilibrium stability of individual populations. We conclude that for general single-species and two-species competition models, the introduction of the spatial dimension in a biologically sensible way has no effect on the overall stability properties. In host-parasitoid models, however, strong host or parasitoid over-dispersal may be destabilising. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

AB 1.  Diatoms were identified and enumerated from a surface sediment calibration set of seventy-two Sudbury lakes, and the relationships between species composition and limnological variables were examined using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), a multivariate technique based on a species-packing model assuming unimodal species distributions along environmental gradients.
   2.  Weighted-averaging regression and calibration were then used to develop predictive models for inferring lakewater pH, total [Al], [Ni], [Ca], and conductivity.
   3.  The applicability of the diatom inference models was further supported by similarities noted between recent diatom-inferred values to actual lakewater measurements made in the 1980s on Chiniguchi Lake.

AB (1) The age and size structures of peatland populations of Pinus sylvestris were studied at eight different sites along a latitudinal gradient from central to northernmost Sweden (61-67-degrees-N).
   (2) Three of the northern populations had age structures with two or several peaks representing periods of successful pine regeneration.  The five remaining populations had unimodal age distributions.  The youngest age class was the modal class in only three populations.
   (3) Stem diameter and height were significantly correlated with age, but the variation in size for any given age was large in all populations.
   (4) Size distributions were skewed towards larger size classes in all populations.
   (5) The age structures of most populations suggest a wave-like regeneration pattern.  Only the age distributions of the two southernmost populations may reflect a more-or-less constant rate of pine recruitment.  No signs of major disturbancess could be found at the study sites, and it is suggested that the periodic increases of successful regeneration may be the result of interactions between different age and size classes of pine.
   (6) Periods of abundant regeneration showed a striking coincidence in the three studied populations which had several peaks in their age structures.  These periods also coincide with periods of successful regeneration documented by studies in high-altitude pine populations on mineral soil in the same region of northern Sweden.  This suggests that a common external factor, like the fluctuating climate, has played an important role in synchronizing these patterns.

AB Restoring gene flow into small, isolated populations can alleviate genetic load and decrease extinction risk (i.e., genetic rescue), yet gene flow is rarely augmented as a conservation strategy. Due to this discrepancy between opportunity and action, a recent call was made for widespread genetic rescue attempts. However, several aspects of augmenting gene flow are poorly understood, including the magnitude and duration of beneficial effects and when deleterious effects are likely to occur. We discuss the remaining uncertainties of genetic rescue in order to promote and direct future research and to hasten progress toward implementing this potentially powerful conservation strategy on a broader scale.

AB Drought-induced tree mortality has major impacts on ecosystem carbon and water cycles, and is expected to increase in forests across the globe with climate change. A large body of research in the past decade has advanced our understanding of plant water and carbon relations under drought. However, despite intense research, we still lack generalizable, cross-scale indicators of mortality risk. In this Viewpoint, we propose that a more explicit consideration of water pools could improve our ability to monitor and anticipate mortality risk. Specifically, we focus on the relative water content (RWC), a classic metric in plant water relations, as a potential indicator of mortality risk that is physiologically relevant and integrates different aspects related to hydraulics, stomatal responses and carbon economy under drought. Measures of plant water content are likely to have a strong mechanistic link with mortality and to be integrative, threshold-prone and relatively easy to measure and monitor at large spatial scales, and may complement current mortality metrics based on water potential, loss of hydraulic conductivity and nonstructural carbohydrates. We discuss some of the potential advantages and limitations of these metrics to improve our capacity to monitor and predict drought-induced tree mortality.

AB To predict the threat of biological invasions to native species, it is critical that we understand how increasing abundance of invasive alien species (IAS) affects native populations and communities. The form of this relationship across taxa and ecosystems is unknown, but is expected to depend strongly on the trophic position of the IAS relative to the native species. Using a global metaanalysis based on 1,258 empirical studies presented in 201 scientific publications, we assessed the shape, direction, and strength of native responses to increasing invader abundance. We also tested how native responses varied with relative trophic position and for responses at the population vs. community levels. As IAS abundance increased, native populations declined non-linearly by 20%, on average, and community metrics declined linearly by 25%. When at higher trophic levels, invaders tended to cause a strong, nonlinear decline in native populations and communities, with the greatest impacts occurring at low invader abundance. In contrast, invaders at the same trophic level tended to cause a linear decline in native populations and communities, while invaders at lower trophic levels had no consistent impacts. At the community level, increasing invader abundance had significantly larger effects on species evenness and diversity than on species richness. Our results show that native responses to invasion depend critically on invasive species' abundance and trophic position. Further, these general abundance-impact relationships reveal how IAS impacts are likely to develop during the invasion process and when to best manage them.

AB The unparalleled biodiversity found in the American tropics (the Neotropics) has attracted the attention of naturalists for centuries. Despite major advances in recent years in our understanding of the origin and diversification of many Neotropical taxa and biotic regions, many questions remain to be answered. Additional biological and geological data are still needed, as well as methodological advances that are capable of bridging these research fields. In this review, aimed primarily at advanced students and early-career scientists, we introduce the concept of "trans-disciplinary biogeography," which refers to the integration of data from multiple areas of research in biology (e.g., community ecology, phylogeography, systematics, historical biogeography) and Earth and the physical sciences (e.g., geology, climatology, palaeontology), as a means to reconstruct the giant puzzle of Neotropical biodiversity and evolution in space and time. We caution against extrapolating results derived from the study of one or a few taxa to convey general scenarios of Neotropical evolution and landscape formation. We urge more coordination and integration of data and ideas among disciplines, transcending their traditional boundaries, as a basis for advancing tomorrow's ground-breaking research. Our review highlights the great opportunities for studying the Neotropical biota to understand the evolution of life.

AB Diverse insects are associated with ancient bacterial symbionts, whose genomes have often suffered drastic reduction and degeneration. In extreme cases, such symbiont genomes seem almost unable to sustain the basic cellular functioning, which comprises an open question in the evolution of symbiosis. Here, we report an insect group wherein an ancient symbiont lineage suffering massive genome erosion has experienced recurrent extinction and replacement by host-associated pathogenic microbes. Cicadas are associated with the ancient bacterial co-obligate symbionts Sulcia and Hodgkinia, whose streamlined genomes are specialized for synthesizing essential amino acids, thereby enabling the host to live on plant sap. However, our inspection of 24 Japanese cicada species revealed that while all species possessed Sulcia, only nine species retained Hodgkinia, and their genomes exhibited substantial structural instability. The remaining 15 species lacked Hodgkinia and instead harbored yeastlike fungal symbionts. Detailed phylogenetic analyses uncovered repeated Hodgkinia-fungus and fungus-fungus replacements in cicadas. The fungal symbionts were phylogenetically intermingled with cicada-parasitizing Ophiocordyceps fungi, identifying entomopathogenic origins of the fungal symbionts. Most fungal symbionts of cicadas were uncultivable, but the fungal symbiont of Meimuna opalifera was cultivable, possibly because it is at an early stage of fungal symbiont replacement. Genome sequencing of the fungal symbiont revealed its metabolic versatility, presumably capable of synthesizing almost all amino acids, vitamins, and other metabolites, which is more than sufficient to compensate for the Hodgkinia loss. These findings highlight a straightforward ecological and evolutionary connection between parasitism and symbiosis, which may provide an evolutionary trajectory to renovate deteriorated ancient symbiosis via pathogen domestication.

AB Background: Pear (Pyrus) is a globally grown fruit, with thousands of cultivars in five domesticated species and dozens of wild species. However, little is known about the evolutionary history of these pear species and what has contributed to the distinct phenotypic traits between Asian pears and European pears.
   Results: We report the genome resequencing of 113 pear accessions from worldwide collections, representing both cultivated and wild pear species. Based on 18,302,883 identified SNPs, we conduct phylogenetics, population structure, gene flow, and selective sweep analyses. Furthermore, we propose a model for the divergence, dissemination, and independent domestication of Asian and European pears in which pear, after originating in southwest China and then being disseminated throughout central Asia, has eventually spread to western Asia, and then on to Europe. We find evidence for rapid evolution and balancing selection for S-RNase genes that have contributed to the maintenance of self-incompatibility, thus promoting outcrossing and accounting for pear genome diversity across the Eurasian continent. In addition, separate selective sweep signatures between Asian pears and European pears, combined with co-localized QTLs and differentially expressed genes, underline distinct phenotypic fruit traits, including flesh texture, sugar, acidity, aroma, and stone cells.
   Conclusions: This study provides further clarification of the evolutionary history of pear along with independent domestication of Asian and European pears. Furthermore, it provides substantive and valuable genomic resources that will significantly advance pear improvement and molecular breeding efforts.

AB Evidence that urban green-space promotes health and well-being of urban residents is increasing. The role of biodiversity is unclear: perceived biodiversity may be important, but how accurately it is perceived and the factors influencing this accuracy are poorly understood. We use experimental perennial urban meadows in southern England to investigate the impact of creating biodiverse habitats on green-space users' i) physical and mental health, psychological well-being, ii) factors moderating health and well-being outcomes (site satisfaction and nature connectedness), and iii) perceived biodiversity. We explore whether 'nature dose' (time spent at a site) influences these relationships. We then assess whether green-space users can estimate botanical diversity accurately across meadow treatments differing in plant species richness and vegetation structure, and determine the environmental cues and personal characteristics associated with these estimates. Sites with experimental meadows did not increase respondents' perceptions of site level biodiversity, their self-rated physical and mental health or psychological well-being relative to control sites lacking meadows. However, there were significant associations between perceived site level biodiversity per se, and site satisfaction and feeling connected to nature. Moreover, we observed a positive association between nature dose and self-estimated mental health. We found that actual and perceived botanical richness in individual meadow plots were strongly positively correlated. Perceived richness was positively associated with vegetation height, evenness, and colourfulness suggesting that these are cues for estimating species richness. The accuracy of estimates varied, but respondents with higher levels of eco-centricity were more accurate than people who were less connected to nature.

   structural attributes in a temperate deciduous forest

AB 1. Forest ecosystems are critical for the global regulation of carbon (C), a substantial portion of which is stored in above-ground biomass (AGB). While it is well understood that taxonomic and functional composition, stand structure and environmental gradients influence spatial variation in AGB, the relative strengths of these drivers at landscape scales have not been investigated in temperate forests. Furthermore, when biodiversity enhances C storage, it is unclear whether it is through mass-ratio effects (i.e. the dominant trait in communities regulates AGB) or through niche complementarity (i.e. increased AGB due to interspecific resource partitioning).
   2. To address these mechanisms, we analysed data from a census of 28,262 adult trees sampled across 900 ha of temperate deciduous forest in southwestern Pennsylvania. We used data on four key plant functional traits to determine if (1) there is a positive relationship between species diversity and AGB and (2) whether this is due to mass-ratio effects or niche complementarity. We also sought to (3) identify the physical stand structural attributes and topographic variables that -influence AGB across this landscape.
   3. We found AGB was positively related to species richness and negatively related to species evenness, albeit weakly, while functional diversity indices had neutral effects. Above-ground biomass was enhanced in communities dominated by traits related to greater maximum tree height, deeper minimum rooting depths and larger seeds. Most importantly, areas with high AGB were dominated by Acer saccharum and Liriodendron tulipifera. Overall, these results support mass-ratio effects, with little evidence for niche complementarity.
   4. Synthesis. Stand structure, topography, and species and functional composition, but not taxonomic or functional diversity, were found to be key drivers of above-ground biomass at landscape scales (<900 ha) in this temperate deciduous forest. Our findings suggest that simultaneously managing for both high diversity and for above-ground carbon storage may prove challenging in some forest systems. Our results further indicate that the impact of tree biodiversity loss on above-ground carbon stocks will depend greatly on the identity of the species that are lost.

AB Comparative studies have identified a wide range of behavioural and ecological correlates of relative brain size, with results differing between taxonomic groups, and even within them. In primates for example, recent studies contradict one another over whether social or ecological factors are critical. A basic assumption of such studies is that with sufficiently large samples and appropriate analysis, robust correlations indicative of selection pressures on cognition will emerge. We carried out a comprehensive re-examination of correlates of primate brain size using two large comparative datasets and phylogenetic comparative methods. We found evidence in both datasets for associations between brain size and ecological variables (home range size, diet and activity period), but little evidence for an effect of social group size, a correlation which has previously formed the empirical basis of the Social Brain Hypothesis. However, reflecting divergent results in the literature, our results exhibited instability across datasets, even when they were matched for species composition and predictor variables. We identify several potential empirical and theoretical difficulties underlying this instability and suggest that these issues raise doubts about inferring cognitive selection pressures from behavioural correlates of brain size.

AB Sentinel prey can provide a direct, quantitative measure of predation under field conditions. Live sentinel prey provides more realistic data but rarely allows the partitioning of the total predation pressure; artificial prey is less natural but traces left by different predators are identifiable, making it suitable for comparative studies. We reviewed the available evidence of the use of both types of invertebrate sentinel prey. Fifty-seven papers used real prey, usually measuring predation on a focal (often pest) species, with studies overwhelmingly from North America. The median predation was 25.8% d(-1). Artificial sentinel prey (45 papers) were used in both temperate and tropical areas, placed more above ground than at ground level. The most commonly used artificial prey imitated a caterpillar. Up to 14 predator groups were identified, registering a median of 8.8% d(-1) predation; half the studies reported only bird predation. Predation on real prey was higher than on artificial ones, but invertebrate predation was not higher than vertebrate predation. Invertertebrate but not vertebrate predation was negatively related to prey size. Predation near the Equator was not higher than at higher latitudes, nor in cultivated than noncultivated habitats. The use of sentinel prey is not yet standardised in terms of prey size, arrangement, exposure period or data reporting. Due to the simplicity and ease of use of the method, such standardisation may increase the usefulness of comparative studies, contributing to the understanding of the importance and level of predation in various habitats worldwide.

AB Nontarget aquatic insects are susceptible to chronic neonicotinoid insecticide exposure during the early stages of development from repeated runoff events and prolonged persistence of these chemicals. Investigations on the chronic toxicity of neonicotinoids to aquatic invertebrates have been limited to a few species and under different laboratory conditions that often preclude direct comparisons of the relative toxicity of different compounds. In the present study, full life-cycle toxicity tests using Chironomus dilutus were performed to compare the toxicity of 3 commonly used neonicotinoids: imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam. Test conditions followed a static-renewal exposure protocol in which lethal and sublethal endpoints were assessed on days 14 and 40. Reduced emergence success, advanced emergence timing, and male-biased sex ratios were sensitive responses to low-level neonicotinoid exposure. The 14-d median lethal concentrations for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam were 1.52g/L, 2.41g/L, and 23.60g/L, respectively. The 40-d median effect concentrations (emergence) for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam were 0.39g/L, 0.28g/L, and 4.13g/L, respectively. Toxic equivalence relative to imidacloprid was estimated through a 3-point response average of equivalencies calculated at 20%, 50%, and 90% lethal and effect concentrations. Relative to imidacloprid (toxic equivalency factor [TEF]=1.0), chronic (lethality) 14-d TEFs for clothianidin and thiamethoxam were 1.05 and 0.14, respectively, and chronic (emergence inhibition) 40-d TEFs were 1.62 and 0.11, respectively. These population-relevant endpoints and TEFs suggest that imidacloprid and clothianidin exert comparable chronic toxicity to C. dilutus, whereas thiamethoxam induced comparable effects only at concentrations an order of magnitude higher. However, the authors caution that under field conditions, thiamethoxam readily degrades to clothianidin, thereby likely enhancing toxicity. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:372-382. (c) 2016 SETAC

AB The multispecies coalescent (MSC) model has emerged as a powerful framework for inferring species phylogenies while accounting for ancestral polymorphism and gene tree-species tree conflict. A number of methods have been developed in the past few years to estimate the species tree under the MSC. The full likelihood methods (including maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference) average over the unknown gene trees and accommodate their uncertainties properly but involve intensive computation. The approximate or summary coalescent methods are computationally fast and are applicable to genomic datasets with thousands of loci, but do not make an efficient use of information in the multilocus data. Most of them take the two-step approach of reconstructing the gene trees for multiple loci by phylogenetic methods and then treating the estimated gene trees as observed data, without accounting for their uncertainties appropriately. In this article we review the statistical nature of the species tree estimation problem under the MSC, and explore the conceptual issues and challenges of species tree estimation by focusing mainly on simple cases of three or four closely related species. We use mathematical analysis and computer simulation to demonstrate that large differences in statistical performance may exist between the two classes of methods. We illustrate that several counterintuitive behaviors may occur with the summary methods but they are due to inefficient use of information in the data by summary methods and vanish when the data are analyzed using full-likelihood methods. These include (i) unidentifiability of parameters in the model, (ii) inconsistency in the so-called anomaly zone, (iii) singularity on the likelihood surface, and (iv) deterioration of performance upon addition of more data. We discuss the challenges and strategies of species tree inference for distantly related species when the molecular clock is violated, and highlight the need for improving the computational efficiency and model realism of the likelihood methods as well as the statistical efficiency of the summary methods.

AB Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is known to relate directly to leaf and canopy scale photosynthesis. Retrieving SIF from space can thus provide an indication on the temporal and spatial patterns of the terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). Recent studies have successfully demonstrated the serendipitous retrieval of SIF from satellite remote sensing instruments originally destined to atmospheric studies. However, the finest spatial resolution achieved by these products is 0.5 degrees, which remains too coarse for many applications, including the early detection of drought impacts on vegetation and the integration with ground GPP measurements from flux towers. This paper proposes a methodology to spatially disaggregate the information contained within each coarse SIF pixels by using a non-linear model based on the concept of light use efficiency (LUE). The strategy involves the aggregation of high-resolution (0.05 degrees) remote sensing biophysical variables to calibrate the downscaling model locally and independently at each time step, which can then be applied to non-aggregated data to create a new layer, denoted SIF*, with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees. A global SIF* dataset is generated by applying this methodology globally to 7 years of monthly GOME-2 SIF data. SIP is shown to be a better proxy for GPP than the original coarse spatial resolution product according to flux-tower eddy covariance measurements. Its performance is comparable to dedicated GPP products despite that (unlike SIF*) these are calibrated based on the same flux towers, driven by meteorological data and not hampered by the large noise caused by the SIF retrieval. To further illustrate the added-value of the global SIF* product, this paper also presents: (1) an ecosystem level assessment showing a considerable reduction of noise with respect to the original SIF; (2) a spatio-temporal inter comparison with existing GPP products; and (3) estimations of global terrestrial productivity per selected vegetation types based on SIF*.

AB Optimal foraging theory predicts that predators are selective when faced with abundant prey, but become less picky when prey gets sparse. Insectivorous bats in temperate regions are faced with the challenge of building up fat reserves vital for hibernation during a period of decreasing arthropod abundances. According to optimal foraging theory, prehibernating bats should adopt a less selective feeding behaviour - yet empirical studies have revealed many apparently generalized species to be composed of specialist individuals. Targeting the diet of the bat Myotis daubentonii, we used a combination of molecular techniques to test for seasonal changes in prey selectivity and individual-level variation in prey preferences. DNA metabarcoding was used to characterize both the prey contents of bat droppings and the insect community available as prey. To test for dietary differences among M. daubentonii individuals, we used ten microsatellite loci to assign droppings to individual bats. The comparison between consumed and available prey revealed a preference for certain prey items regardless of availability. Nonbiting midges (Chironomidae) remained the most highly consumed prey at all times, despite a significant increase in the availability of black flies (Simuliidae) towards the end of the season. The bats sampled showed no evidence of individual specialization in dietary preferences. Overall, our approach offers little support for optimal foraging theory. Thus, it shows how novel combinations of genetic markers can be used to test general theory, targeting patterns at both the level of prey communities and individual predators.

AB Aim: Formalized classifications synthesizing vegetation data at the continental scale are being attempted only now, although they are of key importance for nature conservation planning. Therefore, we aim to provide a vegetation classification and to describe the main biogeographical patterns of floodplain forests and alder carrs in Europe.
   Location: Europe.
   Methods: A database of more than 40 000 vegetation plots of floodplain forests and alder carrs across Europe was compiled. After geographic stratification, 16 392 plots were available for classification, which was performed using the supervised method Cocktail. We also searched for new associations using semi-supervised K-means classification. The main biogeographic patterns and climate-related gradients in species composition were determined using detrended correspondence analysis and cluster analysis.
   Results: Thirty associations of floodplain forests and alder carrs were distinguished, which belong to five alliances. The Alnion incanae includes riparian, seepage and hardwood floodplain forests in the nemoral and hemiboreal zones (dominated by Alnus glutinosa and Fraxinus excelsior) and in the boreal zone (dominated by A. incana). The Osmundo-Alnion represents oceanic vegetation dominated by Alnus glutinosa, Fraxinus angustifolia and F. excelsior distributed mostly on the Iberian Peninsula and composed of species with Atlantic distribution and Iberian endemics. The Populion albae comprises floodplain forests frequently dominated by Fraxinus angustifolia, Populus alba and P. nigra that are widespread in floodplains of large rivers under summer-dry climates in the Mediterranean region. The Platanion orientalis represents eastern Mediterranean floodplain forests dominated by Platanus orientalis. The Alnion glutinosae includes forest swamps dominated by Alnus glutinosa distributed mostly in the nemoral and hemiboreal zones. The main biogeographic patterns within European floodplain forests and alder carrs reflect the climatic contrasts between the Mediterranean, nemoral, boreal and mountain regions. Oceanic floodplain forests differ from those in the rest of Europe. The hydrological regime appears to be the most important factor influencing species composition within regions.
   Conclusions: This study is the first applying a formalized classification at the association level for a broad vegetation type at the continental scale. The proposed classification provides the scientific basis for the necessary improvement of the habitat classification systems used in European nature conservation.

AB Internal corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become an essential part of organizations' social responsibility. Yet, to date, CSR's internal dimension has been widely neglected in the literature. This paper empirically explores the concept of internal CSR and its relationship to employees' affective and normative organizational commitment. For conceptualizing internal CSR, seven factors are theoretically derived based on social exchange theory. The research model is initially tested through a pretest consisting of 386 respondents from a German company active in the renewable energy sector. The main survey is carried out in an international pharmaceutical company, resulting in 2081 employee responses. The results reveal that the relevant factors constituting internal CSR are present and that the latter has a strong effect on employees' affective organizational commitment and a comparatively low effect on normative organizational commitment. Furthermore, a mediating role of affective on normative organizational commitment is detected.

AB The modern biodiversity crisis reflects global extinctions and local introductions. Human activities have dramatically altered rates and scales of processes that regulate biodiversity at local scales [1-7]. Reconciling the threat of global biodiversity loss [2, 4, 6-9] with recent evidence of stability at fine spatial scales [10,11] is a major challenge and requires a nuanced approach to biodiversity change that integrates ecological understanding. With a new dataset of 471 diversity time series spanning from 1962 to 2015 from marine coastal ecosystems, we tested (1) whether biodiversity changed at local scales in recent decades, and (2) whether we can ignore ecological context (e.g., proximate human impacts, trophic level, spatial scale) and still make informative inferences regarding local change. We detected a predominant signal of increasing species richness in coastal systems since 1962 in our dataset, though net species loss was associated with localized effects of anthropogenic impacts. Our geographically extensive dataset is unlikely to be a random sample of marine coastal habitats; impacted sites (3% of our time series) were under-represented relative to their global presence. These local-scale patterns do not contradict the prospect of accelerating global extinctions [2,4,6-9] but are consistent with local species loss in areas with direct human impacts and increases in diversity due to invasions and range expansions in lower impact areas. Attempts to detect and understand local biodiversity trends are incomplete without information on local human activities and ecological context.

AB Background: Small-scale topographic complexity is a characteristic feature of alpine landscapes, with important effects on alpine plant distribution.
   Aims: We investigated the links between small-scale topographic complexity and resultant microclimatic heterogeneity, vascular-plant species richness and beta diversity, and realised niche width and trait variation of some target species.
   Methods: We recorded temperature and soil moisture within 10 sites (40mx40m) of differing topographic complexity in alpine terrain at Finse, Norway (N 60 degrees 36MODIFIER LETTER PRIME, E 7 degrees 33MODIFIER LETTER PRIME). Plant species occurrence and traits of target species were recorded in 16 sample plots at each site.
   Results: Sites differed significantly in microclimatic heterogeneity, and topographically rough sites were always more heterogeneous than flatter ones. Greater species richness and turnover was associated with greater microclimatic heterogeneity, and rough sites contained 15-55% more species than flatter ones. Plant species had on average wider realised niches when growing at rough sites. Individuals of Bistorta vivipara, but not those of Luzula spicata, tended to exhibit greater phenotypic variation at rough sites.
   Conclusions: Rough alpine terrains create small-scale variation in microclimate, promoting species richness and beta diversity. In the event of climate change, small-scale microclimatic heterogeneity might allow plant species to escape from regional climate change by short-distance migration to local micro-refugia. This study suggests that the opportunity for such responses would be greater in topographically complex terrains.

AB A large proportion of genomic information, particularly repetitive elements, is usually ignored when researchers are using next-generation sequencing. Here we demonstrate the usefulness of this repetitive fraction in phylogenetic analyses, utilizing comparative graph-based clustering of next-generation sequence reads, which results in abundance estimates of different classes of genomic repeats. Phylogenetic trees are then inferred based on the genome-wide abundance of different repeat types treated as continuously varying characters; such repeats are scattered across chromosomes and in angiosperms can constitute a majority of nuclear genomic DNA. In six diverse examples, five angiosperms and one insect, this method provides generally well-supported relationships at interspecific and intergeneric levels that agree with results from more standard phylogenetic analyses of commonly used markers. We propose that this methodology may prove especially useful in groups where there is little genetic differentiation in standard phylogenetic markers. At the same time as providing data for phylogenetic inference, this method additionally yields a wealth of data for comparative studies of genome evolution.

AB As the most widely distributed freshwater fish worldwide, common carp Cyprinus carpio can be either invasive or "naturalized" in most areas of introduction. This leads to different levels of perception regarding the species' role in freshwater ecosystems, with experimental research focusing either on its "middle-out" impacts or overall function in limnological processes. At the same time, the large scales at which carp dynamics operate may severely limit the validity of laboratory and, oftentimes, field experiments in extrapolating results to real-world ecosystems. In this study, 129 laboratory, field, and "natural" experiments were systematically reviewed through causal criteria analysis, and within an historical/biogeographical and risk-assessment context. Of the 19 countries where experiments were conducted, only 4 were considered as "low risk" and one as "no risk," the other being "medium" to "high risk." Experimental findings from 373 component-wise assessments supported the framework of effects on water quality, vegetation, invertebrates, and vertebrates, with the latter including also amphibians and waterfowl, previously unreported. Stronger evidence was provided by natural and field relative to laboratory experiments, reflecting the reductionism of the latter. Critical biomass for an impact was highly dependent on experimental setup, even though the overall threshold of approximate to 200 kg ha(-1) under natural conditions supported recent findings. Management of carp should reflect the level of current and potential risk posed by the species in its different areas of distribution, thereby accounting for projections of further spread but also for unsuccessful colonization. Future experimentation should favor a holistic -> reductionist over a reductionist -> holistic approach.

AB Willows (Salix: Salicaceae) form a major ecological component of Holarctic floras and consequently are an obvious target for a DNA-based identification system. We surveyed two to seven plastid genome regions (similar to 3.8kb; similar to 3% of the genome) from 71 Salix species across all five subgenera, to assess their performance as DNA barcode markers. Although Salix has a relatively high level of interspecific hybridization, this may not sufficiently explain the near complete failure of barcoding that we observed: only one species had a unique barcode. We recovered 39 unique haplotypes, from more than 500 specimens, that could be partitioned into six major haplotype groups. A unique variant of group I (haplotype 1*) was shared by 53 species in three of five Salix subgenera. This unusual pattern of haplotype sharing across infrageneric taxa is suggestive of either a massive nonrandom coalescence failure (incomplete lineage sorting), or of repeated plastid capture events, possibly including a historical selective sweep of haplotype 1* across taxonomic sections. The former is unlikely as molecular dating indicates that haplotype 1* originated recently and is nested in the oldest major haplotype group in the genus. Further, we detected significant non-neutrality in the frequency spectrum of mutations in group I, but not outside group I, and demonstrated a striking absence of geographical (isolation by distance) effects in the haplotype distributions of this group. The most likely explanation for the patterns we observed involves recent repeated plastid capture events, aided by widespread hybridization and long-range seed dispersal, but primarily propelled by one or more trans-species selective sweeps.

AB Many models of evolution calculate the rate of evolution by multiplying the rate at which new mutations originate within a population by a probability of fixation. Here we review the historical origins, contemporary applications, and evolutionary implications of these "origin-fixation" models, which are widely used in evolutionary genetics, molecular evolution, and phylogenetics. Origin-fixation models were first introduced in 1969, in association with an emerging view of "molecular" evolution. Early origin-fixation models were used to calculate an instantaneous rate of evolution across a large number of independently evolving loci; in the 1980s and 1990s, a second wave of origin:fixation models emerged to address a sequence of fixation events at a single locus. Although origin-fixation models have been applied to a broad array of problems in contemporary evolutional research, their rise in popularity has not been accompanied by an increased appreciation of their restrictive assumptions or their distinctive implications. We argue that origin-fixation models constitute a coherent theory of mutation-limited evolution that contrasts sharply with theories of evolution that rely on the presence of standing genetic variation. A major unsolved question in evolutionary biology is the degree to which these models provide an accurate approximation of evolution in natural populations.

AB Most evidence for hybrid swarm formation stemming from anthropogenic habitat disturbance comes from the breakdown of reproductive isolation between incipient species, or introgression between allopatric species following secondary contact. Human impacts on hybridization between divergent species that naturally occur in sympatry have received considerably less attention. Theory predicts that reinforcement should act to preserve reproductive isolation under such circumstances, potentially making reproductive barriers resistant to human habitat alteration. Using 15 microsatellites, we examined hybridization between sympatric populations of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and blueback herring (A.aestivalis) to test whether the frequency of hybridization and pattern of introgression have been impacted by the construction of a dam that isolated formerly anadromous populations of both species in a landlocked freshwater reservoir. The frequency of hybridization and pattern of introgression differed markedly between anadromous and landlocked populations. The rangewide frequency of hybridization among anadromous populations was generally 0-8%, whereas all landlocked individuals were hybrids. Although neutral introgression was observed among anadromous hybrids, directional introgression leading to increased prevalence of alewife genotypes was detected among landlocked hybrids. We demonstrate that habitat alteration can lead to hybrid swarm formation between divergent species that naturally occur sympatrically, and provide empirical evidence that reinforcement does not always sustain reproductive isolation under such circumstances.

AB Agriculture since the 1950s has shown pronounced trends toward specialisation and intensification. Intensive measures have been taken for crop protection against pests through the widespread use of chemical pesticides in order to reduce the loss of agriculture yield. Although crop protection practices have reduced the overall potential losses of 50 % to actual losses of about 30 %, crop losses due to pests still vary from 14 to 35 % according to the country. Moreover, consequences of this intensive agriculture are now well known with an important increase of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, water pollution and biodiversity loss. Current challenge is thus to design alternative sustainable cropping systems which maintain food production while reducing externalities. Application of ecological principles to agroecosystems has been proposed for that purpose. Nonetheless, it is difficult since crop systems are characterised by frequent and high disturbances, high nutrient input and high pressure of human activities. Here, we review the current knowledge in weed science and functional ecology and propose a conceptual framework to analyse weed community assembly in arable fields. Cropping systems are highly variable in their combination of agricultural techniques. We designed a trait-based approach of functional diversity (1) to establish a comparative description of the environmental gradients created by cropping systems and (2) to characterise the response of weeds to environmental gradients. We categorise the effects of cropping systems on the environment into disturbance and resource gradients. Disturbances induced by actual and previous agricultural practices are split into physical and chemical components, whose regime are defined by disturbance timing and frequency. Resource availability in arable fields is described by the value of effect traits of crops, such as plant height, that are related to their use of resources. Finally, we provide a list of relevant response traits of weeds to each component of the two gradients.

AB Coastal dune ecosystems show strongly dynamic interactions between abiotic and biotic factors. The relationship between plant communities and environmental factors has been previously studied in oceanic dune systems, but few studies have been conducted along Mediterranean coasts. In this study we analyze the relative contribution of environmental factors associated with two of the main drivers of vegetation zonation: soil and wind. We chose two representative coastal dune systems in the western Mediterranean Basin subject to low levels of human disturbance. Within 54 plots we recorded floristic and environmental data. Vegetation zonation and relationships with environmental variables were investigated through unconstrained and constrained ordinations, correlation, and variance partitioning. Environmental factors shift along the gradient from coastal to inland dunes, concomitantly with the pattern of community types from annual beach communities to shrub-covered fixed dunes. This general gradient is similar both in the Mediterranean and in the oceanic coastal ecosystems, with the same factors that show similar trends along the dune profile. However, our results highlight some peculiarities of the Mediterranean dune systems in relation to the amount of variation explained by environmental factors. While most studies conducted in oceanic ecosystems find that wind-related parameters may control the vegetation zonation, in our study areas we observed a minor importance of the wind-related variables when compared to soil properties. In particular, organic matter and grain-size variability were found to be closely correlated with the distribution of plant communities along the gradient.

AB Environment and genetics combine to influence tree growth and should therefore be jointly considered when evaluating forest responses in a warming climate. Here, we combine dendroclimatology and population genetic approaches with the aim of attributing climatic influences on growth of European larch (Larix decidua) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). Increment cores and genomic DNA samples were collected from populations along a similar to 900-m elevational transect where the air temperature gradient encompasses a similar to 4 A degrees C temperature difference. We found that low genetic differentiation among populations indicates gene flow is high, suggesting that migration rate is high enough to counteract the selective pressures of local environmental variation. We observed lower growth rates towards higher elevations and a transition from negative to positive correlations with growing season temperature upward along the elevational transect. With increasing elevation there was also a clear increase in the explained variance of growth due to summer temperatures. Comparisons between climate sensitivity patterns observed along this elevational transect with those from Larix and Picea sites distributed across the Alps reveal good agreement, and suggest that tree-ring width (TRW) variations are more climate-driven than genetics-driven at regional and larger scales. We conclude that elevational transects are an extremely valuable platform for understanding climatic-driven changes over time and can be especially powerful when working within an assessed genetic framework.

AB Thermally induced bleaching has caused a global decline in corals and the frequency of such bleaching events will increase. Thermal bleaching severely disrupts the trophic behaviour of the coral holobiont, reducing the photosynthetically derived energy available to the coral host. In the short term this reduction in energy transfer from endosymbiotic algae results in an energy deficit for the coral host. If the bleaching event is short-lived then the coral may survive this energy deficit by depleting its lipid reserves, or by increasing heterotrophic energy acquisition. We show for the first time that the coral animal is capable of increasing the amount of heterotrophic carbon incorporated into its tissues for almost a year following bleaching. This prolonged heterotrophic compensation could be a sign of resilience or prolonged stress. If the heterotrophic compensation is in fact an acclimatization response, then this physiological response could act as a buffer from future bleaching by providing sufficient heterotrophic energy to compensate for photoautotrophic energy losses during bleaching, and potentially minimizing the effect of subsequent elevated temperature stresses. However, if the elevated incorporation of zooplankton is a sign that the effects of bleaching continue to be stressful on the holobiont, even after 11 months of recovery, then this physiological response would indicate that complete coral recovery requires more than 11 months to achieve. If coral bleaching becomes an annual global phenomenon by mid-century, then present temporal refugia will not be sufficient to allow coral colonies to recover between bleaching events and coral reefs will become increasingly less resilient to future climate change. If, however, increasing their sequestration of zooplankton-derived nutrition into their tissues over prolonged periods of time is a compensating mechanism, the impacts of annual bleaching may be reduced. Thus, some coral species may be better equipped to face repeated bleaching stress than previously thought.

AB We describe a procedure for evaluating the relative importance of beta diversity, nestedness, and similarity properties of ecological data matrices containing density, cover or biomass scores of species. Our goals are achieved by extension of the simplex approach - originally proposed for presence-absence data - to abundances. Basically, the method involves decomposition of the Marczewski-Steinhaus coefficient of dissimilarity between pairs of sites into two fractions, one derived from differences between total abundance and the other from differences due to abundance replacement. These are contrasted by the similarity function counterpart, known as the Ruzicka coefficient, and are displayed graphically using ternary (or 2D simplex) plots. Interpretation is aided by calculating percentage contributions from these components to the (dis)similarity structure. Measures of replacement and nestedness are new for abundance data; these are considered complementary phenomena reflecting antithetic ecological processes that are analogous to those operating at the presence-absence level. The method is illustrated by artificial data and a range of actual ecological data sets representing different groups of organisms, different scales and different types of data. While the simplex diagrams and associated coefficients are meaningful by themselves, their comparison with presence-absence based results gives additional insight into data structure and background factors.

AB Citizen science projects provide non-scientists with opportunities to take part in scientific research. While their contribution to scientific data collection has been well documented, there is limited research on how participation in citizen science projects may affect their scientific literacy. In this study, we investigated (1) how volunteers' attitudes towards science and epistemological beliefs about the nature of science changed after six months of participation in an astronomy-themed citizen science project and (2) how the level of project participation related to these changes. Two main instruments were used to measure participants' scientific attitude and epistemological beliefs and were administered before they registered for the program and six months after their registration. For analysis, we used pre- and post-test data collected from 333 participants who responded to both tests. Among them, nine participants were randomly chosen for interviews. Participants' responses were analyzed using the Rasch Rating Scale Model. Results show that overall scientific attitudes changed positively, p<0.01. The change was strongest in attitudes towards science news and citizen science projects. The scientific attitudinal change was related to participant social activity in the project. There was a negative change in their evaluation of their knowledge. The interviews suggest that this is due to a greater appreciation for what they have yet to learn. Epistemological beliefs about the nature of science significantly improved from the pre- to the post-tests, p<0.05. Overall, we found volunteers' participation in social components of the program was significantly related to their improvement in scientific literacy while other project participation variables (such as amount of data contributed to the project) was not.

AB How females store and use sperm after remating can generate postcopulatory sexual selection on male ejaculate traits. Variation in ejaculate performance traits generally is thought to be intrinsic to males but is likely to interact with the environment in which sperm compete (e. g., the female reproductive tract). Our understanding of female contributions to competitive fertilization success is limited, however, in part because of the challenges involved in observing events within the reproductive tract of internally fertilizing species while discriminating among sperm from competing males. Here, we used females from crosses among isogenic lines of Drosophila melanogaster, each mated to two genetically standardized males (the first with green-and the second with red-tagged sperm heads) to demonstrate heritable variation in female remating interval, progeny production rate, sperm-storage organ morphology, and a number of sperm performance, storage, and handling traits. We then used multivariate analyses to examine relationships between this female-mediated variation and competitive paternity. In particular, the timing of female ejection of excess second-male and displaced first-male sperm was genetically variable and, by terminating the process of sperm displacement, significantly influenced the relative numbers of sperm from each male competing for fertilization, and consequently biased paternity. Our results demonstrate that females do not simply provide a static arena for sperm competition but rather play an active and pivotal role in postcopulatory processes. Resolving the adaptive significance of genetic variation in female-mediated mechanisms of sperm handling is critical for understanding sexual selection, sexual conflict, and the coevolution of male and female reproductive traits.

AB Species distribution model (SDMs) is increasingly used to determine the distribution range of individual species and identify biodiversity hotspots. Of many technical issues, model over-fitting or over-parameterization is a major concern, which can lead to severe under-prediction. However, under-fitting and over-prediction may also occur if species requirements for environment are inadequately modeled. We used the collection data of stoneflies (Plecoptera, Insecta) from Illinois, USA to examine how often and severely maximum entropy (Maxent) over- or under-predicts species richness and species-occurrence frequency. A recently proposed AICc-based method (Warren and Seifert, 2011) was used for model-complexity control or regularization. Twenty-nine historically well-sampled watersheds were used to validate the predictions. The standard models, which used the default regularization (beta = 1), over- or under-predicted, depending on the watershed, species, and threshold used for converting suitability score into species presence-absence. The AICc-selected models (beta = 7-40) used 77% less parameters, but often strongly and consistently over-predicted. Three thresholds, equal training sensitivity and specificity, maximizing training sensitivity and specificity (MTSS) and minimum training presence, yielded most accurate estimates. Accordingly, we developed standard models for 41 species and identified the historically species-rich watersheds in Illinois. Our results offer new insight into the effects of regularization and choices of thresholds on Maxent performances. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carry-over effects relate to events or processes that influence individual performance in a subsequent season, but their occurrence in the annual cycle of migratory avian taxa is seldom studied. We investigated if different levels of resource allocation to reproduction may result in carry-over effects that change the timing and destination of long-distance migration. We reduced the parental investment of Cory's Shearwaters Calonectris diomedea by removing their chick at an early stage. When compared to individuals with greater parental investment (controls that raised chicks to close to fledging), manipulated birds started most stages of migration sooner and returned to the colony earlier at the start of the following breeding season. Late arrival in the subsequent nesting season increased the probability of skipping a breeding year. Manipulated males were less likely to engage in long-distance migration, which supports the idea that partial migration is condition dependent. Our study demonstrates experimentally that energetic or time-dependent costs of reproduction may have an enduring impact on migration schedule and on nonbreeding geographical distribution of long-distance migrants, which may also influence the ability to breed in the following season.

AB Agricultural straw, hydromulch, and wood shred or wood strand mulches increasingly are being used as post-fire hillslope treatments, but the differences in effectiveness among these mulch treatments are not fully understood. Following the 2002 Hayman fire in central Colorado and the 2003 Cedar fire in southern California, matched catchments were monitored for five to seven post-fire years to determine the effectiveness of wheat straw mulch (Hayman fire only) and hydromulch in reducing post-fire runoff, peak flow rates, and sediment yields from natural rainfall. Measured runoff and sediment yields were caused by short duration high intensity summer storms at the Hayman fire and long duration winter rains at the Cedar fire.
   The wheat straw mulch treatment significantly reduced peak flow rates and sediment yields at the Hayman fire. The annual peak flow rates in the first two post-fire years in the straw mulch catchment were 4.5 and 3.9 m(3) s(-1) km(-2) (respectively) as compared to 4.3 and 7.1 m(3) s(-1) km(-2) (respectively) in the control. In post-fire years one and two, the maximum event sediment yields in the straw mulch catchment were 7.2 and 10 Mg ha(-1), respectively, which were less than half of the maximum event sediment yields in the control catchment (19 and 24 Mg ha(-1), respectively). The straw mulch catchment had no detectable runoff or sediment yield after the second post-fire year, but the control catchment continued to have measurable runoff and sediment yields through the seventh post-fire year. The straw mulch treatment effect in runoff reduction was not Significant in the statistical model. Total ground cover was 80% immediately after the application of straw mulch, and decreased to 10% by the end of first post-fire year, yet total ground cover values remained high as litter and vegetation, including invasive cheatgrass, increased.
   The hydromulch cover at both fires declined rapidly and provided less than 10% of the ground cover within 2.5 months after application at which point the catchment was presumed to be untreated. Due to differences in precipitation, the three catchments at the Cedar fire had significantly different hydrologic responses during the presumed untreated portion of the study, which precluded evaluation of treatment effectiveness during the short treated period. The peak flow responses from the hydromulch and control catchments at the Hayman fire were also different during the presumed untreated period and were not tested. Although the runoff and sediment yields did not differ during the presumed untreated period and were tested for treatment effects, the Hayman hydromulch treatment did not significantly affect either response during the first post-fire year the presumed treated period.
   Unit-area sediment yields from the catchments were similar to those measured on hillslope plots at both the Hayman and Cedar fires in the first post-fire years, but in later years the sediment yields from the catchments were at least double the sediment yields measured on hillslope plots. The longer periods of greater erosion rates in the catchments likely reflect the addition of channel erosion processes and a difference in hydrologic connectivity at the catchment scale.

AB Iron Age societies of the eastern Eurasian steppe are traditionally viewed as nomadic pastoralists. However, recent archaeological and anthropological research in Kazakhstan has reminded us that pastoralist economies can be highly complex and involve agriculture. This paper explores the nature of the pastoralist economies in two Early Iron Age populations from the burial grounds of Ai-Dai and Aymyrlyg in Southern Siberia. These populations represent two cultural groups of the Scythian World - the Tagar Culture of the Minusinsk Basin and the Uyuk Culture of Tuva. Analysis of dental palaeopathology and carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes suggests that domesticated cereals, particularly millet, and fish formed a major component of the diet of both groups. The findings contribute to the emerging picture of the nuances of Early Iron Age subsistence strategies on the eastern steppe. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim When faced with dichotomous events, such as the presence or absence of a species, discrimination capacity (the ability to separate the instances of presence from the instances of absence) is usually the only characteristic that is assessed in the evaluation of the performance of predictive models. Although neglected, calibration or reliability (how well the estimated probability of presence represents the observed proportion of presences) is another aspect of the performance of predictive models that provides important information. In this study, we explore how changes in the distribution of the probability of presence make discrimination capacity a context-dependent characteristic of models. For the first time, we explain the implications that ignoring the context dependence of discrimination can have in the interpretation of species distribution models. Innovation In this paper we corroborate that, under a uniform distribution of the estimated probability of presence, a well-calibrated model will not attain high discrimination power and the value of the area under the curve will be 0.83. Under non-uniform distributions of the probability of presence, simulations show that a well-calibrated model can attain a broad range of discrimination values. These results illustrate that discrimination is a context-dependent property, i.e. it gives information about the performance of a certain algorithm in a certain data population. Main conclusions In species distribution modelling, the discrimination capacity of a model is only meaningful for a certain species in a given geographic area and temporal snapshot. This is because the representativeness of the environmental domain changes with the geographical and temporal context, which unavoidably entails changes in the distribution of the probability of presence. Comparative studies that intend to generalize their results only based on the discrimination capacity of models may not be broadly extrapolated. Assessment of calibration is especially recommended when the models are intended to be transferred in time or space.

AB Comprising >240 extant species, Macrobrachium Bate, 1868 is the most speciose caridean genus in Palaemonidae. It is generally considered as a monophyletic clade that lives exclusively in limnic and brackish habitats. Thus, it may provide a suitable model for the reconstruction of evolutionary transitions of euryhaline shrimp from ancestral state of living in the sea towards invasions of freshwater environments. Reviewing patterns of the biology (adaptative physiological and reproductive traits) and modern biogeographic distribution of this clade, I propose here a scenario for its tentative origin and evolutionary invasion of limnic inland waters, especially in the Americas. Macrobrachium shows: 1) a world-wide tropical to subtropical distribution, with only few species occurring in temperate regions and none in cold waters at high latitudes; 2) a clear preference for low salinity conditions (based on strong osmoregulatory capacities); 3) larval export strategies in coastal species (with diadromous migrations and invariably an extended larval development in estuaries); and 4) almost exclusively an abbreviated and lecithotrophic mode of larval development in hololimnetic inland species. The extant patterns of geographic distribution of this genus are strikingly disjunct, with completely separate groups of species occurring in the Indo-Pacific region (where maximum diversity occurs), in West Africa, and in the Americas. In a clade with common ancestry, this pattern can only be explained with a Tethyan origin and dispersal. Hence, I suggest an origin of ancestral Macrobrachium in the Mesozoic. As a consequence of the breakup of Gondwana and fragmentation of the Tethys Sea, mainly during the Late Cretaceous and Palaeogene, Neotropical and West African clades became isolated from the remaining congeners and thus can be considered as Tethyan relicts. In the Neotropics, the closure of the Central American landbridge in the Late Pliocene was a significant vicariant event that caused diversification of coastal Macrobrachium in the Caribbean region, so that two separate groups of extant species live now in the Atlantic and Pacific drainage systems. The distribution of hololimnetic inland species can be explained by continental floodings occurring during the Miocene sea level highstand. Due to concomitant sub-Andean subsidence and impounded by the uplift of the Andes, the huge Pebas wetland system was formed at that time, covering the vast proto-Amazonas-Orinoco catchment area with sub-Andean lowlands reaching from Columbia to southern Bolivia. This allowed for incursions of marine-derived lineages of euryhaline shrimp and other coastal animals throughout northern and central South America, followed by adaptive radiations in freshwater. After the breaching of the continental divide (mainly the Purus Arch) in central Amazonia, probably in the Late Miocene, the modern eastward flow of the Amazon developed, draining to the Atlantic Ocean. Fluctuation but trending to a general decrease in global sea levels during the Pliocene and Pleistocene caused fragmentation of previously interconnected inland waters, promoting vicariant diversification of hololimnetic lineages. However, some hydrological connections between different catchment areas remained transitorily open, providing limited dispersal routes that also may have influenced speciation, e.g., through hybridisation.
   Thus, the modern distribution patterns of Neotropical Macrobrachium reflect interacting effects of tectonic events including Andean orogeny and the closure of the Panamaian landbridge, Miocene marine incursions, and possible cross-drainage dispersal through historical connections between river basins.

AB Theory predicts that different. components of species diversity should increase with environmental heterogeneity. Our main aim was to examine the relationship between beta-diversity and environmental heterogeneity in a system with high habitat heterogeneity and very small spatial distances between sites. This system allowed us to examine the effect of habitat heterogeneity on beta-diversity in the absence of dispersal limitation. We surveyed 100 riffle sites (10 riffles in each of 10 streams) for benthic macroinvertebrates in a boreal drainage basin. Streams differed in average community composition (based on canonical analysis of principal coordinates) and heterogeneity in community composition (based on test of homogeneity of dispersion). These results were robust regardless of the distance measures used in distance-based multivariate analyses. beta-diversity was not significantly correlated with stream habitat heterogeneity, despite the fact that the latter was quantified by a large set of environmental variables deemed important for species occurrence in our study streams. Thus, we suggest that the relationship between beta-diversity and habitat heterogeneity was masked by individual species environment responses and mass effects. Thus, the beta-diversity habitat heterogeneity relationship may not always be significant, a result that may have important consequences for understanding the structure of community patterns. Despite the absence of a significant beta-diversity habitat heterogeneity relationship, community structure was significantly associated with environmental factors (e.g., moss cover, stream width, velocity) across the streams in distance-based redundancy analysis. This finding suggests that different ways to associate beta-diversity, community structure, and environmental conditions may yield different insights into the structure of biotic communities.

AB Large carnivores inhabiting ecosystems with heterogeneously distributed environmental resources with strong seasonal variations frequently employ opportunistic foraging strategies, often typified by seasonal switches in diet. In semi-arid ecosystems, herbivore distribution is generally more homogeneous in the wet season, when surface water is abundant, than in the dry season when only permanent sources remain. Here, we investigate the seasonal contribution of the different herbivore species, prey preference and distribution of kills (i.e. feeding locations) of African lions in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, a semi-arid African savanna structured by artificial waterholes. We used data from 245 kills and 74 faecal samples. Buffalo consistently emerged as the most frequently utilised prey in all seasons by both male (56%) and female (33%) lions, contributing the most to lion dietary biomass. Jacobs' index also revealed that buffalo was the most intensively selected species throughout the year. For female lions, kudu and to a lesser extent the group "medium Bovidae" are the most important secondary prey. This study revealed seasonal patterns in secondary prey consumption by female lions partly based on prey ecology with browsers, such as giraffe and kudu, mainly consumed in the early dry season, and grazers, such as zebra and suids, contributing more to female diet in the late dry season. Further, it revealed the opportunistic hunting behaviour of lions for prey as diverse as elephants and mice, with elephants taken mostly as juveniles at the end of the dry season during droughts. Jacobs' index finally revealed a very strong preference for kills within 2 km from a waterhole for all prey species, except small antelopes, in all seasons. This suggested that surface-water resources form passive traps and contribute to the structuring of lion foraging behaviour.

AB 1. There is a growing consensus that the distribution of species trait values in a community can greatly determine ecosystem processes and services delivery. Two distinct components of community trait composition are hypothesized to chiefly affect ecosystem processes: (i) the average trait value of the species, quantified by community-weighted mean trait values (CWM; related to the mass ratio hypothesis) and (ii) the degree to which trait values differ between species in a community, quantified by different indices of functional diversity (FD; related to non-additive community effects). The uncertainty on the relative effect of these two components is stimulating an increasing number of empirical studies testing their effects on ecosystem processes and services delivery.
   2. We suggest, however, that the interdependence between CWM and FD poses a challenge on disentangling their relative importance. We present a framework that allows designing experiments to decouple and assess the effects of these two community functional components on ecosystem processes and services. To illustrate the framework, we focused on leaf litter decomposition, as this is an essential process related to important ecosystem services. Using simulations, we applied the framework for plant leaf litter traits (litter nitrogen and phenolic content) that are related to litter decomposition.
   3. CWM and FD generally showed a hump-shaped relationship (i. e. at more extreme CWM values, communities can have only low FD values). Within this relationship, we showed that it is possible to select quasi-orthogonal combinations of CWM and FD that can be treated statistically. Within these orthogonal CWM and FD combinations, it is also possible to select species assemblages controlling for other community parameters, such as total biomass, total density and species richness.
   4. Synthesis. The framework provides a novel approach for designing experiments to decouple the effects of CWM and FD of communities on ecosystem processes, which otherwise cannot be easily disentangled. To apply the framework and design proper experimental layouts, it is essential to have a priori knowledge of the key traits by which species affect ecosystem processes and service delivery.

AB Background: Anthropogenic land use may influence transmission of multi-host vector-borne pathogens by changing diversity, relative abundance, and community composition of reservoir hosts. These reservoir hosts may have varying competence for vector-borne pathogens depending on species-specific characteristics, such as life history strategy. The objective of this study is to evaluate how anthropogenic land use change influences blood meal species composition and the effects of changing blood meal species composition on the parasite infection rate of the Chagas disease vector Rhodnius pallescens in Panama.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: R. pallescens vectors (N = 643) were collected in different habitat types across a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance. Blood meal species in DNA extracted from these vectors was identified in 243 (40.3%) vectors by amplification and sequencing of a vertebrate-specific fragment of the 12SrRNA gene, and T. cruzi vector infection was determined by pcr. Vector infection rate was significantly greater in deforested habitats as compared to contiguous forests. Forty-two different species of blood meal were identified in R. pallescens, and species composition of blood meals varied across habitat types. Mammals (88.3%) dominated R. pallescens blood meals. Xenarthrans (sloths and tamanduas) were the most frequently identified species in blood meals across all habitat types. A regression tree analysis indicated that blood meal species diversity, host life history strategy (measured as r(max), the maximum intrinsic rate of population increase), and habitat type (forest fragments and peridomiciliary sites) were important determinants of vector infection with T. cruzi. The mean intrinsic rate of increase and the skewness and variability of r(max) were positively associated with higher vector infection rate at a site.
   Conclusions/Significance: In this study, anthropogenic landscape disturbance increased vector infection with T. cruzi, potentially by changing host community structure to favor hosts that are short-lived with high reproductive rates. Study results apply to potential environmental management strategies for Chagas disease.

AB Consistent individual behavioural differences in exploration, docility and boldness are often correlated and are associated with differences in short-term neurophysiological responses to environmental perturbations in many animal species. These physiological mechanisms are much less studied over longer periods in wild populations. Here we report the relationships among exploration, docility measured in open-field tests and trappability, taken as an index of boldness, in a wild population of eastern chipmunks and investigate whether behavioural differences among individuals are associated with differences in autonomic nervous system reactivity. We also assess the cortisol level of individuals over several months to investigate whether chipmunks with different exploration levels display different mean cortisol levels or differences in their cortisol variability. Open-field tests showed consistent individual differences in exploration patterns (ranging from fast to slow). Faster explorers were less docile when handled and were trapped more often (males) or farther from their burrows (females) than slower explorers. Fast explorers also showed a higher sympathetic activity under restraint but more stable cortisol levels over the course of the active season, suggesting a lower hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal reactivity. Our results show that chipmunks display individual behavioural variation and that these differences may have physiological implications over long periods in natural settings. Future studies should investigate the fitness consequences of such behavioural/physiological differences. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Gross primary productivity (GPP) quantifies the photosynthetic uptake of carbon by ecosystems and is an important component of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Empirical light use efficiency (LUE) models and process-based Farquhar, von Caemmerer, and Berry (FvCB) photosynthetic models are widely used for GPP estimation. In this paper, the MODIS GPP algorithm using the LUE approach and the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) based on the FvCB model in which a sunlit and shaded leaf separai:ion scheme is evaluated against GPP values derived from eddy-covariance (EC) measurements in a variety of ecosystems. Although the total GPP values simulated using these two models agree within 89% when they are averaged for the conterminous U.S., there are systematic differences between them in terms of their spatial and temporal distribution patterns. The spatial distribution of MODIS GPP therefore differs substantially from that produced by BEPS. These differences may be due to an inherent problem of the LUE modeling approach. When a constant maximum LUE value is used for a biome type, this simplification cannot properly handle the contribution of shaded leaves to the total canopy-level GPP. When GPP is modeled by BEPS as the sum of sunlit and shaded leaf GPP, the problem is minimized, i.e., at the low end, the relative contribution of shaded leaves to GPP is small and at the high end, the relative contribution of shaded leaves is large. Compared with monthly and annual GPP derived from eddy covariance data at 40 tower sites in North America, BEPS performed better than the MODIS GPP algorithm. The difference between MODIS and BEPS GPP widens as with the fraction of shaded leaves increases. The simpler LUE modeling approach should therefore be further improved to reduce this bias issue for effective estimation of regional and temporal GPP distributions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB For the last 23 years, low-severity prescribed fire has been used to decrease shade and fire tolerant tree species, increase oak (Quercus spp.), and increase herbaceous plant diversity in the East Woods of The Morton Arboretum, Lisle, Illinois, USA. The impacts of these fires on the belowground ecosystem have yet to be measured. Soil (0 to 10 cm) and litter samples were collected 12, 19, and 24 months following the most recent fire on 40 plots in burned and un-burned control areas. Soil physical, chemical, and biological properties were measured and compared with vegetation composition and structure from these same plots. Compared to un-burned controls, burn plots had greater canopy openness, greater herbaceous richness, and a lower spring/summer herbaceous ratio. Burned plots had higher soil moisture content, pH, electrical conductivity, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, NO3-, total N, particulate organic matter (POM), total organic C, and potential N mineralization. Soil microbial biomass and respiration, texture, color, aggregate stability, and hydrophobicity were not different in burned compared to un-burned plots. Indices of litter and soil invertebrate diversity were also not affected by prescribed fire. Three stepwise least squares models predicted woody richness, herbaceous richness, and spring/summer herbs with aspect, litter invertebrate richness, and soil factors (pH, potential N mineralization, C/N ratio, Mg2+, Bray P. and soil invertebrate Simpson index). These results confirm others showing prescribed fire to increase soil nutrient availability. Forest structural changes with fire appear correlated with soil nutrient availability. Decreased soil C, nutrient retention, invertebrate diversity, or increased hydrophobicity and the presence of exotic plants is often observed with high-severity fire; but, these negative impacts do not appear to be present with these long-term, low-severity fires.

AB In central Argentina, the Chinese tree glossy privet (Ligustrum lucidum) is an aggressive invasive species replacing native forests, forming dense stands, and is thus a major conservation concern. Mapping the spread of biological invasions is a necessary first step toward understanding the factors determining invasion patterns. Urban areas may function as propagule sources for glossy privet because it has been used as a landscaping tree for over a century. The objectives of this paper were to 1) map the patterns of glossy privet expansion from 1983 to 2006 using a time series of Landsat TM/ETM + images, and 2) analyze the spatial pattern of glossy privet stands with regard to urban extent. Using six summer Landsat TM images (1983, 1987, 1992, 1997, 2001, and 2006) the expansion of glossy privet was analyzed using Support Vector Machines (SVM), a non-parametric classifier which we applied to a stack of all images simultaneously, a novel approach in its application to monitor non-native tree invasions. We then measured the area of glossy privet in a series of 200-m buffers at increasing distances around urban areas in 1983 and 2006, and compared it with the amount of privet expected in proportion to buffer area Glossy privet in the study area has spread very rapidly during the 23 years that we studied and the SVM resulted in highly accurate classifications (Kappa Index 0.88, commission error 0.07, omission error 0.16). Between 1983 and 2006 glossy privet area increased 50 times (from 50 to 2500 ha), and 20% of all forest in the study area is now dominated by glossy privet Most of the glossy privet dominated stands were located within 600 m of urban areas. However, the rate of glossy privet expansion accelerated substantially after 1992 and new glossy privet dominated stands tend to be located away from urban areas. This suggests that glossy privet is now self-sustaining, but expected urban growth in the area could further foster glossy privet invasion. Management and development plans should include mitigation efforts to contain this species and prevent invasion into native forests, and citizens should be informed about the risk of invasion associated with the use of glossy privet for landscaping.

AB Coevolutionary arms races are a powerful force driving evolution, adaptation, and diversification. They can generate phenotypic polymorphisms that render it harder for a coevolving parasite or predator to exploit any one individual of a given species. In birds, egg polymorphisms should be an effective defense against mimetic brood parasites and are extreme in the African tawny-flanked prinia (Prinia subflava) and its parasite, the cuckoo finch (Anomalospiza imberbis). Here we use models of avian visual perception to analyze the appearance of prinia and cuckoo finch eggs from the same location over 40 years. We show that the two interacting populations have experienced rapid changes in egg traits. Egg colors of both species have diversified over time, expanding into avian color space as expected under negative frequency-dependent selection. Egg pattern showed signatures of both frequency-dependent and directional selection in different traits, which appeared to be evolving independently of one another. Host and parasite appear to be closely tracking one another's evolution, since parasites showed closer color mimicry of contemporaneous hosts. This correlational evidence suggests that hosts and parasites are locked in an ongoing arms race in egg appearance, driven by constant change in the selective advantage of different phenotypes, and that coevolutionary arms races can generate remarkably rapid phenotypic change.

AB Aim Restoration of habitats may be used as a conservation tool when ecosystems have lost their natural structure, dynamics or functioning over large areas. Controlled and planned use of fire could be an effective way to restore habitats of many threatened species in boreal forests where fire suppression has been effective. We asked whether the large-scale landscape context affects the occurrence of rare and threatened species in forest habitats that have been burned to restore their fire-related structures.
   Location Boreal forests in southern Finland.
   Methods We designed a large-scale field experiment that included nine Pinus sylvestris forests (5-10 ha each) in southern Finland. Sites were located in two regions: (1) in eastern region with shorter management history and (2) in western region where intensive forestry has continued longer. We evaluated whether restoration of dead/burned wood is beneficial for rare and conservation-dependent species and measured the recovery of pyrophilous and red-listed insects (beetles and flatbugs) in burned forests, using standardized sampling effort. Altogether, 956 individuals of 29 red-listed and pyrophilous species were sampled.
   Results Rare species colonized areas quickly, but there was a clear difference in species richness between the regions. The eastern forests harboured higher species richness after restoration. In these sites, the average species richness was 13.7 species per site, whereas in western forests it was 5.0 species per site. Similar pattern was also observed in subgroups: the corresponding numbers for pyrophilous species were 9.7 vs. 3.8, for red-listed 8.7 vs. 2.3 and for red-listed pyrophiles 4.7 vs. 1.2.
   Main conclusions Introducing fire back to boreal forests can aid in the recovery of rare species, but the landscape context considerably affects the success of restoring species. If restored habitats are located in landscapes that have lost their natural properties long ago, the success of restoration seems to be more challenging than in landscapes where habitats have been modified more recently.

AB Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are ecologically flexible omnivores with broad diets comprising many plant and animal foods, although they mostly eat fruit (including figs). Like other ecologically flexible nonhuman primates (e.g., baboons, Papio spp.) with broad diets, their diets vary across habitats. Much data on diets come from short studies that may not capture the range of variation, however, and data are scant on variation within habitats and populations. We present data on diet composition and diversity for chimpanzees at Ngogo, in Kibale National Park, Uganda, collected over a 15-year period, with a focus on the plant components of the diet. We compare Ngogo data to those on chimpanzees at the nearby Kibale site of Kanyawara, on other chimpanzee populations, and on some other frugivorousomnivorous primates. Results support the argument that chimpanzees are ripe fruit specialists: Ngogo chimpanzees ate a broad, mostly fruit-based diet, feeding time devoted to fruit varied positively with fruit availability, and diet diversity varied inversely with fruit availability. Comparison of Ngogo and Kanyawara shows much similarity, but also pronounced within-population dietary variation. Chimpanzees fed much more on leaves, and much less on pith and stems, at Ngogo. Figs accounted for somewhat less feeding time at Ngogo, but those of Ficus mucuso were quantitatively the most important food. This species is essentially absent at Kanayawara; its abundance and high productivity at Ngogo, along with much higher abundance of several other important food species, help explain why chimpanzee community size and population density are over three times higher at Ngogo. High inter-annual variation at Ngogo highlights the value of long-term data for documenting the extent of ecological variation among chimpanzee populations and understanding how such variation might affect population biology and social dynamics.

AB This study investigates the performances in a terrestrial ecosystem of gross primary production (GPP) estimation of a suite of spectral vegetation indexes (VIs) that can be computed from currently orbiting platforms. Vegetation indexes were computed from near-surface field spectroscopy measurements collected using an automatic system designed for high temporal frequency acquisition of spectral measurements in the visible near-infrared region. Spectral observations were collected for two consecutive years in Italy in a subalpine grassland equipped with an eddy covariance (EC) flux tower that provides continuous measurements of net ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange (NEE) and the derived GPP.
   Different VIs were calculated based on ESA-MERIS and NASA-MODIS spectral bands and correlated with biophysical (Leaf area index, LAI; fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by green vegetation, fIPAR(g)), biochemical (chlorophyll concentration) and ecophysiological (green light-use efficiency, LUEg) canopy variables. In this study, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was the index best correlated with LAI and fIPAR(g) (r = 0.90 and 0.95, respectively), the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) with leaf chlorophyll content (r = 0.91) and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI551), computed as (R-531-R-551)/(R-531+R-551) with LUEg (r = 0.64).
   Subsequently, these VIs were used to estimate GPP using different modelling solutions based on Monteith's light-use efficiency model describing the GPP as driven by the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by green vegetation (APAR(g)) and by the efficiency (epsilon) with which plants use the absorbed radiation to fix carbon via photosynthesis. Results show that GPP can be successfully modelled with a combination of VIs and meteorological data or VIs only. Vegetation indexes designed to be more sensitive to chlorophyll content explained most of the variability in GPP in the ecosystem investigated, characterised by a strong seasonal dynamic of GPP. Accuracy in GPP estimation slightly improves when taking into account high frequency modulations of GPP driven by incident PAR or modelling LUEg with the PRI in model formulation. Similar results were obtained for both measured daily VIs and VIs obtained as 16-day composite time series and then downscaled from the compositing period to daily scale (resampled data). However, the use of resampled data rather than measured daily input data decreases the accuracy of the total GPP estimation on an annual basis.

AB Understanding pelagic ecology and quantifying energy fluxes through the trophic web and from the surface to the deep ocean requires the ability to detect and identify all organisms and particles in situ and in a synoptic manner. An idealized sensor should observe both the very small living or dead particles such as picoplankton and detritus, respectively, and the large particles such as aggregates and meso- to macroplankton. Such an instrument would reveal an astonishing amount and diversity of living and nonliving particles present in a parcel of water. Unfortunately such sensors do not exist. However, complex interactions constrain the space, temporal, and size distributions of these objects in such ways that general rules can be inferred from the measurement of their optical properties. Recent technological developments allow for the in situ measurement of the optical properties and size distributions of particles and plankton in a way such that synoptic surveys are possible. This review deals with particle and plankton size distributions (PSDs) as well as how particles' geometry and nature affect their optical properties. Finally, we propose the integration of the PSD into size-structured mathematical models of biogeochemical fluxes.

AB Induction of altered phenotypes during development in response to environmental input involves epigenetic changes. Phenotypic traits can be passed between generations by a variety of mechanisms, including direct transmission of epigenetic states or by induction of epigenetic marks de novo in each generation. To distinguish between these possibilities we measured epigenetic marks over four generations in rats exposed to a sustained environmental challenge. Dietary energy was increased by 25% at conception in F0 female rats and maintained at this level to generation F3. F0 dams showed higher pregnancy weight gain, but lower weight gain and food intake during lactation than F1 and F2 dams. On gestational day 8, fasting plasma glucose concentration was higher and beta-hydroxybutyrate lower in F0 and F1 dams than F2 dams. This was accompanied by decreased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and increased PPAR alpha and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 mRNA expression. PEPCK mRNA expression was inversely related to the methylation of specific CpG dinucleotides in its promoter. DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) 3a2, but not Dnmt1 or Dnmt3b, expression increased and methylation of its promoter decreased from F1 to F3 generations. These data suggest that the regulation of energy metabolism during pregnancy and lactation within a generation is influenced by the maternal phenotype in the preceding generation and the environment during the current pregnancy. The transgenerational effects on phenotype were associated with altered DNA methylation of specific genes in a manner consistent with induction de novo of epigenetic marks in each generation.

AB The Mediterranean basin is considered a hotspot of biological diversity with a long history of modification of natural ecosystems by human activities, and is one of the regions that will face extensive changes in climate. For 181 terrestrial mammals (68% of all Mediterranean mammals), we used an ensemble forecasting approach to model the future (approx. 2100) potential distribution under climate change considering five climate change model outputs for two climate scenarios. Overall, a substantial number of Mediterranean mammals will be severely threatened by future climate change, particularly endemic species. Moreover, we found important changes in potential species richness owing to climate change, with some areas (e.g. montane region in central Italy) gaining species, while most of the region will be losing species (mainly Spain and North Africa). Existing protected areas (PAs) will probably be strongly influenced by climate change, with most PAs in Africa, the Middle East and Spain losing a substantial number of species, and those PAs gaining species (e.g. central Italy and southern France) will experience a substantial shift in species composition.

AB Soft sediments are often highly polluted as many of the toxic chemicals introduced into surface waters bind to settling particles. The resulting accumulation of pollutants in the sediments poses a risk for benthic communities. However, pollution induced changes in benthic communities have been difficult to determine when using macro-invertebrates as bioindicators, as these organisms are often absent in soft sediment. The present study therefore examined the ability of meiofaunal organisms, specifically, nematodes. to assess the ecological status of soft sediments. Over a 9-year period, nematode communities present in sediments collected from large rivers and lake Constance in Germany were studied. These sediments showed a large range of physico-chemical properties and anthropogenic contamination. After the degree of metal and organic contamination was translated into ecotoxicologically more relevant toxic units (TUs), multivariate methods were used to classify nematode taxa in species at risk (NemaSPEAR) or not at risk (NemaSPE(not)AR). This approach clearly distinguished the influence of sediment texture from that of the toxic potential of the samples and thus allowed classification of the nematode species according to their sensitivity to or tolerance of toxic stress. Two indices, expressing the proportion of species at risk within a sample (NemaSPEAR[%](metal), NemaSPEAR[%](organic)), were calculated from independent data sets obtained in field and experimental studies and showed good correlations with the toxic potential (field data) or chemical concentrations (microcosm data). NemaSPEAR[%] indices for metal and organic pollution were therefore judged to be suitable for assessing the impact of chemical contamination of freshwater soft sediments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sperm are often considered to be individuals, in part because of their unique genetic identities produced as a result of synapsis during meiosis, and in part due to their unique ecology, being ejected away from the soma to continue their existence in a foreign environment. Selection at the level of individual sperm has been suggested to explain the evolution of two enigmatic sperm phenotypes: sperm heteromorphism, where more than one type of sperm is produced by a male, and sperm conjugation, where multiple sperm join together for motility and transport through the female reproductive tract before dissociation prior to fertilization. In sperm heteromorphic species, only one of the sperm morphs typically participates in fertilization, with the non-fertilizing "parasperm" being interpreted as reproductive altruists. Likewise, in species with sperm conjugation, high levels of sperm mortality have been suggested to be required for conjugate break-up and this has been considered evidence of kin-selected altruism. However, it is unclear if sperm possess the heritable variation in fitness (i.e. are individuals) required for the evolution of cooperation. We investigate the question of sperm individuality by focusing on how sperm morphology is determined and how sperm conjugates are formed. Concentrating on sperm conjugation, we discuss functional hypotheses for the evolutionary maintenance of this remarkable trait. Additionally, we speculate on the potential origins of sperm heteromorphism and conjugation, and explore the diversification and losses of these traits once they have arisen in a lineage. We find current evidence insufficient to support the concept of sperm control over their form or function. Thus, without additional evidence of haploid selection (i.e. sperm phenotypes that reflect their haploid genome and result in heritable differences in fitness), sperm heteromorphism and conjugation should be interpreted not as cooperation but rather as traits selected at the level of the male, much like other ejaculatory traits such as accessory gland proteins and ejaculate size.

AB P>1. There is a rapidly growing literature on how climate affects populations of vertebrates. For large herbivorous mammals, most attention has been paid to demographic responses to climate variation. Much less information is available regarding how climate affects animal behaviour, i.e. the climate mechanisms. Further, the appropriate measurement scale of climate variables remains debated. Here, we investigate how local climate variables determine home range sizes at four temporal scales using the Borger-method on GPS telemetry data from 47 female red deer Cervus elaphus L. in Norway.
   2. If local climate operates directly on the immediate activity level of the animal, we predict home range sizes to show season-specific variation on short temporal scale (weekly-daily) related to temperature and precipitation. If local climate operate indirectly through plant growth, we rather predict variation in home range sizes to be apparent on longer time scales (biweekly-monthly), and during summer only.
   3. At all time scales home range size was positively correlated with temperature during winter and negatively during summer, while the effect of precipitation was season- and scale-specific, except when accumulating as snow. Extensive snow cover decreased home range size, indicating direct effects of climate.
   4. The effects of local climate was weaker at the shortest time scales (weekly-daily) compared to the longest time scales (monthly-biweekly), while the effects of day length on home range size was only apparent on the monthly and daily scale. At the longest time scales variation in local climate had a large effect on home range size. This is consistent with climatic variables operating indirectly through plant growth, but we cannot exclude a certain direct effect even at longer time scales.
   5. We show how local climate-home range size correlations measured over different temporal scales can be used to infer direct and indirect climate mechanisms. Insight on the behavioural basis of responses to climate enables more accurate predictions of possible nonlinear relationships to future global warming.

AB Lizards have been model organisms for ecological and evolutionary studies from individual to community levels at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Here we highlight lizards as models for phylogeographic studies, review the published population genetics/phylogeography literature to summarize general patterns and trends and describe some studies that have contributed to conceptual advances. Our review includes 426 references and 452 case studies: this literature reflects a general trend of exponential growth associated with the theoretical and empirical expansions of the discipline. We describe recent lizard studies that have contributed to advances in understanding of several aspects of phylogeography, emphasize some linkages between phylogeography and speciation and suggest ways to expand phylogeographic studies to test alternative pattern-based modes of speciation. Allopatric speciation patterns can be tested by phylogeographic approaches if these are designed to discriminate among four alternatives based on the role of selection in driving divergence between populations, including: (i) passive divergence by genetic drift; (ii) adaptive divergence by natural selection (niche conservatism or ecological speciation); and (iii) socially-mediated speciation. Here we propose an expanded approach to compare patterns of variation in phylogeographic data sets that, when coupled with morphological and environmental data, can be used to to discriminate among these alternative speciation patterns.

TI Forest aboveground biomass along an elevational transect in Sulawesi,
   Indonesia, and the role of Fagaceae in tropical montane rain forests

AB Aim
   This study investigates how estimated tree aboveground biomass (AGB) of tropical montane rain forests varies with elevation, and how this variation is related to elevational change in floristic composition, phylogenetic community structure and the biogeography of the dominant tree taxa.
   Location
   Lore Lindu National Park, Sulawesi, Indonesia.
   Methods
   Floristic inventories and stand structural analyses were conducted on 13 plots (each 0.24 ha) in four old-growth forest stands at 1050, 1400, 1800 and 2400 m a.s.l. (submontane to upper montane elevations). Tree AGB estimates were based on d.b.h., height and wood specific gravity. Phylogenetic diversity and biogeographical patterns were analysed based on tree family composition weighted by AGB. Elevational trends in AGB were compared with other Southeast Asian and Neotropical transect studies (n = 7).
   Results
   AGB was invariant from sub- to mid-montane elevation (309-301 Mg ha-1) and increased slightly to 323 Mg ha-1 at upper montane elevation. While tree and canopy height decreased, wood specific gravity increased. Magnoliids accounted for most of the AGB at submontane elevations, while eurosids I (including Fagaceae) contributed substantially to AGB at all elevations. Phylogenetic diversity was highest at upper montane elevations, with co-dominance of tree ferns, Podocarpaceae, Trimeniaceae and asterids/euasterids II, and was lowest at lower/mid-montane elevations, where Fagaceae contributed > 50% of AGB. Biogeographical patterns showed a progression from dominant tropical families at submontane to tropical Fagaceae (Castanopsis, Lithocarpus) at lower/mid-montane, and to conifers and Australasian endemics at upper montane elevations. Cross-continental comparisons revealed an elevational AGB decrease in transects with low/no presence of Fagaceae, but relatively high AGB in montane forests with moderate to high abundance of this family.
   Main conclusions
   AGB is determined by both changes in forest structure and shifts in species composition. In our study, these two factors traded off so that there was no net change in AGB, even though there were large changes in forest structure and composition along the elevational gradient. Southeast Asian montane rain forests dominated by Fagaceae constitute important carbon stocks. The importance of biogeography and species traits for biomass estimation should be considered by initiatives to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) and in taxon choice in reforestation for carbon offsetting.

AB P>A pilot-scale system was established for in situ biostimulation of U(VI) reduction by ethanol addition at the US Department of Energy's (DOE's) Field Research Center (Oak Ridge, TN). After achieving U(VI) reduction, stability of the bioreduced U(IV) was evaluated under conditions of (i) resting (no ethanol injection), (ii) reoxidation by introducing dissolved oxygen (DO), and (iii) reinjection of ethanol. GeoChip, a functional gene array with probes for N, S and C cycling, metal resistance and contaminant degradation genes, was used for monitoring groundwater microbial communities. High diversity of all major functional groups was observed during all experimental phases. The microbial community was extremely responsive to ethanol, showing a substantial change in community structure with increased gene number and diversity after ethanol injections resumed. While gene numbers showed considerable variations, the relative abundance (i.e. percentage of each gene category) of most gene groups changed little. During the reoxidation period, U(VI) increased, suggesting reoxidation of reduced U(IV). However, when introduction of DO was stopped, U(VI) reduction resumed and returned to pre-reoxidation levels. These findings suggest that the community in this system can be stimulated and that the ability to reduce U(VI) can be maintained by the addition of electron donors. This biostimulation approach may potentially offer an effective means for the bioremediation of U(VI)-contaminated sites.

AB Decomposing variation in population growth into contributions from both ecological and evolutionary processes is of fundamental concern, particularly in a world characterized by rapid responses to anthropogenic threats. Although the impact of ecological change on evolutionary response has long been acknowledged, the converse has predominantly been neglected, especially empirically. By applying a recently published conceptual framework, we assess and contrast the relative importance of phenotypic and environmental variability on annual population growth in five ungulate populations. In four of the five populations, the contribution of phenotypic variability was greater than the contribution of environmental variability, although not significantly so. The similarity in the contributions of environment and phenotype suggests that neither is worthy of neglect. Population growth is a consequence of multiple processes, which strengthens arguments advocating integrated approaches to assess how populations respond to their environments.

AB Forest fragmentation may have positive or negative effects on tropical tree populations. Our earlier study of an endemic African tree, Leptonychia usambarensis (Sterculiaceae), in the East Usambara Mountains of Tanzania, found poorer recruitment of seedlings and juveniles in small fragments compared to continuous forest, and concomitant reduction of seed-dispersal agents and seed dispersal. However, the possibility that other biotic or abiotic consequences of the fragmentation process contribute to diminished recruitment in fragments was left open. Here we test whether excessive seed predation, diminished fecundity, low seed quality, or adverse abiotic effects acted independently or in concert with reduced seed dispersal to limit seedling and juvenile recruitment in fragments. Extended observations of disperser activity, a seed placement experiment, seed predator censuses, and reciprocal seedling transplants from forest and fragment sources failed to support the alternative hypotheses for poorer seedling and juvenile recruitment in fragments, leaving reduced seed dispersal as the most plausible mechanism. Poorer recruitment of this species in forest fragments, where high edge-to-area ratios admit more light than in continuous forest, is particularly striking because the tree is an early successional species that might be expected to thrive in disturbed microhabitats.

AB The damselfishes, with more than 340 species, constitute one of the most important families that live in the coral reef environment. Most of our knowledge of reef-fish ecology is based on this family, but their trophic ecology is poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to determine the trophic niches of 13 sympatric species of damselfishes by combining stable isotope (delta N-15 and delta C-13) and stomach content analyses. Isotopic signatures reveal three main groups according to their foraging strategies: pelagic feeders (Abudefduf sexfasciatus, A. sparoides, A. vaigiensis, Chromis ternatensis, C. dimidiata, Dascyllus trimaculatus and Pomacentrus caeruleus), benthic feeders (Chrysiptera unimaculata, Plectroglyphidodon lacrymatus and Amphiprion akallopisos) and an intermediate group (D. aruanus, P. baenschi and P. trilineatus). Stomach contents reveal that planktonic copepods and filamentous algae mainly represent the diets of pelagic feeders and benthic feeders, respectively. The intermediate position of the third group resulted from a partitioning of small planktonic prey, small vagile invertebrates and filamentous algae. In this last feeding group, the presence of a wide range of delta C-13 values in P. trilineatus suggests a larger trophic niche width, related to diet-switching over time. Some general considerations about the feeding habits of damselfishes reveal that their choice of habitat on the reef and their behavior appear to be good predictors of diet in this group. Benthic (algae and/or small invertebrates) feeders appear to be solitary and defend a small territory on the bottom; zooplankton feeders remain in groups just above the reef, in the water column.

AB Independent measurements of radiation, sensible and latent heat fluxes and the ground heat flux are used to describe the annual cycle of the surface energy budget at a high-arctic permafrost site on Svalbard. During summer, the net short-wave radiation is the dominant energy source, while well developed turbulent processes and the heat flux in the ground lead to a cooling of the surface. About 15% of the net radiation is consumed by the seasonal thawing of the active layer in July and August. The Bowen ratio is found to vary between 0.25 and 2, depending on water content of the uppermost soil layer. During the polar night in winter, the net long-wave radiation is the dominant energy loss channel for the surface, which is mainly compensated by the sensible heat flux and, to a lesser extent, by the ground heat flux, which originates from the refreezing of the active layer. The average annual sensible heat flux of -6.9 Wm(-2) is composed of strong positive fluxes in July and August, while negative fluxes dominate during the rest of the year. With 6.8 Wm(-2), the latent heat flux more or less compensates the sensible heat flux in the annual average. Strong evaporation occurs during the snow melt period and particularly during the snow-free period in summer and fall. When the ground is covered by snow, latent heat fluxes through sublimation of snow are recorded, but are insignificant for the average surface energy budget. The near-surface atmospheric stratification is found to be predominantly unstable to neutral, when the ground is snow-free, and stable to neutral for snow-covered ground. Due to long-lasting near-surface inversions in winter, an average temperature difference of approximately 3K exists between the air temperature at 10 m height and the surface temperature of the snow.
   As such comprehensive data sets are sparse for the Arctic, they are of great value to improve process understanding and support modeling efforts on the present-day and future arctic climate and permafrost conditions.

AB Indices are used to quantify change in the environment by reducing aspects of environmental complexity to numbers. Biodiversity indices are typically calculated using the numbers of species and their relative abundances. A recent advance has been the development of additional measures of diversity, such as phylogenetic diversity, based on relationships between organisms. The emerging paradigms of the importance of biodiversity to ecosystem services and the ecosystem approach to fishery management could be well served by the development of indicators of ecosystem functioning. We discuss how relatedness measures may be adapted to quantify aspects of community structure of relevance to ecosystem functioning, by combining information on species' occurrence, life history, and ecological traits. We present an index that reflects average functional distinctness within assemblages. We illustrate the approach using North Sea fish. Results reveal that average functional distinctness is not independent of taxonomic distinctness. This is expected, but the weakness of the relationship suggests that both indices may prove useful, because they are not constrained to convey the same information about samples. Both indices are shown to be weakly related to species richness, which was not expected. This is a consequence of differences in the frequencies of occurrence among species.

AB Individual performance is expected to decrease with age because of senescence. We analyzed long-term data collected on a North American red squirrel population to assess the influence of age on body mass, survival and reproductive performance, and to study the effects of sex and of environmental conditions during early life on senescence patterns. Mass of males and females did not decrease at the end of life, possibly because body mass mostly reflects overall size in income breeders such as red squirrels. On the other hand, we found evidence of senescence in survival of both sexes and, to a lesser extent, in female reproductive traits. When compared to females, males had both higher survival and delayed decrease in survival, suggesting a weaker senescence in males. The offspring survival from weaning to one year of age also decreased with increasing mother age. This suggests that older females produce juveniles of lower quality, providing evidence of an intergenerational effect of mother's age on juveniles' fitness. Finally, our results indicate that variations in food conditions during early life influenced the reproductive tactics of females in the first years of their life, but not senescence patterns.

AB 1. The mechanisms that structure biological communities hold the key to understanding ecosystem functioning and the maintenance of biodiversity. Patterns of species abundances have been proposed as a means of differentiation between niche-based and neutral processes, but abundance information alone cannot provide unequivocal discrimination.
   2. We combined species niche information and species' relative abundances to test the effects of two opposing structuring mechanisms (environmental filtering and niche complementarity) on species' relative abundances in French lacustrine fish communities. The test involved a novel method comparing the abundance-weighted niche overlap within communities against that expected when relative abundances were randomized among species within the community.
   3. Observed overlap was consistently significantly lower than expected at random for two (swimming ability and trophic status) of four primary niche axes across lakes of differing physical environments. Thus, for these niche axes, pairs of abundant species tended to have relatively low niche overlap, while rare species tended to have relatively high niche overlap with abundant species.
   4. This suggests that niche complementarity may have acted to enhance ecosystem function and that it is important for species coexistence in these fish communities. The method used may be easily applied to any sort of biological community and thus may have considerable potential for determining the generality of niche complementarity effects on community structure.

AB In subalpine grasslands, changes in abiotic conditions with decreased management intensity alter the functional composition of plant communities, leading to modifications of ecosystem properties. Here, it is hypothesized that the nature of plant feedbacks on soil moisture is determined by the values of key traits at the community level.
   As community functional parameters of grasslands change along a gradient of land uses, those traits that respond most to differences in abiotic conditions produced by land use changes were identified. A vegetation removal experiment was then conducted to determine how each plant community affected soil moisture.
   Soil moisture was negatively correlated with community root length and positively correlated with canopy height, whereas average leaf area was associated with productivity. These traits were successfully used to predict the effects on soil moisture of each plant community in the removal experiment. This result was validated using data from an additional set of fields.
   These findings demonstrate that the modification of soil moisture following land use change in subalpine grasslands can be mediated through those plant functional traits that respond to water availability.

AB Invasive species richness often is negatively correlated with native species richness at the small spatial scale of sampling plots, but positively correlated in larger areas. The pattern at small scales has been interpreted as evidence that native plants can competitively exclude invasive species. Large-scale patterns have been understood to result from environmental heterogeneity, among other causes. We investigated species richness patterns among submerged and floating-leaved aquatic plants (87 native species and eight invasives) in 103 temperate lakes in Connecticut (northeastern USA) and found neither a consistently negative relationship at small (3-m(2)) scales, nor a positive relationship at large scales. Native species richness at sampling locations was uncorrelated with invasive species richness in 37 of the 60 lakes where invasive plants occurred; richness was negatively correlated in 16 lakes and positively correlated in seven. No correlation between native and invasive species richness was found at larger spatial scales (whole lakes and counties). Increases in richness with area were uncorrelated with abiotic heterogeneity. Logistic regression showed that the probability of occurrence of five invasive species increased in sampling locations (3 m(2), n = 2980 samples) where native plants occurred, indicating that native plant species richness provided no resistance against invasion. However, the probability of three invasive species' occurrence declined as native plant density increased, indicating that density, if not species richness, provided some resistance with these species. Density had no effect on occurrence of three other invasive species. Based on these results, native species may resist invasion at small spatial scales only in communities where density is high (i.e., in communities where competition among individuals contributes to community structure). Most hydrophyte communities, however, appear to be maintained in a nonequilibrial condition by stress and/or disturbance. Therefore, most aquatic plant communities in temperate lakes are likely to be vulnerable to invasion.

AB At small scales, areas with high native diversity are often resistant to invasion, while at large scales, areas with more native species harbor more exotic species, suggesting that different processes control the relationship between native and exotic species diversity at different spatial scales. Although the small-scale negative relationship between native and exotic diversity has a satisfactory explanation, we lack a mechanistic explanation for the change in relationship to positive at large scales. We investigated the native-exotic diversity relationship at three scales (range: 1-4000 km(2)) in California serpentine, a system with a wide range in the productivity of sites from harsh to lush. Native and exotic diversity were positively correlated at all three scales; it is rarer to detect a positive relationship at the small scales within which interactions between individuals occur. However, although positively correlated on average, the small-scale relationship between native and exotic diversity was positive at low-productivity sites and negative at high-productivity sites: Thus, the change in the relationship between native and exotic diversity does not depend on spatial scale per se, but occurs whenever environmental conditions change to promote species coexistence rather than competitive exclusion. This occurred within a single spatial scale when the environment shifted from being locally unproductive to productive.

AB Neutral community theory explains biodiversity, i.e. the coexistence of several species, as the result of a stochastic balance between immigration and extinction on a local level, and between speciation and extinction on a regional level. The most popular model, presented by Hubbell in 2001, has seen many analytical developments in recent years, which can be used in model analysis, model testing and model comparison. We review these developments here, and present alternative derivations and shine previously unnoticed lights on them.

AB We approach the problem of the evolution of bird migration by asking whether migration evolves towards new breeding areas or towards survival areas in the non-breeding season. Thus, we avoid the ambiguity of the usually discussed "southern-home-theory" or "northern-home-theory". We argue that migration evolved in birds that spread to seasonal habitats through gradual dispersal to enhance survival during the non-breeding season; this in contrast to the alternative idea suggesting that migration evolved towards new breeding areas to increase reproductive success. Our synthesis is based on the threshold model explaining how migratory traits can change rapidly through microevolutionary processes. Our model brings former theories together and explains how bird migration, with the appropriate direction and time program, evolves through selection after genetically non-directed events such as dispersal and colonization. The model does not need the former untested assumptions such as competition as a reason for migration and for the disappearance of sedentary populations or higher reproductive success in temperate breeding areas. Our theory offers answers to questions such as how birds with a southern origin may gradually reach northern latitudes, why migration routes may follow historical expansion routes and why birds leave an area for the non-breeding season and move back instead of breeding on their wintering grounds. The theory proposes gradual change through selection and not sudden changes such as long distance dispersal or mutations and can be applied to migration at all latitudes and in all directions. The scenario provides a reasonable concept to understand most of the existing migratory phenomena on the basis of the ecology and genetics of migratory behaviour.

AB Birds are common predators of arthropods in many ecosystems but their impact on spiders has not been assessed. Therefore, the experimental evidence for bird predation effects on spider populations was examined. In particular, the present review focuses on the questions: what are the ecological mechanisms and what are the evolutionary consequences? Data from 17 field experiments, mainly in forest ecosystems, showed that spider communities were often significantly affected by bird predation. Comparisons of experimental effects were based on the ratio of mean density on experimentally enclosed vegetation and on controls. In 27 tests, a significant effect was detected (mean ratio 3.03) but in 9 tests the effect was nonsignificant (mean ratio 1.03). Furthermore, field experimental studies on bird predation effects on certain spider species or certain genera were reviewed. In three investigations, significant predation effects were found on agelenid, linyphiid and theridiid spiders but there were no significant effects on lycosids. Selective bird predation on large individuals has been shown in studies on spider communities and single species. Data on bird predation effects on species richness were lacking although impact on large species was expected to be important. Three field experiments showed that different spider families may experience differences in bird predation pressure. An aviary experiment showed that frequently moving spiders had a higher risk of predation than sedentary individuals, but the evidence from field experiments supporting the hypothesis of high predation pressure on moving spiders was limited. This included sex-specific differences in size and movement, although at least one experiment showed that males had higher winter mortality than females. One experiment showed that bird predation can affect anti-predator behavior. In conclusion, the present evidence showed that bird predation on spiders in several contrasting forest ecosystems is strong. However, there are many hypotheses regarding bird predation on spider populations that should be examined in future field experiments.

AB The degree to which the original community composition of the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale was altered through transport and decay and how taphonomic conditions varied through time and across taxa is poorly understood. To address these issues, variation in fossil preservation was analyzed through a vertical succession of 26 bed assemblages, each representing a single obrution event, within the 7-m-thick Greater Phyllopod Bed of the Walcott Quarry. More than 50,000 specimens belonging to 158 genera-mostly benthic, mono-specific and nonbiomineralized-were included in this analysis. The decay gradient of the polychaete Burgessochaeta setigera was used as a taphonomic threshold to estimate how far decay had proceeded in each bed assemblage.
   Qualitative comparisons of the degree of preservation of 15 species, representing an array of different body plans, demonstrate that all bed assemblages contain a mix of articulated and in situ dissociated or completely dissociated organisms interpreted respectively as census- and time-averaged assemblages. Furthermore: (1) most organisms studied were preserved within their habitat and only slightly disturbed during burial; (2) most decay processes took place prior to burial and resulted in disarticulation of organisms at the time of burial; (3) the degree of disarticulation was variable within individuals of the same population and between populations; and (4) early mineralization of tissues across all body plans occurred soon after burial.
   Canonical correspondence analysis summarizes the apparent variations in the amount of preburial decay, or time averaging, across species, individuals, and bed assemblages. The effect of time averaging, however, must have been limited because rarefaction curves reveal no link between decay and species richness. This suggests that decay is not an important community controlling factor. Overall, our data suggest that transport was trivial and the traditional distinction between a pre- and postslide environment is unnecessary. It is likely that all specimens present at the time of burial would have been preserved independent of their original tissue composition and degree of preburial decay.
   The presence of extensive sheets of Morania confluens, a putative benthic cyanobacterium, in most bed assemblages suggests that it: (1) provided a stable substrate and food source for a number of benthic metazoans, and (2) played a possible role in the preservation of non-biomineralized animals, acting as a barrier in maintaining local anoxic pore-water conditions.

AB Contrary to early predictions of sperm competition theory, postcopulatory sexual selection favoring increased investment per sperm (e.g., sperm size, sperm quality) has been demonstrated in numerous organisms. We empirically demonstrate for Drosophila melanogaster that both sperm quality and sperm quantity independently contribute to competitive male fertilization success. In addition to these independent effects, there was a significant interaction between sperm quality and quantity that suggests an internal positive reinforcement on selection for sperm quality, with selection predicted to intensify as investment per sperm increases and the number of sperm competing declines. The mechanism underlying the sperm quality advantage is elucidated through examination of the relationship between female sperm-storage organ morphology and the differential organization of different length sperm within the organ. Our results exemplify that primary sex cells can bear secondary sexual straits.

ID BROWN HARE; PALLAS
AB Populations of European hares (Lepus europaeus) have experienced a dramatic decline throughout Europe in recent decades. European hares are assumed to prefer weeds over arable crops, and weed abundance was reduced by the intensification of agriculture. Therefore, modern agriculture has been blamed as a major factor affecting European hare populations. However, it is questionable whether European hares select weeds at all, as previous studies had major methodological limitations. By comparing availability and use of plants with Chesson's Electivity Index, we investigated whether the European hare actually feeds selectively on different plants in arable land. Food availability and use were dominated by cultivated crops (e.g. winter wheat, spring barley and sugar beet). Diet selection analysis revealed that in autumn and winter, European hares predominantly preferred cultivated crops (winter wheat) and food items provided by hunters (tubers of sugar beet and carrot). In spring and summer, apart from soy, only weeds (e.g. clover and corn poppy) were positively selected, especially after cereal crops were harvested. We suggest that the decline in European hare populations throughout Europe was facilitated by the decrease in weed abundance. Wildlife-friendly set-asides in arable land have the potential to reconcile the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy with wildlife conservation.

AB Male parental care is typically thought to come at a cost to mate attraction and future mating success. However, it has also been hypothesized that paternal care may be under sexual, as well as natural, selection, such that good fathers actually attract more mates. Here we show experimentally that in the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus, females prefer to mate with males that provide higher levels of parental care. We manipulated male behavior using (1) different nest sizes and (2) an application of low-O-2 water in the nests, and found that females consistently preferred males with elevated levels of care in dichotomous mate choice tests. This complements our earlier study in which we showed that males increase the amount and quality of care they provide in the presence of females. Our results demonstrate that male care may have evolved as a result of sexual selection rather than natural selection alone, and furthermore, that male care may not necessarily be in conflict with mate attraction.

TI Genetic relationship and diversity in a sesame (Sesamum indicum L.)
   germplasm collection using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)

DT Article
ID ACCESSIONS
AB Background: Sesame is an important oil crop in tropical and subtropical areas. Despite its nutritional value and historic and cultural importance, the research on sesame has been scarce, particularly as far as its genetic diversity is concerned. The aims of the present study were to clarify genetic relationships among 32 sesame accessions from the Venezuelan Germplasm Collection, which represents genotypes from five diversity centres ( India, Africa, China-Korea-Japan, Central Asia and Western Asia), and to determine the association between geographical origin and genetic diversity using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP).
   Results: Large genetic variability was found within the germplasm collection. A total of 457 AFLP markers were recorded, 93 % of them being polymorphic. The Jaccard similarity coefficient ranged from 0.38 to 0.85 between pairs of accessions. The UPGMA dendrogram grouped 25 of 32 accessions in two robust clusters, but it has not revealed any association between genotype and geographical origin. Indian, African and Chinese-Korean-Japanese accessions were distributed throughout the dendrogram. A similar pattern was obtained using principal coordinates analysis. Genetic diversity studies considering five groups of accessions according to the geographic origin detected that only 20 % of the total diversity was due to diversity among groups using Nei's coefficient of population differentiation. Similarly, only 5% of the total diversity was attributed to differences among groups by the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). This small but significant difference was explained by the fact that the Central Asia group had a lower genetic variation than the other diversity centres studied.
   Conclusion: We found that our sesame collection was genetically very variable and did not show an association between geographical origin and AFLP patterns. This result suggests that there was considerable gene flow among diversity centres. Future germplasm collection strategies should focus on sampling a large number of plants. Covering many diversity centres is less important because each centre represents a major part of the total diversity in sesame, Central Asia centre being the only exception. The same recommendation holds for the choice of parents for segregant populations used in breeding projects. The traditional assumption that selecting genotypes of different geographical origin will maximize the diversity available to a breeding project does not hold in sesame.

AB Viewing river systems within a landscape context is a relatively new and rapidly developing approach to river ecology. Although the linkages among landscapes and associated physicochemical and biological characteristics of rivers have long been recognized, the development of conceptual frameworks and tools for measuring and synthesizing such linkages is relatively recent. In this book, authors from the United States and Canada explore new ideas about landscape-river relationships, river research, and river management; compile large regional, spatially referenced, survey data sets on river network characteristics; explore and describe patterns and relationships across survey sites, reaches, and catchments; and develop management and decision tools. In synthesizing these chapters, we have identified key challenges to studying and managing landscape-river systems. Key challenges include identifying appropriate units of measurement and interpretation of the river network, understanding how human alterations of land cover modify river characteristics and biological assemblages, understanding and measuring how various spatial-scale factors interactively influence instream habitat and biota, and collecting and gathering appropriate landscape and instream habitat data. This book also reveals the major current knowledge gaps that deserve more attention in landscape-river ecology. These include improving river-landscape classification, capturing appropriate spatial- and temporal-scale data, developing accurate predictive models where study data are limited, and improving our ability to measure connectivity among river segments and their networks. Future research that focuses on overcoming the challenges and filling the knowledge gaps will substantially improve our understanding of river ecosystems, fuel the development of tools for linking the functions and processes operating at different spatial- and temporal-scales, and stimulate the development of new hypotheses and frameworks to provide foundations for the next phases of riverine science and management.

AB Aquatic microbes, like all organisms, have biogeographies, but this subject has attracted relatively little attention. In this review, recent results exploiting techniques of molecular biology are summarized to place in perspective the studies of this Theme Section. The studies considered concern large-scale patterns of spatial distribution among heterotrophic planktonic prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes. For freshwater bacterioplankton communities, reported patterns are inconsistent. Taxonomic richness may increase with system size, and composition may be related among neighboring bodies of water. However, inconsistencies in patterns may be due to differences in the temporal and spatial scales considered. Among planktonic marine prokaryotes, biogeographic patterns are known only in terms of high level groups, e.g. Archea are perhaps dominant in deep oceanic waters. However, studies of large-scale patterns have just begun and they suggest that some ribotypes or species may be restricted to certain oceanic areas. Eukaryotic microbes appear to characterised by high capacities for both dispersal and gene flow. Recent studies appear to conclude that we can form morphological, genetic and physiological groupings but their inter-relationships are obscure at this point in time.

AB Nitrogen processing in treatment wetlands was investigated by use of the stable isotope (15)N introduced as ammonium. Two small field-scale, gravel-bed wetlands with horizontal subsurface-flow (SSF) received primary meat processing water. Four SSF cascade mesocosms, each comprising five tanks in series, received primary meat processing water, primary dairy water, secondary dairy water or aerated secondary dairy water. The mesocosms and one of the field-scale wetland contained well-established bulrushes (Schoenoplectus tabernaentomani), and the other field-scale wetland remained unvegetated. The systems were operated at steady inflows, with a nominal detention times of 4-5 days. The incoming ammonium nitrogen ranged from 18.5 to 177 g m(-3), and removals ranged from 15 to 90% for the various feed waters. Each system was dosed with a single pulse of (15)N ammonium mixed into the feed wastewater, and the fate and transport of the isotopic nitrogen were determined. The (15)N pulses took 120 days to clear the heavily loaded field-scale wetlands. During this period small reductions in (15)N were attributable to nitrification/denitrification, and a larger reduction due to plant uptake. Mesocosm tests ran for 24 days, during which only 1-16% of the tracer exited with water, increasing with N loading. Very little tracer gas emission was found (similar to 1%). The majority of the tracer was found in plants (6-48%) and sediments (28-37%). These results indicated a rapid absorption of ammonium into a large sediment storage pool, of which only a small proportion was denitrified during the period of the experiment. Plant uptake claimed a fraction of the ammonium, determined mainly by the plants requirement for growth rather than the magnitude of the nitrogen supply. A rapid return of ammonium to the water was also found, so that movement of (15)N through the wetland mesocosms was comprised of a spiral of uptake and release along the flow path. A two compartment model was found to reasonably represent the isotope progress through the wetlands. First order exchanges and removals were employed in dynamic mass balances on water and solids. It is concluded that interpretation of nitrogen dynamics in wetlands must include the nitrogen spiral through the wetland, as well as plant uptake. This greatly increases the N residence time in treatment wetlands relative to the hydraulic detention time, resulting in long delays of treatment system response to changes in N loading and attenuation of short-term fluctuations in loading.

AB Extensive variation in fractional resorption of mineral elements from plant leaves is still not fully understood. In multi-species forest stands, species leaf fall phenology and leaf constitution may significantly modify the timing of nutrient return to the soil and overall plant nutrient loss We studied leaf fall and nutrient loss kinetics, and leaf composition in three natural, temperate, deciduous broadleaf forest stands to determine the role of timing of leaf abscission and nutrient immobilization in cell walls on nutrient resorption efficiency of senescing leaves. Nitrogen (N), phosphorus and potassium contents decreased continuously in attached leaves after peak physiological activity during mid-season. Changes in nutrient contents of attached leaves were paralleled by decreases in nutrient contents in freshly fallen leaf litter. In different species and for different nutrients, resorption of nutrients from senescing leaves proceeded with different kinetics, The maximum nutrient resorption efficiency (the fraction of specific nutrient resorbed from the leaves at the end of leaf fall) did not depend on the mid-seasonal nutrient concentration. Species with earlier leaf fall resorbed leaf nutrients at a faster rate, partly compensating for the earlier leaf fall. Nevertheless, the litter-mass weighted mean nutrient contents in leaf litter were still larger in species with earlier leaf fall, demonstrating an inherent trade-off between early leaf fall and efficient nutrient resorption. This trade-off was most important for N. Losses of the non-mobile nutrients calcium and magnesium were unaffected by the timing of leaf fall. There was large variation in the maximum N resorption efficiency among species. Correlations among leaf chemical variables suggested that the maximum N resorption efficiency decreased with the increasing fraction of cell walls in the leaves, possibly due to a greater fraction of N occluded in cell wall matrix. We conclude that species leaf fall phenology and leaf chemistry modify the timing and quantities of plant nutrient losses, and that more diverse forest stands supporting a spectrum of species with different phenologies and leaf types produce litter with more variable chemical characteristics than monotypic stands.

AB Preventing and controlling exotic plants remains a key challenge in any ecological restoration, and most efforts are currently aimed at local scales. We combined local- and landscape-scale approaches to identify factors that were most closely associated with invasion of riparian forests by exotic shrubs (Amur honeysuckle [Lonicera maackii] and Tatarian honeysuckle [L. tatarica]) in Ohio, U.S.A. Twenty sites were selected in mature riparian forests along a rural-urban gradient (< 1-47% urban land cover). Within each site, we measured percent cover of Lonicera spp. and native trees and shrubs, percent canopy cover, and facing edge aspect. We then developed 10 a priori models based on local- and landscape-level variables that we hypothesized would influence percent cover of Lonicera spp. within 25 m of the forest edge. To determine which of these models best fit the data, we used an information-theoretic approach and Akaike's information criterion. Percent cover of Lonicera was best explained by the proportion of urban land cover within 1 km of riparian forests. In particular, percent cover of Lonicera was greater in forests within more urban landscapes than in forests within rural landscapes. Results suggest that surrounding land uses influence invasion by exotic shrubs, and explicit consideration of land uses may improve our ability to predict or limit invasion. Moreover, identifying land uses that increase the risk of invasion may inform restoration efforts.

AB Regional estimates or prediction of crop production is critical for many applications such as agricultural lands management, food security warning system, food trade policy and carbon cycle research. Remote sensing offers great potential for regional production monitoring and estimates, yet uncertainties associated with are rarely addressed. Moreover, although crops are one of critical biomes in global carbon cycle research, few evidences are available on the performance of global models of terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP) in estimating regional crop NPP. In this study, we use high quality weather and crop data to calibrate model parameter. validate and compare two kinds of remote sensing based production efficiency models, i.e. the Carnegie-Ames-Stan ford-Approach (CASA) and Global Production Efficiency Model Version 2.0 (GLO-PEM2), in estimating maize production across China. Results show that both models intend to underestimate maize yields, although they also overestimate maize yields much at some regions. There are no significant differences between the results from CASA and GLO-PEM2 models in terms of both estimated production and spatial pattern. CASA model simulates better in the areas with dense crop and weather data for calibration. Otherwise GLO-PEM2 model does better. Whether the water soil-moisture down-regulator is used or not should depend on the percent of irrigation lands at the regions. The improved and validated models can be used for many applications. Further improvement can be expected by increasing remote sensing image resolution and the number of surface data stations. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Many examples of the appearance of similar traits in different lineages are known during the evolution of organisms. However, the underlying genetic mechanisms have been elucidated in very few cases. Here, we provide a clear example of evolutionary parallelism, involving changes in the same genetic pathway, providing functional adaptation of RH1 pigments to deep-water habitats during the adaptive radiation of East African cichlid fishes. We determined the RH1 sequences from 233 individual cichlids. The reconstruction of cichlid RH1 pigments with 11-cis-retinal from 28 sequences showed that the absorption spectra of the pigments of nine species were shifted toward blue, tuned by two particular amino acid replacements. These blue-shifted RH1 pigments might have evolved as adaptations to the deep-water photic environment. Phylogenetic evidence indicates that one of the replacements, A292S, has evolved several times independently, inducing similar functional change. The parallel evolution of the same mutation at the same amino acid position suggests that the number of genetic changes underlying the appearance of similar traits in cichlid diversification may be fewer than previously expected.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation currently threaten ecosystems worldwide, yet remain difficult to quantify because within-fragment habitat and landscape-scale influences often interact in unique ways. Although individual species respond to fragmentation differently, large-scale conservation planning must unavoidably target multiple species. Although information on a population's response to fragmentation is critical, and measurements of species richness provide useful insights, exclusive reliance on these responses may mask important information about the taxonomic composition of assemblages in response to fragmentation. The North American tallgrass prairie ecosystem is one of the most threatened and fragmented ecosystems in the world, and insects are significant contributors to its biodiversity. In remaining grassland fragments, we evaluated within-fragment influences in conjunction with landscape-scale responses of representative insect communities from four feeding guilds: generalists, specialists, multiple life stage habitat use, and predators. Fragment-specific attributes capable of. influencing insect diversity include plant species composition, plant biomass, abundance of blooming flowers, and vertical habitat heterogeneity created by the vegetation. Landscape-scale factors expected to influence patterns of insect species diversity include fragment size and shape as well as the spatial configuration of fragments. Ordination techniques were used to summarize composition of each feeding guild assemblage of each fragment, and structural equation modeling was used to examine the direct and indirect effects of fragmentation with influences from local habitats. Generalists (Orthoptera), mixed-modality feeding that changes with life stage (Lepidoptera), and specialist herbivores (Curculionidae) all responded directly to within-site characterizations of the plant community. Site management from large ungulate grazing or mowing for hay production consistently had an indirect effect on the insect community through influences on plant community composition. The predator assemblage (Coccinellidae) was influenced directly by fragment shape. To maintain insect biodiversity in tallgrass prairie fragments, these results indicate that conservation practices should focus on communities in order to maintain insect biodiversity in tallgrass prairie fragments. Landscape-scale factors must also be considered when making conservation decisions, primarily because predators (top trophic level organisms) are more likely to respond to regional changes.

AB Coenagrion mercuriale (Charpentier) (Odonata: Zygoptera) is one of Europe's most threatened damselflies and is listed in the European Habitats directive. We combined an intensive mark-release-recapture (MRR) study with a microsatellite-based genetic analysis for C. mercuriale from the Itchen Valley, UK, as part of an effort to understand the dispersal characteristics of this protected species. MRR data indicate that adult damselflies are highly sedentary, with only a low frequency of interpatch movement that is predominantly to neighbouring sites. This restricted dispersal leads to significant genetic differentiation throughout most of the Itchen Valley, except between areas of continuous habitat, and isolation by distance (IBD), even though the core populations are separated by less than 10 km. An urban area separating some sites had a strong effect on the spatial genetic structure. Average pairwise relatedness between individual damselflies is positive at short distances, reflecting fine-scale genetic clustering and IBD both within- and between-habitat patches. Damselflies from a fragmented habitat have higher average kinship than those from a large continuous population, probably because of poorer dispersal and localized breeding in the former. Although indirect estimates of gene flow must be interpreted with caution, it is encouraging that our results indicate that the spatial pattern of genetic variation matches closely with that expected from direct observations of movement. These data are further discussed with respect to possible barriers to dispersal within the study site and the ecology and conservation of C. mercuriale. To our knowledge, this is the first report of fine-scale genetic structuring in any zygopteran species.

AB We examined the hypothesis that the extent of vegetation cover governs the fluxes of nutrients from boreal and subarctic river catchments to the sea. Fluxes of total organic carbon (TOC) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus, and dissolved silicate (DIN, DIP, and DSi, respectively) are described from 19 river catchments and subcatchments (ranging in size from 34 to 40,000 km(2)) in northern Sweden with a detailed analysis of the rivers Lulealven and Kalixalven. Fluxes of TOC, DIP, and DSi increase by an order of magnitude with increasing proportion of forest and wetland area, whereas DIN did not follow this pattern but remained constantly low. Principal component analysis on landscape variables showed the importance of almost all land cover and soil type variables associated with vegetation, periglacial environment, soil and bedrock with slow weathering rates, boundary of upper tree line, and percentage of lake area. A cluster analysis of the principal components showed that the river systems could be separated into mountainous headwaters and forest and wetland catchments. This clustering was also valid in relation to river chemistry (TOC, DIP, and DSi) and was confirmed with a redundancy analysis, including river chemistry and principal components as environmental variables. The first axis explains 89% of the variance in river chemistry and almost 100% of the variance in the relation between river chemistry and landscape variables. These results suggest that vegetation change during interglacial periods is likely to have had a major effect on inputs of TOC, DIP, and DSi into the past ocean.

AB We compared the dietary composition, feeding preferences, and food selection of the introduced crayfish, Procambarus clarkii in a natural and a transformed freshwater marsh (rice field) in the lower Guadalquivir basin (southern Spain). Both habitats differed in hydroperiod and food item diversity.
   Food item diversity in crayfish stomachs is correlated with prey availability, which is significantly higher in the natural marsh. Herrera's index was low in both areas if compared with the theoretical maximum. P. clarkii behaves like a generalist in this area and individual crayfish have very similar feeding preferences.
   The most frequent items in the stomach were fresh macrophytes, detritus, and sediment grains. However, especially in the untransformed marsh, insect larvae formed an important part of the crayfish's diet, up to 67% by occurrence, with a marked seasonal pattern: crayfish in this area consumed significantly more animal prey in spring than in winter.
   P. clarkii positively selects for insect larvae (mayflies, chironomids), snails, and microcrustaceans except ostracodes. Negative selection against oligochaetes is explained by their burrowing behaviour and the difficulty to detect them in the stomachs. Cannibalism is stronger in the rice fields as a consequence of high crayfish densities.
   Animal food for adult P clarkii is shown to be more important than previously reported. Overestimation of herbivory and detrivory in this omnivorous species might be due to serious methodological drawbacks associated with stomach content analyses.

AB Spatial flows of materials and organisms across ecosystem boundaries are ubiquitous. Understanding the consequences of these flows should be a basic goal of ecosystem science, and yet it has received scant theoretical treatment to date. Here, using a simple, open, nutrient-limited ecosystem model with trophic interactions, we explore theoretically how spatial flows affect the functioning of local ecosystems, how physical mass-balance constraints interact with biological demographic constraints in the regulation of this functioning, and how failure to consider these constraints explicitly can lead to models that are ecologically inconsistent. In particular, we show that standard prey-dependent models for trophic interactions may lead to implausible outcomes when embedded in an ecosystem context with appropriate mass flows and mass-balance constraints. Our analysis emphasizes the need for integration of population, community, and ecosystem perspectives in ecology and the critical consequences of assuming closed versus open systems.

AB The spatial pattern at alpine tree line may be part of a feedback process in which wind plays a central role. The basic aspects Of Such a feedback were embedded in a cellular automaton. Spatial metrics of the patterns generated by this simulation and those of observed patterns at a windy tree line site were ordinated using Principal Component Analysis. Only the Simulations that included a directionally weighted feedback fell close to the observed sites in ordination space. MANOVA indicated that the directionally weighted feedback is most important in structuring the tree line pattern, but that random hotspots for establishment and the overall steepness of the environmental gradient from forest to tundra in space also have an effect. The importance of wind in determining feedback with the spatial pattern of a canopy indicates that non-linear reactions to climatic change are likely.

AB The role of interspecific hybridisation in the evolution of pest species is poorly understood. In mosquito disease vectors this is of particular importance due to the evolution of insecticide resistance and the proposed release of transgenic strains that are refractory to the malaria parasite. In this study, we apply population genetic methods in a novel manner to determine whether mitochondrial DNA sequences have introgressed between the closely related African malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae and A. arabiensis. Our results suggest that speciation was geologically recent and ancestral haplotypes at the ND5 locus are retained in both species. In addition, comparing haplotype frequencies in allopatric and sympatric populations, suggest locale specific unidirectional introgression of mitochondria from A. arabiensis into A. gambiae.

AB Organisms may respond to changing environments by evading the new conditions or by adapting to them. Recently, a large body of evidence has been collected indicating that phenotypic adaptation to climate change is widespread. Adaptation may be achieved by phenotypic adjustment or by changes in the genetic composition of populations. Both processes can assure the survival of populations in changing environments, but at different time scales and at different costs. Recent studies indicate that the mechanisms leading to adaptive phenotypic changes in birds may be complex, involving both plastic response and genetic change. Changes in the timing of breeding, for instance, seem to be predominantly caused by phenotypic adjustment to environmental conditions. Shifts in the genetic composition of populations have been demonstrated to be involved in recent changes in morphology and migratory behaviour. The presence of considerable amounts of additive genetic variation within and among avian populations, and examples of rapid evolutionary response to rare climatic events suggest that birds have a high potential for adaptive evolutionary change. However, it is presently unclear whether this is a general pattern, and which factors actually limit the adaptability of avian populations. Antagonistic genetic correlations and maladaptive phenotypic responses (evolutionary traps) are probably the most important constrains to microevolutionary change. Furthermore, the loss of genetic variation due to population declines, and gene flow in the presence of among-population variation in the response to climate change may limit the rate of adaptive evolution. Future research should try to identify the targets of selection and gauge the importance of constraints to microevolutionary change.

AB In Alberta, Canada (1982-2001), and in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, United States (19872001), wolves (Canis lupus) killed various domestic animals, among which the major prey were sheep in the United States (68%, n = 494) and cattle in Canada (95%; n = 1633). Under recovery programs, the wolf population increased in the United States, and depredation events increased proportionately. In both countries, the number of domestic animals killed each year was correlated with the number of wolves killed by government authorities for depredation management. We tested the ability of antiwolf barriers made of flags hanging from ropes to impede wolf access to food and livestock. In 18 experiments, barriers prevented captive wolves (n = 9) from accessing food for up to 28 hours and allowed daily separation of wolves to administer contraceptive pills to a female wolf. Barriers prevented access by wild wolves to 100-m(2) baited sites during two 60-day tests. We also set barriers around three cattle pastures. In Alberta during two 60-day trials on 25-ha pastures, wolves approached barriers on 23 occasions but did not cross them, and no cattle were killed. Wolves killed cattle on neighboring ranches during the trials and before and after the trials on the tested ranches. In Idaho four radio collared wolves crossed barriers and killed cattle in a 400-ha ranch after 61 days of barrier exposure. Our results suggest that antiwolf barriers are effective in deterring captive and wild wolves for >1 and 60 days, respectively, and that wild wolves switch to alternative livestock when excluded from one herd of livestock. Our depredation data indicate that protecting livestock from wolves reduces the necessity for killing wolves. Barriers could play a role among the limited set of preventive measures available and offer a cost-effective mitigation tool for the problem of livestock depredation on a local scale.

AB Exposure to contaminants can affect survivorship, recruitment, reproductive success, mutation rates and migration, and may play a significant role in the partitioning of genetic variation among exposed and nonexposed populations. However, the application of molecular population genetic data to evaluate such influences has been uncommon and often flawed. We tested whether patterns of genetic variation among native fish populations (Sacramento sucker, Catostomus occidentalis) in the Central Valley of California were consistent with long-term pesticide exposure history, or primarily with expectations based on biogeography. Field sampling was designed to rigorously test for both geographical and contamination influences. Fine-scale structure of these interconnected populations was detected with both amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and microsatellite markers, and patterns of variation elucidated by the two marker systems were highly concordant. Analyses indicated that biogeographical hypotheses described the data set better than hypotheses relating to common historical pesticide exposure. Downstream populations had higher genetic diversity than upstream populations, regardless of exposure history, and genetic distances showed that populations from the same river system tended to cluster together. Relatedness among populations reflected primarily directions of gene flow, rather than convergence among contaminant-exposed populations. Watershed geography accounted for significant partitioning of genetic variation among populations, whereas contaminant exposure history did not. Genetic patterns indicating contaminant-induced selection, increased mutation rates or recent bottlenecks were weak or absent. We stress the importance of testing contaminant-induced genetic change hypotheses within a biogeographical context. Strategic application of molecular markers for analysis of fine-scale structure, and for evaluating contaminant impacts on gene pools, is discussed.

AB When individuals in a population differ in physiological condition and residual reproductive value, selection should favor phenotypic plasticity in reproductive investment such that individuals are able to adopt the reproductive tactic that results in the highest fitness under given conditions. Here we examined reproductive tactics in relation to the elaboration of condition-dependent sexual ornamentation (carotenoid breast coloration) in a Montana population of the house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus). Males used distinct reproductive tactics depending on elaboration of their sexual ornamentation. Males with red pigmentation (maximum ornament elaboration) paired with females that nested earlier, but these males did little provisioning of incubating females and nestlings. In contrast, males with yellow coloration paired with females that nested later, but these males fed female and nestlings more. Consequently, for red males offspring recruitment was primarily affected by earlier nest initiation, whereas in yellow males it was affected most by male provisioning. In males with intermediate plumage coloration, all measured components, nest initiation, provisioning of incubating female, and nestling feeding, strongly contributed to offspring recruitment. The fitness consequences of alternative reproductive tactics of males were influenced by breeding experience and fidelity of their mates. Among first-time breeders, red males achieved the highest fecundity because of the advantage gained through early nesting and pairing with more experienced females and because of compensation by their mates for low male provisioning of nestlings. Among experienced breeders, males with intermediate plumage coloration achieved the highest fecundity because of the combined benefits of relatively early pairing and high parental care. High variation in sexual ornamentation in a Montana population of house finches may favor distinct associations of sexual displays with a particular set of reproductive behaviors.

Increasing the number of pollen donors had a positive effect oil reproductive success in small and large populations, but at the highest pollen diversity this occurred at the expense of slightly reduced offspring fitness Because the total amount of transferred pollen was held constant, these effects could not be attributed to increasing pollen load Rather. the increasing pollen diversity may have increased the chances of selecting a particularly "good" donor for fertilization-an example of a sampling effect of diversity. Pollen from outside a population or from 10-100 in away resulted in higher reproductive success and greater offspring size Effects Of Population size and pollination treatments oil reproductive success and offspring fitness were additive.

AB We present an individual-based model that uses artificial evolution to predict fit behavior and life-history traits on the basis of environmental data and organism physiology. Our main purpose is to investigate whether artificial evolution is a suitable tool for studying life history and behavior of real biological organisms. The evolutionary adaptation is founded on a genetic algorithm that searches for improved solutions to the traits under scrutiny. From the genetic algorithm's "genetic code," behavior is determined using an artificial neural network. The marine planktivorous fish Muller's pearlside (Maurolicus muelleri) is used as the model organism because of the broad knowledge of its behavior and life history, by which the model's performance is evaluated. The model adapts three traits: habitat choice, energy allocation, and spawning strategy. We present one simulation with, and one without, stochastic juvenile survival. Spawning pattern, longevity, and energy allocation are the life-history traits most affected by stochastic juvenile survival. Predicted behavior is in good agreement with field observations and with previous modeling results, validating the usefulness of the presented model in particular and artificial evolution in ecological modeling in general. The advantages, possibilities, and limitations of this modeling approach are further discussed.

AB 1. Persistence and stability of lotic invertebrate communities were determined at an annual time scale over a 9-year period (1990-98) at 26 river sites over the northern half of New Zealand. In addition, a number of water quality variables were measured monthly and flow information collected continuously over the same period at each site.
   2. The aim of the study was to describe the levels of interannual variability in invertebrate communities, and relate community changes to variability in environmental conditions. The consequences of this temporal variability for the sensitivity of predictive models were also investigated.
   3. Levels of change in environmental conditions varied significantly between years, but were relatively similar across sites. In contrast, community persistence (similarity between years in species assemblage composition), and stability (similarity between years with respect to relative abundance of species in the community) both varied significantly between sites, but changes between years were similar. Community stability was highest at sites with relatively harsh flow conditions (high coefficient of variation, high relative size of floods), and was also greater in communities dominated by Ephemeroptera.
   4. Relationships between change in environmental conditions and changes in community composition and structure were relatively weak for most individual sites. However, when average levels of change for each of the 26 sites were used, communities showed greater persistence under conditions where flow conditions remained relatively constant. Water quality changes had no significant effect on community persistence when assessed for all 26 sites combined.
   5. Results from this study suggest that lotic invertebrate communities fluctuate around a relatively stable state, at least over a 9-year period. However, the extent of interannual variation in community composition and structure observed, along with the relatively low degree of cluster fidelity observed within a single region, suggests that predictive models based on reference site conditions extrapolated over several years should be applied with caution in New Zealand streams.

AB Practitioners of nematode taxonomy have rarely been explicit about what species represent or how data are being used to delimit species prior to their description. This lack of explicitness reflects the broader species problem common to all biology: there is no universally accepted idea of what species are and, as a consequence, scientists disagree on how to go about finding species in nature. However, like other biologists, nernatologists seem to agree that species are real and discrete units in nature, and that they result from descent with modification. This evolutionary perspective provides a conceptual framework for nernatologists to view species as independent evolutionary lineages, and provides approaches for their delimitation. Specifically, species may be delimited scientifically by methods that can test the hypothesis of lineage independence. For sequence data, such hypothesis testing should be based on sampling many individual organisms for multiple loci to avoid mistaking tokogeny and gene trees as evidence of species. Evolutionary approaches to analysing data and delimiting species avoid the inherent pitfalls in approaches that use all observed sequence differences to define species through calculation of a genetic distance. To illustrate evolutionary species delimitation, molecular data are used to test the hypothesis that hookworms parasitic in northern fur seals and in California sea lions represent separate species. The advantages and potential caveats of employing nucleotide sequence data for species delimitation are discussed, and the merits of evolutionary approaches are contrasted to inherent problems in similarity-based methods.

AB A goal of landscape ecology is to infer processes or constraints that generate spatial pattern in communities and ecosystems . The rich tradition of plant community ecology is now being extended to address spatial pattern in vegetation over large spatial extents. The challenge ill this is that vegetation pattern oil landscapes is fine-grained, which presents sampling problems for large study areas. Further spatial autocorrelation in ecological data, coupled with strong patterns of correlation among environmental factors (such as the gradient complexes governed by elevation) make it difficult to make it clear inferences about the agents patterning landscape-scale vegetation. Here we review the methods of plant community ecology as extended to landscapes and illustrate the challenges with a case study from Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park in California's southern Sierra Nevada. We outline an iterative approach to such studies, with threee stages. The first stage is a pilot study to characterize the spatial scaling of environmental factors presumed to be important to vegetation: this stage can often be conducted virtually, using digital terrain data. The second stage is iterative and consists of building a preliminary explanatory model using a combination of ordination, classification, and Mantel tests: all analyses based on the same ecological distance or dissimilarity matrices. This preliminary model is then attacked to find its uncertain or sensitive parts and these parametric conditions are mapped into geographic space to identify candidate sites for follow up field studies in the third stage. This approach ensures that the most uncertain aspects of the preliminary model are refined in an efficient manner. As the approach proceeds toward a richer understanding of species environment relationships and vegetation pattern, a need emerges for new kinds of field studies and novel extensions to existing statistical analyses. We discuss possible extensions of these as a natural consequence of this iterative process of model construction and revision.

AB 1. The taxonomic composition and biomass of the phytoplankton and the taxonomic composition of the phytobenthos of the San Joaquin River and its major tributaries were examined in relation to water chemistry, habitat and flow regime. Agricultural drainage and subsurface flow contribute to a complex gradient of salinity and nutrients in this eutrophic, 'lowland type' river.
   2. Because of light-limiting conditions for growth, maintenance demands of the algae exceed production during summer and autumn in the San Joaquin River where there is no inflow from tributaries. In contrast to substantial gains in concentration of inorganic nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus during the summer of normal-flow years, net losses of algal biomass (2-4 mug L-1 day(-1) chlorophyll a) occurred in a mid-river segment with no significant tributary inflow. However, downstream of a large tributary draining the Sierra Nevada, a substantial net gain in algal biomass (6-11 mug L-1 day(-1)) occurred in the summer, but not in the spring (loss of 1-6 mug L-1 day(-1)) or autumn (loss of 2-5 mug L-1 day(-1)).
   3. The phytoplankton was dominated in summer by 'r-selected' centric diatoms (Thalassiosirales), species both tolerant of variable salinity and widely distributed in the San Joaquin River. Pennate diatoms were proportionally more abundant (in biomass) in the winter, spring and autumn. Abundant taxa included the diatoms Cyclotella meneghiniana, Skeletonema cf. potamos, Cyclostephanos invisitatus, Thalassiosira weissflogii, Nitzschia acicularis, N. palea and N. reversa, and the chlorophytes Chlamydomonas sp. and Scenesdesmus quadricauda. Patterns in the abundance of species indicated that assembly of the phytoplankton is limited more by light and flow regime than by nutrient supply.
   4. The phytobenthos was dominated by larger, more slowly reproducing pennate diatoms. Few of the abundant species are euryhaline. The diatoms Navicula recens and Nitzschia inconspicua and cyanophytes, Oscillatoria spp., were the principal late-summer benthic species upstream in the mainstem and in drainages of the San Joaquin Valley. Many of the other abundant diatoms (Amphora veneta, Bacillaria paxillifer, Navicula symmetrica, Nitzschia amphibia, N. fonticola, N. palea, Pleurosigma salinarum) of late-summer assemblages in these segments also are motile species. While many of these species also were abundant in segments downstream of confluences with rivers draining the Sierra Nevada, the relative abundance of prostrate (Cocconeis placentula var. euglypta, Navicula minima) and erect or stalked (Achnanthidium deflexum, Achnanthes lanceolata, Gomphonema kobayasii, G. parvulum var. lagenula) diatoms and Stigeoclonium sp. was greater in these lower San Joaquin River segments.
   5. A weighted-averaging regression model, based on salinity and benthic-algal abundance in the San Joaquin River and segments of its major tributaries within the San Joaquin Valley, yielded a highly significant coefficient-of-determination (r(2) = 0.84) and low prediction error between salinity inferred from the species and that observed, indicating that salinity tolerance is a primary constraint on growth and assembly of the phytobenthos. The same measures of predictability indicated poor performance of a model based on inorganic nitrogen. However, with a greater representation of tributaries (including segments within the Sierra Nevada foothills) in the sample set, an inorganic nitrogen model also yielded a highly significant coefficient-of-determination (r(2) = 0.87) and low prediction error between the species-inferred and the observed concentration. As with the salinity model (r(2) = 0.94) for the enlarged data set, a systematic difference (increased deviation of residuals) existed at high inorganic nitrogen concentrations. These results indicate substantial interaction between salinity and inorganic nitrogen as constraints on the structure of benthic-algal communities of the San Joaquin River basin.

AB Grazing has traditionally been viewed as detrimental to plant growth, but it has been proposed that under certain conditions, grazing may lead to compensatory or overcompensatory growth. However, comprehensive information on the relative role of the main functional processes controlling the response of net primary production (NPP) to grazing is still lacking. In this study, a modelling approach was used to quantify the relative importance of key functional processes in the response of annual canopy NPP to grazing for a West African humid grassland. The PEPSEE-grass model, which represents radiation absorption, NPP, water balance and carbon allocation, was used to compute total and aboveground NPP in response to grazing pressure. Representations of grazing and mineral nitrogen input to the canopy were simplified to focus on the vegetation processes implemented and their relative importance. Simulations were performed using a constant or resource-driven root/shoot allocation coefficient, and dependence or independence of conversion efficiency of absorbed light into dry matter on nitrogen availability. There were three main results. Firstly, the response of NPP to grazing intensity emerged as a complex result of both positive and negative, and direct and indirect effects of biomass removal on light absorption efficiency, soil water availability, grass nitrogen status and productivity, and root/shoot allocation pattern. Secondly, overcompensation was observed for aboveground NPP when assuming a nitrogen-dependent conversion efficiency and a resource-driven root/shoot allocation. Thirdly, the response of NPP to grazing was mainly controlled by the effect of plant nitrogen status on conversion efficiency and by the root/shoot allocation pattern, while the effects of improved water status and reduced light absorption were secondary.

In particular, comparison of communal areas with adjacent protected areas was important in showing the impacts of potential changes in landuse within an overarching catchment management plan. Although most of the protected areas considered preservation of biodiversity as their primary goal, they were characterised by significantly fewer plant species than the adjacent, highly utilised, communal lands, at both the plot and point scale. Slope position also had a significant effect on plant species richness, with eutrophic bottomlands having c. 30% more species than the dystrophic toplands. This adds weight to the need for greater public awareness for the judicious use and management of the sensitive bottomlands, which fringe the primary drainage lines that are vital for sustained supplies of good quality surface water in this semi-arid environment. The total number of species increased with increasing mean annual rainfall across the rainfall gradient. This suggests that, if the catchment management plan aims to identify additional areas for conservation, the higher rainfall areas should be the first to be assessed. Species turnover was greater along the rainfall gradient than the catenal gradient between toplands and bottomlands. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Area sensitivity in songbirds is commonly attributed to increased nest predation in forest fragments. In 1995 and 1996, we tested whether the nest predators and nesting success of an area-sensitive forest bird, the Eastern Yellow Robin (Eopsaltria australis), varied with fragment size, and we also conducted an artificial nest experiment. The study occurred in two small (55 ha) and two large (>400 ha) forest fragments in a matrix of agricultural land in New South Wales, Australia. Predation accounted for 95% of all failures of 282 robin nests, and the survival of robin nests was negatively correlated with how frequently we observed avian nest predators near nests (i.e, nest-predator activity). Of 461 artificial nests, 84% were depredated, nearly all (99%) by birds. Thus, birds were important predators of nests. The abundance, species richness, and activity of avian nest predators were not related to fragment size. Survival of robin nests averaged 19%; nests in small fragments had a 22% chance of producing at least one fledgling compared with 15% in large fragments, but the difference was not significant. Survival of artificial nests averaged 12% in both small and large fragments. Nest-predator activity accounted for the most variation (68%) in the fate of robin nests, followed by the cumulative density of open-cup nesters (16%). The placement of robin nests had no influence on nest fate. We conclude that nest predation was not area dependent and propose food supply as an alternative hypothesis to explain area sensitivity. We suggest that, rather than being related to fragment size, nest predation increases with decreasing forest cover in a landscape. Increased nest predation in fragmented compared with contiguous landscapes may lower the population viability of songbirds in a region, and hence regional numbers. Therefore, the spatial scale at which fragmentation influences nest predation and songbird populations must be considered carefully.

AB Exotic plant invasions represent a threat to natural and managed ecosystems. Understanding of the mechanisms that determine why a given species may invade a given ecosystem, or why some biomes and regions seem more prone to invasions, is limited. One potential reason for this lack of progress may lie in how few studies have addressed invasion mechanisms from the point of view of the invaded community. On the other hand, the renewed debate about the relationship between ecological diversity and ecosystem stability offers the opportunity to revisit existing theory and empirical evidence, and to attempt to investigate which characteristics of plant communities, including their diversity, contribute to their invasibility. Empirical studies have shown both positive and negative relationships between species diversity of resident plant communities and their invasibility by external species. Rather than attempting to build a larger collection of case studies, research now needs to address the mechanisms underlying these relationships. Previous knowledge about the mechanisms favouring invasion needs to be coupled with community theory to form the basis of these new investigations. Modern community theory offers hypotheses and techniques to analyse the invasibility of communities depending on their diversity and other factors, such as species' life histories and environmental variability. The body of knowledge accumulated in invasion ecology suggests that the role of disturbances, in interaction with fertility, and the importance of interactions with other trophic levels, are specific factors for consideration. In addition, it is essential for future studies to explicitly tease apart the effects of species richness per se from the effects of other components of ecological diversity, such as functional diversity (the number of functional groups) and trophic diversity (the number of interactions among trophic levels).

AB Principal curves are smooth one-dimensional curves in a high dimensional space that are ideally suited for indirect gradient analysis of multispecies abundance data. A principal curves ordination will simultaneously estimate the species response curves and locate sites on a single ecological gradient. By means of theoretical argument and simulations, they are shown to be superior to both correspondence analysis and multidimensional scaling, outperforming them in 77% and 72% of simulations, respectively. The species response curves used in the simulations varied from simple Gaussian form with equal maxima and tolerances to complex multimodal curves with varying maxima and tolerances. Simulations were conducted both with and without noise. When species response curves are smooth, and a reasonable initial configuration is provided, principal curve gradient analysis can succeed even when the curves are complex and beta diversity is high. Principal curves can also be adapted for direct gradient analysis in order to relate species composition to environmental variables.
   Although ordination techniques are used both to uncover ecological gradients and to represent species composition, it is argued that these two aims are distinct. Hence, a single ordination technique cannot generally achieve both objectives simultaneously. However, by superimposing a principal curve on a principal components biplot, joint representation of an ecological gradient and species composition can be achieved. Information from either an indirect or direct principal curve gradient analysis can be added to the biplot, thereby relating environmental variables to species composition and locations of sites on the gradient. Two ecological data sets, comprising abundances of hunting spiders and species of grasses, are analyzed using principal curve gradient analysis. The results are contrasted with previous analyses, using canonical-correspondence analysis and canonical-correlation analysis, and indicate that principal curve gradient analysis can find one-dimensional gradients that explain species composition as well as, or better than, higher dimensional solutions from other techniques. This, in turn, can lead to a more succinct representation and better understanding of ecological systems.

AB Physiognomic analysis of four taphofloras (one from the Coniacian of N. Alaska, one from the Coniacian of Kamchatka, one from the Turonian of Kamchatka, and one from the Turonian of Novaya Sibir' Island) using the CLAMP technique of Wolfe (1993) yielded quantitative data on the mean annual, warm month mean, and cold month mean temperatures, the length of the growing season, mean annual precipitation, mean growing season precipitation, mean monthly growing season precipitation and the precipitation during the three consecutive driest months. These new results represent the first application of multivariate statistical analysis of foliar physiognomy to determine palaeoclimatic parameters (CLAMP) to Arctic Cretaceous floras and demonstrate its robustness even in the context of vegetation which has no living analogues. These new estimates were comparable to those from previous quantitative or qualitative sedimentological or palaeobotanical data where they were available, but offer greater measurable precision.
   The results also suggest that an Arctic Ocean with a winter surface temperature of approximately 6 degrees C maintained N. Alaska coastal temperatures above freezing, locally reversing the equator to pole temperature gradient; a phenomenon not seen in the northern proto-Pacific. This anomalously warm Arctic Ocean could have been produced by marine poleward heat transport. Precipitation in Alaska, Kamchatka and Novaya Sibir' Island was predicted to have been high (e.g. 1760 mm/yr in the Coniacian of N. Alaska) reflecting a very weak polar high pressure cell and substantially different precipitation patterns to Present.

AB The development of a modern data set of 156 diatom samples from salt lakes has provided evidence of the tolerance of a large number of taxa to the salinity of lake waters. Thirty taxa have been recorded from 30 or more samples and so have been well characterised. A further 42 taxa have been recorded from 10 or more samples. The lakes sampled range in salinity from the freshwater-oligosaline boundary to well into the hypersaline range, so the upper and lower salinity tolerance limits of many species were investigated. Canonical correspondence analysis of the data set showed that salinity was the most important of the tested parameters influencing the diatom assemblages in the samples. Randomisation tests have provided correlation values between measured and predicted salinity comparable with those gained from other major salt lake diatom data sets, suggesting that this set is a good predictor of lake salinity.

AB A predictive model for bryophyte distribution, water table position, and seasonal mean methane (CH4) emission was developed for two areas of northern peatland: the Clay Belt of Ontario and the Labrador Trough of Quebec. Water table position and CH4 flux were the most important environmental variables in canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) of bryophyte data. Water chemistry constituted a second environmental gradient, independent of hydrology and CH4 flux.
   Weighted averaging regression and calibration were used to develop a model for predicting log CH4 flux from bryophyte distribution. The model showed an increase in log CH4 flux from hummock to carpet and pool species, corresponding with a decrease in height above the mean water table position. The exceptions were rich-fen pool species, which had low CH4 flux optima in spite of their moisture status. Tolerances were greatest for mid-hummock species and least for carpet and pool species. No overlap in tolerances occurred between hummock and pool species, suggesting that species at either end of the height gradient are the best predictors of CH4 flux.
   Error analyses showed that bryophytes are equally as effective as water table position for predicting mean CH4 flux even though bryophytes are only surrogates for the degree of anaerobism/aerobism in the peat profile. Bryophytes are distributed in well-defined zones along microtopographic gradients; they integrate long-term changes in the water table, which fluctuates on a daily and seasonal basis along with CH4 flux, and may be more easily mapped with remote-sensing techniques. Bryophytes, however, are only useful for predicting CH4 flux within a region; similar species values cannot be extrapolated to other northern peatlands where different climatic and biogeochemical factors may result in different ranges of CH4 emission. The model may be used in paleoreconstructions of methane emission and for biological monitoring of climate change.

AB During a 3-year study, soil microbial biomass C and N, length of the fungal hyphae, soil respiration, and the percent mass loss of needle litter were recorded in coniferous forest soil humus layers following a prescribed burning (PB) treatment or a forest fire simulation (FF) treatment (five plots per treatment). Unburned humus from adjacent plots served as controls (PC and FC, respectively). Prescribed burning was more intensive than the forest fire, and this was reflected in all the measurements taken. The amounts of microbial biomass C and N, length of fungal hyphae, and soil respiration in the PB area did not recover to their controls levels, whereas unchanged microbial biomass N and recovery of the length of the fungal hyphae to control levels were observed in the FF area. The mean microbial C/N ratio was approximately 7 in all the areas, which reflected the C/N ratio of the soil microbial community. Deviation from this mean value, as observed during the first three samplings from the PB area (3, 18, and 35 days after fire treatment), suggested a change in the composition of the microbial community. Of the two treated areas, the decrease in soil respiration (laboratory measurements) was much more pronounced in the PB area. However, when the humus samples from both areas were adjusted to 60% water holding capacity, no differences in respiration capacity were observed. The drier humus, due to higher soil temperatures, of the PB area is a likely explanation for the low soil respiration. Lower soil respiration was not reflected in lower litter decomposition rates of the PB area, since there was a significantly higher needle litter mass loss during the first year in the PB area followed by a decline to the control level during the second year. Consistently higher mass losses were recorded in the FC area than in the FF area.

AB Net Primary Productivity (NPP) and Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) are key processes characterizing the vegetation activity. At a continental scale, Annual Net Primary Productivity (ANPP) and annual AET are related to the integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). When applied to the African continent, the ANPP/SIGMANDVI relation gives an estimation of the productivity with a precision comparable to those given by climate models. The estimation of annual AET is possible within climatic zones defined here by their Rain-Use Efficiencies (RUE). On the other hand, on a monthly basis, the AET/SIGMANDVI relations are less clear and are strongly dependent on the physiognomy of the vegetation community considered. These results show the limits of using SIGMANDVI for estimating the elementary processes of terrestrial vegetation at a continental scale.

AB The global Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has affected more than eight million people. There is an urgent need to investigate how the adaptive immunity is established in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we profiled adaptive immune cells of PBMCs from recovered COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity using single-cell RNA and TCR/BCR V(D)J sequencing. The sequencing data revealed SARS-CoV-2-specific shuffling of adaptive immune repertories and COVID-19-induced remodeling of peripheral lymphocytes. Characterization of variations in the peripheral T and B cells from the COVID-19 patients revealed a positive correlation of humoral immune response and T-cell immune memory with disease severity. Sequencing and functional data revealed SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell immune memory in the convalescent COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we also identified novel antigens that are responsive in the convalescent patients. Altogether, our study reveals adaptive immune repertories underlying pathogenesis and recovery in severe versus mild COVID-19 patients, providing valuable information for potential vaccine and therapeutic development against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB Many controversies in statistics are due primarily or solely to poor quality control in journals, bad statistical textbooks, bad teaching, unclear writing, and lack of knowledge of the historical literature. One way to improve the practice of statistics and resolve these issues is to do what initiators of the 2016 ASA statement did: take one issue at a time, have extensive discussions about the issue among statisticians of diverse backgrounds and perspectives and eventually develop and publish a broadly supported consensus on that issue. Upon completion of this task, we then move on to deal with another core issue in the same way. We propose as the next project a process that might lead quickly to a strong consensus that the term "statistically significant" and all its cognates and symbolic adjuncts be disallowed in the scientific literature except where focus is on the history of statistics and its philosophies and methodologies. Calculation and presentation of accurate p-values will often remain highly desirable though not obligatory. Supplementary materials for this article are available online in the form of an appendix listing the names and institutions of 48 other statisticians and scientists who endorse the principal propositions put forward here..

AB Purpose of the Review Weather and climate extremes substantially affect global- and regional-scale carbon (C) cycling, and thus spatially or temporally extended climatic extreme events jeopardize terrestrial ecosystem carbon sequestration. We illustrate the relevance of drought and/or heat events ("DHE") for the carbon cycle and highlight underlying concepts and complex impact mechanisms. We review recent results, discuss current research needs and emerging research topics.
   Recent Findings Our review covers topics critical to understanding, attributing and predicting the effects of DHE on the terrestrial carbon cycle: (1) ecophysiological impact mechanisms and mediating factors, (2) the role of timing, duration and dynamical effects through which DHE impacts on regional-scale carbon cycling are either attenuated or enhanced, and (3) large-scale atmospheric conditions under which DHE are likely to unfold and to affect the terrestrial carbon cycle. Recent research thus shows the need to view these events in a broader spatial and temporal perspective that extends assessments beyond local and concurrent C cycle impacts of DHE.
   Summary Novel data streams, model (ensemble) simulations, and analyses allow to better understand carbon cycle impacts not only in response to their proximate drivers (drought, heat, etc.) but also attributing them to underlying changes in drivers and large-scale atmospheric conditions. These attribution-type analyses increasingly address and disentangle various sequences or dynamical interactions of events and their impacts, including compensating or amplifying effects on terrestrial carbon cycling.

AB Drosophila suzukii Matsumura is an invasive species of vinegar fly that has become a prominent pest of berries and other soft-skinned fruits. Unlike most other Drosophila species, female D. suzukii flies lay their eggs in ripening and ripe fruits and larvae develop within the fruit. To understand how D. suzukii larvae utilize ripe and ripening fruits, which usually have low levels of protein, we investigated the microbiota of field-captured and laboratory-reared D. suzukii flies and further examined the combined influence of diet and microbes on host fitness. Field-captured flies were associated with diverse microbiota, which varied significantly with sampling location and season. In contrast, laboratory-reared flies possessed strikingly lower bacterial abundance and diversity. A comparison of conventionally reared (CR) and germ-free (GF) flies revealed that the microbiota of D. suzukii does not alter its development significantly but decreases its life span under conditions of a nutrient-sufficient diet. However, the microbiota is essential for D. suzukii development on strawberry-based or blueberry-based fruit diets. This developmental failure could be rescued by reassociation with single bacterial or fungal species or by the addition of a high quantity of heat-killed microbes. In addition, we found that proteins are limiting with respect to fly development on fruit-based diets and that GF flies show signs of protein starvation. Taken together, our study results demonstrate that the microbiota provides key proteins required for the development of D. suzukii reared on fresh fruit. Our work shows that the impact of microbes on fly fitness depends strongly on nutritional conditions.
   IMPORTANCE Animals are commonly associated with specific microbes, which play important roles in host development and fitness. However, little information about the function of microbes has been available for the important invasive pest Drosophila suzukii, also known as Spotted wing drosophila. Our study results demonstrate that the abundance and structure of microbiota in D. suzukii are strongly affected by the environment, where microbes have variable roles depending on the nutritional situation. For instance, we found that the presence of microbes is deleterious for flies growing on a protein-rich diet and yet is beneficial for flies growing on a diet of protein-poor fruits. Additionally, germ-free flies must feed on microbes to obtain the necessary protein for larval development on strawberries and blueberries. Our report validates the complexity seen in host-microbe interactions and may provide information useful for D. suzukii pest control.

AB This review summarizes the effects of vegetation on runoff and soil loss in three dimensions: vertical vegetation structures (aboveground vegetation cover, surface litter layer and underground roots), plant diversity, vegetation patterns and their scale characteristics. Quantitative relationships between vegetation factors with runoff and soil loss are described. A framework for describing relationships involving vegetation, erosion and scale is proposed. The relative importance of each vegetation dimension for various erosion processes changes across scales. With the development of erosion features (i.e., splash, interrill, rill and gully), the main factor of vertical vegetation structures in controlling runoff and soil loss changes from aboveground biomass to roots. Plant diversity levels are correlated with vertical vegetation structures and play a key role at small scales, while vegetation patterns also maintain a critical function across scales (i.e., patch, slope, catchment and basin/region). Several topics for future study are proposed in this review, such as to determine efficient vegetation architectures for ecological restoration, to consider the dynamics of vegetation patterns, and to identify the interactions involving the three dimensions of vegetation.

AB A recent and prominent claim for the value of biodiversity is its importance for sustaining multiple ecosystem functions. The general idea is intuitively appealing: since all species are to some extent unique, each will be important for a different set of functions. Therefore, as more functions are considered, a greater diversity of species is necessary to sustain all functions simultaneously. However, we show here that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning does not change with the number of functions considered. Biodiversity affects the level of multifunctionality via non-additive effects on individual functions, and the effect on multifunctionality equals the average effect on single functions. These insights run counter to messages in the literature. In the light of our simulations, we present limitations and pitfalls with current methods used to study biodiversity-multifunctionality, which together provide a perspective for future studies.

AB Background and Aims During the growing season, the cambium of conifer trees produces successive rows of xylem cells, the tracheids, that sequentially pass through the phases of enlargement and secondary wall thickening before dying and becoming functional. Climate variability can strongly influence the kinetics of morphogenetic processes, eventually affecting tracheid shape and size. This study investigates xylem anatomical structure in the stem of Picea abies to retrospectively infer how, in the long term, climate affects the processes of cell enlargement and wall thickening.
   Methods Tracheid anatomical traits related to the phases of enlargement (diameter) and wall thickening (wall thickness) were innovatively inspected at the intra-ring level on 87-year-long tree-ring series in Picea abies trees along a 900 m elevation gradient in the Italian Alps. Anatomical traits in ten successive tree-ring sectors were related to daily temperature and precipitation data using running correlations.
   Key Results Close to the altitudinal tree limit, low early-summer temperature negatively affected cell enlargement. At lower elevation, water availability in early summer was positively related to cell diameter. The timing of these relationships shifted forward by about 20 (high elevation) to 40 (low elevation) d from the first to the last tracheids in the ring. Cell wall thickening was affected by climate in a different period in the season. In particular, wall thickness of late-formed tracheids was strongly positively related to August-September temperature at high elevation.
   Conclusions Morphogenesis of tracheids sequentially formed in the growing season is influenced by climate conditions in successive periods. The distinct climate impacts on cell enlargement and wall thickening indicate that different morphogenetic mechanisms are responsible for different tracheid traits. Our approach of long-term and high-resolution analysis of xylem anatomy can support and extend short-term xylogenesis observations, and increase our understanding of climate control of tree growth and functioning under different environmental conditions.

AB Many citizen science projects are place-based - built on in-person participation and motivated by local conservation. When done thoughtfully, this approach to citizen science can transform humans and their environment. Despite such possibilities, many projects struggle to meet decision-maker needs, generate useful data to inform decisions, and improve social-ecological resilience. Here, we define leveraging the 'power of place' in citizen science, and posit that doing this improves conservation decision making, increases participation, and improves community resilience. First, we explore 'place' and identify five place dimensions: social-ecological, narrative and name-based, knowledge-based, emotional and affective, and performative. We then thematically analyze 134 case studies drawn from CitSci.org (n = 39), The Stewardship Network New England (TSN-NE; n = 39), and Earthwatch (n = 56) regarding: (1) use of place dimensions in materials (as one indication of leveraging the power of place), (2) intent for use of data in decision-making, and (3) evidence of such use. We find that 89% of projects intend for data to be used, 46% demonstrate no evidence of use, and 54% provide some evidence of use. Moreover, projects used in decision making leverage more (t = 4.8, df = 117; p < 0.001) place dimensions ((x) over bar= 3.0; s = 1.4) than those not used in decision making ((x) over bar =1.8; s =1.2). Further, a Principal Components Analysis identifies three related components (aesthetic, narrative and name-based, and social-ecological). Given these findings, we present a framework for leveraging place in citizen science projects and platforms, and recommend approaches to better impart intended outcomes. We discuss place in citizen science related to relevance, participation, resilience, and scalability and conclude that effective decision making as a means towards more resilient and sustainable communities can be strengthened by leveraging the power of place in citizen science.

AB The exploration of new niches for microorganisms capable of degrading recalcitrant molecules is still required. We hypothesized the gut microbiota associated with insect-resistant lines carry pesticide degrading bacteria, and predicted they carry bacteria selected to degrade pesticides they were resistant to. We isolated and accessed the pesticide-degrading capacity of gut bacteria from the gut of fifth instars of Spodoptera frugiperda strains resistant to lambda-cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos ethyl, spinosad and lufenuron, using insecticide-selective media. Sixteen isolates belonging to 10 phylotypes were obtained, from which four were also associated with the susceptible strain. However, growth of gut bacteria associated with larvae from the susceptible strain was not obtained in any of the insecticide-based selective media tested. Growth of isolates was affected by the concentration of insecticides in the media, and all grew well up to 40 lag/ml. The insecticide degrading capacity of selected isolates was assessed by GC or LC-MS/MS analyses. In conclusion, resistant strains of S. frugiperda are an excellent reservoir of insecticide-degrading bacteria with bioremediation potential. Moreover, gut-associated bacteria are subjected to the selection pressure imposed by insecticides on their hosts and may influence the metabolization of pesticides in insects.

AB Heat tolerance is a trait of paramount ecological importance and may determine a species' ability to cope with ongoing climate change. Although critical thermal limits have consequently received substantial attention in recent years, their potential variation throughout ontogeny remained largely neglected. We investigate whether such neglect may bias conclusions regarding a species' sensitivity to climate change. Using a tropical butterfly, we found that developmental stages clearly differed in heat tolerance. It was highest in pupae followed by larvae, adults and finally eggs and hatchlings. Strikingly, most of the variation found in thermal tolerance was explained by differences in body mass, which may thus impose a severe constraint on adaptive variation in stress tolerance. Furthermore, temperature acclimation was beneficial by increasing heat knock-down time and therefore immediate survival under heat stress, but it affected reproduction negatively. Extreme temperatures strongly reduced survival and subsequent reproductive success even in our highly plastic model organism, exemplifying the potentially dramatic impact of extreme weather events on biodiversity. We argue that predictions regarding a species' fate under changing environmental conditions should consider variation in thermal tolerance throughout ontogeny, variation in body mass and acclimation responses as important predictors of stress tolerance.

AB This study compared the densest available database of tree-ring growth with the longest Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) information available at the global scale to quantify the relationship between annual forest growth and the NDVI across different forest types and regions and to characterize the patterns of response of forest growth to NDVI values at different temporal scales. We found a general positive relationship between the inter-annual NDVI variability and the annual tree growth in most of the analyzed forests. Nevertheless, there were strong differences in the tree growth responses to NDVI, given that the annual tree-ring records in each forest responded in a different way to the magnitude, seasonality and accumulation period of the NDVI values. Thus, we found eight main patterns of tree-ring response to the NDVI, which were related to the forest type and climate conditions of each corresponding site. The identified patterns may be useful for determining early-warning signals of changes in forest growth over large areas based on remote sensing information. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI Towards a new understanding of migration timing: slower spring than
   autumn migration in geese reflects different decision rules for stopover

AB According to migration theory and several empirical studies, long-distance migrants are more time-limited during spring migration and should therefore migrate faster in spring than in autumn. Competition for the best breeding sites is supposed to be the main driver, but timing of migration is often also influenced by environmental factors such as food availability and wind conditions.
   Using GPS tags, we tracked 65 greater white-fronted geese Anser albifrons migrating between western Europe and the Russian Arctic during spring and autumn migration over six different years. Contrary to theory, our birds took considerably longer for spring migration (83 days) than autumn migration (42 days). This difference in duration was mainly determined by time spent at stopovers.
   Timing and space use during migration suggest that the birds were using different strategies in the two seasons: In spring they spread out in a wide front to acquire extra energy stores in many successive stopover sites (to fuel capital breeding), which is in accordance with previous results that white-fronted geese follow the green wave of spring growth. In autumn they filled up their stores close to the breeding grounds and waited for supportive wind conditions to quickly move to their wintering grounds. Selection for supportive winds was stronger in autumn, when general wind conditions were less favourable than in spring, leading to similar flight speeds in the two seasons. In combination with less stopover time in autumn this led to faster autumn than spring migration.
   White-fronted geese thus differ from theory that spring migration is faster than autumn migration. We expect our findings of different decision rules between the two migratory seasons to apply more generally, in particular in large birds in which capital breeding is common, and in birds that meet other environmental conditions along their migration route in autumn than in spring.

AB There is clear evidence for sublethal effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on non-target ecosystem service-providing insects. However, their possible impact on male insect reproduction is currently unknown, despite the key role of sex. Here, we show that two neonicotinoids (4.5 ppb thiamethoxam and 1.5 ppb dothianidin) significantly reduce the reproductive capacity of male honeybees (drones), Apis mellifera. Drones were obtained from colonies exposed to the neonicotinoid insecticides or controls, and subsequently maintained in laboratory cages until they reached sexual maturity. While no significant effects were observed for male teneral (newly emerged adult) body mass and sperm quantity, the data dearly showed reduced drone lifespan, as well as reduced sperm viability (percentage living versus dead) and living sperm quantity by 39%. Our results demonstrate for the first time that neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect male insect reproductive capacity, and provide a possible mechanistic explanation for managed honeybee queen failure and wild insect pollinator decline. The widespread prophylactic use of neonicotinoids may have previously overlooked inadvertent contraceptive effects on non-target insects, thereby limiting conservation efforts.

AB A mosaic of intact native and human-modified vegetation use can provide important habitat for top predators such as the puma (Puma concolor), avoiding negative effects on other species and ecological processes due to cascade trophic interactions. This study investigates the effects of restoration scenarios on the puma's habitat suitability in the most developed Brazilian region (Sao Paulo State). Species Distribution Models incorporating restoration scenarios were developed using the species' occurrence information to (1) map habitat suitability of pumas in Sao Paulo State, Southeast, Brazil; (2) test the relative contribution of environmental variables ecologically relevant to the species habitat suitability and (3) project the predicted habitat suitability to future native vegetation restoration scenarios. The Maximum Entropy algorithm was used (Test AUC of 0.84 +/- 0.0228) based on seven environmental non-correlated variables and non-autocorrelated presence-only records (n = 342). The percentage of native vegetation (positive influence), elevation (positive influence) and density of roads (negative influence) were considered the most important environmental variables to the model. Model projections to restoration scenarios reflected the high positive relationship between pumas and native vegetation. These projections identified new high suitability areas for pumas (probability of presence >0.5) in highly deforested regions. High suitability areas were increased from 5.3% to 8.5% of the total State extension when the landscapes were restored for >= the minimum native vegetation cover rule (20%) established by the Brazilian Forest Code in private lands. This study highlights the importance of a landscape planning approach to improve the conservation outlook for pumas and other species, including not only the establishment and management of protected areas, but also the habitat restoration on private lands. Importantly, the results may inform environmental policies and land use planning in Sao Paulo State, Brazil.

AB A major challenge in carnivore conservation worldwide is identifying priority human-carnivore conflict sites where mitigation efforts would be most effective. Spatial predation risk modeling recently emerged as a tool for predicting and mapping hotspots of livestock depredation using locations where carnivores attacked livestock in the past. This literature review evaluates the approaches and applications of spatial risk modeling for reducing human-carnivore conflict and presents a workflow to help conservation practitioners use this tool. Over the past decade 18 studies were published, most which examined canid and felid (10 and 8 studies on each group, respectively) depredation on cattle (14) and sheep (12). Studies employed correlation modeling, spatial association and/or spatial interpolation to identify high-risk landscape features, and many (but not all) validated models with independent data. The landscape features associated with carnivore attacks related to the species (carnivore and prey), environment, human infrastructure and management interventions. Risk maps from most studies (14) were used to help livestock owners and managers identify top-priority areas for implementing carnivore deterrents, with some efforts achieving > 90 % reductions in attacks. Only one study affected policy, highlighting a gap where risk maps could be useful for more clearly communicating information to assist policymakers with large-scale decisions on conflict. Studies were used to develop a six-step workflow on integrating risk modeling into conservation. This review reveals a need for future predation risk modeling to focus more on validating models, accounting for feedbacks and impacting conflict-related policy in order to reliably improve the mitigation of human-carnivore conflict globally.

AB Global warming and land-use change are expected to be additive threats to global diversity, to which insects contribute the highest proportion. Insects are strongly influenced by temperature but also require specific habitat resources, and thus interaction between the two factors is likely. We selected saproxylic beetles as a model group because their life cycle depends on dead wood, which is highly threatened by land use. We tested the extent to which higher temperatures compensate for the negative effects of low amounts of dead wood on saproxylic beetle species richness (Temperature-Dead wood compensation hypothesis) on both a macroclimate and a topoclimate scale (north- and south-facing slopes). We analyzed 1404 flight-interception trap catches across Europe to test for interaction effects of temperature and dead-wood amount on species richness. To experimentally test our findings from the activity trap data, we additionally reared beetles from 80 bundles of dead wood initially exposed at high and low elevations. At the topoclimate scale, we analyzed trap catches and reared beetles from dead wood exposed in 20 forest stands on south-facing and north-facing slopes in one region. On the macroscale, both temperature and dead-wood amount positively affected total and threatened species richness independently, but their interaction was significantly negative, indicating compensation. On both scales and irrespective of the method, species richness decreased with temperature decline. Our observation that increasing temperature compensates for lower amounts of dead wood has two important implications. First, managers of production forests should adapt their dead-wood enrichment strategy to site-specific temperature conditions. Second, an increase in temperature will compensate at least partially for poor habitat conditions in production forests. Such a perspective contrasts the general assumption of reinforcing impacts of global warming and habitat loss on biodiversity, but it is corroborated by recent range expansions of threatened beetle species.

AB BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have suggested an association between external estimates of exposure to metals in air particles and altered heart rate variability (HRV). However, studies on the association between internal assessments of metals exposure and HRV are limited.
   OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the potential association between urinary metals and HRV among residents of an urban community in Wuhan, China.
   METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 23 urinary metals and 5-min HRV indices (SDNN, standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals; r-MSSD, root mean square of successive differences in adjacent normal-to-normal intervals; LF, low frequency; HF, high frequency; TP, total power) using baseline data on 2,004 adult residents of Wuhan.
   RESULTS: After adjusting for other metals, creatinine, and other covariates, natural log-transformed urine titanium concentration was positively associated with all HRV indices (all p < 0.05). Moreover, we estimated negative associations between cadmium and r-MSSD, LF, HF, and TP; between lead and r-MSSD, HF, and TP; and between iron, copper, and arsenic and HF, SDNN, and LF, respectively, based on models adjusted for other metals, creatinine, and covariates (all p < 0.10). Several associations differed according to cardiovascular disease risk factors. For example, negative associations between cadmium and r-MSSD were stronger among participants <= 52 years of age (vs. > 52), current smokers (vs. nonsmokers), body mass index < 25 kg/m(2) (vs. >= 25), and among those who were not hypertensive.
   CONCLUSIONS: Urine concentrations of several metals were associated with HRV parameters in our cross-sectional study population. These findings need replication in other studies with adequate sample sizes.

AB Soil chronosequences provide valuable model systems to investigate pedogenesis and associated effects of nutrient availability on biological communities. However, long-term chronosequences occurring under seasonally dry climates remain scarce. We assessed soil development and nutrient dynamics along the Jurien Bay chronosequence, a 2 million-year sequence of coastal dunes in southwestern Australia. The chronosequence is significant because it occurs in a Mediterranean climate and supports hyperdiverse shrublands within a global biodiversity hotspot. Young soils formed during the Holocene (< 6,500 years old) are strongly alkaline and contain abundant carbonate, which is leached from the profile within a few thousand years. Middle Pleistocene soils (ca 120,000-500,000 years old) are yellow decalcified sands with residual iron oxide coatings on quartz grains over a petrocalcic horizon that occurs at increasing depth as soils age. Early Pleistocene soils (> 2,000,000 years old) are completely leached of iron oxides and consist of bleached quartz sand several meters deep. Changes in soil organic matter and nutrient status along the Jurien Bay chronosequence are consistent with patterns observed along other long-term chronosequences and correspond closely to expectations of the Walker and Syers (1976) model of biogeochemical change during pedogenesis. Organic carbon and nitrogen (N) accumulate rapidly to maximum amounts in intermediate-aged Holocene dunes and then decline as soils age. In contrast, total phosphorus (P) declines continuously along the chronosequence to extremely low levels after 2 million years of pedogenesis, eventually representing some of the lowest P soils globally. Ratios of soil organic carbon to P and N to P increase continuously along the chronosequence, consistent with a shift from N limitation on young soils to extreme P limitation on old soils. Phosphorus fractionation by sequential extraction reveals a rapid decline in primary and non-occluded phosphate and an increase in organic and occluded P as soils age. Concentrations of extractable (that is, readily bioavailable) N and P, as well as exchangeable cations, are greatest in Holocene dunes and decline to low levels in Pleistocene dunes. Extractable micronutrient concentrations were generally very low and varied little across the chronosequence. We conclude that the Jurien Bay chronosequence is an important example of changing patterns of nutrient limitation linked to long-term soil and ecosystem development under a Mediterranean climate.

AB Accurate species identification is fundamental to biodiversity science, but the natural history skills required for this are neglected in formal education at all levels. In this paper we describe how the web application ispotnature.org and its sister site ispot.org.za (collectively, "iSpot") are helping to solve this problem by combining learning technology with crowdsourcing to connect beginners with experts. Over 94% of observations submitted to iSpot receive a determination. External checking of a sample of 3,287 iSpot records verified >92% of them. To mid 2014, iSpot crowdsourced the identification of 30,000 taxa (>80% at species level) in >390,000 observations with a global community numbering >42,000 registered participants. More than half the observations on ispotnature.org were named within an hour of submission. iSpot uses a unique, 9-dimensional reputation system to motivate and reward participants and to verify determinations. Taxon-specific reputation points are earned when a participant proposes an identification that achieves agreement from other participants, weighted by the agreers' own reputation scores for the taxon. This system is able to discriminate effectively between competing determinations when two or more are proposed for the same observation. In 57% of such cases the reputation system improved the accuracy of the determination, while in the remainder it either improved precision (e.g. by adding a species name to a genus) or revealed false precision, for example where a determination to species level was not supported by the available evidence. We propose that the success of iSpot arises from the structure of its social network that efficiently connects beginners and experts, overcoming the social as well as geographic barriers that normally separate the two.

AB A multi-method approach estimating summer waste heat emissions from anthropogenic activities (Q(F)) was applied for a major subtropical city (Phoenix, AZ). These included detailed, quality-controlled inventories of city-wide population density and traffic counts to estimate waste heat emissions from population and vehicular sources respectively, and also included waste heat simulations derived from urban electrical consumption generated by a coupled building energy regional climate model (WRF-BEM + BEP). These component Q(F) data were subsequently summed and mapped through Geographic Information Systems techniques to enable analysis over local (i.e. census-tract) and regional (i.e. metropolitan area) scales. Through this approach, local mean daily Q(F) estimates compared reasonably versus (1.) observed daily surface energy balance residuals from an eddy covariance tower sited within a residential area and (2.) estimates from inventory methods employed in a prior study, with improved sensitivity to temperature and precipitation variations. Regional analysis indicates substantial variations in both mean and maximum daily Q(F) which varied with urban land use type. Average regional daily Q(F) was similar to 13 W m(-2) for the summer period. Temporal analyses also indicated notable differences using this approach with previous estimates of Q(F) in Phoenix over different land uses, with much larger peak fluxes averaging similar to 50 W m(-2) occurring in commercial or industrial areas during late summer afternoons. The spatio-temporal analysis of Q(F) also suggests that it may influence the form and intensity of the Phoenix urban heat island, specifically through additional early evening heat input, and by modifying the urban boundary layer structure through increased turbulence.

AB We review causes of synergies in mixed-species stands, develop guiding hypotheses for revealing their mechanisms and present a rainfall exclusion experiment along with a transect (KROOF) for exploring drought effects.
   While monocultures have dominated forest research and practice in the past, in face of growing resource scarcity and climate change, mixed-species stands are on the advance. Long-term observations show that mixed-species stands frequently over-yield monocultures, and they further suggest that the over-yielding is often higher on poor than on fertile sites and in low-growth than in high-growth years. However, the underlying causes have not yet been clarified. We start with a review of, among others, hydraulic redistribution, complementary eco-physiological traits, and ectomycorrhizal networks as possible causes behind the observed productivity gains in mixed-species stands. Then, we develop guiding hypotheses for further exploration of synergies in mixed-species stands. Finally, we introduce into the concept and model approach of the rainfall exclusion experiment for examining the role of water supply in mixed versus pure forest stands of spruce and beech. At the Kranzberg site, six plots are equipped with water retention roofs, which only close during rain events. The remaining six plots serve as non-roofed control. Together with the rainfall exclusion experiment, an ecological gradient with five sites extending through SE-Germany forms the "Kranzberg Roof Experiment" (in short KROOF). Kranzberg Forest is a part of this gradient from moist to dry conditions, with each site providing mixed and pure associations each of spruce and beech. The ecophysiological approach will be complemented by tree ring analysis and modelling of productivity of the tree associations under intense drought.

   Location Europe.
   Methods Using recently updated catchment-scale species data and climate projections from multiple climate models, we assessed the climate change threat by the 2050s for 1648 European freshwater plants, fishes, molluscs, odonates, amphibians, crayfish and turtles for two dispersal scenarios and identified hot-spots of change at three spatial scales: major river basins, countries and freshwater ecoregions. We considered both common species and the often overlooked rare species. To set our findings within the context of current and future conservation networks, we evaluated the coverage of freshwater biodiversity by Europe's protected area network.
   Results Six per cent of common and 77% of rare species are predicted to lose more than 90% of their current range. Eight fish species and nine mollusc species are predicted to experience 100% range loss under climate change. As the most species-rich group, molluscs are particularly vulnerable due to the high proportion of rare species and their relatively limited ability to disperse. Furthermore, around 50% of molluscs and fish species will have no protected area coverage given their projected distributions.
   Main conclusions We identified the species most at threat due to projected changes in both catchment suitability and representation within the European protected area network. Our findings suggest an urgent need for freshwater management plans to facilitate adaptation to climate change.

AB Detailed knowledge of a species' functional niche is crucial for the study of ecological communities and processes. The extent of niche overlap, functional redundancy and functional complementarity is of particular importance if we are to understand ecosystem processes and their vulnerability to disturbances.
   Coral reefs are among the most threatened marine systems, and anthropogenic activity is changing the functional composition of reefs. The loss of herbivorous fishes is particularly concerning as the removal of algae is crucial for the growth and survival of corals. Yet, the foraging patterns of the various herbivorous fish species are poorly understood.
   Using a multidimensional framework, we present novel individual-based analyses of species' realized functional niches, which we apply to a herbivorous coral reef fish community. In calculating niche volumes for 21 species, based on their microhabitat utilization patterns during foraging, and computing functional overlaps, we provide a measurement of functional redundancy or complementarity. Complementarity is the inverse of redundancy and is defined as less than 50% overlap in niche volumes.
   The analyses reveal extensive complementarity with an average functional overlap of just 15 center dot 2%. Furthermore, the analyses divide herbivorous reef fishes into two broad groups. The first group (predominantly surgeonfishes and parrotfishes) comprises species feeding on exposed surfaces and predominantly open reef matrix or sandy substrata, resulting in small niche volumes and extensive complementarity. In contrast, the second group consists of species (predominantly rabbitfishes) that feed over a wider range of microhabitats, penetrating the reef matrix to exploit concealed surfaces of various substratum types. These species show high variation among individuals, leading to large niche volumes, more overlap and less complementarity.
   These results may have crucial consequences for our understanding of herbivorous processes on coral reefs, as algal removal appears to depend strongly on species-specific microhabitat utilization patterns of herbivores. Furthermore, the results emphasize the capacity of the individual-based analyses to reveal variation in the functional niches of species, even in high-diversity systems such as coral reefs, demonstrating its potential applicability to other high-diversity ecosystems.

AB This research was aimed at understanding how far and how fast glyphosate-resistant (GR) Palmer amaranth will spread in cotton and the consequences associated with allowing a single plant to escape control. Specifically, research was conducted to determine the collective impact of seed dispersal agents on the in-field expansion of GR Palmer amaranth, and any resulting yield reductions in an enhanced GR cotton system where glyphosate was solely used for weed control. Introduction of 20,000 GR Palmer amaranth seed into a 1-m(2) circle in February 2008 was used to represent survival through maturity of a single GR female Palmer amaranth escape from the 2007 growing season. The experiment was conducted in four different cotton fields (0.53 to 0.77 ha in size) with no history of Palmer amaranth infestation. In the subsequent year, Palmer amaranth was located as far as 114 m downslope, creating a separate patch. It is believed that rainwater dispersed the seeds from the original area of introduction. In less than 2 yr after introduction, GR Palmer amaranth expanded to the boundaries of all fields, infesting over 20% of the total field area. Spatial regression estimates indicated that no yield penalty was associated with Palmer amaranth density the first year after introduction, which is not surprising since only 0.56% of the field area was infested with GR Palmer amaranth in 2008. Lint yield reductions as high as 17 kg ha(-1) were observed 2 yr after the introduction (in 2009). Three years after the introduction (2010), Palmer amaranth infested 95 to 100% of the area in all fields, resulting in complete crop loss since it was impossible to harvest the crop. These results indicate that resistance management options such as a "zero-tolerance threshold" should be used in managing or mitigating the spread of GR Palmer amaranth. This research demonstrates the need for proactive resistance management.

AB We investigate the effect of habitat fragmentation on the genetic diversity of a species experiencing a range expansion. These two evolutionary processes have not been studied yet, at the same time, owing to the difficulties of deriving analytic results for non-equilibrium models. Here we provide a description of their interaction by using extensive spatial and temporal coalescent simulations and we suggest guidelines for a proper genetic sampling to detect fragmentation. To model habitat fragmentation, we simulated a two-dimensional lattice of demes partitioned into groups ( patches) by adding barriers to dispersal. After letting a population expand on this grid, we sampled lineages from the lattice at several scales and studied their coalescent history. We find that in order to detect fragmentation, one needs to extensively sample at a local level rather than at a landscape level. This is because the gene genealogy of a scattered sample is less sensitive to the presence of genetic barriers. Considering the effect of temporal changes of fragmentation intensities, we find that at least 10, but often >100, generations are needed to affect local genetic diversity and population structure. This result explains why recent habitat fragmentation does not always lead to detectable signatures in the genetic structure of populations. Finally, as expected, long-distance dispersal increases local genetic diversity and decreases levels of population differentiation, efficiently counteracting the effects of fragmentation.

AB Whether, when, how, and why increased complexity evolves in biological populations is a longstanding open question. In this work we combine a recently developed method for evolving virtual organisms with an information-theoretic metric of morphological complexity in order to investigate how the complexity of morphologies, which are evolved for locomotion, varies across different environments. We first demonstrate that selection for locomotion results in the evolution of organisms with morphologies that increase in complexity over evolutionary time beyond what would be expected due to random chance. This provides evidence that the increase in complexity observed is a result of a driven rather than a passive trend. In subsequent experiments we demonstrate that morphologies having greater complexity evolve in complex environments, when compared to a simple environment when a cost of complexity is imposed. This suggests that in some niches, evolution may act to complexify the body plans of organisms while in other niches selection favors simpler body plans.

AB A mechanistic understanding of the dynamics of populations requires knowledge about the variation of the underlying demographic rates and about the reasons for their variability. In geographically open populations, immigration is often necessary to prevent declines, but little is known about whether immigration can contribute to its regulation. We studied the dynamics of a Red-backed Shrike population (Lanius collurio) over 36 years in Germany with a Bayesian integrated population model. We estimated mean and temporal variability of population sizes, productivity, apparent survival, and immigration. We assessed how strongly the demographic rates were correlated with population growth to understand the demographic reasons of population change and how strongly the demographic rates were correlated with population size to identify possible density-dependent mechanisms. The shrike population varied between 35 and 74 breeding pairs but did not show a significant trend in population size over time (growth rate 1.002 +/- 0.001 [mean +/- SD]). Apparent survival of females (juveniles 0.06 +/- 0.01; adults 0.37 +/- 0.03) was lower than that of males (juveniles 0.10 +/- 0.01; adults 0.44 +/- 0.02). Immigration rates were substantial and higher in females (0.56 +/- 0.02) than in males (0.43 +/- 0.02), and average productivity was 2.76 +/- 0.14. Without immigration, the Red-backed Shrike population would have declined strongly. Immigration was the strongest driver for the number of females while local recruitment was the most important driver for the number of males. Immigration of both sexes and productivity, but not local recruitment and survival, were subject to density dependence. Density-dependent productivity was not effectively regulating the local population but may have contributed to regulate shrike populations at larger spatial scales. These findings suggest that immigration is not only an important component to prevent a geographically open population from decline, but that it can also contribute to its regulation.

AB Commercial selective logging and the conversion of primary and degraded forests to agriculture are the biggest threats to tropical biodiversity. Our understanding of the impacts of these disturbances and the resulting local extinctions on the functional roles performed by the remaining species is limited. We address this issue by examining functional diversity (FD), which quantifies a range of traits that affect a species' ecological role in a community as a single continuous metric. We calculated FD for birds across a gradient of disturbance from primary forest through intensively logged forest to oil palm plantations on previously forested land in Borneo, Southeast Asia, a hotspot of imperilled biodiversity. Logged rainforest retained similar levels of FD to unlogged rainforest, even after two logging rotations, but the conversion of logged forest to oil palm resulted in dramatic reductions in FD. The few remaining species in oil palm filled a disproportionately wide range of functional roles but showed very little clustering in terms of functional traits, suggesting that any further extinctions from oil palm would reduce FD even further. Determining the extent to which the changes we recorded were due to under-utilization of resources within oil palm or a reduction in the resources present is an important next step. Nonetheless our study improves our understanding of the stability and resilience of functional diversity in these ecosystems and of the implications of land-use changes for ecosystem functioning.

AB We investigated the impact of drought on interannual variability of net primary productivity (NPP) from 1997 to 2009, using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) drought index and satellite-derived vegetation greenness converted to NPP. SPEI is positive for wet conditions and negative for dry conditions. We found that SPEI and NPP were coupled and showed in-phase behaviour on a global scale. We then used the Koppen climate classification to study the SPEI-NPP relations regionally and found that while NPP and SPEI were positively related (high SPEI, high NPP) in arid and in seasonal dry regions, the opposite occurs in most boreal regions (high SPEI, low NPP). High intensity drought events, such as the 2003 drought in Europe were picked up by our analysis. Our findings suggest that the strong positive relation between global average moisture availability and NPP consists of a composite of the positive relation across dry regions and the coherent NPP decline during and after intensive drought events in humid regions. Importantly, we also found that there are many areas on the globe that show no strong correlation between drought and NPP.

AB Understanding speciation requires determining how inherent barriers to gene flow (reproductive isolation, RI) evolve between populations. The field of population genomics attempts to address this question by characterizing genome-wide patterns of divergence between taxa, often utilizing next-generation sequencing. Here, we focus on a central assumption of such "genome scans": regions displaying high levels of differentiation contain loci contributing to RI. Three major issues are discussed concerning the relationship between gene flow, genomic divergence, and speciation: (a) patterns expected in the presence versus absence of gene flow; (b) processes, such as direct selection and genetic hitchhiking, allowing for divergence with gene flow; and (c) the consequences of the timing of when gene flow occurs during speciation (e. g., continuous gene flow versus gene flow following secondary contact after a period of initial allopatric divergence). Theory and existing data are presented for each issue, and avenues for future work are highlighted.

AB A previous analysis of Pacific herring mitochondrial (mt) DNA with Bayesian skyline plots (BSPs) was interpreted to reflect population growth in the late Pleistocene that was preceded by population stability over several hundred thousand years. Here we use an independent set of mtDNA control region (CR) sequences and simulations to test these hypotheses. The CR haplotype genealogy shows three deeply divided lineages, A, B and C, with divergences ranging from d = 1.6% to 1.9% and with similar genetic diversities (h = 0.95, 0.96, 0.94; Theta(n) = 0.011, 0.012, 0.014, respectively). Lineage A occurs almost exclusively in the NW Pacific and Bering Sea, but lineages B and C are co-distributed in the Northeastern Pacific. This distribution points to a historical allopatric separation between A and B-C across the North Pacific during Pleistocene glaciations. The origins of B and C are uncertain. One hypothesis invokes long-term isolation of lineage C in the Sea of Cortez, but the present-day lack of geographical segregation from lineage B argues for lineage sorting to explain the deep divergence between B and C. BSPs depict rapid population growth in each lineage, but the timing of this growth is uncertain, because of questions about an appropriate molecular clock calibration. We simulated historical demographies under a Pleistocene climate model using observed genetic parameters. BSPs for these sequences showed rapid population growth after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) 18-20k years ago and a flat population history during previous climate fluctuations. Population declines during the LGM appear to have erased signals of previous population fluctuations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI The Whereabouts of Flower Visitors: Contrasting Land-Use Preferences

AB Background: In the past decade, accumulating evidence of pollinator decline has raised concerns regarding the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems and the sustainability of crop production. Although land-use changes have been advanced as the major causes, the affinities of most wild pollinators with the main land-use types remain unknown. Filling this gap in our knowledge is a prerequisite to improving conservation and management programmes.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We estimated the affinity of flower visitors with urban, agricultural and natural land-uses using data from a country-wide scale monitoring scheme based on citizen science (Spipoll). We tested whether the affinities differed among insect orders and according to insect frequency (frequent or infrequent). Our results indicate that the affinities with the three land-use types differed among insect orders. Apart from Hymenopterans, which appeared tolerant to the different land-uses, all flower visitors presented a negative affinity with urban areas and a positive affinity with agricultural and natural areas. Additionally, infrequent taxa displayed a lower affinity with urban areas and a higher affinity with natural areas than did frequent taxa. Within frequent taxa, Hymenoptera and Coleoptera included specialists of the three land-use types whereas Diptera and Lepidoptera contained specialists of all but urban areas.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our approach allowed the first standardised evaluation of the affinity of flower visitors with the main land-use types across a broad taxonomical range and a wide geographic scope. Our results suggest that the most detrimental land-use change for flower visitor communities is urbanisation. Moreover, our findings highlight the fact that agricultural areas have the potential to host highly diverse pollinator communities. We suggest that policy makers should, therefore, focus on the implementation of pollinator-friendly practices in agricultural lands. This may be a win-win strategy, as both biodiversity and crop production may benefit from healthier communities of flower visitors in these areas.

AB Success of the cattle industry in Latin America is impeded by the common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, through decreases in milk production and mass gain and increased risk of secondary infection and rabies. We used ecological niche modeling to predict the current potential distribution of D. rotundus and the future distribution of the species for the years 2030, 2050, and 2080 based on the A2, A1B, and B1 climate scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We then combined the present day potential distribution with cattle density estimates to identify areas where cattle are at higher risk for the negative impacts due to D. rotundus. We evaluated our risk prediction by plotting 17 documented outbreaks of cattle rabies. Our results indicated highly suitable habitat for D. rotundus occurs throughout most of Mexico and Central America as well as portions of Venezuela, Guyana, the Brazilian highlands, western Ecuador, northern Argentina, and east of the Andes in Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay. With future climate projections suitable habitat for D. rotundus is predicted in these same areas and additional areas in French Guyana, Suriname, Venezuela and Columbia; however D. rotundus are not likely to expand into the U.S. because of inadequate 'temperature seasonality.' Areas with large portions of cattle at risk include Mexico, Central America, Paraguay, and Brazil. Twelve of 17 documented cattle rabies outbreaks were represented in regions predicted at risk. Our present day and future predictions can help authorities focus rabies prevention efforts and inform cattle ranchers which areas are at an increased risk of cattle rabies because it has suitable habitat for D. rotundus.

AB In vector mosquitoes, the presence of midgut bacteria may affect the ability to transmit pathogens. We have used a laboratory colony of Aedes aegypti as a model for bacterial interspecies competition and show that after a blood meal, the number of species (culturable on LuriaBertani agar) that coexist in the midgut is low and that about 40% of the females do not harbor any cultivable bacteria. We isolated species belonging to the genera Bacillus, Elizabethkingia, Enterococcus, Klebsiella, Pantoea, Serratia, and Sphingomonas, and we also determined their growth rates, antibiotic resistance, and ex vivo inhibition of each other. To investigate the possible existence of coadaptation between midgut bacteria and their host, we fed Ae.similar to aegypti cohorts with gut bacteria from human, a frog, and two mosquito species and followed the bacterial population growth over time. The dynamics of the different species suggests coadaptation between host and bacteria, and interestingly, we found that Pantoea stewartii isolated from Ae.similar to aegypti survive better in Ae.similar to aegypti as compared to P.similar to stewartii isolated from the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae.

AB 1. Habitat filtering and limiting similarity have been proposed as two opposing forces structuring community memberships. Community assembly theory proposes habitat filtering as a mechanism restricting community membership according to the ecological strategies of species in a given environment. Limiting similarity posits that some species exclude others that are ecologically similar.
   2. We quantified nine ecophysiological and life-history traits for 80 dipterocarp species in the 52-ha Lambir Forest Dynamics Plot (FDP; Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia). We studied forests on four soil types differing in fertility and moisture, focusing on soil resource availabilities as environmental determinants of habitat filtering processes. We used a null-model approach to detect the strengths of habitat filtering and limiting similarity. We quantified the relative contributions of soil resources (nutrients and water) to habitat filtering by comparing the strength of habitat filtering processes (i.e. effect sizes) at the overall plot scale and at the individual soil-type scale. We also compared the strengths of assembly processes among soil types.
   3. Compared to a null model at microscale (20 x 20 m), trait range and variance were reduced for seven of nine functional traits, suggesting the importance of habitat filtering in the dipterocarp community. We also found a broader distribution of five traits, and more even spacing for seven traits (20 x 20 m), which is consistent with the concept of limiting similarity. Randomizations that swapped species occurrences within soil types (i.e. null models removing soil effects in assembly processes) were much closer to observed values, and there were no phylogenetic constraints on habitat association. Hence, soil resource availability acted as a habitat filtering mechanismin the FDP; relative contributions to habitat filtering ranged from 35% for seed mass to 77% for relative growth rate. Furthermore, soil types apparently affected the strengths of habitat filtering and limiting similarity.
   4. Synthesis. We demonstrate that soil resource availability is a crucial determinant of habitat filtering in this species-rich tropical rain forest; the strengths of assembly processes differed among soil types. Variation in soil resource availability can shape the distribution of traits through community assembly processes, promoting trait diversification and species coexistence.

AB The effects of different fire intensities on physiochemical soil properties have been studied in this research. The experiment was conducted in a eucalyptus forested area near the Namadgi National Park (ACT, Australia), and four fire intensities were achieved by adding different amounts of fuel load: 0 kg m(-2) (control), 2 kg m(-2) (low fire intensity), 4 kg m(-2) (moderate fire intensity) and 8 kg m(-2) (high fire intensity). Soil surface peak temperatures reached at each plot were 14, 142, 317 and 525 degrees C, respectively. Immediate changes in soil properties under different fuel loads were studied and monitored monthly during a 7-month period.
   Average pH increased significantly with fuel load immediately after fire and decreased progressively to initial values. Changes in soil pH from burnt plots seem to be caused mainly by an ephemeral ash layer, and the recovery time has been relatively short The complete oxidation of soil organic matter and the release of substantial amounts of cations after high fire intensity also contributed to increased pH. Only small variations in soil texture have been observed in this study even after high intensity fire, although the clay content decreased slightly during the experiment. This can be due to relatively low pre-burn clay content, but also to spatial variability of texture. In this case, post-fire erosion processes might have contributed to decreased clay content and are probably more important than other processes associated to temperature. Aggregate stability indices showed good correlation coefficients with the organic matter content. The role of organic matter as cementing agent of soil aggregates is extremely important after fire, since aggregate stability indices showed good correlation coefficients with the organic matter content. Low intensity fire enhanced soil water repellency. In this case, fire-enhanced soil water repellency persisted or increased progressively, but decreased below initial levels at the end of the experiment, but soil water repellency was completely destroyed after moderate or high fuel load treatments. The persistence of wettable conditions after destruction of soil water repellency can be considered as an index of fire severity, since it is a direct consequence of strong reduction of organic matter content.

AB Aim
   Jaguars and pumas, being similar in size and behaviour, are the largest felids of the Neotropics. However, pumas appear to be more resistant to human impacts. Our objective was to compare the response of both species with human impacts at a regional scale in a highly modified region where both species had continuous distribution in the past.
   Location
   The Upper Parana Atlantic Forest (UPAF).
   Methods
   Pumas and jaguars presence-only data were used in an Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA). From the total number of records, we resampled 95 records of each species 10 times to characterize and compare their habitat requirements, built habitat-suitability maps and examined interspecific differences in niche parameters related to present landscape characteristics.
   Results
   Both species showed high dependence on native forest and habitat protection, and low tolerance to anthropogenic environments. However, jaguars showed higher differences between their optimal habitat and the available landscape (mean +/- SD; marginality M = 2.290 +/- 0.072) and lower tolerance to deviations from their optimal habitat (tolerance T = 0.596 +/- 0.013) than pumas (M = 1.358 +/- 0.067, P < 0.001; T = 0.742 +/- 0.022, P < 0.001). Although their niches highly overlapped (Pianka's O = 0.746 +/- 0.069), pumas' higher tolerance resulted in a larger area covered by suitable patches of habitat with higher connectivity. All jaguar-suitable areas were also suitable for pumas; however, 44 +/- 8% of puma-suitable areas were unsuitable or marginal for jaguars.
   Main conclusions
   Pumas showed more tolerance than jaguars to human impacts at a regional scale in the UPAF, a pattern also observed at local and continental scales. Although the proximate factors responsible for the differential response of pumas to human-altered environments seem to be similar at all spatial scales (e.g. broader trophic niche than jaguars), the resultant spatial configuration of suitable habitat at a regional scale might be another important factor determining puma persistence and higher jaguar demands on conservation efforts.

AB An increased emphasis on integrated water management at a catchment scale has led to the development of numerous modelling tools. To support efficient decision making and to better target investment in management actions, such modelling tools need to link socioeconomic information with biophysical data. However, there is still limited experience in developing catchment models that consider environmental changes and economic values in a single framework. We describe a model development process where biophysical modelling is integrated with economic information on the non-market environmental costs and benefits of catchment management changes for a study of the George catchment in northeast Tasmania, Australia. An integrated assessment approach and Bayesian network modelling techniques were used to integrate knowledge about hydrological, ecological and economic systems. Rather than coupling existing information and models, synchronous data collection and model development ensured tailored information exchange between the different components. The approach is largely transferable to the development of integrated hydro-economic models in other river catchments. Our experiences highlight the challenges in synchronizing economic and scientific modelling. These include the selection of common attributes and definition of their levels suitable for the catchment modelling and economic valuation. The lessons from the model development process are useful for future studies that aim to integrate scientific and economic knowledge. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB P>Interactions between vascular plants and bryophytes determine plant community composition in many ecosystems. Yet, little is known about the importance of interspecific differences between bryophytes with respect to their effects on vascular plants. We compared the extent to which species-specific bryophyte effects on vascular plant generative recruitment depend on the following underlying mechanisms: allelopathy, mechanical obstruction, soil moisture and temperature control.
   We sowed 10 vascular plant species into monospecific mats of six chemically and structurally diverse bryophytes, and examined 1-yr seedling recruitment. Allelopathic effects were also assessed in a laboratory phyto-assay.
   Although all bryophytes suppressed vascular plant regeneration, there were significant differences between the bryophyte species. The lack of interactions indicated the absence of species-specific adaptations of vascular plants for recruitment in bryophyte mats. Differences between bryophyte species were best explained by alterations in temperature regime under bryophyte mats, mostly by reduced temperature amplitudes during germination. The temperature regime under bryophyte mats was well predicted by species-specific bryophyte cushion thickness. The fitness of established seedlings was not affected by the presence of bryophytes.
   Our results suggest that climatically or anthropogenically driven changes in the species' composition of bryophyte communities have knock-on effects on vascular plant populations via generative reproduction.

AB Land cover and land use surrounding, fragmented habitat can greatly impact species persistence by altering resource availability, edge effects, or the movement of individuals throughout a landscape. Despite the potential importance of the landscape matrix, ecologists still have limited understanding of the relative effects of different types of land cover and land uses on species patterns and processes in natural systems. Here we investigated whether Neotropical resident bird communities in limestone forest patches differed if they were embedded in three different human-dominated matrix types (agriculture, pert-urban development, and bauxite mining) relative to sites in continuous forest in central Jamaica. We found that species richness, community composition, and abundances were matrix-dependent, with agricultural landscapes supporting greater avian diversity and more intact community assemblages than either pen-urban or bauxite landscapes. Abundance of almost 70% of species differed in forest embedded in the different landscape matrix types. Traits related to resource use best predicted species responses, including diet guild, nest height, habitat association, and foraging strata. Insectivores, frugivores, canopy nesters, understory and canopy foragers, and forest-restricted species rarely observed in matrix habitats had lower abundances in forest fragments embedded in human-dominated matrix types than in continuous forest. In contrast, nectarivores, omnivores, granivores, ground and multi-strata nesters, ground foragers, and species regularly in matrix habitats were least sensitive to forest fragmentation. Results suggest that structure, composition, and land use disturbance regimes in matrix areas impact overall habitat quality in landscapes by potentially mediating resource availability inside as well as outside forest habitat. This study reinforces the importance of differentiating among land cover and land uses in fragmentation research and lends support to the hypothesis that resource availability may be a primary factor driving Neotropical bird responses to fragmentation.

AB Sunlight exposure of winegrape clusters is frequently reported to increase C-13-norisoprenoids in resulting wines, but the timing and mechanism of this influence is not well understood. Fruit zone leaf removal was applied to Vitis vinifera cv. Riesling at three timings: 2, 33 and 68 days past berry set (PBS), and compared to an untreated control. Free and total 1,1,6-trimethyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene (TDN), vitispirane and beta-damascenone were measured in juice and wines, and carotenoid profiles were determined in grapes at midseason and maturity. Significantly higher total TDN was observed in grapes from the 33-day PBS treatment compared to the control and other treatments (195 mu g/L vs 54-87 mu g/L). Total vitispirane in juice was also significantly increased in the 33-day PBS treatment, while total beta-damascenone was reduced in the 68-day PBS treatment compared to the control. Existing HPLC protocols were modified to allow for quantification of zeaxanthin in V. vinifera berries, and zeaxanthin was determined to be significantly higher in the 33-day PBS treatment than the control or other treatments (p < 0.05). Total TDN in juice correlated with free TDN in wine, with 11.0% +/- 2.5% of total juice TDN converted to free TDN in wine. In contrast, total vitispirane increased significantly during fermentation, and was not correlated with vitispirane in juice. In summary, leaf removal at 33 days PBS significantly increased zeaxanthin in Riesling grapes midseason, total TDN and vitispirane in the juice of mature Riesling grapes, and free and total TDN in finished wine, while earlier or later leaf removal had no effect.

AB High-impact biological invasions often involve establishment and spread in disturbed, high-resource patches followed by establishment and spread in biotically or abiotically stressful areas. Evolutionary change may be required for the second phase of invasion (establishment and spread in stressful areas) to occur. When species have low genetic diversity and short selection history, within-generation phenotypic plasticity is often cited as the mechanism through which spread across multiple habitat types can occur. We show that trans-generational plasticity (TGP) can result in pre-adapted progeny that exhibit traits associated with increased fitness both in high-resource patches and in stressful conditions. In the invasive sedge, Cyperus esculentus, maternal plants growing in nutrient-poor patches can place disproportional number of propagules into nutrient-rich patches. Using the invasive annual grass, Aegilops triuncialis, we show that maternal response to soil conditions can confer greater stress tolerance in seedlings in the form of greater photosynthetic efficiency. We also show TGP for a phenological shift in a low resource environment that results in greater stress tolerance in progeny. These lines of evidence suggest that the maternal environment can have profound effects on offspring success and that TGP may play a significant role in some plant invasions.

AB P>1. Changes in cladoceran subfossils in the surface sediments of 54 shallow lakes were studied along a European latitude gradient (36-68 degrees N). Multivariate methods, such as regression trees and ordination, were applied to explore the relationships between cladoceran taxa distribution and contemporary environmental variables, with special focus on the impact of climate.
   2. Multivariate regression tree analysis showed distinct differences in cladoceran community structure and lake characteristics along the latitude gradient, identifying three groups: (i) northern lakes characterised by low annual mean temperature, conductivity, nutrient concentrations and fish abundance, (ii) southern, macrophyte rich, warm water lakes with high conductivity and high fish abundance and (iii) Mid-European lakes at intermediate latitudes with intermediate conductivities, trophic state and temperatures.
   3. Large-sized, pelagic species dominated a group of seven northern lakes with low conductivity, where acid-tolerant species were also occasionally abundant. Small-sized, benthic-associated species dominated a group of five warm water lakes with high conductivity. Cladoceran communities generally showed low species-specific preferences for habitat and environmental conditions in the Mid-European group of lakes. Taxon richness was low in the southern-most, high-conductivity lakes as well as in the two northern-most sub-arctic lakes.
   4. The proportion of cladoceran resting eggs relative to body shields was high in the northern lakes, and linearly (negatively) related to both temperature and Chl a, indicating that both cold climate (short growing season) and low food availability induce high ephippia production.
   5. Latitude and, implicitly, temperature were strongly correlated with conductivity and nutrient concentrations, highlighting the difficulties of disentangling a direct climate signal from indirect effects of climate, such as changes in fish community structure and human-related impacts, when a latitude gradient is used as a climate proxy. Future studies should focus on the interrelationships between latitude and gradients in nutrient concentration and conductivity.

AB Aim
   We tested whether the species-energy and species-human relationships vary between native and both naturalized and casual alien species richness when other environmental variables had been taken into account.
   Location
   Trento Province, a region (c. 6200 km2) on the southern border of the European Alps (Italy), subdivided into 156 contiguous (c. 37.5 km2) cells and ranging in elevation from 66 to 3769 m.
   Methods
   Data were separated into three subsets, representing richness of natives, naturalized aliens and casual aliens and separately related to temperature, human population and various environmental correlates of plant species diversity. We applied ordinary least squares and simultaneous autoregressive regressions to identify potential contrasting responses of the three plant status subsets and hierarchical partitioning to evaluate the relative importance of the predictor variables.
   Results
   Variation in alien plant species richness along the region was almost entirely explained by temperature and human population density. The relationships were positive but strongly curvilinear. Native species richness was less strongly related to either factor but was positively related to the presence of calcareous bedrock. Native species richness had a decelerating positive relationship with temperature (R2 = 55%), whereas naturalized and casual aliens had a positive accelerating relationship explaining 86% and 62% of the variation in richness, respectively. Native species richness had a positive decelerating relationship with population density (R2 = 42%), whilst both alien subsets had a positive accelerating relationship.
   Main conclusions
   Alien species richness was higher in areas with the most rich and diverse assemblages of native species. Areas at high altitudes are not especially prone to alien invasion due to energy constraints, low propagule pressure and disturbance, even considering a potential increased in temperature. Thus, if we consider future environmental change, we should expect a stronger response of aliens than natives in the currently warm, urbanized, low-altitude areas than in cold, high-altitude areas where human population density is low.

AB Sperm morphology (size and shape) and sperm velocity are both positively associated with fertilization success, and are expected to be under strong selection. Until recently, evidence for a link between sperm morphology and velocity was lacking, but recent comparative studies have shown that species with high levels of sperm competition have evolved long and fast sperm. It is therefore surprising that evidence for a phenotypic or genetic relationship between length and velocity within species is equivocal, even though sperm competition is played out in the intraspecific arena. Here, we first show that sperm velocity is positively phenotypically correlated with measures of sperm length in the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata. Second, by using the quantitative genetic "animal model" on a dataset from a multigenerational-pedigreed population, we show that sperm velocity is heritable, and positively genetically correlated to a number of heritable components of sperm length. Therefore, selection for faster sperm will simultaneously lead to the evolution of longer sperm (and vice versa). Our results provide, for the first time, a clear phenotypic and genetic link between sperm length and velocity, which has broad implications for understanding how recently described macroevolutionary patterns in sperm traits have evolved.

AB Biological invasions are a major component of global change with increasing effects on natural ecosystems and human societies. Here, we aim to assess the relationship between plant invader species attributes and the extent of their distribution range size, at the same time that we assess the association between environmental factors and plant invader species richness.
   Spain, Mediterranean region.
   From the species perspective, we calculated the distribution range size of the 106 vascular plant invaders listed in a recently published atlas of alien plant species in Spain. Range size was used as an estimation of the degree of invasion success of the species. To model variation in range size between species as a function of a set of species attributes, we adopted the framework of the generalized linear mixed models because they allow the incorporation of taxonomic categories as nested random factors to control for phylogenetic relationships. From the invaded site perspective, we determined invader plant species richness as the number of species for each 10 x 10 km Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid. For each grid cell, we estimated variables concerning landscape, topography, climate and human settlement. Then, we performed a generalized linear mixed model incorporating a defined spatial correlation structure to assess the relationship between plant invader richness and the environmental predictors.
   From the species perspective, wind dispersal and minimum residence time appeared to favour invasion success. From the invaded site perspective, we identified high anthropogenic disturbance, low altitude, short distance to the coastline and dry, hot weather as the main correlates to UTM grid cell invader richness.
   According to these results, an increasing importance of man-modified ecosystems and global warming in the Mediterranean region should facilitate the expansion of plant invaders, especially wind-dispersed species, leading to the accumulation of invasive species in some sites (i.e. invasion hot spots).

AB We tested predictions of the relative changes in plant leaf traits in response to land uses in Australian eucalypt grassy ecosystems. Predictions were determined from responses observed in European landscapes in relation to disturbances associated with agricultural land uses. We measured specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) across five land uses: reference sites (closest to pre-European state), native pastures (unfertilized), fertilized pastures, sown pastures (cultivated and fertilized) and enriched grassland (previously fertilized, no longer grazed). Leaves were expected to have higher SLA and lower LMDC at sites with increasing fertility and/or disturbance.
   The predictions were confirmed, with SLA increasing progressively in land uses associated with (I) grazing; (2) grazing and fertilization; (3) grazing, fertilization and cultivation. Values for LDMC were closely (but inversely) correlated with those of SLA. For both traits, there were relationships with available soil phosphorus but not with soil total nitrogen. The positive correlation of SLA with phosphorus was not evident above 30 mg kg(-1), the recommended level of phosphorus for improved pastures.
   Results confirm patterns of leaf-trait response to disturbance that reflect fundamental constraints to plant survival in habitats with different levels of resources and disturbances. A conservative strategy for low productivity undisturbed habitats is associated with low SLA and high dry matter content in contrast to fertile disturbed habitats which select for high SLA and low dry matter content. The changes in leaf traits across land uses resulted from species substitution rather than variation within species across sites, and most notably the replacement of native by annual exotic species as land use intensifies.
   Recommended fertilization rates for pasture production convert the ground layer to plants with soft, digestible leaves, that are responsive to fertilizer and desirable for livestock production. However, fertilization also drastically reduces the diversity of native plants and annual plants tend to dominate. The trade-off associated with high production includes increased vulnerability to soil erosion, due to reduced plant cover and low persistence of cover. If alternative ecosystem values such as erosion control, water quality, salinity control and biodiversity persistence are required, incentives may be needed to offset the loss of production that can be gained from fertilizer application.

AB Invasions resulting in the transformation of one ecosystem to another are an increasingly widespread phenomenon. While it is clear that these conversions, particularly between grassland and shrubland systems, have severe consequences, it is often less clear which factors are associated with these conversions. We resampled plots from the 1930s (Weislander VTMs) to test whether two widely assumed factors, changes in fire frequency and nitrogen deposition, are associated with the conversion of coastal sage scrublands to exotic grasslands in southern California. Over the 76-year period, coastal sage scrub cover declined by 49%, being replaced predominantly by exotic grassland species. Grassland encroachment was positively correlated with increased fire frequency and, in areas with low fire frequencies, air pollution (percent fossil carbon as indicated by partial derivative C-14, likely correlated with nitrogen deposition). We conclude that increases in fire frequency and air pollution over the last several decades in southern California may have facilitated the conversion of coastal sage shrubland to exotic grassland systems.

AB Metagentiana striata is an alpine annual herbaceous plant endemic to the east of the Qinghai-Tibet (Q-T) Plateau and adjacent areas. The phylogeography of M. striata was studied by sequencing the chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) trnS-trnG intergenic spacer. Ten haplotypes were identified from an investigation of 232 individuals of M. striata from 14 populations covering the entire geographical range of this species. The level of differentiation amongst populations was very high (G(ST) = 0.746; N-ST = 0.774) and a significant phylogeographical structure was observed (P < 0.05). An analysis of molecular variance found a high variation amongst populations (76%), with F-ST = 0.762 (highly significant, P < 0.001), indicating that little gene flow occurred amongst the different regions; this was explained by the isolation of populations by high mountains along the Q-T Plateau and adjacent areas (N-m = 0.156). Only one ancestral haplotype (A) was common and widespread throughout the distributional range of M. striata. The populations of the Hengduan Mountains region of the south-eastern Q-T Plateau showed high diversity and uniqueness of haplotypes. It is suggested that this region was the potential refugium of M. striata during the Quaternary glaciation, and that interglacial and postglacial range expansion occurred from this refugium. This scenario was in good agreement with the results of nested clade analysis, which inferred that the current spatial distribution of cpDNA haplotypes and populations resulted from range expansion, together with past allopatric fragmentation events.

AB Maternal fitness should be maximized by the optimal division of reproductive investment between offspring number and offspring quality. While evidence for this is abundant in many taxa, there have been fewer tests in mammals, and in particular, humans. We used a dataset of humans spanning three generations from pre-industrial Finland to test how increases in maternal fecundity affect offspring quality and maternal fitness in contrasting socio-economic conditions. For `resource-poor' landless families, but not `resource-rich' landowning families, maternal fitness returns diminished with increased maternal fecundity. This was because the average offspring contribution to maternal fitness declined with increased maternal fecundity for landless but not landowning families. This decline was due to reduced offspring recruitment with increased maternal fecundity. However, in landowning families, recruited offspring fecundity increased with increased maternal fecundity. This suggests that despite decreased offspring recruitment, maternal fitness is not reduced in favourable socio-economic conditions due to an increase in subsequent offspring fecundity. These results provide evidence consistent with an offspring quantity-quality trade-off in the lifetime reproduction of humans from poor socio-economic conditions. The results also highlight the importance of measuring offspring quality across their whole lifespan to estimate reliably the fitness consequences of increased maternal fecundity.

AB We analyzed satellite track data for 186 loggerhead sea turtles in the North Pacific Ocean using remotely sensed environmental data to characterize pelagic habitat. A large number of candidate habitat variables were merged to the satellite track data and statistically compared to background values over a large spatiotemporal grid which bounded overall occupancy. Five statistically significant variables were identified out of the 16 environmental variables examined. Two of these variables have strong seasonal, interannual, and spatial patterns (sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentration), while three others were primarily spatial (earth magnetic force, earth magnetic declination, and earth magnetic inclination). Habitat selectivity for these variables was quantified using preference curve methodology established in the foraging literature. The output from the selectivity curves was used to predict a multivariate loggerhead sea turtle habitat index across the pelagic North Pacific. This predicted habitat was ground-truthed with newly available satellite track data. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Following catastrophic disturbances, succession and vegetation development occur, but in the prolonged absence of these disturbances a decline (retrogressive) phase follows in which nutrient availability and tree biomass declines considerably. We measured plant diversity across six long-term chronosequences that each included retrogressive stages in Australia, New Zealand, Alaska, Hawaii and Sweden. In contrast to theories predicting negative or hump-shaped responses of tree diversity to biomass or soil fertility, tree species richness often peaked coincidentally with tree basal area (a surrogate of tree biomass), and declined during retrogression. Similar patterns were found regardless of whether or not species richness estimates were rarefraction-adjusted to correct for variation in stem densities across plots. The Shannon-Weiner diversity index sometimes showed the same pattern, but in two chronosequences was least when tree basal area peaked; this was driven by the domination of total basal area by single tree species in both cases. The decline in tree diversity during retrogression was often associated with reduced relative amounts of total phosphorus in soil. In contrast, total vascular plant species richness often increased during retrogression. These results demonstrate that forests with high tree diversity and biomass do not persist indefinitely in the long-term absence of catastrophic disturbance, and that similar patterns occur across the boreal, temperate and subtropical zones.

AB 1. Ecosystem retrogression occurs during the very long-term absence of major disturbances, and it is characterized by decreases in productivity, decomposition rates and nutrient availability. Ratios of total soil nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) also characteristically increase during retrogression, but the nature of N inputs to ecosystems undergoing retrogression has seldom been explored.
   2. We studied a 5000-year-old chronosequence involving 30 islands that differed greatly in history of disturbance (wildfire through lightning strike), with increasing time since disturbance leading to ecosystem retrogression. For each island, we quantified N inputs through biological fixation by cyanobacteria hosted by each of two feather moss species that dominate the ground layer vegetation (Pleurozium schreberi and Hylocomium splendens), and compared these with N inputs through atmospheric deposition.
   3. Both N-2 fixation per unit land area and fixation per unit moss mass increased significantly with increasing time since disturbance for both moss species. As retrogression progressed, the amount of total N input through biological fixation increased to levels comparable to that of input through atmospheric deposition.
   4. Across the chronosequence, N has been accumulating in the humus layer at a rate of 1.8 kg ha(-1) year(-1) in the absence of fire during the past 5000 years. The added N input from biological fixation in this area of low atmospheric N deposition helps explain this relatively high rate of sequestration.
   5. Our results show that, contrary to several claims in the literature, biological N-2 fixation is not only important in early-successional ecosystems but also in late-successional systems that have undergone retrogression. This fixation can contribute both to the elevated N : P ratios that occur during retrogression and to accumulation of N capital in the soil. However, much of this N may exist in forms that are relatively unavailable to co-existing plant species.

AB Background: Suicide is an important and potentially preventable consequence of serious mental disorders of unknown etiology. Gene expression profiling technology provides an unbiased approach to identifying candidate genes for mental disorders. Microarray studies with post-mortem prefrontal cortex ( Brodmann's Area 46/10) tissue require larger sample sizes. This study poses the question: to what extent are differentially expressed genes for suicide a diagnostic specific set of genes ( bipolar disorder vs. schizophrenia) vs. a shared common pathway?
   Results: In a reanalysis of a large set of Affymetrix Human Genome U133A microarray data, gene expression levels were compared between suicide completers vs. non-suicide groups within a diagnostic group, namely Bipolar disorder ( N = 45; 22 suicide completers; 23 non-suicide) or Schizophrenia ( N = 45; 10 suicide completers; 35 non-suicide). Among bipolar samples, 13 genes were found and among schizophrenia samples, 70 genes were found as differentially expressed. Two genes, PLSCR4 ( phospholipid scramblase 4) and EMX2 ( empty spiracles homolog 2 ( Drosophila)) were differentially expressed in suicide groups of both diagnostic groups by microarray analysis. By qRT-PCR, PLSCR4 and EMX2 were significantly down-regulated in the schizophrenia suicide completers, but could not be confirmed in bipolar disorder.
   Conclusion: This molecular level analysis suggests that diagnostic specific genes predominate to shared genes in common among suicide vs. non-suicide groups. These differentially expressed, candidate genes are neural correlates of suicide, not necessarily causal. While suicide is a complex endpoint with many pathways, these candidate genes provide entry points for future studies of molecular mechanisms and genetic association studies to test causality.

AB Hydrological connectivity is known to determine biodiversity patterns across large river floodplains, but it is often greatly altered by human activities. indicators and predictors of the response of river alteration or restoration are therefore needed. Recent papers suggested that fish environmental guilds - based on species flow preferences - could be used as a tool to assess ecological status of rivers. In the Loire floodplain, we described fish assemblages across the floodplain at the onset of the dry season and we determined whether observed spatial patterns could be related to environmental variables, especially connectivity. Based on specific composition of 46 electrofished waterbodies, a hierarchical typology of the Loire floodplain assemblages was built using self-organizing maps. Each assemblage of the typology was characterized by a set of species using the indicator value method. These species sets and the composition of the assemblages revealed a gradient of flow preferences in the different assemblages identified. A stepwise discriminant analysis showed that the most important variable determining assemblage composition was the hydrological connectivity. Finally, the conclusion was made that a high connectivity level is needed to conserve native fish diversity in the Loire floodplain, notably because the number of protected and native species increased with connectivity, and because the number of exotic species increased with isolation.

AB Hvbridization and polyploidization are now recognized as major phenomena in the evolution of plants, promoting,Q genetic diversity, adaptive radiation and speciation. Modern molecular techniques have recently provided evidence that allopolyploidy can induce several types of genetic and epigenetic events that are of critical importance for the evolutionary success of these plants: (1) chromosomal rearrangements within one or both parental genomes contribute toward proper meiotic pairing and isolation of the hybrid from its progenitors; (2) demethylation and activation of dormant transposable elements may trigger insertional mutagenesis and changes in local patterns of gene expression, facilitating rapid genomic reorganization; (3) rapid and reproducible loss of low copy DNA sequences appears to result in further differentiation of homoeologous chromosomes; and (4) organ-specific up- or down-regulation of one of the duplicated genes, may result in unequal expression or silencing one copy. All these alterations also have the potential, while stabilizing allopolyploid genomes, to produce novel expression patterns and new phenotypes, which together with increased heterozygosity and gene redundancy might confer on allopolyploids an elevated evolutionary potential, with effects at scales ranging from molecular to ecological. Although important advances have been rnade in understanding genomic responses to allopolyploidization, further insights are still expected to be gained in the near future, Such as the direction and nature of the diploidization process, functional relevance of gene expression alterations, molecular mechanisms that result in adaptation to different ecologies/habitats, and ecological and evolutionary implications of recurrent polyploidization.

AB Reduction in grazing intensity and the use of traditional instead of commercial breeds have frequently been recommended to meet biodiversity and production goals in sustainable grazing systems. The impact of such practices within a range of contrasting grassland vegetation types was studied. This paper describes the effects on foraging behaviour in a study conducted over three years on mesotrophic or semi-natural grasslands in UK (steers), Germany (steers), France (heifers) and Italy (sheep). Three treatments were performed: (i) a moderate grazing intensity using a commercial breed, (ii) a more lenient grazing intensity with a commercial breed and (iii) a more lenient intensity with a traditional breed. Livestock at all sites preferentially selected bites containing legumes and forbs, and also short rather than tall vegetative patches. Grazing intensity affected not only diet consumed, largely reflecting the different availabilities of dietary components, but also some differences in diet selection. Livestock grazing the more productive mesotrophic grasslands more frequently exploited short patches of higher nutritive value, which is expected to reinforce the spatial heterogeneity of the pastures. Studies in the UK and Germany also revealed that steers showed a more pronounced selection for short patches at the lenient grazing intensity. More homogeneous grazing by livestock on the semi-natural grasslands with finescale heterogeneity is likely to decrease their spatial heterogeneity. There were few differences in the choices made by commercial and traditional breed livestock. North Devon steers in the UK expressed a greater selection for tall grass-forb bites than Charolais x Holstein crossbreds, whereas traditional breeds appeared slightly less selective than commercial breeds at the other three sites.

AB The goal of habitat selection studies is to identify important habitats for a particular species. However, most studies using radiotelemetry have focused on habitat-selection patterns using daytime positions only. We used 24 h data from six female brown bears (Ursus arctos L., 1758) equipped with GPS-GSM collars and activity loggers to analyse variations in habitat selection related to diel variations in activity (foraging and resting). We found that the bears rested mainly during the daylight hours and foraged mainly during the crepuscular and nocturnal hours. The bears selected habitats differently when they were resting than when they were foraging. We found no selection for tall coniferous forest using all data, but this habitat was selected by resting bears and avoided by foraging bears. Thus, for studies of habitat selection, our results show the importance of obtaining data from all 24 h and dividing these data into relevant categories based on the diel activity pattern of the studied species.

AB Songbirds are an important model system for the study of the neurological bases of song learning, but variation in song learning accuracy and adult song complexity remains poorly understood. Current models of sexual selection predict that signals such as song must be costly to develop or maintain to constitute honest indicators of male quality. It has been proposed that reductions of nestling condition during song development might limit the expression of song learning. Adult song could thus act as an indicator of early stress as only males that enjoy good condition during development could learn accurately and sing long songs or large repertoires. We tested this hypothesis in the zebra finch by modifying early condition through cross-fostering chicks to small, medium, and large broods. Song learning was very accurate and was found to reflect very closely tutor song characteristics and to depend on the number of males in the tutoring group. Although the brood size manipulation strongly affected several measures of nestling condition and adult biometry, we found no relationship between early condition and song learning scores or song characteristics. Similarly, brain mass and high vocal center (HVC), robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), and lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN) volumes did not covary with nestling condition and growth measurements. We found no significant relationship between song repertoire size and HVC and RA volumes, although there was a nonsignificant trend for HVC to increase with increasing proportion of learnt elements in a song. In conclusion, the results provide no evidence for song learning to be limited by nestling condition during the period of nutritional dependence from the parents in this species.

AB Studies of secondary sexual ornamentation and its maintenance by sexual selection tend to focus on males; however, females may also possess showy ornaments. For example, female mandrills possess facial coloration that ranges from black to bright pink. We used fortnightly photographs of 52 semi-free-ranging females aged above 3 years over 19 months to evaluate whether colour conveys information concerning female competitive ability, reproductive quality, age or reproductive status. Colour was not related to female rank or quality (body mass index, age at first birth or mean inter-birth interval); however, colour did increase significantly with age and primiparous females were darker than multiparous females. Colour may therefore signal reproductive quality, as younger females are less fertile and produce smaller offspring. Colour was brighter during the follicular phase than during the luteal phase, suggesting that it may signal fertility. Colour also varied across gestation and peaked at four and eight weeks post-parturition, suggesting that it may signal approaching parturition and lactation. Future studies should examine the relationship between colour and the menstrual cycle in more detail, the hormonal basis of female colour, and determine experimentally whether mandrills of both sexes attend to differences in colour between and within females.

AB Molecular variation is often used to infer the demographic history of species, but sometimes the complexity of species history can make such inference difficult. The willow warbler, Phylloscopus trochilus, shows substantially less geographical variation than the chiffchaff, Phylloscopus collybita, both in morphology and in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) divergence. We therefore predicted that the willow warbler should harbour less nuclear DNA diversity than the chiffchaff. We analysed sequence data obtained from multiple samples of willow warblers and chiffchaffs for the mtDNA cytochrome b gene and four nuclear genes. We confirmed that the mtDNA diversity among willow warblers is low (pi = 0.0021). Sequence data from three nuclear genes (CHD-Z, AFLP-WW1 and MC1R) not linked to the mitochondria demonstrated unexpectedly high nucleotide diversity (pi values of 0.0172, 0.0141 and 0.0038) in the willow warbler, on average higher than the nucleotide diversity for the chiffchaff (pi values of 0.0025, 0.0017 and 0.0139). In willow warblers, Tajima's D analyses showed that the mtDNA diversity, but not the nuclear DNA diversity, has been reduced relative to the neutral expectation of molecular evolution, suggesting the action of a selective sweep affecting the maternally inherited genes. The large nuclear diversity seen within willow warblers is not compatible with processes of neutral evolution occurring in a population with a constant population size, unless the long-term effective population size has been very large (N-e > 10(6)). We suggest that the contrasting patterns of genetic diversity in the willow warbler may reflect a more complex evolutionary history, possibly including historical demographic fluctuations or historical male-biased introgression of nuclear genes from a differentiated population of Phylloscopus warblers.

AB In the last 20 years, new species, asexual reproduction, polyploidy and hybridization have all been reported within the genus Cobitis. An understanding of the current distribution and baseline phylogeographical history of 'true' nonhybrid Cobitis species is crucial in order to unravel these discoveries. In the present work, we investigated the phylogeography of the spined loach, Cobitis taenia, using 1126 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from 174 individuals collected at 47 sites. In total, 51 haplotypes that differed at 49 positions (4.35%) were detected. We deduce that C. taenia survived European glaciations in at least three refuges in the Ponto-Caspian area. Two of these refuges each provided a major lineage that recolonized Europe in separate directions: one westward to England and the other spreading north into Russia before moving west. A third (minor) lineage that contributed little to the recolonization of Europe was also revealed - remaining near its Black Sea refuge. However, more recent history was difficult to resolve with colonization from a more western refugium during the last glacial maximum (LGM) a distinct possibility. Nested clade analysis indicates a pattern of restricted gene flow with isolation by distance at the first two levels and overall. Unlike many other European freshwater fish species, the Danube is not part of the current distribution of C. taenia, nor was it used as either a refuge or a source of colonization of Europe. Low genetic diversity within C. taenia suggests that its colonization of Europe is relatively recent. Demographic analyses revealed a history of recent expansion and isolation by distance.

AB The behavior of several landscape pattern metrics were tested against various pattern scenarios generated by neutral landscape models, including number of classes, scale-map extent, scale-resolution, class proportion, aggregation level-RULE, and aggregation level-SimMap. The results demonstrate that most of the metrics are sensitive to certain pattern scenarios, yet are not sensitive to others; therefore, none of them is appropriate for all aspects of a landscape pattern. Despite these limitations, some of these metrics are recommended for future use, which include total number of patches, average patch size, total edge density, double-logged fractal, contagion, and aggregation index. Special attention should be paid to the relationships between metric values and ecological processes rather than the numbers themselves. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society.

AB Functional stability, measured in terms of resistance and resilience of respiration and growth rate of bacteria and fungi, was studied in soils that have been exposed to copper and low pH for more than twenty years. We used treatments, consisting of soil with no or high copper load (0 or 750 kg ha(-1)) and low or neutral pH (4.0 or 6.1). Stability was examined by applying an additional stress in the form of lead or salt. After addition of lead, respiration (decomposition of freshly added lucerne meal) showed lower resistance at low than at neutral pH and at high copper than at low copper. The most acid and contaminated soil was the least resistant. Respiration showed no resilience after addition of lead. Bacterial growth rate (thymidine incorporation) also showed resistance at low pH but only in soils that were not contaminated with copper.
   After addition of salt, respiration showed no differences in resistance but the soils without copper contamination showed higher resilience. Bacterial growth rate showed lower resistance at low pH than at neutral pH, the latter in which the growth rate increased by on average 123%. This increase at high pH was faster in soil without copper than in soil with copper contamination in which the growth rate initially decreased and then increased. The effects of secondary stress depended on the nature of the stress (lead or salt) and on the parameter measured (respiration or bacterial growth rate). In general the highest resistance and/or resilience were found in the least contaminated soils with neutral pH and/or no copper contamination. Thus, the microbial communities in the cleaner soils showed the highest functional stability. The results seem to confirm the notion that environmental stress alters ecosystems such that supplementary stress will have stronger impacts than in an unstressed system. The results may also confirm the insurance-hypothesis that reduced biodiversity due to the first stress negatively affected community stability. As an alternative, we discuss the observed effects in terms of altered energy budget.

AB We measured aboveground plant biomass and soil inorganic nitrogen pools in a biodiversity experiment in northern Sweden, with plant species richness ranging from 1 to 12 species. In general, biomass increased and nitrate pools decreased with increasing species richness. Transgressive overyielding of mixed plant communities compared to the most productive of the corresponding monocultures occurred in communities with and without legumes. N-2-fixing legumes had a fertilizing function, while non-legumes had a N retaining function. Plant communities with only legumes had a positive correlation between biomass and soil nitrate content, whereas in plant communities without legumes they were negatively correlated. Both nitrate and ammonium soil pools in mixed non-legume communities were approximately equal to the lowest observed in the corresponding monocultures. In mixed legume/non-legume communities, no correlation was found for soil nitrate with either biomass or legume biomass as percentage of total biomass. The idea of complementarity among species in nitrogen acquisition was supported in both pure non-legume and mixed non-legume/legume communities. In the latter, however, facilitation through increased nitrogen availability and retention, was probably dominating. Our results suggest that diversity effects on biomass and soil N pools through resource use complementarity depend on the functional traits of species, especially N-2 fixation or high productivity.

AB Predictive models are increasingly used in geomorphology, but systematic evaluations of novel statistical techniques are still limited. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM), classification tree analysis (CTA), neural networks (ANN) and multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS) in predictive geomorphological modelling. Five different distribution models both for non-sorted and sorted patterned ground were constructed on the basis of four terrain parameters and four soil variables. To evaluate the models, the original data set of 9997 squares of 1 ha in size was randomly divided into model training (70%, n=6998) and model evaluation sets (30%, n=2999).
   In general, active sorted patterned ground is clearly defined in upper fell areas with high slope angle and till soils. Active non-sorted patterned ground is more common in valleys with higher soil moisture and fine-scale concave topography. The predictive performance of each model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the Kappa value. The relatively high discrimination capacity of all models, AUC=0.85-0.88 and Kappa=0.49-0.56, implies that the model's predictions provide an acceptable index of sorted and non-sorted patterned ground occurrence. The best performance for model calibration data for both data sets was achieved by the CTA. However, when the predictive mapping ability was explored through the evaluation data set, the model accuracies of CTA decreased clearly compared to the other modelling techniques. For model evaluation data MARS performed marginally best.
   Our results show that the digital elevation model and soil data can be used to predict relatively robustly the activity of patterned ground in fine scale in a subarctic landscape. This indicates that predictive geomorphological modelling has the advantage of providing relevant and useful information on earth surface processes over extensive areas, such data being unavailable through more conventional survey methods.

AB We quantified supply and establishment limitation as components of seedling recruitment for five species common to the temperate forests of central Ontario. Establishment limitation was the primary cause of recruitment failure for the three most common species: Acer saccharum Marsh., Betula alleghaniensis Britt., and Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carriere. The main barrier to establishment (including germination and seedling emergence) was a lack of suitable substrates, rather than a lack of light. Supply limitation, on the other hand, was the primary cause of recruitment failure for two less common species, Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. and Fagus grandifolia Ehrh. The cause of supply limitation was a lack of parent trees, in the case of A. balsamea, and low fecundity, in the case of F. grandifolia. Our results suggest that niche differences (i.e., germination requirements) are more important than dispersal in structuring temperate forest communities. Our results also suggest that availability of suitable substrates is the primary factor limiting seedling recruitment following logging.

AB Fish community metrics and diversity indices have often been proposed as indicators to support an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management. The response of eight fish community indicators to spatio-temporal changes in fishing effort was studied by comparing the rate of change in (i) areas subject to different levels (high, medium, and low) of fishing effort and (ii) areas inside and outside a closed area (the plaice box) where management measures led to changes in fishing effort over time. Several indicators showed broadly consistent responses to fishing effort (slope of the biomass-size spectra, mean weight, and mean maximum length) while a range of biodiversity indices and biomass did not. The response of the indicators to spatio-temporal changes in fishing effort showed that, with the exception of the slope of the biomass-size spectra, none of the indicators reliably detected the effects of spatial management measures at the scales of time and space that were used for these analyses. While some of the size-based indicators we tested did provide evidence for fishing impacts on communities, the response of the indicators to fishing was not straightforward and may have depended on environmental conditions and historic fishing regimes. Therefore, the indicators would provide limited support for assessing the effects of short-term and small-scale management actions and must be applied with caution until we have an improved theoretical understanding of their response to fishing and the environment.

AB In a field experiment on the island of Helgoland ( southeast North Sea), we investigated whether migration strategy or competition between the sexes cause the differential timing of spring migration of male and female northern wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe) ( males migrating earlier). The study included two subspecies, heading towards Greenland/Iceland and Scandinavia, respectively, and is based on colour-ringing and remote weighing of individuals. Despite food offered ad libitum, most Scandinavian birds left the island on the day of arrival or stayed only 1-3 days, whereas more than half of Greenlandic/Icelandic birds stayed for up to 12 days and refuelled rapidly. In the latter subspecies, males showed a positive correlation of departure fuel load and fuel deposition rate, resembling time-minimizers in optimal migration theory. In contrast, females departed irrespective of fuel deposition rate, with an approximately constant level of fuel stores. This level was lower than in males, but sufficient to enable by-passing of stopover sites en route, allowing us to regard females as time-minimizers also. Since females are not able to reach Greenland without additional refuelling elsewhere and males appeared to have a larger potential for by-passing stopover sites, time-selection seems to be more pronounced in males and may be the reason for earlier migration of males. Intraspecific aggressive interactions between colour-ringed birds were predominantly won by the initiator, by males and by larger birds, whereas fuel load and subspecies did not affect the outcome. Although compared to females, males were more often dominant at the feeding stations or held territories, refuelling patterns could not be explained by dominance. Subordinate or non-territorial birds did not refuel at a lower rate or depart with lower fuel loads than dominant or territorial birds. In non-territorial birds, the restricted access to feeding stations was made up with larger doses of food taken per visit, leading to the same energy intake as that of dominant and territorial birds. Therefore, competition during stopover could be eliminated as the reason for differential timing of migration of male and female wheatears, but this result may be species-specific.

AB The northern Australian woody vegetation is predominantly evergreen despite an intensely seasonal climate and a diversity of deciduous species in the regional. ora. From a global climatic perspective the dominance of evergreen rather than deciduous trees in the Australian savannas is apparently anomalous when compared with other savannas of the world. However, this pattern is not unexpected in light of existing theory that emphasises photosynthetic return relative to cost of investment between deciduous and evergreen species. (a) Climatically, monsoonal Australia is more extreme in terms of rainfall seasonality and variability and high air temperatures than most other parts of the seasonally dry tropics. Existing theory predicts that extreme variability and high temperatures favour evergreen trees that can maximise the period during which leaves assimilate CO2. (b) Soil infertility is known to favour evergreens, given the physiological cost of leaf construction, and the northern Australian vegetation grows mainly on deeply weathered and infertile Tertiary regoliths. (c) These regoliths also provide stores of ground water that evergreens are able to exploit during seasonal drought, thereby maintaining near constant transpiration throughout the year. (d) Fire disturbance appears to be an important secondary factor in explaining the dominance of evergreens in the monsoon tropics, based on the fact that most deciduous tree species of the region are restricted to small fire-protected sites. (e) Evolutionary history cannot explain the predominance of evergreens, given the existence of a wide range of deciduous species, including deciduous eucalypts, in the regional tree flora.

AB Various ecological processes influence patterns of species diversity at multiple spatial scales. One process that is potentially important but rarely considered is community assembly. I assembled model communities using species pools of differing size to examine how the history of community assembly may affect multi-scale diversity patterns. The model contained three scales at which diversity could be measured: local community, metacommunity, and species pool. Local species saturation occurred, as expected from the competition and predation built in the model. However, local communities did not become resistant to invasions except when the species pool was very small. Depending on dispersal rate and trophic level, the larger the species pool, the harder it was to predict which species invades which local community at a given time. Consequently, local-community dissimilarity maintained by assembly history increased linearly with pool size, even though local diversity was decoupled from pool size. These results have two implications for multi-scale diversity patterns. First, assembly history may provide an explanation for scale-dependent relationships between local and regional diversity: assembly causes the relationship to be curvilinear at one scale (local community), while linear at another (metacommunity). Second, assembly history influences how gamma-diversity is partitioned into alpha- and beta-diversity: assembly causes the relative contribution of beta to increase with pool size. Overall, this study suggests that community assembly history interacts with species pool size to regulate multi-scale patterns of species diversity.

AB Wolves, Canis lupus, routinely live in large packs that include unrelated individuals and mature offspring. Studies. show that individual wolves that live in large packs suffer reduced foraging returns. Therefore, group hunting and group living (sociality) in wolves is generally thought to be favoured by indirect fitness gains accrued through kin-directed altruism. However, we show that kin-directed altruism cannot account for groups that include mature offspring or unrelated individuals. We also present an analysis that incorporates a previously ignored feature of wolf foraging ecology, namely the loss of food to scavenging ravens, Corvus corax. By accounting for this process, we show that individuals in large packs do indeed accrue foraging advantages. In the hypothetical absence of this scavenging pressure, an individual would maximize its rate of prey acquisition, and minimize its risk of energetic shortfall, by foraging with just one other individual. However, incorporating the effect of scavenging by ravens leads to a dramatic increase in the predicted group size. Our analysis indicates that per capita gains are highest in the largest observed packs. The greater food-sharing costs in a larger pack are more than offset by smaller losses to scavengers and increased rates of prey acquisition. Thus, in contrast with previous interpretations, the selfish benefits of social foraging appear to contribute to the maintenance of sociality in wolves after all. We explore whether such benefits favour group living in various social carnivores that hunt large prey and are thus vulnerable to scavenging.

AB In wheat, spike growth prior to anthesis is a key period influencing kernel set. Incident radiation and crop N status affect the accumulation of dry matter (DM) and nitrogen (N) in the spike, as observed at anthesis. However, the influence of these two factors on the dynamics of spike growth throughout the pre-anthesis period is not fully understood. Our objective was to investigate the effects of incident radiation and crop N nutrition on the dynamics of spike dry matter, N concentration and N content throughout the pre-anthesis period and to propose models describing spike DM and N content during spike growth, per unit area. We also investigated whether kernel number was related to spike N content at anthesis independently of spike DM, a controversial issue. Field experiments were conducted over two seasons with 'Tremie' winter wheat and over an additional season with 'Arche' and 'Soissons'. Treatments involved the application of N fertiliser at different stages and rates to achieve various levels of N deficit and the use of shading nets at various periods during spike growth to reduce incident radiation. Shading reduced spike DM but increased spike N concentration; it reduced spike N content whenever there was a large decrease in incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). All these effects occurred only during the second half of the spike growth period, even if shading was applied from the onset of spike growth. Crop N deficit reduced spike DM, N concentration and N accumulation. Spike DM and N content were affected throughout the spike growth period if the deficit started before the beginning of spike growth, and was severe. Continuous and temporary N deficits induced similar responses. The interaction between shading and N fertilisation was not significant for spike DM and N content, but was significant for spike N concentration. Two models, one predicting spike DM and the other predicting spike N content at any time during spike growth were developed. They were validated with an independent data set and by cross-validation with the initial database. Both models fitted the observed data well. The input variables, cumulative PAR after sowing, nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) of the crop and cumulative thermal time after sowing are easy to measure or to simulate. Kernel number was correlated with both spike DM and spike N content at anthesis, demonstrating that N content played no role in determining kernel number independently of DM.

AB In contrast to competing explanations of species-area relationships (SARs), neutral theory is dynamic, meaning that it should explain patterns in both space and time. However, most empirical tests of neutral theory have. relied on snapshots, such as comparisons of observed and simulated SARs observed at one point in time. I used 35 years of data from permanent plots in Kansas grasslands to test the ability of strict and modified neutral models to reproduce observed species-area and species-time relationships (STRs). Holding species density to observed values, the models could generate realistic SARs or STRs, but not both simultaneously. Parameter combinations that simulated realistic STRs led to SARs with extremely steep slopes. To examine the consequences of relaxing neutrality, I incorporated plant functional types into the model. More realistic dominance produced only limited improvement in the simulated results, and indicates that the models' primary flaw is their failure to reproduce rapid but spatially correlated changes in species composition. In these grasslands, characterized by large interannual variation in resources and many short-lived species, functional differences among species play a strong role in driving macroscopic patterns. The results emphasize the need to test neutral models, and other dynamic community models, with spatiotemporal data.

AB Studies on glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus) breeding in the Barents Sea have reported that high blood levels of halogenated organic contaminants in this species might cause reproductive, behavioral, and developmental stress. However, potential endocrine system modulation caused by contaminant exposure has yet not been reported in this Arctic apical predator. In this present study we aimed to investigate whether the current levels of a selection of organochlorines (OCs) were associated with altered circulating levels of thyroid hormones (THs) in free-ranging adult glaucous gulls breeding at Bear Island in the Barents Sea. Blood concentrations of 14 polychlorinated biphenyls, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), oxychlordane, and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyidichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) were quantified, in addition to free and total thyroxine (T-4) and triiodothyronine (T-3), in plasma of 66 glaucous gulls in the spring of 2001. Negative correlations were found between plasma levels of T-4 and T-4:T-3 ratio, and blood levels of OCs in male glaucous gulls. Despite their relatively low contribution to the total OC fraction, HCB and oxychlordane were the most prominent compounds in terms of their negative effect on the variation of the T4:T3 ratio. Moreover, lower T4 levels and T4:T3 ratios were measured in glaucous gulls breeding in a colony exposed to high levels of OCs, compared with a less exposed colony. Levels of T3 were elevated in the high-OC-exposed colony. This may indicate that the glaucous gull is susceptible to changes to TH homeostasis mediated by exposure to halogenated organic contaminants.

AB Techniques for estimating tidal elevation and confinement (proxy for salinity) using modem benthic foraminiferal census data from New Zealand harbours and lower-salinity estuaries are described and assessed for their utility for reconstructing the depositional settings of late-Holocene sequences. We describe a simple modern analogue technique for estimating tidal or subtidal elevation of Holocene fossil faunas, utilizing the modem data set most applicable to the Holocene setting (sheltered tidal harbours and inlets, or lower-salinity estuaries). Canonical correspondence analysis was used to extract a synthetic confinement gradient from foraminiferal census data in transects down five New Zealand estuaries. This gradient was used to develop a New Zealand Confinement Index that can be computed for New Zealand modem and Holocene estuarine and harbour samples based on their foraminiferal composition. The value of the method for estimating Holocene elevational and confinement (palaeosalinity) histories was assessed for a tidal inlet and the middle reaches of an estuary. Two earthquake-related vertical displacements are recognized in a 1.1 rn core from Ahuriri Inlet, Hawkes Bay: (1) a 1-2 m subsidence (c. 500 BP) from low tidal to subtidal; (2) a 1.5-2.5 m uplift (1931 Napier Earthquake) from subtidal to high tidal, followed by progressively increasing confinement in a much smaller inlet. A substantial confinement increase (probable salinity decrease) is recognized in a 0.8 m core from Rangitopuni Estuary, Auckland, accompanying the widespread disappearance of cockle beds. Palynology shows that this event is associated with forest clearance in the watershed following earliest significant human settlement (c. 600-800 BP). Taphonomic dissolution of calcareous tests was a significant factor in the lesser accuracy of elevational estimates in our estuarine study core, although dissolution appears to correspond with increased freshwater runoff. Taphonomic disaggregation and loss of agglutinated foraminifera did not appear to be significant in these short cores.

AB Survival rates during the first winter of life are strongly size dependent and variable in many temperate fish populations. Starvation is often implicated as the cause of size-dependent first-winter mortality, and interannual variation in energy accumulation and the allocation between growth and storage is a likely source of variability. We examined these processes in young-of-the-year Hudson River striped bass Morone saxatilis, which are known to experience size-selective winter mortality and a winter energy deficit. Neutral-lipid and lean-tissue masses were determined for fish of five consecutive year classes collected through the first year of life. Differences in scaling relationships between body length and neutral-lipid and lean-tissue mass were used to infer patterns of resource allocation. Lipid reserves scaled isometrically with body length in summer but increased at a greater rate than did body length in autumn and winter. Lean-tissue allometries were less variable but followed a similar seasonal cycle. Allometric slopes were homogeneous across years, but significant interannual variation in length-specific lipid content and lean-tissue mass in the later half of the growing season indicated variable allocation patterns. During winter, up to 21% of total energy content and 50% of neutral-lipid stores were depleted. The-results indicate that energy allocation patterns result from interactions among season, ontogenetic stage, and body size. The variation in growth, allocation, and severity of the winter energy deficit likely interact to determine first-winter survival.

AB Several individual-based models (IBMs) have recently been developed to improve understanding of factors impacting on recruitment variability of anchovy (Engraulis capensis/encrasicolus) in the southern Benguela. These IBMs have focused on early life history stages ( eggs through to post-larvae) as it is thought that variations in anchovy recruitment strength are primarily driven by biological and/or physical factors impacting on these stages. The pelagic zone of the Benguela system constitutes an ideal system for studying the coupling between biological and physical processes; in the IBMs this coupling is obtained by releasing particles endowed with biological properties in the virtual currents resulting from the output of a hydrodynamic model of the southwestern coast of South Africa. The particles are tracked through virtual time and space and their final locations are assessed in terms of previously defined criteria deemed to promote successful recruitment. The aim of this paper is to provide a synthesis of the results of IBMs of the early stages of anchovy in the southern Benguela constructed to date. Emphasis is placed on the methodological aspects of these studies and on the sequential link of several simulation experiments of increasing complexity. In addition to improving understanding, such an approach allows for effective interplay between modelling experiments and surveys or laboratory experiments. Details of individual IBM experiments and their results have been published elsewhere.

AB Encrusting-coralline-algae habitat monopolized the substrata (>74% cover) under canopies of Ecklonia radiata at four sites (similar to1 km apart) within each of four localities (> 100 km apart) spanning > 1000 km of continuous South Australian coastline. This monopolization was analyzed experimentally to test whether canopy-mediated shade and sedimentation account for this canopy-understorey association. I tested the hypothesis that initially different habitat types (turf-forming-algae habitat versus habitat dominated by encrusting coralline algae) will converge to become like those under E. radiata if subjected to lower light and accumulation of sediment in the absence of E. radiata. Convergence in the absence of canopies, but in physically similar environments as under canopies, provides strong evidence that understorey habitats are primarily dependent on the manipulated environments. The experiment was provided with sufficient time (338 days) to adequately test for convergence as evidenced by indistinguishable percentage covers of encrusting coralline algae between canopies and treatments of shade on previously unoccupied rock and between habitat types transplanted to canopies. Convergence of habitat types, however, did not occur under treatments of shade and sedimentation. The effect of lowering light accounted for similar to52% of the effect of canopies on percentage cover of encrusting-coralline-algae habitat. The effect of reducing sediment accumulation under shade was negligible. The magnitude of unaccounted effects (similar to48%) highlights a need to assess alternative factors that act to exclude taxa from or include taxa in the understorey assemblage. It is clear that canopies place strong constraints on the presence and abundance of many taxa, but not encrusting-algae habitats which beneficially coexist as understorey. A more complete identification of such positive and negative effects is needed to improve our understanding of the conditions that produce readily recognizable canopy-understorey associations that are repeated with great fidelity on a regional scale.

AB Coastal freshwater fishes provide valuable models for studying the role of the last glaciations in promoting speciation. To date, the great majority of studies are of Northern Hemisphere taxa, and reflect the influence of vicariant events during, or prior to, the Pleistocene. Microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA sequences were used to investigate patterns of population divergence and evolutionary relationships in a freshwater group of silverside fishes (Odontesthes perugiae complex), endemic to the recently formed coastal plain of southern Brazil. Lacustrine morphotypes showed concordant patterns of genetic and morphological divergence consistent with the geographical history of the coastal plain. The results support the proposal of a silverside radiation chronologically shaped by the sea-level changes of the Pleistocene and Holocene. The radiating lineage comprises a minimum of three allopatric and two sympatric lacustrine species. Four species displayed extremely high levels of genetic variation and some of the most rapid speciation rates reported in fishes. These features were related to a marine-estuarine origin of the radiation. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first molecular phylogeographic survey of a coastal radiation in South America.

AB The fire history of Norra Kvills National Park in southeastern hemiboreal Sweden was reconstructed for the last 600 years by cross-dating of fire scars in trees, stumps and snags of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). Between 1401 and 1770 forty different fires were recorded; fire frequency at point scale was 20 years, which is 3-4 times more frequent than in northern Sweden. Since 1770, no large fires have been recorded. This has had considerable consequences for the forest structure and fauna in that it has resulted in a shift from a Scots pine-dominated ecosystem to a fire-sensitive Norway spruce (Picea abies) system over large parts of the park. For rare late-successional species associated with Norway spruce (e.g. Fomitopsis rosea. a polyporous fungus and Ceruchus chrysomelinus, a beetle) this has been advantageous, while fire-, light- and thermophilous species like the saproxylic beetle Tragosoma depsarium may be increasingly threatened if the process of spruce invasion and suppression of fires is allowed to continue. We discuss the importance and problems of incorporating fire in management plans of reserves and in forestry practices, with the aim of preserving the large number of species that are directly or indirectly dependent on fire in southern Sweden.

AB 1 Two palaeoecological data sets were used to study forest development in the boreo-nemoral zone of southern Sweden during the last 3000 years. Maps of forest types present in 1250 BC, AD 500 and today were compiled from regional pollen data and these were compared with 16 stand-scale pollen analyses.
   2 The forest type maps showed a transition from mixed deciduous forest to coniferous forest consisting chiefly of Picea and Pinus. The stand-scale studies recorded the same general development despite site-specific trends. A detrended correspondence analysis displayed the successional trends of the stand-scale sites. All stands moved away from the rich deciduous forest represented by Alnus, Corylus, Quercus and Tilia via Betula and Carpinus to Picea and Pinus forest or, in two stands, to Fagus forest.
   3 A rate of change analysis covering the last 3000 years showed that the changes recorded from the last 150 years were the most rapid, but represented the culmination of a transformation that was initiated 850 years earlier. These recent changes completely overshadowed the previous record.
   4 The regional maps recorded relatively high proportions of Pinus in the eastern part of the study area throughout the period under investigation. The stand-scale studies indicated that this area had a high fire frequency, while the relatively recent increase in Pinus in south-west Sweden was better explained by anthropogenic influences. The stand-scale data suggested that the regional role of Pinus had been overestimated in southern Sweden
   5 Corylus, Quercus and Tilia were the major species in the former forests, but began a slow decrease in importance around AD 700. The increasing cereal pollen record was related to the decline of the deciduous forest component, suggesting that anthropogenic activity has been the major driving force in its loss.
   6 The combination of regional- and stand-scale studies has provided new insights into forest pattern and process. The local records capture the essential features of the regional record of vegetation history, record forest composition more faithfully than regional sites, and additionally yield insight into processes such as fires that have a regional significance.

AB In spring 1993 phytoplankton samples were taken along the longitudinal salinity gradient of the estuaries of the Elbe, Schelde and Gironde. A minimum in phytoplankton abundance, biomass and diversity was observed in the inner to upper reaches of all estuaries, suggesting massive mortality in these zones. Due to a combination of high turbidity and high river runoff, phytoplankton of the Gironde estuary differed in species composition and had lower cell abundancies and biomass compared with Elbe and Schelde. Phytoplankton structure and biomass of the polyhaline reaches of the Elbe and Schelde were quite comparable. They were characterized by the diatoms Skeltonema costatum and several Thalassiosira spp. and most probably developed in situ. The presence of tychoplanktonic species in these reaches indicates exchange with the intertidal flats. On the other hand, some marked differences were observed in the upper and tidal freshwater reaches of these two estuaries. In the oligohaline Schelde stations, phytoplankton populations were dominated by the diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana. The diatom Stephanodiscus hantzschii was dominant in the limnetic stations of the Elbe estuary. Despite the unfavourable light climate, the presence of the halophilous. diatom C. meneghiniana in the Schelde estuary might indicate in situ development of phytoplankton populations. This could be attributed to the high residence time and the absence of grazers due to oxygen stress. In the Elbe, river runoff is too high (at least in spring) to permit in situ development of phytoplankton in the upper and freshwater tidal reaches. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB 1 Multivariate analysis of complex data sets is plagued by problems of subjectivity and of finding statistically valid ways to test a large number of plausible hypotheses. We show how patterns in the data can be identified (data diving) as well as rigorously tested statistically by subdividing the data set.
   2 We analysed data on weed biomass and environmental variables from more than 2000 plots in cereal and oil-seed crops in Sweden during 1970-94. Half the data set was used in an exploratory phase while the other half was used in a subsequent confirmatory phase.
   3 The exploratory analyses included multivariate statistics [detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA)] with various options and combinations of variables, and led to the formation of hypotheses that were then tested.
   4 We tested the hypotheses in a sequential analysis with CCA and Monte Carlo permutation tests: after establishing the influence of one set of environmental variables, this set was covaried out in subsequent analyses. In this way the influence of (i) season of sowing of the crop; (ii) geographical region; (iii) soil type; (iv) crop species; and (v) temporal trends was tested. The four latter were tested separately for spring- and autumn-sown crops.
   5 The sowing season of the crop had an overwhelming influence on the weed flora, and many weed species, both annual and perennial, showed strong associations with either autumn or spring. There were significant differences in weed flora composition between the geographical regions and soil types as well as between crop species. There were significant temporal trends only in the weed flora of autumn-sown crops.
   6 This study provides a protocol that combines exploratory 'data diving' with strict hypothesis testing using direct gradient analysis methods such as CCA. Such two-phase analysis should improve the way complex data are analysed and patterns are interpreted.

AB 1. The macroinvertebrate fauna living on stones in the exposed stony littorals of thirty-nine Danish lakes were examined by multivariate numerical methods. The data were derived from 125 semi-quantitative samples and a species list of 126 taxa. The mean number of individuals per sample was 960, and among the most common taxa were Asellus aquaticus, Gammarus, Oulimnius, Tinodes, Cricotopus and Dicrotendipes.
   2. The total number of species and fourteen individual taxa were positively correlated to mean depth of the lakes and eleven taxa were correlated to the total phosphorus concentration. The Shannon diversity was negatively correlated to the chlorophyll a concentration ([Chl a])
   3. Community patterns were examined by detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), and the relationship between species data and selected environmental variables was analysed by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Mean lake depth was found to be the strongest environmental variable in explaining the species data. The [Chl a] and Secchi depth also explained significant variation in the distribution of the stony littoral invertebrates. Wind fetch and relative exposure did not explain any variation in the faunal composition among sites.
   4. The abilities of the macroinvertebrates to predict the lake trophic state, expressed as log ([Chl a]), were explored by means of weighted averaging (WA) regression and calibration. Two tolerance-weighted WA models using inverse and classical regression for deshrinking are presented. The models were assessed by the root mean square error (RMSE) of prediction, using bootstrapping as cross validation, and by the correlation between observed and inferred log ([Chl a]) The model using inverse deshrinking had a RMSEboot = 0.41 and r(2) = 0.63. By using classical regression, the predictability in the ends of the gradient was improved but the RMSE increased: RMSEboot = 0.46.
   5. Although the factors determining faunal distribution patterns in the Danish lowland lakes were highly multivariate and difficult to disentangle, it seems reasonable to use the WA estimated species optima and tolerances to [Chl a] ina bio-assessment model.

AB Previous experimental studies suggest that methane emission from wetlands is influenced by multiple interactive pathways of gas production and transport through soil and sediment layers to the atmosphere. The objective of this study is to evaluate a new simulation model of methane production and emission in wetland soils that was developed initially to help identify key processes that regulate methanogenesis and net flux of CH4 to the air but which is designed ultimately for regional simulation using remotely sensed inputs for land cover characteristics. The foundation for these computer simulations is based on a well-documented model (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach, CASA) of ecosystem production and carbon cycling in the terrestrial biosphere. Modifications to represent flooded wetland soils and anaerobic decomposition include three new submodels for (1) layered soil temperature and water table depth (WTD) as a function of daily climate drivers, (2) CH4 production within the anoxic soil layer as a function of WTD and CO2 production under poorly drained conditions, and (3) CH4 gaseous transport pathways (molecular diffusion, ebullition, and plant vascular transport) as a function of WTD and ecosystem type. The model was applied and tested using climate and ecological data to characterize tundra wetland sites near Fairbanks, Alaska, studied previously by Whaler, and Reeburgh [1992]. Comparison of model predictions to measurements of soil temperature and thaw depth, water table depth, and CH4 emissions over a 2-year period suggest that intersite differences in soil physical conditions and methane fluxes could be reproduced accurately for selected periods. Day-to-day comparison of predicted emissions to measured CH4 flux rates reveals good agreement during the early part of the thaw season, but the model tends to underestimate production of CH4 during the months of July and August in both test years. Important seasonal effects, including that of falling WTD during these periods, are apparently overlooked in the model formulation. Nevertheless, reasonably close agreement was achieved between the model's mean daily and seasonal estimates of CH4 flux and observed emission rates for northern wetland ecosystems. Several features of the model are identified as crucial to more accurate prediction of wetland methane emission, including the capacity to incorporate influences of localized topographic and hydrologic features on site-specific soil temperature and WTD dynamics and mechanistic simulation of methane emission transport pathways from within the soil profile.

AB The diet composition of largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, and pumpkinseed sunfish, Lepomis gibbosus, and its relation to environmental factors was studied in intermittent watercourses of the lower Guadiana basin (southern Iberia) during the particularly dry summer of 1994. Overall, both species took food items similar to those found in their North American and acclimatised ranges, with pumpkinseed consuming invertebrates (chiefly Chironomidae) and bass preying on invertebrates (chiefly Micronecta meridionalis) and fish (chiefly L. gibbosus and Gambusia holbrooki). Both bass and pumpkinseed were opportunistic feeders, feeding on the most frequent and abundant prey. However, Diptera larvae were apparently preferred by pumpkinseed and avoided by bass, while the contrary occurred with respect to Heteroptera. The two main fish prey of bass were eaten on the basis of random encounter. The relative abundance of macro-prey (i.e. fish and Atyephira desmarestii) were the principal environmental variables constraining bass dietary variation along the basin. On the contrary, pumpkinseed diet variation was mainly related to pumpkinseed size and the presence of piscivorous bass nearby, although habitat size and cyprinid abundance were also influential.

AB We model the sequential assembly of species into communities, using a notion of permanence from dynamical-systems theory, to investigate effects of species pools on the development of local communities. The results show that communities built from species-rich pools develop more slowly to invasion-resistant states. Fewer basal species are found locally where species pools are rich in consumers, although specialization by the consumers for different kinds of prey enables more basal species to exist locally. The invasion-resistant states eventually achieved by such an assembly process may be single communities or cyclic sequences of communities uninvadable by species not in the cycle. These endstates of assembly are properties of the species pool, and the form they take depends on the nature of the pool. If made rich enough, species pools cause saturation of local communities such that the number of species present locally becomes uncoupled from the richness of the pool.

AB We used multivariate statistical techniques to analyse the distributions of surface sediment chironomid assemblages with respect to surface-water temperature, and an additional set of 27 environmental variables, in 30 freshwater lakes of northern Fennoscandia. Our study transect spans boreal coniferous forest to subarctic tundra and includes a steep temperature gradient. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with forward selection and associated Monte Carlo permutation tests revealed that there were statistically significant (P<0.05) relationships between chironomid distributions and two environmental variables, namely lakewater temperature and maximum lake depth. A constrained CCA with temperature as the only predictor variable suggested that the relationship between lakewater temperature and chironomid composition was sufficiently robust for developing a weighted-averaging (WA) based quantitative inference model that will allow palaeotemperature reconstructions using subfossil chironomid remains preserved in lake sediments.

AB Reconciling tree harvesting with the maintenance of forest. bird populations is a major concern of integrated management. Because bird nest predation causes > 50% of the nest losses in passerines and is known to vary according to habitat characteristics, we explored some aspects of avian nest predation in relation to forestry practices in a boreal coniferous landscape managed primarily for timber production in Quebec. Using artificial tree and ground nests with Common Quail (Coturnix coturnix) and plasticine eggs, we compared the risk of nest predation (1) in experimental riparian forest strips of different widths (20-m, 40-m, and 60-m unthinned strips; > 300-m control strips; and 20-m thinned strips) and (2) in clearcuts experimentally subjected to different regeneration practices (plantations with chemical and mechanical weeding, and naturally regenerated clearcuts) between 1992 and 1995. The risk of ground nest predation was lower in naturally regenerated clearcuts (5% daily probability of predation) than in control forest strips (27%), We found no evidence that chemical and mechanical weeding affected the risk of nest predation in clearcuts. In forest strips, the predation risk was higher in forest strips 40-60 m wide than in 20-m and central strips. Birds accounted for 13% of predation signs, whereas red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) were the dominant mammalian predators, accounting for 36% of the total predation (it = 201 nests preyed upon), In our region, the low predation rates (30% for 24 real nests) and the absence of generalist foragers such as crows, raccoons, and skunks could be attributed to the near absence of human occupation in comparison to forest-dominated landscapes in Europe and northeastern United States.

AB We used the eddy covariance technique to measure exchanges of water vapor, energy, and CO2 between California serpentine grassland and the atmosphere. Even though the system was built around an inexpensive, one-dimensional sonic anemometer and a closed-path CO2 analyzer, energy balance closure was accurate to +/-20% at a net radiation of 500 W/m(2), and the spectra and cospectra indicated only modest information loss from incompletely resolved high-frequency turbulence.
   In the early and middle parts of the growing season, net radiation, latent heat, and sensible heat all had similar diurnal dynamics, with latent heat accounting for approximate to 60% of the net radiation. Late in the growing season, energy dissipation by latent heat dropped dramatically, even though the vapor pressure gradient remained high.
   The Omega factor, an index of the role of canopy conductance in regulating transpiration (Jarvis and McNaughton 1986), decreased from 0.8 early in the growing season (indicating predominant control of transpiration by net radiation) to 0.1 late in the growing season (indicating a shift to control of transpiration by canopy conductance and vapor pressure deficit). Canopy conductance was a linear function of the product of net photosynthesis and relative humidity, divided by the CO2 concentration, as predicted by Ball (1988). The slope of the relationship, however, was greater early in the growing season than at other times.
   Whole-ecosystem carbon exchange rates were modest, with midday net photosynthesis reaching maximum values of 6-8 mu mol . m(-2). s(-1) in early April. Diurnal variation in photosynthesis roughly paralleled variation in photosynthetically active photon flux density (PFD), but with the daily maximum increasing with canopy development early in the growing season and decreasing with drought at the end of the growing season. Photosynthesis did not clearly saturate at high levels of PFD. Ecosystem dark respiration increased strongly (Q(10) = 4.6) with increasing soil surface temperature.
   The efficiency with which absorbed radiation was used in ecosystem photosynthesis, integrated over entire days, was 0.0115 +/- 0.0015 mol CO2/mol PFD (approximate to 20% of the values measured for healthy, single leaves under low light conditions) until late in the growing season, when the efficiency fell sharply. Using simple assumptions to extrapolate measurements from 11 d to the entire growing season, we estimate ecosystem annual gross primary production to be 11.1 mol CO2/m(2), yielding an annual net primary production of approximate to 133 g biomass/m(2). This is near the center of the range of published values from aboveground harvest studies.

AB In general the pooling of major taxa did not provide a basis for classifying zooplankton communities in 342 large Norwegian lakes, as neither cladocerans nor calanoids varied systematically with lake productivity or fish predation pressure. At the species level, most herbivorous cladocerans and calanoids, which constituted three quarters of the metazoan zooplankton biomass, differed in their preference for lake productivity and fish community and could be distinctly grouped according to these variables by canonical correspondance analysis. The analysis pointed out one oligotrophic and one eutrophic specialist among the herbivorous cladocerans, while two of the calanoids were oligotrophic specialists. The biomasses of cladocerans, calanoids, or daphnids were poorly correlated with both lake productivity and fish predation, whereas shifts in average size and species distribution could be attributed to these variables. At low lake productivity, chemical variables such as pH and Ca, as well as the species' physiological adaptations, appear as the main determinants for the competitive advantage and relative success of herbivorous species. Fish community composition changes with increasing lake productivity, bur only at very high fish predation intensity (cyprinid communities) did the effects of predation become the main determinant of the zooplankton community, superimposed on the lake productivity.

AB The feeding niche of Colostethus stepheni changes during ontogeny. Small individuals eat small arthropods, principally mites and collembolans, and larger frogs eat bigger prey of other types. The shift in prey types is not a passive effect of selection for bigger prey. There is a strong relationship between electivity for prey types and frog size, independent of electivity for prey size. Four indices of general activity during foraging (number of movements, velocity, total area utilized and time spent moving), which are associated with electivity for prey types in adult frogs and lizards, did not predict the ontogenetic change in the diet of C. stepheni. Apparently, the behavioral changes that cause the ontogenetic change in C. stepheni are more subtle than shifts in general activity during foraging. Studies of niche partitioning in communities of anurans that do not take into consideration ontogenetic changes in diet and seasonal changes in the size structures of populations present a partial and possibly erroneous picture of the potential interactions among species.

AB Fluctuations in the abundance of butterflies at many sites in Britain are monitored in a national scheme.  Both annual fluctuations and long term trends at individual sites are often very closely synchronised with regional data which excludes the study sites.  I argue from such synchrony:  (1) that these population are likely to be limited by density-dependent factors and (2) that population fluctuations are little influenced by interactions which are specific to local communities.

AB Knowing phylogenetic relationships among species is fundamental for many studies in biology. An accurate phylogenetic tree underpins our understanding of the major transitions in evolution, such as the emergence of new body plans or metabolism, and is key to inferring the origin of new genes, detecting molecular adaptation, understanding morphological character evolution and reconstructing demographic changes in recently diverged species. Although data are ever more plentiful and powerful analysis methods are available, there remain many challenges to reliable tree building. Here, we discuss the major steps of phylogenetic analysis, including identification of orthologous genes or proteins, multiple sequence alignment, and choice of substitution models and inference methodologies. Understanding the different sources of errors and the strategies to mitigate them is essential for assembling an accurate tree of life.
   Understanding evolutionary relationships between species requires the generation of accurate phylogenetic trees. In this Review, Kapli, Yang and Telford discuss the principles, steps and computational tools for phylogenetic tree building. They describe the impact of burgeoning genomic datasets as well as the diverse sources of errors and how they can be mitigated.

AB Conservation aims to preserve species and ecosystem services. If rare species contribute little to ecosystem services, yet are those most in need of preservation, tradeoffs may exist for these contrasting objectives. However, little attention has focused on identifying how, when, and where rare species contribute to ecosystem services and at what scales. Here, we review distinct ways that ecosystem services can positively depend on the presence, abundance, disproportionate contribution or, counterintuitively, the scarcity of rare species. By contrast, ecosystem services are less likely to depend on rare species that do not have a unique role in any service or become abundant enough to contribute substantially. We propose a research agenda to identify when rare species may contribute significantly to services.

AB Semi-arid grasslands on the Mongolian Plateau are expected to experience high inputs of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen in this century. It remains unclear, however, how soil organisms and nutrient cycling are directly affected by N enrichment (i.e., without mediation by plant input to soil) vs. indirectly affected via changes in plant-related inputs to soils resulting from N enrichment. To test the direct and indirect effects of N enrichment on soil organisms (bacteria, fungi and nematodes) and their associated C and N mineralization, in 2010, we designated two subplots (with plants and without plants) in every plot of a six-level N-enrichment experiment established in 1999 in a semi-arid grassland. In 2014, 4 years after subplots with and without plant were established, N enrichment had substantially altered the soil bacterial, fungal and nematode community structures due to declines in biomass or abundance whether plants had been removed or not. N enrichment also reduced the diversity of these groups (except for fungi) and the soil C mineralization rate and induced a hump-shaped response of soil N mineralization. As expected, plant removal decreased the biomass or abundance of soil organisms and C and N mineralization rates due to declines in soil substrates or food resources. Analyses of plant-removal-induced changes (ratios of without- to with-plant subplots) showed that micro-organisms and C and N mineralization rates were not enhanced as N enrichment increased but that nematodes were enhanced as N enrichment increased, indicating that the effects of plant removal on soil organisms and mineralization depended on trophic level and nutrient status. Surprisingly, there was no statistical interaction between N enrichment and plant removal for most variables, indicating that plant-related inputs did not qualitatively change the effects of N enrichment on soil organisms or mineralization. Structural equation modelling confirmed that changes in soil communities and mineralization rates were more affected by the direct effects of N enrichment (via soil acidification and increased N availability) than by plant-related indirect effects. Our results provide insight into how future changes in N deposition and vegetation may modify below-ground communities and processes in grassland ecosystems.

AB Within the past decades, the karst region in the Guangxi province in southwest China has been in the focus of large scale ecological restoration projects. In this study, we adapt the pressure-state-response (PSR) framework (which includes measures for human pressure, the current state of the ecosystem and the human response) and propose a remote sensing based ecosystem health (ESH) index (0-1; 250 m spatial resolution), evaluating the pressure and state of the fragile karst ecosystem. We further apply inventory data of recovery actions (restoration areas at county level resolution) as response to ongoing degradation to test the impact of ecological restoration on the ESH. Our analysis was conducted for the years 2000, 2010 and 2016, and the results showed that 73% of the study area experienced an increase in the ESH (from 2000 to 2016) which was related to the improvements in vegetation vigor, organization, resilience, ecosystem service provisioning which offset a deterioration in fragmentation and population density. From 2000 to 2016, areas of increase in ESH were slightly larger in karst than in non-karst (37.5% and 35.1%, respectively), but also larger areas of decrease in ESH were observed in karst as compared to non-karst (16% and 11%, respectively). The results further showed that the share of areas with a high ESH (greater than 0.7) had increased by similar to 3% (from 67.16% to 70.21%) during the 17 years period. At county level, we found a clear relationship between increases in ESH and ecological restoration areas (r = 0.58, p = 0.004), with a high recovery rate (ratio between areas with increased ESH and restoration areas in a county) in karst than in non-karst. We conclude that restoration projects have caused a large scale transformation of farmland into forested areas (similar to 5500 km(2)), which has caused a general improvement in ecosystem parameters related to ESH.

AB Identification of the majority of organisms present in human-associated microbial communities is feasible with the advent of high throughput sequencing technology. As substantial variability in microbiota communities is seen across subjects, the use of longitudinal study designs is important to better understand variation of the microbiome within individual subjects. Complex study designs with longitudinal sample collection require analytic approaches to account for this additional source of variability. A common approach to assessing community changes is to evaluate the change in alpha diversity (the variety and abundance of organisms in a community) over time. However, there are several commonly used alpha diversity measures and the use of different measures can result in different estimates of magnitude of change and different inferences. It has recently been proposed that diversity profile curves are useful for clarifying these differences, and may provide a more complete picture of the community structure. However, it is unclear how to utilize these curves when interest is in evaluating changes in community structure over time. We propose the use of a bi-exponential function in a longitudinal model that accounts for repeated measures on each subject to compare diversity profiles over time. Furthermore, it is possible that no change in alpha diversity (single community/sample) may be observed despite the presence of a highly divergent community composition. Thus, it is also important to use a beta diversity measure (similarity between multiple communities/samples) that captures changes in community composition. Ecological methods developed to evaluate temporal turnover have currently only been applied to investigate changes of a single community over time. We illustrate the extension of this approach to multiple communities of interest (i.e., subjects) by modeling the beta diversity measure over time. With this approach, a rate of change in community composition is estimated. There is a need for the extension and development of analytic methods for longitudinal microbiota studies. In this paper, we discuss different approaches to model alpha and beta diversity indices in longitudinal microbiota studies and provide both a review of current approaches and a proposal for new methods.

TI Trends and seasonality of river nutrients in agricultural catchments: 18

AB Agriculture and urbanization have disturbed three-quarters of global ice-free land surface, delivering huge amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus to freshwater ecosystems. These excess nutrients degrade habitat and threaten human food and water security at a global scale. Because most catchments are either currently subjected to, or recovering from anthropogenic nutrient loading, understanding the short- and long-term responses of river nutrients to changes in land use is essential for effective management. We analyzed a never-published, 18-year time series of anthropogenic (NO3- and PO43-) and naturally derived (dissolved silica) riverine nutrients in 13 catchments recovering from agricultural pollution in western France. In a citizen science initiative, high-school students sampled catchments weekly, which ranged from 26 to 1489 km(2). Nutrient concentrations decreased substantially over the period of record (19 to 50% for NO3- and 14 to 80% for PO4-), attributable to regional, national, and international investment and regulation, which started immediately prior to monitoring. For the majority of catchments, water quality during the summer low-flow period improved faster than during winter high-flow conditions, and annual minimum concentrations improved relatively faster than annual maximum concentrations. These patterns suggest that water-quality improvements were primarily due to elimination of discrete nutrient sources with seasonally-constant discharge (e.g. human and livestock wastewater), agreeing with available land-use and municipal records. Surprisingly, long-term nutrient decreases were not accompanied by changes in nutrient seasonality in most catchments, attributable to persistent, diffuse nutrient stocks. Despite decreases, nutrient concentrations in almost all catchments remained well above eutrophication thresholds, and because additional improvements will depend on decreasing diffuse nutrient sources, future gains may be much slower than initial rate of recovery. These findings demonstrate the value of citizen science initiatives in quantifying long-term and seasonal consequences of changes in land management, which are necessary to identify sustainable limits and predict recovery timeframes.

AB The ecological dynamics of cities are influenced not only by geophysical and biological factors, but also by aspects of human society. In cities around the world, a pattern of higher biodiversity in affluent neighbourhoods has been termed 'the luxury effect'. The luxury effect has been found globally regarding plant diversity and canopy or vegetative cover. Fewer studies have considered the luxury effect and animals, yet it has been recognized in the distributions of birds, bats, lizards and indoor arthropods. Higher socioeconomic status correlates with higher biodiversity resulting from many interacting factors-the creation and maintenance of green space on private and public lands, the tendency of both humans and other species to favour environmentally desirable areas, while avoiding environmental burdens, as well as enduring legacy effects. The luxury effect is amplified in arid cities and as neighbourhoods age, and reduced in tropical areas. Where the luxury effect exists, benefits of urban biodiversity are unequally distributed, particularly in low-income neighbourhoods with higher minority populations. The equal distribution of biodiversity in cities, and thus the elimination of the luxury effect, is a worthy societal goal.

AB The long-term impact of river regulation on fish functional diversity by a dam immediately upstream from the upper Parana River floodplain, Brazil, was evaluated. It was expected that the resulting alterations in natural flow, downstream from the dam, would negatively impact fish species, resulting in a functional simplification of the ichthyofauna. In addition, this effect was expected to be more pronounced in the directly affected main channel of the Parana River than in its tributaries, the Baia and Ivinhema rivers. Fish were sampled before (pre) and after (post) dam closure (the intervention). The functional traits used were diet, habitat use, mouth position, migration, parental care, internal fertilisation and maximum total length. Differences in trait composition between periods (pre and post) were tested using a PERMANOVA main-test. An indicator value analysis (IndVal) was applied to identify which traits significantly increased or decreased in abundance after the intervention. The indexes used were functional richness (FRic), Rao's quadratic entropy (FDQ) and functional redundancy (FRed). The intervention analysis based on linear models for time series was used to evaluate differences in these indexes over time. Traits most representative during pre-intervention were large-bodied species with long reproductive migrations, pelagic, with subterminal and superior mouths, and herbivorous. Traits most representative during the post-intervention were omnivorous species, with parental care, benthopelagic and insectivorous, which typically characterise fishes that inhabit stable environments. FRic decreased in Parana and Baia rivers after the construction of the dam. However, the Ivinhema River showed an increase in mean FRic in the post-intervention period. FDQ decreased substantially in all three rivers, while FRed increased. The combined results of FRic, FDQ and FRed corroborate the functional simplification hypothesis expected from flow regulation by dams on functional diversity. As expected, the most pronounced simplification occurred in the Parana River. Therefore, hydroelectric power plants can act as environmental filters strongly selecting functional traits of the downstream fish fauna, generating long-lasting impacts on ecosystem functioning and services.

TI New insights into the covariation of stomatal, mesophyll and hydraulic

AB Optimization models of stomatal conductance (g(s)) attempt to explain observed stomatal behaviour in terms of cost-benefit tradeoffs. While the benefit of stomatal opening through increased CO2 uptake is clear, currently the nature of the associated cost(s) remains unclear. We explored the hypothesis that g(s) maximizes leaf photosynthesis, where the cost of stomatal opening arises from nonstomatal reductions in photosynthesis induced by leaf water stress.
   We analytically solved two cases, CAP and MES, in which reduced leaf water potential leads to reductions in carboxylation capacity (CAP) and mesophyll conductance (g(m)) (MES).
   Both CAP and MES predict the same one-parameter relationship between the intercellular:atmospheric CO2 concentration ratio (c(i)/c(a)) and vapour pressure deficit (VPD, D), viz. c(i)/c(a) approximate to xi/xi (xi+D), as that obtained from previous optimization models, with the novel feature that the parameter xi is determined unambiguously as a function of a small number of photosynthetic and hydraulic variables. These include soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance, implying a stomatal closure response to drought. MES also predicts that g(s)/g(m) is closely related to c(i)/c(a) and is similarly conservative.
   These results are consistent with observations, give rise to new testable predictions, and offer new insights into the covariation of stomatal, mesophyll and hydraulic conductances.

AB The two hemispheres of the human brain differ functionally and structurally. Despite over a century of research, the extent to which brain asymmetry is influenced by sex, handedness, age, and genetic factors is still controversial. Here we present the largest ever analysis of subcortical brain asymmetries, in a harmonized multi-site study using meta-analysis methods. Volumetric asymmetry of seven subcortical structures was assessed in 15,847 MRI scans from 52 dataset worldwide. There were sex differences in the asymmetry of the globus pallidus and putamen. Heritability estimates, derived from 1170 subjects belonging to 71 extended pedigrees, revealed that additive genetic factors influenced the asymmetry of these two structures and that of the hippocampus and thalamus. Handedness had no detectable effect on subcortical asymmetries, even in this unprecedented sample size, but the asymmetry of the putamen varied with age. Genetic drivers of asymmetry in the hippocampus, thalamus and basal ganglia may affect variability in human cognition, including susceptibility to psychiatric disorders.

AB Aim: Woodlands make up a third of European territory and carry out important ecosystem functions, yet a comprehensive overview of their invasion by alien plants has never been undertaken across this continent. Location: Europe.
   Methods: We extracted data from 251,740 vegetation plots stored in the recently compiled European Vegetation Archive. After filtering (resulting in 83,396 plots; 39 regions; 1970-2015 time period), we analysed the species pool and frequency of alien vascular plants with respect to geographic origin and life-forms, and the levels of invasion across the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) woodland habitats.
   Results: We found a total of 386 alien plant species (comprising 7% of all recorded vascular plants). Aliens originating from outside of and from within Europe were almost equally represented in the species pool (192 vs. 181 species) but relative frequency was skewed towards the former group (77% vs. 22%) due, to some extent, to the frequent occurrence of Impatiens parviflora (21% frequency among alien plants). Phanerophytes were the most species-rich life-form (148 species) and had the highest representation in terms of relative frequency (39%) among aliens in the dataset. Apart from Europe (181 species), North America was the most important source of alien plants (109 species). At the local scale, temperate and boreal softwood riparian woodland (5%) and mire and mountain coniferous woodland (<1%) had the highest and lowest mean relative alien species richness (percentage of alien species per plot), respectively.
   Main conclusions: Our results indicate that European woodlands are prone to alien plant invasions especially when exposed to disturbance, fragmentation, alien propagule pressure and high soil nutrient levels. Given the persistence of these factors in the landscape, competitive alien plant species with a broad niche, including alien trees and shrubs, are likely to persist and spread further into European woodlands.

AB Hybridization is widespread in nature and, in some instances, can result in the formation of a new hybrid species. We investigate the genetic foundation of this poorly understood process through whole-genome analysis of the hybrid Italian sparrow and its progenitors. We find overall balanced yet heterogeneous levels of contribution from each parent species throughout the hybrid genome and identify areas of novel divergence in the hybrid species exhibiting signals consistent with balancing selection. High-divergence areas are disproportionately located on the Z chromosome and overrepresented in gene networks relating to key traits separating the focal species, which are likely involved in reproductive barriers and/or species-specific adaptations. Of special interest are genes and functional groups known to affect body patterning, beak morphology, and the immune system, which are important features of diversification and fitness. We show that a combination of mosaic parental inheritance and novel divergence within the hybrid lineage has facilitated the origin and maintenance of an avian hybrid species.

AB Macroecological models for predicting species distributions usually only include abiotic environmental conditions as explanatory variables, despite knowledge from community ecology that all species are linked to other species through biotic interactions. This disconnect is largely due to the different spatial scales considered by the two sub-disciplines: macroecologists study patterns at large extents and coarse resolutions, while community ecologists focus on small extents and fine resolutions. A general framework for including biotic interactions in macroecological models would help bridge this divide, as it would allow for rigorous testing of the role that biotic interactions play in determining species ranges. Here, we present an approach that combines species distribution models with Bayesian networks, which enables the direct and indirect effects of biotic interactions to be modelled as propagating conditional dependencies among species' presences. We show that including biotic interactions in distribution models for species from a California grassland community results in better range predictions across the western USA. This new approach will be important for improving estimates of species distributions and their dynamics under environmental change.

AB Metacommunity patterns and underlying processes in aquatic organisms have typically been studied within a drainage basin. We examined variation in the composition of six freshwater organismal groups across various drainage basins in Finland. We first modelled spatial structures within each drainage basin using Moran eigenvector maps. Second, we partitioned variation in community structure among three groups of predictors using constrained ordination: (1) local environmental variables, (2) spatial variables, and (3) dummy variable drainage basin identity. Third, we examined turnover and nestedness components of multiple-site beta diversity, and tested the best fit patterns of our datasets using the "elements of metacommunity structure" analysis. Our results showed that basin identity and local environmental variables were significant predictors of community structure, whereas within-basin spatial effects were typically negligible. In half of the organismal groups (diatoms, bryophytes, zooplankton), basin identity was a slightly better predictor of community structure than local environmental variables, whereas the opposite was true for the remaining three organismal groups (insects, macrophytes, fish). Both pure basin and local environmental fractions were, however, significant after accounting for the effects of the other predictor variable sets. All organismal groups exhibited high levels of beta diversity, which was mostly attributable to the turnover component. Our results showed consistent Clementsian-type metacommunity structures, suggesting that subgroups of species responded similarly to environmental factors or drainage basin limits. We conclude that aquatic communities across large scales are mostly determined by environmental and basin effects, which leads to high beta diversity and prevalence of Clementsian community types.

AB Global climate change affects marine fish through drivers such as ocean warming, acidification and oxygen depletion, causing changes in marine ecosystems and socioeconomic impacts. While experimental and observational results can inform about anticipated effects of different drivers, linking between these results and ecosystem-level changes requires quantitative integration of physiological and ecological processes into models to advance research and inform management. We give an overview of important physiological and ecological processes affected by environmental drivers. We then provide a review of available modelling approaches for marine fish, analysing their capacities for process-based integration of environmental drivers. Building on this, we propose approaches to advance important research questions. Examples of integration of environmental drivers exist for each model class. Recent extensions of modelling frameworks increase the potential for including detailed mechanisms and improving model projections. Experimental results on energy allocation, behaviour and physiological limitations will advance the understanding of organism-level trade-offs and thresholds in response to multiple drivers. More explicit representation of life cycles and biological traits can improve description of population dynamics and adaptation, and data on food web topology and feeding interactions help to detail the conditions for possible regime shifts. Identification of relevant processes will also benefit the coupling of different models to investigate spatial-temporal changes in stock productivity and integrated responses of social-ecological systems. Thus, a more process-informed foundation for models will promote the integration of experimental and observational results and increase the potential for model-based extrapolations into a future under changing environmental conditions.

AB The magnitude and genetic basis of local adaptation is of fundamental interest in evolutionary biology. However, field experiments usually do not consider early life stages, and therefore may underestimate local adaptation and miss genetically based tradeoffs. We examined the contribution of differences in seedling establishment to adaptive differentiation and the genetic architecture of local adaptation using recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from a cross between two locally adapted populations (Italy and Sweden) of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We planted freshly matured, dormant seeds (> 180 000) representing >200 RILs at the native field sites of the parental genotypes, estimated the strength of selection during different life stages, mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) for fitness and its components, and quantified selection on seed dormancy. We found that selection during the seedling establishment phase contributed strongly to the fitness advantage of the local genotype at both sites. With one exception, local alleles of the eight distinct establishment QTL were favored. The major QTL for establishment and total fitness showed evidence of a fitness tradeoff and was located in the same region as the major seed dormancy QTL and the dormancy gene DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 (DOG1). RIL seed dormancy could explain variation in seedling establishment and fitness across the life cycle. Our results demonstrate that genetically based differences in traits affecting performance during early life stages can contribute strongly to adaptive differentiation and genetic tradeoffs, and should be considered for a full understanding of the ecology and genetics of local adaptation.

AB The beta-null deviation measure, developed as a null model for beta-diversity, is increasingly used in empirical studies to detect the underlying structuring mechanisms in communities (e.g. niche versus neutral and stochastic versus deterministic). Despite growing use, the ecological interpretation of the presence/absence and abundance-based versions of the beta-null diversity measure have not been tested against communities with known assembly mechanisms, and thus have not been validated as an appropriate tool for inferring assembly mechanisms. Using a mechanistic model with known assembly mechanisms, we simulated replicate metacommunities and examined beta-null deviation values 1) across a gradient of niche (species-sorting) to neutrally structured metacommunities, 2) through time, and 3) we compared the effect of changes in assembly mechanism on the performance of the beta-null deviation measures. The impact of stochasticity on assembly outcomes was also considered. beta-null deviation measures proved to be interpretable as a measure of niche or neutral assembly. However, the presence/absence version of the beta-null deviation measure could not differentiate between niche and neutral metacommunities if demographic stochasticity were present. The abundance-based beta-null deviation measure was successful in distinguishing between niche and neutral metacommunities and was robust to the presence of stochasticity, changes through time, and changing assembly mechanisms. However, we suggest that it is not robust to changing abundance evenness distributions or sampling of communities, and so its interpretation still requires some care. We encourage the testing of the assumptions behind null models for ecology and care in their application.

AB The colonization pattern of intestinal microbiota during childhood may impact health later in life, but children older than 1 year are poorly studied. We followed healthy children aged 1-4 years (n=28) for up to 12 months, during which a synbiotic intervention and occasional antibiotics intake occurred, and compared them with adults from the same region. Microbiota was quantified with the HITChip phylogenetic microarray and analyzed with linear mixed effects model and other statistical approaches. Synbiotic administration increased the stability of Actinobacteria and antibiotics decreased Clostridium cluster XIVa abundance. Bacterial diversity did not increase in 1- to 5-year-old children and remained significantly lower than in adults. Actinobacteria, Bacilli and Clostridium cluster IV retained child-like abundances, whereas some other groups were converting to adult-like profiles. Microbiota stability increased, with Bacteroidetes being the main contributor. The common core of microbiota in children increased with age from 18 to 25 highly abundant genus-level taxa, including several butyrate-producing organisms, and developed toward an adult-like composition. In conclusion, intestinal microbiota is not established before 5 years of age and diversity, core microbiota and different taxa are still developing toward adult-type configuration. Discordant development patterns of bacterial phyla may reflect physiological development steps in children.

AB The contribution of low-abundance microbial species to soil ecosystems is easily overlooked because there is considerable overlap between metabolic abilities (functional redundancy) of dominant and subordinate microbial species. Here we studied how loss of less abundant soil bacteria affected the production of antifungal volatiles, an important factor in the natural control of soil-borne pathogenic fungi. We provide novel empirical evidence that the loss of soil bacterial species leads to a decline in the production of volatiles that suppress root pathogens. By using dilution-to-extinction for seven different soils we created bacterial communities with a decreasing number of species and grew them under carbon-limited conditions. Communities with high bacterial species richness produced volatiles that strongly reduced the hyphal growth of the pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. For most soil origins loss of bacterial species resulted in loss of antifungal volatile production. Analysis of the volatiles revealed that several known antifungal compounds were only produced in the more diverse bacterial communities. Our results suggest that less abundant bacterial species play an important role in antifungal volatile production by soil bacterial communities and, consequently, in the natural suppression of soil-borne pathogens.

AB Hydraulic systems of plants have evolved in the context of carbon allocation and fitness trade-offs of maximizing carbon gain and water transport in the face of short and long-term fluctuations in environmental conditions. The resulting diversity of traits include a continuum of isohydry-anisohydry or high to low relative stomatal closure during drought, shedding of canopy foliage or disconnecting roots from soil to survive drought, and adjusting root areas to efficiently manage canopy water costs associated with photosynthesis. These traits are examined within TREES, an integrated model that explicitly couples photosynthesis and carbon allocation to soil-plant hydraulics and canopy processes. Key advances of the model are its ability to account for differences in soil and xylem cavitation, transience of hydraulic impairment associated with delayed or no refilling of xylem, and carbon allocation to plant structures based on photosynthetic uptake of carbon and hydraulic limitations to water transport. The model was used to examine hydraulic traits of cooccurring isohydric (pinon pine) and anisohydric (one-seed juniper) trees from a field-based experimental drought. Model predictions of both transpiration and leaf water potential were improved when there was no refilling of xylem over simulations where xylem was able refill in response to soil water recharge. Model experiments with alternative root-to-leaf area ratios (R-R/L) showed the R-R/L that supports maximum cumulative water use is not beneficial for supporting maximum carbon gain during extended drought, illustrating how a process model reveals trade-offs in plant traits.

AB Functional trait-based approaches have seen rapid development in community ecology and biogeography in recent years, as they promise to offer a better mechanistic and predictive understanding of community structure. However, several key challenges remain. First, while many studies have explored connections between functional traits and abiotic gradients, far fewer have directly tested the common assumption that functional trait differences influence interspecific interactions. Second, empirical studies often ignore intraspecific trait variation within communities, even though intraspecific variation has been known to have substantial impacts on community dynamics. Here we present an experiment designed to assess the role of functional trait differences in predicting the outcome of interspecific species interactions among a suite of California vernal pool annual plants. Eight species were grown in pairwise combinations in two levels of inundation in a greenhouse and functional traits were measured on all individuals. Nested models predicting focal plant performance were fit to the data. For seven of the eight species in the experiment, the best model included a functional trait difference term that was consistent with a competitive hierarchy, indicating that focal species tended to do better when they had larger leaf size, lower specific leaf area, and greater investment in lateral canopy spread than their neighbors. Models that included individually measured trait values generally performed better than models using species trait averages. We tested if the same trait measurements predicted tolerance of inundation (a feature of vernal pool habitats), and species depth distributions from extensive field surveys, though we did not find strong relationships. Our results suggest that functional traits can be used to make inferences about the outcome of interspecific interactions, and that greater predictive power can come from considering intraspecific variation in functional traits, particularly in low diversity communities.

AB Molecular gut-content analysis enables detection of arthropod predation with minimal disruption of ecosystem processes. Most assays produce only qualitative results, with each predator testing either positive or negative for target prey remains. Nevertheless, they have yielded important insights into community processes. For example, they have confirmed the long-hypothesized role of generalist predators in retarding early-season build-up of pest populations prior to the arrival of more specialized predators and parasitoids and documented the ubiquity of secondary and intraguild predation. However, raw qualitative gut-content data cannot be used to assess the relative impact of different predator taxa on prey population dynamics: they must first be weighted by the relative detectability periods for molecular prey remains for each predator-prey combination. If this is not carried out, interpretations of predator impact will be biased towards those with the longest detectabilities. We review the challenges in determining detectability half-lives, including unstated assumptions that have often been ignored in the performance of feeding trials. We also show how detectability half-lives can be used to properly weight assay data to rank predators by their importance in prey population suppression, and how sets of half-lives can be used to test hypotheses concerning predator ecology and physiology. We use data from 32 publications, comprising 97 half-lives, to generate and test hypotheses on taxonomic differences in detectability half-lives and discuss the possible role of the detectability half-life in interpreting qPCR and next-generation sequencing data.

AB In the past few decades, many investigations in the field of plant biology have employed selectively neutral, multilocus, dominant markers such as inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR), random-amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) to address hypotheses at lower taxonomic levels. More recently, sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers have been developed, which are used to amplify coding regions of DNA with primers targeting open reading frames. These markers have proven to be robust and highly variable, on par with AFLP, and are attained through a significantly less technically demanding process. SRAP markers have been used primarily for agronomic and horticultural purposes, developing quantitative trait loci in advanced hybrids and assessing genetic diversity of large germplasm collections. Here, we suggest that SRAP markers should be employed for research addressing hypotheses in plant systematics, biogeography, conservation, ecology, and beyond. We provide an overview of the SRAP literature to date, review descriptive statistics of SRAP markers in a subset of 171 publications, and present relevant case studies to demonstrate the applicability of SRAP markers to the diverse field of plant biology. Results of these selected works indicate that SRAP markers have the potential to enhance the current suite of molecular tools in a diversity of fields by providing an easy-to-use, highly variable marker with inherent biological significance.

TI The Lion in West Africa Is Critically Endangered

AB The African lion has declined to,35,000 individuals occupying 25% of its historic range. The situation is most critical for the geographically isolated populations in West Africa, where the species is considered regionally endangered. Elevating their conservation significance, recent molecular studies establish the genetic distinctiveness of West and Central African lions from other extant African populations. Interventions to save West African lions are urgently required. However formulating effective conservation strategies has been hampered by a lack of data on the species' current distribution, status, and potential management deficiencies of protected areas (PAs) harboring lions. Our study synthesized available expert opinion and field data to close this knowledge gap, and formulate recommendations for the conservation of West African lions. We undertook lion surveys in 13 large (>500 km(2)) PAs and compiled evidence of lion presence/absence for a further eight PAs. All PAs were situated within Lion Conservation Units, geographical units designated as priority lion areas by wildlife experts at a regional lion conservation workshop in 2005. Lions were confirmed in only 4 PAs, and our results suggest that only 406 (273-605) lions remain in West Africa, representing <250 mature individuals. Confirmed lion range is estimated at 49,000 km(2), or 1.1% of historical range in West Africa. PAs retaining lions were larger than PAs without lions and had significantly higher management budgets. We encourage revision of lion taxonomy, to recognize the genetic distinctiveness of West African lions and highlight their potentially unique conservation value. Further, we call for listing of the lion as critically endangered in West Africa, under criterion C2a(ii) for populations with <250 mature individuals. Finally, considering the relative poverty of lion range states in West Africa, we call for urgent mobilization of investment from the international community to assist range states to increase management effectiveness of PAs retaining lions.

AB The Cedars, in coastal northern California, is an active site of peridotite serpentinization. The spring waters that emerge from this system feature very high pH, low redox potential, and low ionic concentrations, making it an exceptionally challenging environment for life. We report a multiyear, culture-independent geomicrobiological study of three springs at The Cedars that differ with respect to the nature of the groundwater feeding them. Within each spring, both geochemical properties and microbial diversity in all three domains of life remained stable over a 3-y period, with multiple samples each year. Between the three springs, however, the microbial communities showed considerable differences that were strongly correlated with the source of the serpentinizing groundwater. In the spring fed solely by deep groundwater, phylum Chloroflexi, class Clostridia, and candidate division OD1 were the major taxa with one phylotype in Euryarchaeota. Less-abundant phylotypes include several minor members from other candidate divisions and one phylotype that was an outlier of candidate division OP3. In the springs fed by the mixture of deep and shallow groundwater, organisms close to the Hydrogenophaga within Betaproteobacteria dominated and coexisted with the deep groundwater community members. The shallow groundwater community thus appears to be similar to those described in other terrestrial serpentinizing sites, whereas the deep community is distinctly different from any other previously described terrestrial serpentinizing community. These unique communities have the potential to yield important insights into the development and survival of life in these early-earth analog environments.

AB Questions Is trait convergence more intense when soil resource availability and disturbance constrain productivity and limit above-ground competition? Do the effects of productivity and disturbance on functional diversity differ between the local and metacommunity scales?
   Location Semi-arid grasslands in New Zealand (43 degrees 59S, 170 degrees 27E).
   Methods We measured trait convergence and divergence in grasslands along gradients of primary productivity and disturbance at local (i.e. 1mx1m) and metacommunity (8mx50m) scales, using long-term (27-yr) manipulations of soil resource availability and grazing intensity. We compared trait dispersion metrics to those expected under different null models.
   Results At the metacommunity scale, we found stronger trait convergence with increasing productivity and grazing intensity, where all short, slow-growing species were excluded from the potential species pool. However, once this broad-scale filter on species pool was taken into account, we found that at the local scale, abundance-weighted functional dispersion of co-occurring species was stronger than expected under our null model, thereby suggesting limiting similarity. Moreover, trait divergence became stronger at higher productivity and lower grazing intensity, where size-asymmetric competition for light is likely to have been more intense.
   Conclusions At the metacommunity scale, environmental filtering led to species with particular traits being excluded from the species pool. In contrast, at the local community scale where individuals interact, there was evidence of limiting similarity. Our results suggest that environmental filtering and limiting similarity are not mutually exclusive and jointly determine community structure, but can operate at different spatial scales.

   FRAMEWORK
AB Trait-based approaches are increasingly used to obtain an insight into the functional aspects of plant communities. Since measuring traits can be time-consuming, large international databases of plant traits are being compiled to share the effort. From these databases, average trait values are often extracted per species by averaging trait values of individuals over multiple populations and habitats. However, the accuracy of such aggregated information from regional databases as a surrogate for on-site measurements has seldom been tested. For the local species pool (aggregated at the habitat-level) and the plant communities on the plots (aggregated at the community-level), we quantified how accurately trait values for each species measured at the plot (plot scale) and those averaged per species and site (site scale) can be estimated from those retrieved from a North-west-European trait database. We analysed three widely used plant traits, canopy height (CH), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA), of species occurring in a wet meadow and a salt marsh. Database values more accurately predicted traits aggregated at the habitat-level than those aggregated at the community-level. In addition, traits with lower plasticity, such as LDMC, were more accurately predicted by database values. The performance of database values also depended upon the habitat studied, for example, habitat-level SLA values were accurately predicted by database values in the wet meadow but inaccurately predicted in the salt marsh. Synthesis. This study reveals that the accuracy of traits retrieved from a database depends on the level of aggregation (lower at community-level), the trait (lower in plastic traits) and the habitat type (lower in extreme habitats). For studies focussing on processes mainly acting at the site scale (e.g. traitenvironment relationships), traits retrieved from a regional database and filtered according to habitat will probably lead to good results. Whereas studying processes acting at the plot scale (e.g. niche partitioning), requires the additional effort of measuring traits on-site.

AB Over the past two decades, microsatellite genotypes have provided the data for landmark studies of human population-genetic variation. However, the various microsatellite data sets have been prepared with different procedures and sets of markers, so that it has been difficult to synthesize available data for a comprehensive analysis. Here, we combine eight human population-genetic data sets at the 645 microsatellite loci they share in common, accounting for procedural differences in the production of the different data sets, to assemble a single data set containing 5795 individuals from 267 worldwide populations. We perform a systematic analysis of genetic relatedness, detecting 240 intra-population and 92 inter-population pairs of previously unidentified close relatives and proposing standardized subsets of unrelated individuals for use in future studies. We then augment the human data with a data set of 84 chimpanzees at the 246 loci they share in common with the human samples. Multidimensional scaling and neighbor-joining analyses of these data sets offer new insights into the structure of human populations and enable a comparison of genetic variation patterns in chimpanzees with those in humans. Our combined data sets are the largest of their kind reported to date and provide a resource for use in human population-genetic studies.

AB Urban land development substantially alters the terrestrial carbon cycle, particularly the net primary productivity (NPP), from local to global scales. However, limited attempts have been undertaken to elucidate the differences in NPP between pre- and post-urban land development in China. In this paper, the terrestrial NPP after urbanization in China was assessed by using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA), toward which a calibration was conducted for adapting this model on the fine-scale application. In addition, a method of neighborhood proxy was applied to acquire the NPP in the absence of urban land development, assuming that non-urban lands can represent their nearby urban lands before they were transformed. Our analyses indicate that urban land development had overall negative effects on terrestrial NPP. They reduced the NPP at an accelerating rate of 0.31 x 10(-3) Pg C year(-1), approximately 5.88% of the annual reduction during the period of 2000-2006 in China. Furthermore, these effects of NPP variations exhibited obvious differences in the amounts and spatial distributions. However, the NPP showed a slight increase around some regions that experienced rapid urbanization, as well as the arid regions in northwest China. These were probably caused by the effects of Urban Heat Island (UHI) and Urban Rain Island (URI), an introduction of faster growing exotics, various resource augmentations and so on.

AB Climate change and invasive species are two major biodiversity threats expected to provoke extinctions of many species in the future. This study evaluates the joint threat posed by climate change and two invasive species: the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and the signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus), on the distribution of two endangered freshwater species: the depressed river mussel (Pseudanodonta complanata) and the white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes), at the scale of Europe. We expected the native species to experience a gradual contraction over time in their geographic range size, while the invasive species would maintain or increase their spread; therefore, their overlap would increase, further threatening the conservation of the native species. To test these three hypotheses, ensemble species distribution models (SDMs) were calibrated with current distributions and projected onto present and 2050 future climatic scenarios. In agreement with our expectations, the 2050 scenarios suggested D. polymorpha may strongly benefit from climate changes (increase of 15-20% in range size), while the depressed river mussel would experience a considerable loss (14-36%), the overlap between both mussels increasing up to 24%. Although both crayfishes were predicted to be negatively affected by climate changes, the contraction was more severe for the invasive P. leniusculus (up to 32% decrease in range size). Moreover, the overlap between both crayfishes decreased by 13-16%, which may reduce the pressure upon the native A. pallipes. This study illustrates how SDMs can assist in management of endangered species over large spatial and temporal scales by identifying current and future areas of shared bioclimatic suitability and potential refugia.

AB Tropical forest ecosystems are threatened by habitat conversion and other anthropogenic actions. Timber production forests can augment the conservation value of primary forest reserves, but studies of logging effects often yield contradictory findings and thus inhibit efforts to develop clear conservation strategies. We hypothesized that much of this variability reflects a common methodological flaw, simple pseudoreplication, that confounds logging effects with preexisting spatial variation. We reviewed recent studies of the effects of logging on biodiversity in tropical forests (n = 77) and found that 68% were definitively pseudoreplicated while only 7% were definitively free of pseudoreplication. The remaining proportion could not be clearly categorized. In addition, we collected compositional data on 7 taxa in 24 primary forest research plots and systematically analyzed subsets of these plots to calculate the probability that a pseudoreplicated comparison would incorrectly identify a treatment effect. Rates of false inference (i.e., the spurious detection of a treatment effect) were >0.5 for 2 taxa, 0.30.5 for 2 taxa, and <0.3 for 3 taxa. Our findings demonstrate that tropical conservation strategies are being informed by a body of literature that is rife with unwarranted inferences. Addressing pseudoreplication is essential for accurately assessing biodiversity in logged forests, identifying the relative merits of specific management practices and landscape configurations, and effectively balancing conservation with timber production in tropical forests.

AB The literature on speciation has expanded dramatically in recent years, catalyzed by the emergence of new conceptual frameworks, new theoretical approaches, and new methods for characterizing pattern and inferring process. As a consequence, the language used to describe the speciation process has become more complex. Increasing complexity may be an accurate reflection of current thinking with respect to how phenotypic differences limit gene flow, how selection results in the evolution of reproductive isolation, and genetic changes that contribute to speciation. However, increased language complexity has come at a cost; old definitions have been reconfigured and new terms have been introduced. In some instances, the introduction of new terminology has failed to recognize historical usage, leading to unnecessary ambiguity and redundancy. Although the writings of Mayr and Dobzhansky remain a reference point in the language of speciation, the last decades of the 20th century saw substantial changes in our thinking about the speciation process. During that period, the language of speciation remained relatively stable. In contrast, the first decade of the 21st century has witnessed a remarkable expansion of the language of speciation. Here, the origin and evolution of ideas about speciation are viewed through the lens of changing language use.

AB Engineering higher photosynthetic efficiency for greater crop yields has gained significant attention among plant biologists and breeders. To achieve this goal, manipulation of metabolic targets and canopy architectural features has been heavily emphasized. Given the substantial variations in leaf anatomical features among and within plant species, there is large potential to engineer leaf anatomy for improved photosynthetic efficiency. Here we review how different leaf anatomical features influence internal light distribution, delivery of CO2 to Rubisco and water relations, and accordingly recommend features to engineer for increased leaf photosynthesis under different environments. More research is needed on (a) elucidating the genetic mechanisms controlling leaf anatomy, and (b) the development of a three dimensional biochemical and biophysical model of leaf photosynthesis, which can help pinpoint anatomical features required to gain a higher photosynthesis.

AB Migrants' responses to varying meteorological and magnetic conditions and their consequent costs in terms of energy and time are crucial for the understanding of the spatial principles guiding migration. Until now, studies of birds' phenotypic responses to environmental conditions and estimated costs of migration in terms of energy and time have focused on single sites and have rarely followed individuals along entire migration routes. We used individual-based light level geolocators to track birds' daily phenotypic responses to the environmental conditions experienced along a 30 000 km migration between Alaska and Africa. In autumn, departures of northern wheatears, Oenanthe oenanthe, were highly dependent on low temperatures and light winds but there was no such apparent dependence in spring. Migration was 1.4-times faster in spring than in autumn. There was an unexpected shift in the ratio of migration: stopover time towards less stopover time in spring, reducing spring's total energy costs for migration with respect to distance covered by nearly 50% in comparison to autumn. Despite strong changes in declination during migration, offering near-experimental conditions, birds did not navigate exclusively along any major compass course. In contrast to expectations, these high-Arctic migrants did not follow great circle routes; their hypothetical energetic benefit (ca. 20% for flying) might be insufficient and conditions for orientation too unfavourable to favour its evolution.

AB 1. Considerable debate surrounds the extent to which tropical forests can be managed for resource extraction while conserving biodiversity and ecosystem properties, which depend on functional composition. Here we evaluate the compatibility of these aims by examining the effects of logging on taxonomic and functional diversity and composition in a tropical forest. 2. Twenty years after selective logging, we inventoried 4140 stems regenerating in logging gaps and adjacent undisturbed areas, and we integrated a database of 13 functional traits describing leaf and wood economics of tropical trees. 3. We found no differences in taxonomic and functional richness among habitats, but logging gaps had significantly higher taxonomic and functional evenness. 4. Logging also effected striking, long-term changes in both species and functional composition. In particular, the xylem density of recruits in logging gaps was 6% less than in unlogged forests, leaves were 11% less tough and had 613% greater mineral nutrient concentrations. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that managers of tropical forests should limit overall surface area converted to logging gaps by creating fewer, larger gaps during selective logging, to reduce impacts on the taxonomic and functional composition of the regenerating stand.

AB Temporal partitioning of activity among sympatric species can be an important mechanism for species coexistence. Further, if exotic and native species overlap temporally, there is potential for direct competition and antagonism, which may lead to native species extirpation. We 1st assessed if ecologically similar native carnivores of Madagascar demonstrated activity pattern overlap and then explored whether overlap in activity might lead to negative impacts of exotic carnivores on native carnivores. We used photographic sampling to quantify the temporal activity patterns of carnivores at 4 study sites. The activity of the 2 smaller-bodied native species, Galidia elegans and Galidictis fasciata, overlapped minimally; these 2 carnivores share a similar generalist diet, which may drive their divergent temporal activity. In contrast, the medium-sized native species, Fossa fossana and Eupleres goudotii, were both highly nocturnal; these 2 species appear segregated in their diets. The largest native carnivore, Cryptoprocta ferox, selectively used crepuscular hours, but overall was cathemeral; it was notably absent or basically so at sites where dogs were most abundant and active throughout the did l cycle. We found G. elegans to shift from preferred activity periods in the presence of dogs and the exotic Viverricula indica. Our results suggest that the presence and activity of exotic carnivores can negatively impact native carnivores in fragmented rain forests.

AB A central goal in ecology is to grasp the mechanisms that underlie and maintain biodiversity and patterns in its spatial distribution can provide clues about those mechanisms. Here, we investigated what might determine the bacterioplankton richness (BR) in lakes by means of 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. We further provide a BR estimate based upon a sampling depth and accuracy, which, to our knowledge, are unsurpassed for freshwater bacterioplankton communities. Our examination of 22 669 sequences per lake showed that freshwater BR in fourteen nutrient-poor lakes was positively influenced by nutrient availability. Our study is, thus, consistent with the finding that the supply of available nutrients is a major driver of species richness; a pattern that may well be universally valid to the world of both micro-and macro-organisms. We, furthermore, observed that BR increased with elevated landscape position, most likely as a consequence of differences in nutrient availability. Finally, BR decreased with increasing lake and catchment area that is negative species-area relationships (SARs) were recorded; a finding that re-opens the debate about whether positive SARs can indeed be found in the microbial world and whether positive SARs can in fact be pronounced as one of the few 'laws' in ecology.

AB Intraguild predation (IGP) occurs when one predator species attacks another predator species with which it competes for a shared prey species. Despite the apparent omnipresence of intraguild interactions in natural and managed ecosystems, very few studies have quantified rates of IGP in various taxa under field conditions. We used molecular analyses of gut contents to assess the nature and incidence of IGP among four species of coccinellid predators in soybean fields. Over half of the 368 predator individuals collected in soybean contained the DNA of other coccinellid species indicating that IGP was very common at our field site. Furthermore, 13.2% of the sampled individuals contained two and even three other coccinellid species in their gut. The interaction was reciprocal, as each of the four coccinellid species has the capacity to feed on the others. To our knowledge, this study represents the most convincing field evidence of a high prevalence of IGP among predatory arthropods. The finding has important implications for conservation biology and biological control.

AB Recent studies in the Northern Hemisphere have shown that songbirds living in noisy urban environments sing at higher frequencies than their rural counterparts. However, several aspects of this phenomenon remain poorly understood. These include the geographical scale over which such patterns occur (most studies have compared local populations), and whether they involve phenotypic plasticity or microevolutionary change. We conducted a field study of silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) vocalizations over more than 1 million km 2 of urban and rural south-eastern Australia, and compared possible effects of urban noise on songs (which are learned) and contact calls (which are innate). Across 14 paired urban and rural populations, silvereyes consistently sang both songs and contact calls at higher frequencies in urban environments. Syllable rate (syllables per second) decreased in urban environments, consistent with the hypothesis that reflective structures degrade song and encourage longer intervals between syllables. This comprehensive study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate varied adaptations of urban bird vocalizations over a vast geographical area, and to provide insight into the mechanism responsible for these changes.

   The term relict refers to a formerly widespread species currently occurring in refugia that provide a persistent combination of specific ecological conditions. In peatlands, direct palaeoecological evidence of relict status exists for some plant species and, in the case of calcareous sediments, for some snail species. We tested whether some species are significantly linked to old calcareous fens at the millennial scale independent of the effect of recent fen area. We focused on three organism groups - vascular plants, bryophytes and land snails - that differ in the degree of preservation of their remains in calcareous fen sediments and in their dispersal ability.
   Location
   Western Carpathians (Slovakia and the Czech Republic).
   Methods
   The sample sites comprised 47 well-preserved calcareous fens, from which we compiled complete recent species lists, measured the area and analysed radiocarbon-dated samples from the deepest sediment and from the beginning of complete deforestation, as indicated by plant and snail fossils. Using the species co-occurrences in large data sets, we identified calcareous fen specialists and compared their recent distribution patterns against a null model that controlled for the effect of fen area.
   Results
   Two land snail species, eleven vascular plant species and no bryophyte species have statistically significant affinities with old fens, independent of the effect of recent fen area. For one bryophyte and one snail, the effects of age and area are not distinguishable.
   Main conclusions
   The results for land snails, being abundantly preserved and easily determinable in calcareous fen deposits, are in full accordance with the direct macrofossil evidence. This suggests that our approach indirectly revealed a relict distribution of the species. Identification of species that are significantly linked to ancient localities at the millennial scale has great potential in palaeoecology for the detection of stands with old sediments, and in nature conservation as a tool for the identification of long-term-persisting rare species that infrequently colonize young sites and thus deserve priority in the protection of their habitats. From a theoretical perspective, limited dispersal from old to new localities of the same habitat can contribute to spatial effects in biotic assemblages, even at relatively fine scales.

AB Aim
   Robust and reliable predictions of the effects of climate change on biodiversity are required in formulating conservation and management strategies that best retain biodiversity into the future. Significant challenges in modelling climate change impacts arise from limitations in our current knowledge of biodiversity. Community-level modelling can complement species-level approaches in overcoming these limitations and predicting climate change impacts on biodiversity as a whole. However, the community-level approaches applied to date have been largely correlative, ignoring the key processes that influence change in biodiversity over space and time. Here, we suggest that the development of new 'semi-mechanistic' community-level models would substantially increase our capacity to predict climate change impacts on biodiversity.
   Location
   Global.
   Methods
   Drawing on an expansive review of biodiversity modelling approaches and recent advances in semi-mechanistic modelling at the species level, we outline the main elements of a new semi-mechanistic community-level modelling approach.
   Results
   Our quantitative review revealed a sharp divide between mechanistic and non-mechanistic biodiversity modelling approaches, with very few semi-mechanistic models developed to date.
   Main conclusions
   We suggest that the conceptual framework presented here for combining mechanistic and non-mechanistic community-level approaches offers a promising means of incorporating key processes into predictions of climate change impacts on biodiversity whilst working within the limits of our current knowledge.

AB Plant communities vary dramatically in the number and relative abundance of species that exhibit facilitative interactions, which contributes substantially to variation in community structure and dynamics. Predicting species' responses to neighbors based on readily measurable functional traits would provide important insight into the factors that structure plant communities. We measured a suite of functional traits on seedlings of 20 species and mature plants of 54 species of shrubs from three arid biogeographic regions. We hypothesized that species with different regeneration niches-those that require nurse plants for establishment (beneficiaries) versus those that do not (colonizers)-are functionally different. Indeed, seedlings of beneficiary species had lower relative growth rates, larger seeds and final biomass, allocated biomass toward roots and height at a cost to leaf mass fraction, and constructed costly, dense leaf and root tissues relative to colonizers. Likewise at maturity, beneficiaries had larger overall size and denser leaves coupled with greater water use efficiency than colonizers. In contrast to current hypotheses that suggest beneficiaries are less "stress-tolerant" than colonizers, beneficiaries exhibited conservative functional strategies suited to persistently dry, low light conditions beneath canopies, whereas colonizers exhibited opportunistic strategies that may be advantageous in fluctuating, open microenvironments. In addition, the signature of the regeneration niche at maturity indicates that facilitation expands the range of functional diversity within plant communities at all ontogenetic stages. This study demonstrates the utility of specific functional traits for predicting species' regeneration niches in hot deserts, and provides a framework for studying facilitation in other severe environments.

AB Spiders represent a diverse, widespread and abundant group of carnivores. Studying the nutritional ecology of spiders is critical because it can aid in understanding the evolution of prey capture and life history strategies, factors regulating the abundance and diversity of spiders in particular habitats and the role of spiders in arthropod community dynamics including biological control of crop pests. The feeding habits of spiders have long attracted the attention of biologists, in part, because many build webs and are relatively easy to observe. While these studies have provided a wealth of information on the abundance and types of prey captured, they have yielded relatively little information on the types and quantities of nutrients ingested by spiders in nature. Relatively little is also known about the nutritional requirements of spiders, although recent studies using more controlled manipulations of prey nutrient content are beginning to provide a clearer understanding of the types and quantities of nutrients needed by spiders to maximize performance. There is a tremendous opportunity to rapidly advance our understanding of spider nutrition, given a strong foundation in the natural history, behaviour, physiology and ecology of spiders and recent advances in analytical techniques and frameworks for studying nutrition. Studies focusing on the connections between spider nutritional physiology and how this is affected by and affects prey communities may produce particularly exciting results.

AB To become invasive, exotic species have to succeed in the consecutive phases of introduction, naturalization, and invasion. Each of these phases leaves traces in genetic structure, which may affect the species' success in subsequent phases. We examined this interplay of genetic structure and invasion dynamics in the South African Ragwort (Senecio inaequidens), one of Europe's fastest plant invaders. We used AFLP and microsatellite markers to analyze 19 native African and 32 invasive European populations. In combination with historic data, we distinguished invasion routes and traced them back to the native source areas. This revealed that different introduction sites had markedly different success in the three invasion phases. Notably, an observed lag-phase in Northern Germany was evidently not terminated by factors increasing the invasiveness of the resident population but by invasive spread from another introduction centre. The lineage invading Central Europe was introduced to sites in which winters are more benign than in the native source region. Subsequently, this lineage spread into areas in which winter temperatures match the native climate more closely. Genetic diversity clearly increases with population age in Europe and less clearly decreases with spread rate up to population establishment. This indicates that gene flow along well-connected invasion routes counteracted losses of genetic diversity during rapid spread. In summary, this study suggests that multiple introductions, environmental preadaptation and high gene flow along invasion routes contributed to the success of this rapid invader. More generally, it demonstrates the benefit of combining genetic, historical, and climatic data for understanding biological invasions.

AB Current shifts in ecosystem composition and function emphasize the need for an understanding of the links between environmental factors and organism fitness and tolerance. The examples discussed here illustrate how recent progress in the field of comparative physiology may provide a better mechanistic understanding of the ecological concepts of the fundamental and realized niches and thus provide insights into the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance. Here we argue that, as a link between physiological and ecological indicators of organismal performance, the mechanisms shaping aerobic scope and passive tolerance set the dimensions of an animal's niche, here defined as its capacity to survive, grow, behave, and interact with other species. We demonstrate how comparative studies of cod or killifish populations in a latitudinal cline have unraveled mitochondrial mechanisms involved in establishing a species' niche, performance, and energy budget. Riverine fish exemplify how the performance windows of various developmental stages follow the dynamic regimes of both seasonal temperatures and river hydrodynamics, as synergistic challenges. Finally, studies of species in extreme environments, such as the tilapia of Lake Magadi, illustrate how on evolutionary timescales functional and morphological shifts can occur, associated with new specializations. We conclude that research on the processes and time course of adaptations suitable to overcome current niche limits is urgently needed to assess the resilience of species and ecosystems to human impact, including the challenges of global climate change.

AB For an increasing number of applications, mesoscale modelling systems now aim to better represent urban areas. The complexity of processes resolved by urban parametrization schemes varies with the application. The concept of fitness-for-purpose is therefore critical for both the choice of parametrizations and the way in which the scheme should be evaluated. A systematic and objective model response analysis procedure (Multiobjective Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis (MOSCEM) algorithm) is used to assess the fitness of the single-layer urban canopy parametrization implemented in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The scheme is evaluated regarding its ability to simulate observed surface energy fluxes and the sensitivity to input parameters. Recent amendments are described, focussing on features which improve its applicability to numerical weather prediction, such as a reduced and physically more meaningful list of input parameters. The study shows a high sensitivity of the scheme to parameters characterizing roof properties in contrast to a low response to road-related ones. Problems in partitioning of energy between turbulent sensible and latent heat fluxes are also emphasized. Some initial guidelines to prioritize efforts to obtain urban land-cover class characteristics in WRF are provided. Copyright (C) 2010 Royal Meteorological Society and Crown Copyright.

AB Over the last decade there has been a tremendous increase in the use of flow cytometry (FCM) in studies on the biosystematics, ecology and population biology of vascular plants. Most studies, however, address questions related to differences in genome copy number, while the value of FCM for studying homoploid plant groups has long been underestimated. This review summarizes recent advances in taxonomic and ecological research on homoploid plants that were made using FCM. A fairly constant amount of nuclear DNA within each evolutionary entity together with the often large differences between species means that genome size is a useful character for taxonomic decision-making. Regardless of the number of chromosomes, genome size can be used to delimit taxa at various taxonomic levels, resolve complex low-level taxonomies, assess the frequency of interspecific hybridization or infer evolutionary relationships in homoploid plant groups. In plant ecology and evolutionary biology, variation in genome size has been used for prediction purposes because genome size is associated with several phenotypic, physiological and/or ecological characteristics. It is likely that in the future the use of FCM in studies on taxonomy, ecology and population biology of homoploid plants will increase both in scope and frequency. Flow cytometry alone, but especially in combination with other molecular and phenotypic approaches, promises advances in our understanding of the functional significance of variation in genome size in homoploid plants.

AB Sexual selection acting on male traits through female mate choice is commonly inferred from female association preferences in dichotomous mate choice experiments. However, there are surprisingly few empirical demonstrations that such association preferences predict the likelihood of females reproducing with a particular male. This information is essential to confirm association preferences as good predictors of mate choice. We used green swordtails (Xiphophorus helleri) to test whether association preferences predict the likelihood of a female reproducing with a male. Females were tested for a preference for long- or short-sworded males in a standard dichotomous choice experiment and then allowed free access to either their preferred or non-preferred male. If females subsequently failed to produce fry, they were provided a second unfamiliar male with similar sword length to the first male. Females were more likely to reproduce with preferred than non-preferred males, but for those that reproduced, neither the status (preferred/non-preferred) nor the sword length (long/short) of the male had an effect on brood size or relative investment in growth by the female. There was no overall preference based on sword length in this study, but male sword length did affect likelihood of reproduction, with females more likely to reproduce with long- than short-sworded males (independent of preference for such males in earlier choice tests). These results suggest that female association preferences are good indicators of female mate choice but that ornament characteristics of the male are also important.

AB In arid environments, ecological refuges are often conceptualised as places where animal species can persist through drought owing to the localised persistence of moisture and nutrients. The mesopredator release hypothesis (MRH) predicts that reduced abundance of top-order predators results in an increase in the abundance of smaller predators (mesopredators) and consequently has detrimental impacts on the prey of the smaller predators. Thus according to the MRH, the existence of larger predators may provide prey with refuge from predation. In this study, we investigated how the abundance of an endangered rodent Notomys fuscus is affected by Australia's largest predator, the dingo Canis lupus dingo, introduced mesopredators, introduced herbivores, kangaroos and rainfall. Our surveys showed that N. fuscus was more abundant where dingoes occurred. Generalised linear modelling showed that N. fuscus abundance was associated positively with dingo activity and long-term annual rainfall and negatively with red fox Vulpes vulpes activity. Our results were consistent with the hypothesis that areas with higher rainfall and dingoes provide N. fuscus with refuge from drought and predation by invasive red foxes, respectively. Top-order predators, such as dingoes, could have an important functional role in broad-scale biodiversity conservation programmes by reducing the impacts of mesopredators.

AB An extensive debate concerning the origin and taxonomic status of wolf-like canids in the North American Great Lakes region and the consequences for conservation politics regarding these enigmatic predators is ongoing. Using maternally, paternally and biparentally inherited molecular markers, we demonstrate that the Great Lakes wolves are a unique population or ecotype of gray wolves. Furthermore, we show that the Great Lakes wolves experienced high degrees of ancient and recent introgression of coyote and western gray wolf mtDNA and Y-chromosome haplotypes, and that the recent demographic bottleneck caused by persecution and habitat depletion in the early 1900s is not reflected in the genetic data.

AB The replacement of native plants by alien species is likely to affect other trophic levels, particularly phytophagous insects. Nevertheless, the effect of alien plants on insect biomass has not yet been quantified. Given their critical role in transferring energy from plants to higher trophic levels, if alien plants do affect insect biomass, this could have far-reaching consequences for community structure. We used 35 food webs to evaluate the impacts of alien plants on insect productivity in a native forest in the Azores. Our food webs quantified plants, insect herbivores, and their parasitoids, which allowed us to test the effects of alien plants on species richness and evenness, insect abundance, insect biomass, and food-web structure. Species richness of plants and insects, along with plant species evenness, declined as the level of plant invasion increased. Nevertheless, none of the 4 quantitative food-web descriptors (number of links, link density, connectance, and interaction evenness) varied significantly with plant invasion independent of the size of the food web. Overall, insect abundance was not significantly affected by alien plants, but insect biomass was significantly reduced. This effect was due to the replacement of large insects on native plants with small insects on alien plants. Furthermore, the impact of alien plants was sufficiently severe to invert the otherwise expected pattern of species-richness decline with increased elevation. We predict a decrease in insect productivity by over 67% if conservation efforts fail to halt the invasion of alien plants in the Azores.

AB Succession to a naturalized grassland from former agricultural land and pastures is accompanied by changes in plant biodiversity and in the soil community. These changes are the result of a reduction or elimination of management, fertilizer applications and of grazing by large herbivores. We review soil biology studies on agricultural land that are in various successional stages towards naturalized grasslands, where interactions between plant species composition changes and the soil ecology affect each other. In many chronosequence studies, the soil microbial community tends to shift towards a less bacterial, and more fungal dominated food web energy channel following a reduction in fertilizer inputs and grazing intensity. Whereas changes in microarthropod communities are obscured, nematode trophic functional group (ecological guild) changes respond to both plant and soil community changes. There are opportunities to further study the feedback interactions between roots and soil organisms in grasslands. A better understanding of the molecular feedback mechanisms would be beneficial in long-term grassland management. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The central-European population of wolves Canis lupus has its western border of contiguous range in eastern Poland. Protected since 1998, Polish wolves began to expand towards the west. Based on large-scale data on wolf abundance (2000-2006) and geographic information system (GIS) tools, we built a habitat suitability model (HSM) for the species in Poland. The best model, selected by the Akaike information criterion, of the resource selection function (RSF) by wolves included percentage cover of forests, meadows and marshes (positively correlated to wolf abundance) and road density (negatively correlated), and explained 53% of the total variation in the wolf abundance index in a 10 x 10 km cell grid. That RSF was then used to evaluate the whole country in terms of suitability for wolves. Potential wolf range appeared to consist of 24 patches of good habitat (predicted relative probability of wolf occurrence >= 30%), including six patches already occupied and 17 new ones. In total, habitat suitable for wolves covers at least 20-24% of Poland, compared with 16% of the country's area now occupied by the species. HSM was validated with historical data on wolf occurrence in 1950-2006. The areas selected by our model and those inhabited by wolves in at least one decade overlapped in 81-86%. Furthermore, the probability of wolf occurrence predicted by the model correlated positively with the number of decades the wolves were actually recorded in the area. Based on the empirical relationship between patch size and wolf numbers, we estimated that Poland could support a population of 1450-1540 wolves, two to three times larger than the current estimate. HSM needs to be supplemented with a GIS-based connectivity analysis among patches, which in turn should be validated by molecular genetics studies on dispersing wolves. Because of broadly similar geographic conditions, the model may be applicable to eastern Germany, Belarus Republic and the Baltic States (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia).

AB Invasion by cheatgrass and the associated high fire frequency can displace native plant communities from a perennial to an annual grass driven system. Our overall objective of this study was to determine the potential to favor desired native perennial bunchgrasses over annual grasses by altering plant available mineral nitrogen (N). In the first study, we grew cheatgrass and three native bunch grasses (native grasses were combined in equal proportions) in an addition series experimental design and applied one of three N treatments (0, 137, and 280 mg N/kg soil). Regression models were used to derive the effects of intra-and interspecific competition on individual plant yield of cheatgrass and the native bunch grasses (combined). In our second study, we compared the absolute growth rate of the four plant species grown in isolation in a randomized complete block design for 109 days under the same soil N treatments as the competition study. Predicted mean average weight of isolated individuals increased with increasing soil N concentrations for both cheatgrass and the three native perennials (P < 0.05). Biomass of cheatgrass and its competitive ability increased with increasing soil N concentrations (P < 0.0001) compared to the combined native bunchgrasses. However, the greatest resource partitioning occurred at the 137 mg N/kg soil N treatment compared to the 0 (control) and 280 mg N/kg soil treatments, suggesting there may be a level of N that minimizes competition. In the second study, the absolute growth of cheatgrass grown in isolation also increased with increasing N levels (P = 0.0297). Results and ecological implications of this study suggest that increasing soil N leads to greater competitive ability of cheatgrass, and that it may be possible to favor desired plant communities by modifying soil nutrient levels.

AB Explanations for species coexistence in ant communities have traditionally focused on niche partitioning, particularly relating to differences in diet, foraging times and nesting requirements. Although niche separation is undoubtedly important, it seems insufficient to account for the high levels of local species richness that are commonly observed. This paper explores alternative explanations for ant species coexistence, focusing on factors that prevent competitive exclusion in diverse ant communities experiencing high levels of behavioural dominance, such as characteristically occurs in Australia. Very high species densities require two conditions to be met: first, a large number of species must successfully establish; and second, there must be a high rate of species persistence once established. In this context I advance five propositions based around three sets of arguments. First, ant sociality and modularity confers a high level of persistence once colonies are established, so that species coexistence is determined to a significant extent by processes operating at the establishment phase, rather than just by interactions between established colonies. Second, competitive outcomes are highly conditioned by environmental variation, which severely limits competitive exclusion. Finally, dominant species are highly patchy in space, and cannot comprehensively monopolize resources, such that there will usually be room for low densities of subordinate species. These propositions have relevance to neutral theories of community ecology, and to understanding intercontinental differences in local species richness.

AB 1. Many studies have identified relationships between plant reproductive behaviour and environmental conditions. However, they have all been based on cross-species analysis and take no account of the relative abundance of species with vegetation.
   2. Using two reproductive traits - seed mass and dispersal vector - as examples, a range of previously identified relationships were tested using both unweighted and weighted-by-abundance data collected from land-use transitions at 12 sites across Europe.
   3. Seed mass was correlated positively with most measures of temperature (stronger relationships for unweighted data) and declined against measures of disturbance (stronger relationships with weighted data). It was not related consistently to measures of water availability.
   4. There was some evidence that endozoochory was associated with damper environments, hoarding with drier ones and exozoochory with more fertile habitats.
   5. Weighting reduced the slope of relationships between seed mass and environmental variables, possibly indicating that dominance within vegetation is determined by land use after the operation of a climatic filter. Fewer significant relationships were detected for weighted dispersal mechanisms compared to unweighted ones, indicating less difference of the dominants from other species with regard to this trait.
   6. Synthesis. This analysis shows that weighting by abundance in the vegetation (compared to unweighted analysis) has a significant impact on the relationships between key species traits and a range of environmental parameters related to climate and land use, and that this impact was not consistent in its effects.

AB Lateglacial environments at Hijkermeer, northwest Netherlands, were reconstructed by means of chironomid, diatom and pollen analyses. Diatom assemblages indicate that Hijkermeer was a shallow, oligo- to mesotrophic lake during this period. Pollen assemblages reflect the typical northwest European Lateglacial vegetation development and provide an age assessment for the record from the beginning of the Older Dryas (ca 14 000 calibrated C-14 yr BP) into the early Holocene (to ca 10 700 calibrated C-14 yr BP). The chironomid record is characterized by several abrupt shifts between assemblages typically found in mid-latitude subalpine to alpine lakes and assemblages typical for lowland environments. Based on the chironomid record, July air temperatures were reconstructed using a chironomid-temperature transfer-function from central Europe. Mean July air temperatures of ca 14.0-16.0 degrees C are inferred before the Older Dryas, of ca 16.0-16.5 degrees C during most of the Allerod, of ca 13.5-14.0 degrees C during the Younger Dryas, and of ca 15.5-16.0 degrees C during the early Holocene. Two centennial-scale decreases in July air temperature were reconstructed during the Lateglacial interstadial which are correlated with Greenland Interstadial events (GI)-1d and -1b. The results suggest that vegetation changes in the Netherlands may have been promoted by the cooler climate during GI-1d, immediately preceding the Older Dryas biozone, and GI-1b. The Hijkermeer chironomid-inferred temperature record shows a similar temperature development as the Greenland ice core oxygen isotope records for most of the Lateglacial and a good agreement with other temperature reconstructions available from the Netherlands. This suggests that chironomid-based temperature reconstruction can be successfully implemented in the Northwest European lowlands and that chironomids may provide a useful alternative to oxygen isotopes for correlating European lake sediment records during the Lateglacial.

AB Variation in tree stem diameter results from reversible shrinking and swelling and irreversible radial growth, all processes that are influenced by tree water status. To assess the causal effects of water and temperature on stem radial variation (Delta R) and maximum daily shrinkage (MDS), the diurnal cycle was divided into three phases: contraction, expansion and stein radius increment. Diurnal cycles were measured during 1996-2004 in Picea abies (L.) Karst., Pinus cembra L. and Larix decidua Mill. in a timberline ecotone to understand the links between stem diameter variation (v; defined as MDS or Delta R), phase duration (h), and weather or sap flow descriptors (d). We demonstrated that a high proportion of MDS and Delta R was explained by h because of the nonlinearity of the physiological responses to weather d. By causal modeling, we tested whether the relationship between d and v was due to h (lack of causal relationship between d and v)) or to both d and h (double cause). The results of this modeling added new physiological insight into daily growth-cliniate relationships. Negative correlations were found between Delta R and air temperature owing to the negative effect of temperature on h only, and did not correspond to a direct effect on tree growth mediated by an alteration in metabolic activities. Precipitation had two main effects: a direct effect on Delta R and an indirect effect mediated through an effect on h. A reduction in sap flow at night led to an increase in Delta R for P. abies and L. decidua, but not for P. cembra.

AB Within the growing body of proteomics studies, issues addressing problems of ecotoxicology are on the rise. Generally speaking, ecotoxicology uses quantitative expression changes of distinct proteins known to be involved in toxicological responses as biomarkers. Unlike these directed approaches, proteomics examines how multiple expression changes are associated with a contamination that is suspected to be detrimental. Consequently, proteins involved in toxicological responses that have not been described previously may be revealed. Following identification of key proteins indicating exposure or effect, proteomics can potentially be employed in environmental risk assessment. To this end, bioinformatics may unveil protein patterns specific to an environmental stress that would constitute a classifier able to distinguish an exposure from a control state. The combined use of sets of marker proteins associated with a given pollution impact may prove to be more reliable, as they are based not only on a few unique markers which are measured independently, but reflect the complexity of a toxicological response. Such a proteomic pattern might also integrate some of the already established biomarkers of environmental toxicity Proteomics applications in ecotoxicology may also comprise functional examination of known classes of proteins, such as glutathione transferases or metallothioneins, to elucidate their toxicological responses.

AB 1. Quantifying how biological diversity is distributed in the landscape is one of the central themes of conservation ecology. For this purpose, landscape classifications are being intensively used in conservation planning and biodiversity management, although there is still little information about their efficacy.
   2. I used data from 158 running water sites in Hungary to examine the contribution of six a priori established habitat types to regional level diversity of fish assemblages. Three community measures [species richness, diversity (Shannon, Simpson indices), assemblage composition] were examined at two assemblage levels (entire assemblage, the native assemblage). The relative role of non-native species was quantified to examine their contribution to patterns in diversity in this strongly human influenced landscape.
   3. Additive diversity partitioning revealed the primary importance of beta diversity (i.e. among-site factors) to patterns in species richness. Landscape-scale patterns in species richness were best explained by between-habitat type (beta(2): 41.2%), followed by within-habitat type (beta(1): 37.7%) and finally within-site (alpha: 21.1%) diversity. Diversity indices showed patterns different from species richness, indicating the importance of relative abundance distributions on the results. Exclusion of non-natives from the analysis gave similar results to the entire-assemblage level analysis.
   4. Canonical analysis of principal coordinates, complemented with indicator species analysis justified the separation of fish assemblages among the habitat types, although classification error was high. Multivariate dispersion, a measure of compositional beta diversity, showed significant differences among the habitat types. Contrary to species diversity (i.e. richness, diversity indices), patterns in compositional diversity were strongly influenced by the exclusion of non-natives from the analyses.
   5. This study is the first to quantify how running water habitat types contribute to fish diversity at the landscape scale and how non-native species influence this pattern. These results on riverine fish assemblages support the hypothesis that environmental variability (i.e. the diversity of habitat types) is an indication of biodiversity and can be used in large-scale conservation designs. The study emphasises the joint application of additive diversity partitioning and multivariate statistics when exploring the contribution of landscape components to the overall biodiversity of the landscape mosaic.

AB Soil food webs are particularly important in terrestrial systems, but studying them is difficult. Here we report on the first study to apply a molecular approach to identify species-specific trophic interactions in below-ground food webs. To identify the invertebrate predator guild of the garden chafer Phyllopertha horticola (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae) whose root-feeding larvae can be highly abundant in grasslands, a specific DNA marker was developed. It allowed detection of P. horticola egg and white grub meals within the gut content of Poecilus versicolor (Coleoptera, Carabidae) larvae for up to 24 h post-feeding. Soil samples from an alpine grassland revealed a diverse below-ground macro-invertebrate community with earthworms, P. horticola larvae, and centipedes as well as beetle larvae as the most abundant detritivores, herbivores, and predators, respectively. Garden chafer DNA was detected in 18.6%, 4.1%, and 4.4% of field-collected Geophilidae (n = 124), beetle larvae (n = 159), and Lithobiidae (n = 49), respectively. We conclude that most of the investigated predators actively preyed on P. horticola, as secondary predation is unlikely to be detected in below-ground systems. Moreover, scavenging most likely contributes only to a small percentage of the revealed trophic links due to the low availability of carrion. Sampling date did not influence prey detection rates, indicating that both P. horticola eggs and larvae were preyed on. Only 2.7% of the below-ground predators tested positive for earthworms, an alternative, highly abundant prey, suggesting that P. horticola represents an important prey source for centipedes and predatory beetle larvae during summer within the soil food web.

AB As an initial step in establishing mechanistic relationships between environmental variability and recruitment in Atlantic cod Gadhus morhua along the coast of the western Gulf of Maine, we assessed transport success of larvae from major spawning grounds to nursery areas with particle tracking using the unstructured grid model FVCOM (finite volume coastal ocean model). In coastal areas, dispersal of early planktonic life stages of fish and invertebrate species is highly dependent on the regional dynamics and its variability, which has to be captured by our models. With state-of-the-art forcing for the year 1995, we evaluate the sensitivity of particle dispersal to the timing and location of spawning, the spatial and temporal resolution of the model, and the vertical mixing scheme. A 3 d frequency for the release of particles is necessary to capture the effect of the circulation variability into an averaged dispersal pattern of the spawning season. The analysis of sensitivity to model setup showed that a higher resolution mesh, tidal forcing, and current variability do not change the general pattern of connectivity, but do tend to increase within-site retention. Our results indicate strong downstream connectivity among spawning grounds and higher chances for successful transport from spawning areas closer to the coast. The model run for January egg release indicates 1 to 19 % within-spawning ground retention of initial particles, which may be sufficient to sustain local populations. A systematic sensitivity analysis still needs to be conducted to determine the minimum mesh and forcing resolution that adequately resolves the complex dynamics of the western Gulf of Maine. Other sources of variability, i.e. large-scale upstream forcing and the biological environment, also need to be considered in future studies of the interannual variability in transport and survival of the early life stages of cod.

AB The relative importance of the Pleistocene glacial cycles in driving avian speciation remains controversial, partly because species limits in many groups remain poorly understood, and because current taxonomic designations are often based on phenotypic characteristics of uncertain phylogenetic significance. We use mtDNA sequence data to examine patterns of genetic variation, sequence divergence and phylogenetic relationships between phenotypically distinct groups of the yellow-rumped warbler complex. Currently classified as a single species, the complex is composed of two North American migratory forms (myrtle warbler Dendroica coronata coronata and Audubon's warbler Dendroica coronata auduboni), and two largely sedentary forms: Dendroica coronata nigrifrons of Mexico, and Dendroica coronata goldmani of Guatemala. The latter are typically considered to be races of the Audubon's warbler based on plumage characteristics. However, mtDNA sequence data reveal that sedentary Mesoamerican forms are reciprocally monophyletic to each other and to migratory forms, from which they show a long history of isolation. In contrast, migratory myrtle and Audubon's warblers form a single cluster due to high levels of shared ancestral polymorphism as evidenced by widespread sharing of mtDNA haplotypes despite marked phenotypic differentiation. Sedentary and migratory forms diverged in the early Pleistocene, whereas phenotypic differentiation between the two migratory forms has occurred in the Holocene and is likely the result of geographical isolation and subsequent range expansion since the last glaciation. Our results underscore the importance of Quaternary climatic events in driving songbird speciation and indicate that plumage traits can evolve remarkably fast, thus rendering them potentially misleading for inferring systematic relationships.

AB It has been shown theoretically that sympatric speciation can occur if intraspecific competition is strong enough to induce disruptive selection. However, the plausibility of the involved processes is under debate, and many questions on the conditions for speciation remain unresolved. For instance, is strong disruptive selection sufficient for speciation? Which roles do genetic architecture and initial composition of the population play? How strong must assortative mating be before a population can split in two? These are some of the issues we address here. We investigate a diploid multilocus model of a quantitative trait that is under frequency-dependent selection caused by a balance of intraspecific competition and frequency-independent stabilizing selection. This trait also acts as mating character for assortment. It has been established previously that speciation can occur only if competition is strong enough to induce disruptive selection. We find that speciation becomes more difficult for very strong competition, because then extremely strong assortment is required. Thus, speciation is most likely for intermediate strengths of competition, where it requires strong, but not extremely strong, assortment. For this range of parameters, however, it is not obvious how assortment can evolve from low to high levels, because with moderately strong assortment less genetic variation is maintained than under weak or strong assortment-sometimes none at all. In addition to the strength of frequency-dependent competition and assortative mating, the roles of the number of loci, the distribution of allelic effects, the initial conditions, costs to being choosy, the strength of stabilizing selection, and the particular choice of the fitness function are explored. A multitude of possible evolutionary outcomes is observed, including loss of all genetic variation, splitting in two to five species, as well as very short and extremely long stable limit cycles. On the methodological side, we propose quantitative measures for deciding whether a given distribution reflects two (or more) reproductively isolated clusters.

AB 1 Intact, closed canopied forests appear highly resistant to exotic plant invasions, but there are few experimental studies of this observation. To test this issue and explore the conditions that foster resistance, we experimentally added Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.) seeds to intact forests for 3 years and monitored emergence, survivorship and height growth for 5 years.
   2 Seed additions (250 seeds(-1) m(2)) were replicated in situ in combinations of light (deep shade vs. small gaps), soil fertility (NO3 and pH), and variation in soil moisture as influenced by topography (hill slopes vs. flat areas at slope bases) in five eastern deciduous forests in central New York and southern Connecticut. We then parameterized a model with this data to project long-term rates of sapling recruitment.
   3 Seedlings had high survival and low growth rates in the deep shade, suggesting that this species readily forms a seedling bank in intact forests. By age 5, annual survivorship reached 93% in deep shade and 98% in small gaps. Median seedling heights were <= 10 cm in all treatments after 5 years, though the largest seedlings were markedly taller in gaps. Mean year 5 densities of all experimental seedlings (ages 3-5 years) were 14 seedlings(-1) m(2) (+/- 2.4 SE) in the shade and 19 seedlings(-1) m(2) (+/- 3.5 SE) in small gaps.
   4 While seedlings colonized in all conditions, resistance to invasion varied markedly; resistance was highest in deeply shaded, acidic conditions (pH < 4.5). Small gaps initially promoted invasion, but by age 4 shade survivorship rates were equivalent to gaps. Higher soil pH (especially > 6) also significantly increased survivorship, particularly in deep shade. Shading's main effect was to suppress height growth. Overall, the model predicted impressive sapling recruitment; even in deeply shaded, acidic conditions, approximately 1% of seeds emerge and survive to become saplings.
   5 Intact forests only weakly resisted A. platanoides colonization, but strongly suppressed its rate of invasion. As such, the frequency of disturbance, though ultimately unnecessary for A. platanoides invasions, will strongly influence its near-term invasiveness. Dispersal limitation and slow stand dynamics appear to be the primary constraints on its current distribution.

AB We fill a gap in understanding wetland vegetation diversity and relationship with environmental determinants in Bulgarian high mountains. A total of 615 phytosociological samples were taken from springs, mires, wet meadows and tall-forb habitats throughout Bulgaria, of which 234 releves are from mire and spring vegetation above timberline. The vegetation was classified by TWINSPAN and the resulting vegetation types were reproduced by the formal definitions using the combination of Cocktail species groups based on phi-coefficient of joint co-occurrence of the species. Nine vegetation types of springs and fens have been clearly delimited above the timberline. All vegetation types include Balkan endemic species, the representation of which varies. Fens generally harbour more Balkan endemics than do springs, with the exception of species-poor high-altitude Drepanocladetum exannulati. The gradient structure of the vegetation was revealed by DCA and by CCA with forward selection of environmental factors. The major determinants of vegetation variation strongly differ above and below the timberline and likewise between springs and fens. The base-richness gradient controls the floristic variation of Bulgarian submontane fens, whereas the complete data set including both submontane and subalpine fens is governed by the altitude gradient from lowland and basin fens to subalpine fens rich in Balkan endemics. When focusing on sites above the timberline only, the first DCA axis separates fens from springs without organic matter. The major species turnover in springs follows the variation in water pH and mineral content in water, whereas fen vegetation variation is primarily controlled by succession gradient of peat accumulation. Altitude remains an important factor in all cases. Weak correlation between water pH and conductivity was found. This correlation was even statistically insignificant in fens above the timberline. Water pH is not influenced by mineral richness in Bulgarian high mountains, since it is buffered by decomposition of organic matter in fens. In springs, pH reaches maximum values due to strong aeration caused by water flow. The plant species richness decreases significantly with increasing altitude. The increase of species richness towards circumneutral pH, often found in mires, was not confirmed in Bulgarian high mountains. The correlation between species richness and pH was significant only when arctic-alpine species and allied European high-mountain species were considered separately. The richness of boreal species was independent on pH. Some of them had their optima shifted to more acidic fens as compared to regions below the timberline. Our results suggest that subalpine spring and fen vegetation should be analysed separately with respect to vegetation-environment correlations. Separate analysis of fens below and above timberline is quite appropriate.

AB Species of Fucus are among the dominant seaweeds along Northern Hemisphere shores, but taxonomic designations often are confounded by significant intraspecific morphological variability. We analyzed intra- and inter-specific phylogenetic relationships within the genus (275 individuals representing 16 taxa) using two regions of the mitochondrion: a variable intergenic spacer and a conserved portion of the 23S subunit. Bayesian ML and MP analyses verified a shallow phylogeny with two major lineages (previously reported) and resolved some intra-lineage relationships. Significant species-level paraphyly/polyphyly was observed within lineages 1A and 2. Despite higher species richness in the North Atlantic, a North Pacific origin of the genus is supported by a gradient of decreasing haplotype and nucleotide diversities in F distichus from the North Pacific to the East Atlantic.

AB Intensive forestry practises in the Swedish landscape have led to the loss and fragmentation of stable old-growth habitats. We investigated relationships between landscape composition at multiple scales and the composition of saproxylic beetle assemblages in nine clear-cut, mature managed and old-growth spruce-dominated forest stands in the central boreal zone of Sweden. We set out fresh spruce and birch logs and created spruce snags in 2001-2002 to experimentally test the effects of coarse woody debris (CWD) type and forest management on the composition of early and late successional, and red-listed saproxylic beetle assemblages. We examined effects of CWD availability at 100 m, and landscape composition at 1 and 10 km on saproxylic beetle abundances. Additionally, we tested whether assemblage similarity decreased with increasing distance between sites. We collected beetles from the experimental logs using eclector and window traps in four periods during 2003. CWD was measured and landscape composition data was obtained from maps of remotely sensed data. The composition of saproxylic beetles differed among different CWD substrates and between clear-cuts and the older stand types, however differences between mature managed and old-growth forests were significant only for red-listed species. Assemblage similarities for red-listed species on clear-cuts were more different at greater distances apart, indicating that they have more localised distributions. CWD availability within 100 m of the study sites was rarely important in determining the abundance of species, suggesting that early successional saproxylic beetles can disperse further than this distance. At a larger scale, a large area of suitable stand types within both 1 and 10 km resulted in greater abundances in the study sites for several common and habitat-specific species. The availability of suitable habitat at scales of 1-10 km is thus likely to be important in the survival of many saproxylic species in forestry-fragmented areas.

AB We have made daily measurements of phytoplankton pigments, size-fractionated (< 2 and > 2-mu m) carbon fixation and chlorophyll-a concentration during four Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) cruises in 2003-04. Surface rates of carbon fixation ranged from < 0.2-mmol C m(-3) d(-1) in the subtropical gyres to 0.2-0.5-mmol C m(-3) d(-1) in the tropical equatorial Atlantic. Significant intercruise variability was restricted to the subtropical gyres, with higher chlorophyll-a concentrations and carbon fixation in the subsurface chlorophyll maximum during spring in either hemisphere. In surface waters, although picoplankton (<-mu m) represented the dominant fraction in terms of both carbon fixation (50-70%) and chlorophyll-alpha (80-90%), nanoplankton (> 2-mu m) contributions to total carbon fixation (30-50%) were higher than to total chlorophyll-alpha (10-20%). However, in the subsurface chlorophyll maximum picoplankton dominated both carbon fixation (70-90%) and chlorophyll-alpha (70-90%). Thus, in surface waters chlorophyll-normalised carbon fixation was 2-3 times higher for nanoplankton and differences in picoplankton and nanoplankton carbon to chlorophyll-alpha ratios may lead to either higher or similar growth rates. These low chlorophyll-normalised carbon fixation rates for picoplankton may also reflect losses of fixed carbon (cell leakage or respiration), decreases in photosynthetic efficiency, grazing losses during the incubations, or some combination of all these. Comparison of nitrate concentrations in the subsurface chlorophyll maximum with estimates of those required to support the observed rates of carbon fixation (assuming Redfield stoichiometry) indicate that primary production in the chlorophyll maximum may be light rather than nutrient limited.

AB The optimal number of mate partners for females rarely coincides with that for males, leading to a potential sexual conflict over multiple-partner mating. This suggests that the population sex ratio may affect multiple-partner mating and thus multiple paternity. We investigate the relationship between multiple paternity and the population sex ratio in the polygynandrous common lizard (Lacerta vivipara). In Six Populations the adult sex ratio was biased toward males, and in another six Populations the adult sex ratio was biased toward females, the latter corresponding to the average adult sex ratio encountered in natural populations. In males the frequency and the degree of polygyny were lower in male-biased populations, as expected if competition among males determines polygyny. In females the frequency of polyandry was not different between treatments, and polyandrous females produced larger clutches, suggesting that polyandry might be adaptive. However, in male-biased populations females Suffered from reduced reproductive success compared to female-biased populations, and the number of mate partners increased with female body size in polyandrous females. Polyandrous females of male-biased populations showed disproportionately more mating scars. indicating that polyandrous females of male-biased populations had more interactions with males and suggesting that the degree of multiple paternity is controlled by male sexual harassment. Our results thus imply that polyandry may be hierarchically controlled, with females controlling when to mate with multiple partners and male sexual harassment being a proximate determinant of the degree of multiple paternity. The results are also consistent with a sexual conflict in which male behaviors are harmful to females.

AB When the reproductive value of a breeding attempt is related to attributes of the breeding partner, an individual is expected to allocate more resources to parental care when mated to a high-quality partner. We tested predictions of the differential allocation hypothesis, by experimentally increasing and decreasing male blue tit, Parus caeruleus, sexual attractiveness and recording subsequent measures of male and female parental effort during the chick-feeding period. We used marker pens, to create two distinct male phenotypes: one more attractive phenotype with a shift in peak reflectance towards the ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum (UV+) and one less attractive phenotype with a shift towards the human-visible part of the spectrum (UV-). There was no significant difference in absolute or relative female feeding rate with respect to treatment. However, there were significant interaction effects between treatment and female age on female feeding rate, indicating that 1-year-old females provisioned more when mated to a UV+ male than a UV- male. UV- males fed their chicks at a higher rate than UV+ males, but there was no significant difference between the groups in total feeding rate. Females contributed less to nest defence relative to their mates when they were mated to UV- males, whereas the opposite was true for females mated to UV+ males. The behavioural responses did not translate into differences in measures of reproductive output. Our study suggests that male phenotypic appearance at the chick-feeding stage influences female decisions about level of parental effort. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We present a critical review of current trends in research of spatio-temporal development of forests. The paper addresses (1) field methods for the development of spatially-explicit models of forest dynamics and their integration in models of forest dynamics, (2) strengths and limitations of traditional patch models versus spatially-explicit, individual-based models, and (3) the potential for moment-based methods in the analysis of forest dynamics. These topics are discussed with reference to their potential for solving open questions in the studies of forest dynamics. The study of spatio-temporal processes provides a link between pattern and process in plant communities, and plays a crucial role in understanding ecosystem dynamics. In the last decade, the development of spatially-explicit, individual-based models shifted the focus of forest dynamics modelling from the dynamics of discrete patches to the interactions among individual organisms, thus encapsulating the theory of "neighbourhood" dynamics. In turn, the stochastic properties and the complexity of spatially-explicit, individual-based models gave rise to the development of a new suite of so-called moment-based models. These new models describe the dynamics of individuals and of pairs of individuals in terms of their densities, thus directly capturing second-order information on spatial structure. So far, this approach has not been applied to forests; we indicate extensions needed for such applications. Moment-based models may be an important complement to spatially explicit individual-based models in developing a general spatial theory of forest dynamics. However, both kinds of models currently focus on fine scales, whereas a critical issue in forest dynamics is to understand the interaction of fine-scale processes with coarser-scale disturbances. To obtain a more complete picture of forest dynamics, the relevant links and interactions between fine-, intermediate-, and coarse-scale processes ought to be identified. Intensive links between modelling work and field studies designed across different scales are a promising means to create a new perspective on forest dynamics.

AB 1. Although genetic differentiation among plant populations is well known, its relevance for preserving the integrity of native ecosystems has received little attention. In a series of competition experiments with Andropogon gerardii Vitman, a dominant species of the North American Tallgrass Prairie, plant performance was related to seed provenance and restoration activities.
   2. Glasshouse experiments showed plant performance to be a function of seed source. Differential target plant performance relative to competitor identity was observed when plant performance was assessed across a range of competitor densities. Local and non-local plants were larger when competing against non-local plants relative to the local and cultivar plants, while cultivar plants were consistently larger than local and non-local plants regardless of competitor identity or density. The consistency of cultivar performance could reflect directional selection during cultivar development for consistently high fecundity, vigorous vegetative growth and resistance to pathogens.
   3. In a field experiment, non-local plants were half the size of local and cultivar plants, supporting recognition of seed provenances of A. gerardii based on differences in plant performance among source populations observed in the glasshouse study, and previous genetic analyses of the same populations.
   4. This study establishes that seed provenance and restoration activities influence the competitive ability of a dominant species which, in turn, may affect plant community structure and potential ecosystem function.

AB Experiments where the diversity of species assemblage is manipulated are sometimes used to predict the consequences of species loss from real communities. However, their design corresponds to a random selection of the lost species. There are three main factors that limit species richness: harshness of the environment, competitive exclusion, and species pool, limitation. Species loss is usually caused by increasing effects of these factors. In the first two cases, the species that are excluded are highly non-random subsets of the potential. species set, and consequently, the predictions based on random selection of the lost species might be misleading. The data show that the least productive species are those being recently excluded from temperate grasslands and consequently, species loss is not connected with decline of productivity. The concurrent species loss in many communities, however, means also a reduction of the available diaspore pool, on a landscape scale, and could result in increased species pool limitation in other communities.

AB In this paper, we re-examine how heterogeneous environments can enable protected polymorphisms. Building on the classical models by Levene and Dempster of dispersal and selection in two habitats, we systematically investigate how the maintenance of polymorphisms is affected by (1) local versus global density regulation and (2) constant versus variable output from habitats to the next generation. We show that, for populations capable of habitat choice, a third independent and fundamental class of models needs to be considered. It is characterized by local density regulation (like Levene's model) and variable habitat output (like Dempster's model). Our results indicate that the conditions determining whether a system allows for protected polymorphisms differ qualitatively in the presence and absence of matching habitat choice (which occurs when individuals prefer the habitat to which they are best adapted). Without such habitat choice, the salient distinction is not between local and global density regulation, but between constant and variable habitat output. With matching habitat choice this situation is reversed. Analysis of the third class of models introduced here suggests that the joint evolution of matching habitat choice and local-adaptation polymorphism is easier than was previously thought.

AB As the human demand for freshwater natural resources such as fish and drinking water increases' we may rely more heavily on models to predict the response of aquatic ecosystems to natural and anthropogenic disturbance. Theses models in turn implicitly depend on the underlying spatial distribution of organisms. In terrestrial ecosystems, increased natural resource utilization has transformed habitat and changed the spatial distribution of organisms, with subsequent negative effects on biota. Recent studies in lakes demonstrate that human development of lakeshores alters the physical habitat and nutrient cycles. The impact of such disturbance by humans on the spatial distribution of aquatic organisms, however, remains unknown. Here we quantify the effect of lakeshore development on the spatial distribution of fishes in 23 lakes in the US Pacific Northwest. We found a significant decrease in the spatial aggregation of fishes with increased shoreline development by humans, reflecting a loss of refugia and resource heterogeneity that favors aggregation among fishes. We also found that lakes with a high perimeter-surface-area ratio and a relatively shallow littoral zone had much higher levels of fish aggregation, suggesting the importance of terrestrial inputs to lakes. Finally, we found a marginally significant decrease in fish spatial aggregation with increased total phosphorus concentration, but no effect of chlorophyll concentration, water transparency, the predator-prey ratio, or number of species on fish spatial distributions. These results suggest that anthropogenic modification of shorelines is significantly altering the spatial distribution of important aquatic organisms, and that these changes may have important implications for predictive modeling of ecosystem dynamics.

AB Recent decreases in biodiversity in Europe are commonly thought to be due to land use and climate change. However, the genetic diversity of populations is also seen as one essential factor for their fitness. Genetic diversity in species across the continent of Europe has been recognized as being in part a consequence of ice age isolation in southern refugia and postglacial colonization northwards, and these phylogeographical patterns may themselves affect the adaptability of populations. Recent work on butterfly species with different refugia, colonization paths and genetic structures allows this idea to be examined. The 'chalk-hill blue' pattern is one of decreasing genetic diversity from south to north, whereas the 'woodland ringlet' pattern shows greater genetic diversity in eastern than in western lineages. Comparison of population demographic trends in species with these biogeographical patterns reveals higher rates of decrease with lower genetic diversity. This indicates reduced adaptability due to genetic impoverishment as a result of glacial and postglacial range changes. Analysis of phylogeographical pattern may be a useful guide to interpreting demographic trends and in conservation planning.

AB Causes of natal dispersal were studied in an isolated population of the migratory, facultatively colonial Lesser Kestrel (Falco naumanni) in northeastern Spain. Dur During a seven-year study, we gathered information on natal dispersal of 751 individuals and on 24 explanatory variables that evaluated individual traits, conspecific cues in terms of colony size, and different ecological and populational features. We examined separately whether or not individuals changed colonies and how far they moved. Dispersal from the natal colony was high (83%), and dispersers covered a median distance-of 7225 In (range 112-136500 m). The probability of natal dispersal decreased with the size of the natal colony and with the distance to the nearest colony, but not with the distance to unoccupied buildings, in the year of recruitment. Moreover, the shorter the distance to the nearest colony, the shorter the distances that individuals dispersed, particularly to large colonies (>10 pairs). These results support the conspecific attraction hypothesis. Accordingly, the probability of recruiting in-the natal colony increased with the proportion of philopatric adults, although beyond a threshold individuals were prevented from recruiting by the more dominant adults in a despotic way. The timing of arrival from the wintering grounds was positively related to the probability of colony change, especially in males. To the extent that this variable is related to the phenotypic quality of individuals, it reinforces the idea that natal dispersal is shaped by intraspecific competition in crowded colonies. Males showed lower frequencies of colony change and dispersed shorter distances than did females, as explained by the different role of the sexes in nest acquisition and defense. Our results indicate that natal dispersal is an evolutionarily labile trait simultaneously influenced by ecological, social, and individual features both within and between populations.

AB In the past several decades, the development of novel molecular techniques and the advent of noninvasive DNA sampling, coupled with the ease and speed with which molecular analyses can now be performed, have made it possible for primatologists to directly examine the fitness effects of individual behavior and to explore how variation in behavior and social systems influences primate population genetic structure. This review describes the theoretical connections between individual behavior and primate social systems on the one hand and population genetic structure on the other, discusses the kinds of molecular markers typically employed in genetic studies of primates, and summarizes what primatologists have learned from molecular studies over the past few decades about dispersal patterns, mating systems, reproductive strategies, and the influence of kinship on social behavior. Several important conclusions can be drawn from this overview. First, genetic data confirm that, in many species, male dominance rank and fitness are positively related, at least over the short term, though this relationship need not simply be a reflection of male-male contest competition over mates. More importantly, genetic research reveals the significance of female choice in determining male reproductive success, and documents the efficacy of alternative mating tactics among males. Second, genetic data suggest that the presumed importance of kinship in structuring primate social relationships needs to be evaluated further, at least for some taxa such as chimpanzees in which demographic factors may be more important than relatedness. I conclude this paper by offering several suggestions of additional ways in which molecular techniques might be employed in behavioral and ecological studies of primates (e.g., for conducting,"molecular censuses" of unhabituated populations, for studying disease and host-parasite interactions, or for tracking seed fate in studies of seed dispersal) and by providing a brief introduction to the burgeoning field of nonhuman primate behavioral genetics.

AB Although principal coordinates analysis is one of the most widely used ordination methods in ecology, no study had been undertaken as yet on the combined effect of gradient type and resemblance coefficient on the results. We examine the performance of principal coordinates analysis with different choices of the resemblance function and different types of a single, underlying gradient. Whereas unimodal species response to long gradients always leads to horseshoe (or arch)-shaped configurations in the first two dimensions, the converse is not true; curvilinear arrangements cannot generally be explained by the Gaussian model. Several resemblance coefficients widely used in ecology produce paradoxical arches from perfectly linear data. Species richness changes alone, may also lead to a horseshoe for even more distance functions, with the noted exception of Manhattan metric. The appearance of arches is a mathematical necessity in these cases; true artifacts are introduced only if distances are treated inappropriately before eigenanalysis. Examples illustrate that similar configurations (curves and even circles) may arise from very different data structures; therefore the shape of the point scatter is insufficient by itself to identify background ecological phenomena. The horseshoe effect may be diminished and eigenvalue extraction may be made more efficient if input measures are raised to high powers; but this operation is recommended only in combination with standard analyses, as part of a comparative approach. We derive a new distance function, implying standardization by species totals, from the chi-square distance. We found that this function improves gradient recovery when there is unimodal species response and. some species have their optima outside the range of study.

AB Previous studies investigating density-dependent nest predation risk have suffered from unnaturally high nest densities (artificial nests) or lack of controls for nest predator densities (observational data on real nests). I designed an experiment with artificial nests within the natural range of nest densities using a Latin square design (to control for differences in densities of nest predators in time and space) to avoid the shortcomings of previous studies. I incorporated confounding factors, such as time in the breeding season and landscape type, in order to study whether they affected nest predation risk. The experiment was performed in dry semi-natural shrub-rich grasslands in Sweden, using artificial shrub-nests containing two quail (Coturnix coturnix) eggs and a plasticine egg. Finally, I validated my results obtained from the artificial nest experiment by comparing relative nest predation risk on artificial nests with nest predation risk on real nests of red-backed shrikes (Lanius collurio), a shrub-nesting passerine. Corvids were the major nest predators on artificial shrub nests as revealed by marks in plasticine eggs. Within the natural variation in densities of simultaneously active shrub nests, corvids increased their rates of predation with increasing densities of artificial nests, indicating a functional response. Nest predation risk decreased with time in the season and differed between grassland plots in farmland-dominated (high risk), farmland-forest mosaic (low risk), and forest-dominated (low risk) landscape surroundings. Furthermore, predation risk on artificial nests increased with decreasing distance to nests of at least one corvid species. Breeding red-backed shrikes selected grasslands with a low nest predation risk on artificial nests and reproductive success of shrikes was positively related to success of artificial nests. Moreover, the probability of success for both artificial and real red-backed shrike nests increased with increasing distance from the nearest corvid nest. Thus, results from the artificial nest experiment were validated by the results from the red-backed shrike population study. My results therefore suggest that predation risk measured on artificial nests can be used as a relative index of spatial and temporal variation in nest predation risk. My results also indicate that grasslands in forested landscapes should be given extra attention for conservation aspects, since nest predation risk is lower there compared to grasslands in more open habitats.

AB We studied both the short- and long-term effects of density on three life history traits of a red deer population inhabiting a temperate forest. Both male and female body mass increased when population density decreased, but male mass changed to a greater extent than female mass. Density did not influence female survival irrespective of age, however, Survival of males was lower at high density for all age classes except the prime-age class. Pregnancy rates of primiparous females increased markedly with decreasing density, whereas those of adult hinds were fairly constant and unrelated to density. For both sexes, of the studied life history traits we detected a long-term effect of density at birth (cohort effect) only on body mass. These results suggest that density influences life history traits in the same way as factors of environmental variation such as climate. In this population we did not find any evidence for an influence of climatic conditions on life history traits of red deer. Both mild winters and the absence of summer droughts during the study period could account for such an absence of climatic effects. We interpreted our results to show that 1) as expected for a highly dimorphic and polygynous species such as red deer, male traits showed consistently higher sensitivity to variation in density than female traits. illustrating possible costs caused by sexual selection it, males, 2) the female-based Eberhardt's model according to which increasing density should sequentially affect juvenile survival, reproductive rates of primiparous females, reproductive rates of adults and lastly adult survival was only partly supported because we found that pregnancy rate of primiparous females rather than juvenile survival was the most sensitive trait to variation in density. We propose that including variation in male traits would improve the accuracy of models of Population dynamics of large mammals. at least for highly dimorphic species. Because the population we studied was not fenced. we only measured apparent Survival. We discuss how dispersal, in relation to the phenotypic quality of young deer, might be a potential regulating factor under such conditions.

AB Insular populations typically occur at higher densities, have higher survivorship, reduced fecundity, decreased dispersal. and reduced aggression compared to their mainland counterparts. Insularity may also affect mating system and genetic population structure. However, these factors have not been examined simultaneously in any island vertebrate. Here we report on the ecological, behavioural and genetic characteristics of a small carnivore, the island fox Urocyon littoralis, from Fraser Point. Santa Cruz Island, California. Dispersal distances in island foxes are very low (mean 1.39 km. SID 1.26, range 0.16-3.58 knit, n = 8). Home-range size is one of the smallest (mean annual home range = 0.55 km(2), SID 0.2, n = 14) and density is nearly the highest recorded for any canid species (2.4-15.9 foxes/km(2)). Similar to other fox species, island foxes are distributed as mated pairs that maintain discrete territories. Overlap among mated pairs was always high (mean 0.85, SD 0.05), while overlap among neighbours (mean 0.11, SID 0.13), regardless of sex, was low. Despite this high degree of territoriality, island foxes are not strictly monogamous. Four of 16 offspring whose parents were identified by paternity analysis were a result of extra-pair fertilizations. Mated pairs were unrelated, however, suggesting inbreeding avoidance. Substantial population differentiation was found between the Fraser Point subpopulation and one only 13 km away (F-st = 0. 11). We suggest that the primary effect of finite island area is to limit dispersal, which then influences the demography, behaviour and genetic structure of island fox populations.

AB A longstanding view in zooplankton research has been that large copepods are the important members of most communities. It has also been thought that warm water communities contain smaller copepods than temperate waters, with cold polar waters containing large species. We present copepod size spectra from detailed microscopic analysis of tropical and temperate locations, to challenge these paradigms. While the size range of copepods does increase with decreasing temperature and with depth into oceanic waters, the fundamental attributes of the size spectra are similar. Small copepods and early developmental stages dominate all communities.

AB Lake eutrophication is a problem in many areas of Ontario, although the history of nutrient enrichment is poorly documented. The aim of this study was to construct a diatom-based transfer function to infer past phosphorus levels in Ontario lakes using paleolimnological analyses. The relationship between diatom assemblages and limnological conditions was explored from a survey of diatoms preserved in the surface sediments of 64 Southern Ontario lakes, spanning a total phosphorus gradient of 0.004 to 0.054 mg L-1. Over 420 diatom taxa were identified, 98 of which were sufficiently common to be considered in statistical analyses. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) determined that pH, ammonium, aluminium, spring total phosphorus(TP), strontium, total nitrogen (TN), maximum depth (MaxZ), chlorophyll a (Chla) and mean depth were significant variables in explaining the variance in the diatom species data. The environmental optima of common diatom taxa for the limnologically important variables (TP, pH, TN, MaxZ, Chla) were calculated using weighted averaging (WA) regression and calibration techniques, and transfer functions were generated. The diatom inference model for spring TP provided a robust reconstructive relationship (r(2) = 0.637; RMSE = 0.007 mg L-1; r(boot)(2) = 0.466; RMSEboot = 0.010 mg L-1). Other variables, including pH (r(2) = 0.702; RMSE = 0.208; r(boot)(2) = 0.485; RMSEboot = 0.234), TN (r(2) = 0.574; RMSE = 0.0899 mg L-1; r(boot)(2) = 0.380; RMSEboot = 0.127 mg L-1) and MaxZ (r(2) = 0.554; RMSE = 1.05 m; r(boot)(2) = 0.380; RMSEboot = 1.490 m), were also strong, indicating that they may also be reconstructed from fossil diatom communities. This study shows that it is possible to reliably infer lakewater TP and other limnological variables in alkaline Southern Ontario lakes using the WA technique. This method has the potential to aid rehabilitation programs, as it can provide water quality managers with the means to estimate pre-enrichment phosphorus concentrations and an indication of the onset and development of nutrient enrichment in a lake.

AB 1. We wanted to determine if changes in algae in the Everglades were due to increased phosphorus (P) loading. Epiphytic algae, water chemistry, and surface sediment chemistry were characterized from 32 sloughs along a P gradient in the Everglades and changes in the algal assemblages along the P gradient were compared with those along an experimental P gradient of in situ mesocosms. The sloughs are the wettest open water habitats characterized by floating and submerged aquatic plants in the Everglades.
   2. Algal species composition was much more sensitive to P concentration than algal biomass. The diatom species variance among sloughs, captured by 1st ordination axis, was more highly correlated with total P (TP) in surface sediments (r = -0.79), than soluble reactive P (SRP) (r = -0.08) and TP (r = -0.48) in the water column. Algal biomass (mu g chl a cm(-2)) was not significantly correlated with P (SRP: r = 0.22, TP: r = 0.19, sediment TP: r = 0.07) along the P gradient in the Everglades. Cluster analysis classified diatom species assemblages in 32 doughs into three groups (TWIN I, II, III), which corresponded to three zones along the P gradient. Dominant diatom species shifted from Mastogloia smithii (40.3%), Cymbella scotica (22.3%), and Fragilaria synegrotesca (21.8%) in TWIN I to Nitzschia amphibia (22.4%) and C. microcephala (12.4%) in TWIN III. TP in surface sediments and TP in epiphyton assemblages increased 4- and 5-fold from TWIN I to TWIN III, respectively.
   3. Patterns in epiphytic assemblages along the experimental P gradient in the mesocosms were very similar to those along the Everglades P gradient. Shannon diversity indices and species richness significantly increased along both P gradients. TN : TP ratio in epiphyton assemblages significantly decreased as sediment TP increased along both P gradient. Ordination analysis showed that diatom assemblages in the impacted zone (TWIN III) were ordinated closely to the assemblages from the highest P treatments in the mesocosms. The assemblages from the less impacted zone (TWIN I) were ordinated closely to the assemblages from controls in the mesocosms.
   4. Concurrence between results of our survey and experiments suggest that changes in epiphytic assemblages along the P gradient in the Everglades are caused by increases in P concentrations.

AB We studied revegetation patterns after experimental fine-scale disturbance (e.g. uprooting) in an old-growth Picea abies forest in southeastern Norway. An experimental severity gradient was established by manipulation of the depth of soil disturbance; two types of disturbed areas were used. Species recovery was recorded in the disturbed patches in three successive years after disturbance. The cover of vascular plants and, even more so the cover of bryophytes and Lichens, recovered slowly after disturbance. The least severe treatments (removal of vegetation and removal of vegetation and the litter layer) was followed by the fastest recovery. The mean number of vascular plant species was usually higher three years after disturbance than before disturbance, while the opposite was true for bryophytes. Several vascular plant species that were abundant in intact forest floor vegetation (Vaccinium myrtillus, V. vitis-idaea and Deschampsia flexuosa) recovered during a three-year period primarily by resprouting from intact rhizomes and clonal in-growth. Other important recovery mechanisms included germination from a soil-buried propagule bank (e.g. Luzula pilosa, Plagiathecium laetum agg., Pohlia nutans and Polytrichum spp.) and dispersal of propagules into the disturbed patches (e.g. Betula pubescens and Picea abies). Microsite limitation seemed to occur in several species that were abundant in the soil propagule bank (e.g. the ferns Athyrium filix-femina, Gymnocarpium dryopteris and Phegopteris connectilis) but which did not appear in disturbed patches.
   Disturbance severity influenced revegetation patterns, recorded both as trajectories of vegetation composit-ion in a DCA ordination space and as change in floristic dissimilarity. The length of the successional path (compositional change measured in beta-diversity units) increased with increasing disturbance severity, and was also influenced by the area of the disturbed patch and the distance to intact vegetation. The rate of succession depended on the method by which it was measured; decreasing year by year in floristic space, while first decreasing and then increasing in ordination space. The reason for this difference is explained.

AB Early-successional vegetation is often a major factor that limits recovery of tropical forest in abandoned pastures by outcompeting seedlings of forest trees. The goal of this study was to compare the effects of above- and below-ground competition of pasture grasses and shrubs on the growth of tree seedlings in abandoned tropical pasture in Costa Rica. Seedlings of Calophyllum brasiliense were planted in areas of dense pasture grass and below shrub patches. In each vegetation type seedlings were subjected to one of four treatments: control, root trenching, above-ground clearing, or trenching and clearing. Seedling height was measured and above- and below-ground biomass was harvested after one year. Seedling height and biomass were higher for seedlings grown under grass than under shrubs. Above-ground clearing had a strong positive effect an seedling height and all biomass measurements (stem, leaves, tap root, and fine roots). Trenching had a significant effect on height and all biomass measurements except tap root mass; however, trenching had a weaker effect on plant growth than above-ground clearing. Root:shoot ratios were significantly affected by trenching. These results suggest that both pasture grasses and early-colonizing shrubs may slow succession of forest in abandoned pasture. Moreover, the results highlight the importance of reducing above-ground competition to improve the success of reforestation efforts. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Several studies have documented elevated rates of nest predation for passerines and grouse in small forest patches and near anthropogenic edges. We examined patterns of predation on artificial nests in aspen (Populus tremuloides) woodlots and fencerows surrounded by agricultural land in Alberta. Nests were intended to mimic those of ground-nesting grouse and shrub-nesting passerines. We evaluated the relative importance of factors at the nest site, the forest patch, and the landscape to risk of nest predation by different predators. Total predation rates were highest in fencerows. Among woodlots, predation rates did not differ with woodlot area except in 1992, when predation on ground nests was higher in large woodlots. Most shrub nests were depredated by birds (corvids and House Wrens [Troglodytes aedon]). Corvid predation on shrub nests was higher in smaller woodlots and was highest on nests closest to the woodlot edge. Predation by small mammals was highest in larger woodlots and woodlots closer to farms and showed no edge effect. House Wren predation of shrub nests did not vary by any woodlot feature, nest cover, or distance to edge. We suggest that corvids forage mainly at the edges of forest patches and can fully penetrate small patches and fencerows. Small mammals are present in all woodlots, but avian predators take the eggs in small woodlots before they are detected by small mammals. Nest predators living within woodlots, such as wrens and small mammals, may be equally or more important than those living outside of woodlots in determining nest-predation risk for birds in woodlots.

AB Previous studies of avian nest predation have focused on how human-induced changes in the landscape influence the frequency of predation. However, natural variation in the abundance of predators due to their choice of habitat can also influence predation rate. To determine if predation on artificial nests was influenced by forest stand type, we placed ground and shrub nests containing quail and plasticine eggs in contiguous coniferous, mixedwood and deciduous stands in the southern boreal mixedwood forest of central Canada. Nest predators were identified using remotely triggered cameras and marks left in plasticine eggs, while the relative abundance of nest predators such as squirrels and corvids were estimated using acoustic-visual surveys. Using the fate of quail eggs to calculate predation rate, we found that predation was significantly higher in coniferous (67%) than in deciduous (17%) or mixedwood (25%) forest, with similar predation on ground (37%) and shrub (29%) nests. Using plasticine eggs to calculate predation rate, nests in coniferous forest still suffered higher rates of predation, although predation rates were 15-20% higher, and ground nests suffered significantly higher rates of predation than shrub nests. Quail eggs seemed to suffer lower rates of predation because small mammals were unable to penetrate the shell, but could leave marks on plasticine eggs. The higher predation rate in coniferous forest war likely caused by higher abundance of red squirrels Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, the presence of fishers Martes pennanti and a simplified understory which may have made it easier for predators to find nests relative to the deciduous and mixedwood forest. Plasticine eggs provide new insights into nest predation by identifying predation events by smaller predators such as mice that are missed when using quail eggs.

AB Understorey vegetation changes in a South Norwegian old-growth coniferous forest were studied between 1988 and 1993 in 200 1-m(2) vegetation plots. Our aims were to quantify the amount of between-year compositional change, and to elaborate the environmental basis for long-term vegetation change, including the previously identified gradient structure with a major gradient related to topography (and soil nutrient status and soil depth) and a minor gradient reflecting paludification and canopy coverage.
   Species richness (yearly mean and cumulative species number) and change in species richness differed between vascular plants and cryptogams, and between forest types. The number of vascular plant species decreased in pine forest in dry years; bryophyte species number increased in spruce forest.
   Statistically significant vegetation change, as tested by constrained ordination (CCA) with time as the constraining variable, is demonstrated for most one-year periods and for the five-year period in most forest types. Vegetation change along identified gradients, measured as plot displacement along DCA ordination axes, also occurred. The magnitude of year-to-year vegetation change was related neither to forest type nor to one-year period; different responses to climatic and environmental change were observed in each forest type. The largest average displacement observed, from medium-rich spruce forest towards poor spruce forest, was interpreted as a long-term trend. Humus-layer pH decreased by ca. 0.25 units from 1988 to 1993, most strongly in medium-rich spruce forest where exchangeable Ca decreased and Al and Mn increased strongly.
   Our study supports the hypothesis that vascular plants show a long-term and broad-scale response to soil acidification. Change in bryophyte composition is linked to some very long growing-seasons. Detailed analysis of short-term vegetation dynamics enhances the interpretation of long-term changes and stresses the complementarity of univariate and multivariate methods in the analysis of vegetation change.

AB To understand the functioning and ecological roles of ectomycorrhizal fungi in natural ecosystems, it is necessary to have adequate knowledge of the spatial distribution of individual mycelial systems in populations and communities and how this distribution may persist or vary with time. However, this issue has attracted relatively little attention until recently. Moreover, the limited information available is mostly based on the distribution of sporocarps, which is at best an unreliable indicator of the location and activity of mycelia. More useful information can be obtained using somatic and sexual incompatibility tests, as well as molecular markers to trace the distribution of individual genets over a range of spatial and temporal scales. For example, it has been possible using this approach to demonstrate that while young populations tend to consist of numerous small mycelia, individuals in older populations tend to be fewer and larger but heterogeneous in scale. It has also been possible to verify the persistence over several years of mycorrhizal mycelial individuals. Such findings represent only the first step in the study of the spatiotemporal dynamics of ectomycorrhizal fungi, which promises to be a rich and important field for future research. Concepts concerning the process and mechanisms likely to affect distribution patterns are discussed.

AB 1 Pathogens are assumed to maintain high genetic diversity and the need for sexual reproduction in plants by continually reducing the fitness of genotypes that become dominant in a population. If this were true, a mixed stand should perform better than the average pure stand of the same plant genotypes. To test this hypothesis I deliberately created thirty-two 16-shoot stands of different genetic diversity of Solidago altissima, a plant species which in the field can form mono- or polyclonal patches, and allowed natural infestations by the mildew Erysiphe cichoracearum to occur.
   2 Preliminary experiments revealed significant genetic variation in the source population of S. altissima with regard to pathogen level. However, the pattern of this variation changed between years, indicating that different strains of E. cichoracearum were dominant at different times.
   3 In the main experiment pathogen levels at the beginning tended to be higher in more diverse than in less diverse plant stands. As the growing season progressed, levels of E. cichoracearum became higher in the genetically less diverse than in the genetically more diverse stands.
   4 Despite the effects on pathogen level, genetic diversity did not significantly influence mean plant performance per stand (height growth and biomass at harvest). However, individual plant performance and pathogen level were positively correlated with each other at low levels of E. cichoracearum and negatively correlated at higher levels. Small plants possibly were in a phenological condition of low susceptibility to pathogen attack. The proportion of above-ground biomass allocated to leaves steadily decreased with increasing pathogen level.
   5 The present study suggests that small-scale genetic diversity in the perennial plant Solidago altissima can influence pathogen levels which in turn may affect plant performance and ultimately fitness. I suggest that selection pressures exerted by plant pathogens may play a major role not only in the maintenance of sexual reproduction but also in the maintenance of lateral clonal growth that leads to a mixing of genotypes in polyclonal patches within plant populations and communities.

TI A BIRD-HABITAT CODING SYSTEM FOR USE IN BRITAIN AND IRELAND
   INCORPORATING ASPECTS OF LAND-MANAGEMENT AND HUMAN ACTIVITY
SO BIRD STUDY
LA English
DT Article
AB A classification system for coding the habitats of British and Irish birds has been designed for use in 'extensive' ecological studies, i.e. where data are contributed by many observers.  The system is based mainly on the vegetation structure of habitats and requires no expert botanical knowledge.  It has advantages over several existing habitat classifications because it embraces agricultural and man-made sites as well as semi-natural ones, and it also includes aspects of land-management and human activity.  The system described in this paper has, however, been designed to be as fully compatible as possible with other widely-used classifications.  It has been implemented within the BTO Nest Record Scheme and its use will be extended throughout the BTO's Integrated Population Monitoring Programme.

AB 1. The immigration and rise to dominance of Picea abies within Fiby Forest, Sweden, was investigated by pollen and charcoal analysis of tiny (c.1-m2) bogs which contained a 4000-year record.
   2. A mixed deciduous forest that existed 4000 years ago was replaced in a stepwise manner by a boreal community. The detailed dynamics of the changeover were controlled by catastrophic disturbances 2500 and 2200 years ago.
   3. Two long periods of disturbance by burning and grazing kept the woodland open in structure. Eventual abandonment of this management practice initiated a succession that resulted in the present dominance of Picea, over 2000 years after its immigration into Fiby.
   4. A model is presented describing the role of disturbance in facilitating the response of vegetation to climatic change.

AB In the broad sense, the Bayesian networks (BN) are probabilistic graphical models that possess unique methodical features to model dependencies in complex networks, such as forward and backward propagation (inference) of disruptions. BNs have transitioned from an emerging topic to a growing research area in supply chain (SC) resilience and risk analysis. As a result, there is an acute need to review existing literature to ascertain recent developments and uncover future areas of research. Despite the increasing number of publications on BNs in the domain of SC uncertainty, an extensive review on their application to SC risk and resilience is lacking. To address this gap, we analyzed research articles published in peer-reviewed academic journals from 2007 to 2019 using network analysis, visualization-based scientometric analysis, and clustering analysis. Through this study, we contribute to literature by discussing the challenges of current research, and, more importantly, identifying and proposing future research directions. The results of our survey show that further debate on the theory and application of BNs to SC resilience and risk management is a significant area of interest for both academics and practitioners. The applications of BNs, and their conjunction with machine learning algorithms to solve big data SC problems relating to uncertainty and risk, are also discussed. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Stomata, the microvalves on leaf surfaces, exert major influences across scales, from plant growth and productivity to global carbon and water cycling. Stomatal opening enables leaf photosynthesis, and plant growth and water use, whereas plant survival of drought depends on stomatal closure. Here we report that stomatal function is constrained by a safety-efficiency trade- off, such that species with greater stomatal conductance under high water availability ( g(max)) show greater sensitivity to closure during leaf dehydration, i.e., a higher leaf water potential at which stomatal conductance is reduced by 50% (Psi(gs50)). The gmax - Psi(gs50) trade- off and its mechanistic basis is supported by experiments on leaves of California woody species, and in analyses of previous studies of the responses of diverse flowering plant species around the world. Linking the two fundamental key roles of stomata the enabling of gas exchange, and the first defense against drought-this trade-off constrains the rates of water use and the drought sensitivity of leaves, with potential impacts on ecosystems.

AB Home range estimation is routine practice in ecological research. While advances in animal tracking technology have increased our capacity to collect data to support home range analysis, these same advances have also resulted in increasingly autocorrelated data. Consequently, the question of which home range estimator to use on modern, highly autocorrelated tracking data remains open. This question is particularly relevant given that most estimators assume independently sampled data. Here, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of autocorrelation on home range estimation. We base our study on an extensive data set of GPS locations from 369 individuals representing 27 species distributed across five continents. We first assemble a broad array of home range estimators, including Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) with four bandwidth optimizers (Gaussian reference function, autocorrelated-Gaussian reference function [AKDE], Silverman's rule of thumb, and least squares cross-validation), Minimum Convex Polygon, and Local Convex Hull methods. Notably, all of these estimators except AKDE assume independent and identically distributed (IID) data. We then employ half-sample cross-validation to objectively quantify estimator performance, and the recently introduced effective sample size for home range area estimation ((N) over cap (area)) to quantify the information content of each data set. We found that AKDE 95% area estimates were larger than conventional IID-based estimates by a mean factor of 2. The median number of cross-validated locations included in the hold-out sets by AKDE 95% (or 50%) estimates was 95.3% (or 50.1%), confirming the larger AKDE ranges were appropriately selective at the specified quantile. Conversely, conventional estimates exhibited negative bias that increased with decreasing (N) over cap (area). To contextualize our empirical results, we performed a detailed simulation study to tease apart how sampling frequency, sampling duration, and the focal animal's movement conspire to affect range estimates. Paralleling our empirical results, the simulation study demonstrated that AKDE was generally more accurate than conventional methods, particularly for small (N) over cap (area). While 72% of the 369 empirical data sets had >1,000 total observations, only 4% had an (N) over cap (area) >1,000, where 30% had an (N) over cap (area) <30. In this frequently encountered scenario of small <(N)over cap>(area), AKDE was the only estimator capable of producing an accurate home range estimate on autocorrelated data.

AB Effects of biochars on soil silicon dissolution kinetics remain unaddressed. Si-rich rice husk (RH) and rice straw (RS), and Si-deficient wood sawdust (WB) and orange peel (OP) were applied to prepare biochars at 300-700 degrees C. The silicon dissolution of Si-rich biochars was relatively high in comparison with Si-deficient biochars, and increased with the pyrolysis temperature. The mechanism of silicon release is suggested to be controlled by a protective carbon-silicon interaction, as accompanied by carbon release. After mixing with soil, the addition of Si-rich biochar leads up to 72.7-121% improvement in silicon dissolution in a high-silicon soil (HSS) compared to 147-243% improvement in a low-silicon soil (LSS). The total cumulative amount of silicon dissolved decreased compared to the theoretical value due to the adsorption of silicic acid by the biochar. The addition of WB700 or OP700 as Si-deficient biochars leads to a cumulative Si dissolution decrease of 15.7 and 12.1%, respectively. The adsorption of silicic acid in the biochar and the protection of soil dissolved Fe make biochar a reservoir of soil silicon. Thus, Si-rich biochar could serve as a source of Si with slow release, while Si-deficient biochar could serve as an extra Si sink in agricultural paddy soil.

AB 1. Cover crop mixtures with complementary plant functional traits including biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) may supply nitrogen (N) to farm fields while simultaneously providing other ecosystem functions such as N retention and weed suppression (i.e., multifunctionality). Understanding variation in these relationships across farms can help advance trait-based research in agroecology and ecological approaches to nutrient management.
   2. This on-farm experiment explored the contributions of two-and three-species cover crop mixtures, which combined legumes, brassicas and cool season grasses, to ecosystem functions across a gradient of soil fertility levels driven by farm management history.
   3. I evaluated the predictions that functional trait diversity of the cover crops would explain variation in multifunctionality, and that legume biomass and BNF within mixtures would be inversely correlated with indicators of soil N availability from organic matter across the farm gradient.
   4. Ecosystem functions varied widely across farms. As expected, functional diversity was a significant predictor of multifunctionality, although the relationship was weak. Cover crop mixtures had significantly greater multifunctionality than a cereal rye monoculture, though not at the highest observed levels of each function, indicating trade-offs among functions. Linear regression models showed that legume biomass and BNF were negatively correlated with soil properties indicative of N availability from soil organic matter, whereas non-legume and weed biomass were positively correlated with other measures of soil fertility.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Cover crop mixtures can increase functional diversity within crop rotations. Designing mixtures with complementary plant traits may be particularly effective for increasing multifunctionality and agroecosystem sustainability. On-farm research to understand variation in biological nitrogen fixation, which is both a plant trait and a key ecosystem function, across heterogeneous soil conditions, can inform management of soil fertility based on ecological principles.

AB PastureBase Ireland (PBI) is a web-based grassland management application incorporating a dual function of grassland decision support and a centralized national database to collate commercial farm grassland data. This database facilitates the collection and storage of vast quantities of grassland data from grassland farmers. The database spans across ruminant grassland enterprises - dairy, beef and sheep. To help farmers determine appropriate actions around grassland management, we have developed this data informed decision support tool to function at the paddock level. Individual farmers enter data through the completion of regular pasture cover estimations across the farm, allowing the performance of individual paddocks to be evaluated within and across years. To evaluate the PBI system, we compared actual pasture cut experimental data (Etesia cuts) to FBI calculated outputs. We examined three comparisons, comparing FBI outputs to actual pasture cut data, for individual DM yields at defoliation (Comparison 1), for cumulative annual DM yields including silage data (Comparison 2) and, for cumulative annual DM yields excluding silage data (Comparison 3). We found an acceptable accuracy between PBI outputs and pasture cut data when statistically analyzed using relative prediction error and concordance correlation coefficients for the measurement of total annual DM yield (Comparison 2), with a relative prediction error of 15.4% and a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.85. We demonstrated an application of the PBI system through analysis of commercial farm data across two years (2014-2015) for 75 commercial farms who actively use the system. The analysis showed there was a significant increase in DM yield from 2014 to 2015. The results indicated a greater variation in pasture growth across paddocks within farms than across farms.

AB Long paleoecological records are critical for understanding evolutionary responses to environmental forcing and unparalleled tools for elucidating the mechanisms that lead to the development of regions of high biodiversity. We use a 1.2-My record from Lake Malawi, a textbook example of biological diversification, to document how climate and tectonics have driven ecosystem and evolutionary dynamics. Before similar to 800 ka, Lake Malawi was much shallower than today, with higher frequency but much lower amplitude water-level and oxygenation changes. Since similar to 800 ka, the lake has experienced much larger environmental fluctuations, best explained by a punctuated, tectonically driven rise in its outlet location and level. Following the reorganization of the basin, a change in the pacing of hydroclimate variability associated with the Mid-Pleistocene Transition resulted in hydrologic change dominated by precession rather than the high-latitude teleconnections recorded elsewhere. During this time, extended, deep lake phases have abruptly alternated with times of extreme aridity and ecosystem variability. Repeated crossings of hydroclimatic thresholds within the lake system were critical for establishing the rhythm of diversification, hybridization, and extinction that dominate the modern system. The chronology of these changes closely matches both the timing and pattern of phylogenetic history inferred independently for the lake's extraordinary array of cichlid fish species, suggesting a direct link between environmental and evolutionary dynamics.

AB High-density aquaculture has led to increasing occurrences of diseases in shrimp. Thus, it is imperative to establish effective and quantitative strategies for preventing and predicting these diseases. Water quality indices and investigations of specific pathogen abundance provide only a qualitative evaluation of the risk of shrimp disease and can be inaccurate. To address these shortcomings, we introduced intestinal indicative assemblages as independent variables with which to quantitatively predict incidences of shrimp disease. Given the ignorance regarding the niches differences in the shrimp intestine throughout its developmental stages, the use of probiotics in aquaculture has had limited success. Therefore, we propose the exploration of effective probiotic bacteria from shrimp intestinal flora and the establishment of therapeutic strategies dependent on shrimp age. Following ecological selection principles, we hypothesize that the larval stage provides the best opportunity to establish a desired gut microbiota through preemptive colonization of the treated rearing water with known probiotics. To employ this strategy, however, substantial barriers must be overcome.

AB Mitonuclear discordance across taxa is increasingly recognized as posing a major challenge to species delimitation based on DNA sequence data. Integrative taxonomy has been proposed as a promising framework to help address this problem. However, we still lack compelling empirical evidence scrutinizing the efficacy of integrative taxonomy in relation to, for instance, complex introgression scenarios involving many species. Here, we report remarkably widespread mitonuclear discordance between about 15 mitochondrial and 4 nuclear Brachionus calyciflorus groups identified using different species delimitation approaches. Using coalescent-, Bayesian admixture-, and allele sharing-based methods with DNA sequence or microsatellite data, we provide strong evidence in support of hybridization as a driver of the observed discordance. We then describe our combined molecular, morphological, and ecological approaches to resolving phylogenetic conflict and inferring species boundaries. Species delimitations based on the ITS1 and 28S nuclear DNA markers proved a more reliable predictor of morphological variation than delimitations using the mitochondrial COI gene. A short-term competition experiment further revealed systematic differences in the competitive ability between two of the nuclear-delimited species under six different growth conditions, independent of COI delimitations; hybrids were also observed. In light of these findings, we discuss the failure of the COI marker to estimate morphological stasis and morphological plasticity in the B. calyciflorus complex. By using B. calyciflorus as a representative case, we demonstrate the potential of integrative taxonomy to guide species delimitation in the presence of mitonuclear phylogenetic conflicts.

AB Unraveling the genetic basis of organismal form and function remains one of the major goals of evolutionary biology. Theory has long supported a model of polygenic evolution in which quantitative traits are underpinned by many genes of small effect, but empirical methods have lacked the power to detect causative loci when effect sizes are small or moderate. We (i) review traditional approaches used for identifying the molecular basis of phenotypic traits, to highlight the inherent problems and pitfalls that bias them towards the detection of large-effect loci. We then (ii) outline the promises of recent statistical frameworks to detect polygenic signatures of trait evolution, and discuss some of the first studies in evolutionary biology employing these approaches. Lastly, we (iii) outline future directions and point to areas that still need development.

AB Symbiotic interactions between insects and microorganisms are widespread in nature and are often the source of ecological innovations. In addition to supplementing their host with essential nutrients, microbial symbionts can produce enzymes that help degrade their food source as well as small molecules that defend against pathogens, parasites, and predators. As such, the study of insect ecology and symbiosis represents an important source of chemical compounds and enzymes with potential biotechnological value. In addition, the knowledge on insect symbiosis can provide novel avenues for the control of agricultural pest insects and vectors of human diseases, through targeted manipulation of the symbionts or the host-symbiont associations. Here, we discuss different insect-microbe interactions that can be exploited for insect pest and human disease control, as well as in human medicine and industrial processes. Our aim is to raise awareness that insect symbionts can be interesting sources of biotechnological applications and that knowledge on insect ecology can guide targeted efforts to discover microorganisms of applied value.

AB Ecological communities often transition from phylogenetic and functional clustering to overdispersion over succession as judged by space-for-time substitution studies. Such a pattern has been generally attributed to the increase in competitive exclusion of closely related species with similar traits through time, although colonisation and extinction have rarely been examined. Using 44 years of uninterrupted old-field succession in New Jersey, USA, we confirmed that phylogenetic and functional clustering decreased as succession unfolded, but the transition was largely driven by colonisation. Early colonists were closely related and functionally similar to residents, while later colonists became less similar to the species present. Extirpated species were generally more distantly related to residents than by chance, or exhibited random phylogenetic/functional patterns, and their relatedness to residents was not associated with time. These results provide direct evidence that the colonisation of distant relatives, rather than extinction of close relatives, drives phylogenetic and functional overdispersion over succession.

AB Maternally inherited bacterial symbionts are present in many, if not most, insect species. While there is rapidly accumulating evidence that facultative, heritable symbionts often protect insect hosts from natural enemies, there have been few clear examples where facultative symbionts mediate herbivore-plant interactions. The phloem-feeding whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, is a major agricultural pest that frequently harbours facultative symbionts, including Hamiltonella defensa. While H.defensa and other facultative symbionts have been shown to improve whitefly performance on particular food plants, no direct and specific roles for symbiont-mediated interactions with food plants have been identified. Here, we conducted a series of assays to determine whether infection with H.defensa improved whitefly performance on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and whether this benefit was associated with symbiont effects on induced plant defences. Finally, we tested whether impacts on induced defences involved in the modulation of a salivary factor. The downregulation of plant defences was associated with increased whitefly fecundity and survival. Feeding by H.defensa-infected whiteflies suppressed JA and JA-related anti-herbivore-induced defences in tomato relative to uninfected controls. That saliva-only treatments of damaged tomato leaves from H.defensa-infected whiteflies suppressed induced plant defences compared to saliva from uninfected controls, suggesting that elicitors in saliva were responsible. Characterization of the putative salivary factor(s) revealed they are likely small (< 3-kDa) and nonproteinaceous. Interestingly, suppression of defences was not observed in SA-deficient NahG plants, indicating that suppression of JA-regulated defences depends on the SA signalling pathway. This finding reveals an intriguing example of the crosstalk between SA and JA signalling pathways and suggests that infection with facultative symbionts can result in the manipulation of induced plant defences to the benefit of the insect host and heritable symbiont. Our results show that the bacterial symbiont H.defensa mediates whitefly-plant interactions by suppressing induced plant defences in tomato. This finding is among the first showing a direct role for facultative symbionts in mediating plant-herbivore interactions and demonstrates a novel tactic for insect herbivores to circumvent plant defences. Symbiont-mediated suppression of plant defences may enhance the deleterious effects of insect pests feeding on important crops.

AB Objective To examine patterns of microbial colonization of the respiratory and intestinal tracts in early life in infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) and their associations with breastfeeding and clinical outcomes.
   Study design A comprehensive, prospective longitudinal analysis of the upper respiratory and intestinal microbiota in a cohort of infants and young children with CF followed from birth was performed. Genus-level microbial community composition was characterized using 16S-targeted pyrosequencing, and relationships with exposures and outcomes were assessed using linear mixed-effects models, time-to-event analysis, and principal components analysis.
   Results Sequencing of 120 samples from 13 subjects collected from birth to 34 months revealed relationships between breastfeeding, microbial diversity in the respiratory and intestinal tracts, and the timing of onset of respiratory complications, including exacerbations and colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fluctuations in the abundance of specific bacterial taxa preceded clinical outcomes, including a significant decrease in bacteria of the genus Parabacteroides within the intestinal tract prior to the onset of chronic P aeruginosa colonization. Specific assemblages of bacteria in intestinal samples, but not respiratory samples, were associated with CF exacerbation in early life, indicating that the intestinal microbiome may play a role in lung health.
   Conclusions Our findings relating breastfeeding to respiratory outcomes, gut diversity to prolonged periods of health, and specific bacterial communities in the gut prior to respiratory complications in CF highlight a connection between the intestinal microbiome and health and point to potential opportunities for antibiotic or probiotic interventions. Further studies in larger cohorts validating these findings are needed.

AB To investigate the distances at which honey bee foragers collect nectar and pollen, we analysed 5,484 decoded waggle dances made to natural forage sites to determine monthly foraging distance for each forage type. Firstly, we found significantly fewer overall dances made for pollen (16.8 %) than for non-pollen, presumably nectar (83.2 %; P < 2.2 x 10(-23)). When we analysed distance against month and forage type, there was a significant interaction between the two factors, which demonstrates that in some months, one forage type is collected at farther distances, but this would reverse in other months. Overall, these data suggest that distance, as a proxy for forage availability, is not significantly and consistently driven by need for one type of forage over the other.

AB The extent of Dipterocarp rainforests on the emergent Sundaland landmass in Southeast Asia during Quaternary glaciations remains a key question. A better understanding of the biogeographic history of Sundaland could help explain current patterns of biodiversity and support the development of effective forest conservation strategies. Dipterocarpaceae trees dominate the rainforests of Sundaland, and their distributions serve as a proxy for rainforest extent. We used species distribution models (SDMs) of 317 Dipterocarp species to estimate the geographic extent of appropriate climatic conditions for rainforest on Sundaland at the last glacial maximum (LGM). The SDMs suggest that the climate of central Sundaland at the LGM was suitable to sustain Dipterocarp rainforest, and that the presence of a previously suggested transequatorial savannah corridor at that time is unlikely. Our findings are supported by palynologic evidence, dynamic vegetation models, extant mammal and termite communities, vascular plant fatty acid stable isotopic compositions, and stable carbon isotopic compositions of cave guano profiles. Although Dipterocarp species richness was generally lower at the LGM, areas of high species richness were mostly found off the current islands and on the emergent Sunda Shelf, indicating substantial species migration and mixing during the transitions between the Quaternary glacial maxima and warm periods such as the present.

AB Despite the global trend in urbanization, little is known about patterns of biodiversity or provisioning of ecosystem services in urban areas. Bee communities and the pollination services they provide are important in cities, both for small-scale urban agriculture and native gardens. To better understand this important ecological issue, we examined bee communities, their response to novel floral resources, and their potential to provide pollination services in 25 neighborhoods across Chicago, IL (USA). In these neighborhoods, we evaluated how local floral resources, socioeconomic factors, and surrounding land cover affected abundance, richness, and community composition of bees active in summer. We also quantified species-specific body pollen loads and visitation frequencies to potted flowering purple coneflower plants (Echinacea purpurea) to estimate potential pollination services in each neighborhood. We documented 37 bee species and 79 flowering plant genera across all neighborhoods, with 8 bee species and 14 flowering plant genera observed on average along each neighborhood block. We found that both bee abundance and richness increased in neighborhoods with higher human population density, as did visitation to purple coneflower flower heads. In more densely populated neighborhoods, bee communities shifted to a suite of species that carry more pollen and are more active pollinators in this system, including the European honey bee (Apis mellifera) and native species such as Agapostemon virescens. More densely populated neighborhoods also had a greater diversity of flowering plants, suggesting that the positive relationship between people and bees was mediated by the effect of people on floral resources. Other environmental variables that were important for bee communities included the amount of grass/herbaceous cover and solar radiation in the surrounding area. Our results indicate that bee communities and pollination services can be maintained in dense urban neighborhoods with single-family and multi-family homes, as long as those neighborhoods contain diverse and abundant floral resources.

AB 1. Wildlife scientists continue to be interested in studying ways to quantify how the movements of animals are interdependent - dynamic interaction. While a number of applied studies of dynamic interaction exist, little is known about the comparative effectiveness and applicability of available methods used for quantifying interactions between animals.
   2. We highlight the formulation, implementation and interpretation of a suite of eight currently available indices of dynamic interaction. Point-and path-based approaches are contrasted to demonstrate differences between methods and underlying assumptions on telemetry data.
   3. Correlated and biased correlated random walks were simulated at a range of sampling resolutions to generate scenarios with dynamic interaction present and absent. We evaluate the effectiveness of each index at identifying different types of interactive behaviour at each sampling resolution. Each index is then applied to an empirical telemetry data set of three whitetailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) dyads.
   4. Results from the simulated data show that three indices of dynamic interaction reliant on statistical testing procedures are susceptible to Type I error, which increases at fine sampling resolutions. In the white-tailed deer examples, a recently developed index for quantifying local-level cohesive movement behaviour (the di index) provides revealing information on the presence of infrequent and varying interactions in space and time.
   5. Point-based approaches implemented with finely sampled telemetry data overestimate the presence of interactions (Type I errors). Indices producing only a single global statistic (7 of the 8 indices) are unable to quantify infrequent and varying interactions through time. The quantification of infrequent and variable interactive behaviour has important implications for the spread of disease and the prevalence of social behaviour in wildlife. Guidelines are presented to inform researchers wishing to study dynamic interaction patterns in their own telemetry data sets. Finally, we make our code openly available, in the statistical software R, for computing each index of dynamic interaction presented herein.

AB Transpiration may enhance mass-flow of nutrients to roots, especially in low-nutrient soils or where the root system is not extensively developed. Previous work suggested that nitrogen (N) may regulate mass-flow of nutrients. Experiments were conducted to determine whether N regulates water fluxes, and whether this regulation has a functional role in controlling the mass-flow of nutrients to roots. Phaseolus vulgaris were grown in troughs designed to create an N availability gradient by restricting roots from intercepting a slow-release N source, which was placed at one of six distances behind a 25 m mesh from which nutrients could move by diffusion or mass-flow (termed mass-flow treatment). Control plants had the N source supplied directly to their root zone so that N was available through interception, mass-flow, and diffusion (termed interception treatment). Mass-flow plants closest to the N source exhibited 2.9-fold higher transpiration (E), 2.6-fold higher stomatal conductance (g(s)), 1.2-fold higher intercellular [CO2] (C-i), and 3.4-fold lower water use efficiency than interception plants, despite comparable values of photosynthetic rate (A). E, g(s), and C-i first increased and then decreased with increasing distance from the N source to values even lower than those of interception plants. Mass-flow plants accumulated phosphorus and potassium, and had maximum concentrations at 10mm from the N source. Overall, N availability regulated transpiration-driven mass-flow of nutrients from substrate zones that were inaccessible to roots. Thus when water is available, mass-flow may partially substitute for root density in providing access to nutrients without incurring the costs of root extension, although the efficacy of mass-flow also depends on soil nutrient retention and hydraulic properties.

AB The ability of females to adaptively influence offspring phenotype via maternal effects is widely acknowledged, but corresponding nongenetic paternal effects remain unexplored. Males can adjust sperm phenotype in response to local conditions, but the transgenerational consequences of this plasticity are unknown. We manipulated paternal density of a broadcast spawner (Styela plicata, a solitary ascidean) using methods shown previously to alter sperm phenotype in the field, then conducted in vitro fertilizations that excluded maternal effects and estimated offspring performance under natural conditions. Offspring sired by males from low-density experimental populations developed faster and had a higher hatching success than offspring sired by males living in high densities. In the field, offspring survived relatively better when their environment matched their father's, raising the possibility that fathers can adaptively influence the phenotype of their offspring according to local conditions. As the only difference between offspring is whether they were artificially fertilized by sperm from males kept in high- vs. low-density cages, we can unequivocally attribute any differences in offspring performance to an environmentally induced paternal effect. Males of many species manipulate the phenotype of their sperm in response to sperm competition: our results show this plasticity can influence offspring fitness, potentially in adaptive ways, raising the possibility that adaptive nongenetic paternal effects may be more common than previously thought.

AB The rate at which genomes diverge during speciation is unknown, as are the physical dynamics of the process. Here, we compare full genome sequences of 32 butterflies, representing five species from a hybridizing Heliconius butterfly community, to examine genome-wide patterns of introgression and infer how divergence evolves during the speciation process. Our analyses reveal that initial divergence is restricted to a small fraction of the genome, largely clustered around known wing-patterning genes. Over time, divergence evolves rapidly, due primarily to the origin of new divergent regions. Furthermore, divergent genomic regions display signatures of both selection and adaptive introgression, demonstrating the link between microevolutionary processes acting within species and the origin of species across macroevolutionary timescales. Our results provide a uniquely comprehensive portrait of the evolving species boundary due to the role that hybridization plays in reducing the background accumulation of divergence at neutral sites.

AB 1. Our ability to generalize about broad patterns and outcomes of competitive interactions among plants has improved from a better understanding of functional traits. Facilitative interactions among plants also exhibit strong trait-based patterns; however, very little empirical research has addressed the trait basis of different facilitative mechanisms or the applicability of traditionally defined functional strategies to facilitation.
   2. We present a series of predictions regarding the trait basis of a variety of facilitative mechanisms based on empirical patterns of trait responses to environmental filters and knowledge of plant-environment feedbacks.
   3. Using a leaf-height-seed framework to predict plant responses to facilitative effects of neighbours, we identify two categories of facilitative mechanisms based on similar predicted responses of specific leaf area (SLA), height and seed size: (i) facilitation of low-SLA, large-seeded and tall plants in environments typified by periodically unfavourable conditions; and (ii) facilitation of high-SLA, small-seeded and tall plants in persistently severe environments. We suggest that facilitation related to herbivory will be idiosyncratic with respect to these functional traits.
   4. Competition for limiting resources is predicted to reinforce trait-based responses to facilitation in periodically severe environments, particularly under light competition, but to offset facilitative effects to some degree in persistently severe environments. Thus, biotic interactions may have stronger consequences for shifts in trait distributions in environments typified by disturbance, pulsed soil moisture and short growing seasons limited by low temperatures.
   5. Facilitative effects, in addition to facilitative responses, may also be regulated by functional traits, but there is much less empirical evidence for links between functional traits and ameliorative effects on the environment. However, we predict that leaf area index or other integrative traits related to canopy density are likely to be important effect traits for most facilitative mechanisms and should be integrated into more trait-screening programs.
   6. Based on the exceptional contribution that trait-based approaches have made for understanding other interactions, we suggest that taking a functional comparative approach to facilitation is an opportunity to improve our ability to identify general patterns and consequences of positive interactions.

AB Individual-based models (IBMs) are increasingly used to link the dynamics of individuals to higher levels of biological organization. Still, many IBMs are data hungry, species specific, and time-consuming to develop and analyze. Many of these issues would be resolved by using general theories of individual dynamics as the basis for IBMs. While such theories have frequently been examined at the individual level, few cross-level tests exist that also try to predict population dynamics. Here we performed a cross-level test of dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory by parameterizing an individual-based model using individual-level data of the water flea, Daphnia magna, and comparing the emerging population dynamics to independent data from population experiments. We found that DEB theory successfully predicted population growth rates and peak densities but failed to capture the decline phase. Further assumptions on food-dependent mortality of juveniles were needed to capture the population dynamics after the initial population peak. The resulting model then predicted, without further calibration, characteristic switches between small-and large-amplitude cycles, which have been observed for Daphnia. We conclude that cross-level tests help detect gaps in current individual-level theories and ultimately will lead to theory development and the establishment of a generic basis for individual-based models and ecology.

AB The range, variety, or diversity of words found in learners' language use is believed to reflect the complexity of their vocabulary knowledge as well as the level of their language proficiency. Many indices of lexical diversity have been proposed, most of which involve statistical relationships between types and tokens, and which ultimately reflect the rate of word repetition. These indices have generally been validated in accordance with how well they overcome sample-size effects and/or how well they predict language knowledge or behavior, rather than in accordance with how well they actually measure the construct of lexical diversity. In this article, I review developments that have taken place in lexical diversity research, and also describe obstacles that have prevented it from advancing further. I compare these developments with parallel research on biodiversity in the field of ecology, and show what language researchers can learn from ecology regarding the modeling and measurement of diversity as a multidimensional construct of compositional complexity.

AB Questions How does above-ground grassland biomass production respond to change in multiple climate drivers over a 4-yr period? Can climate-induced patterns of biomass response be explained by shifts in plant community structure? Does sustained climate change affect the relationships between abundance of functional groups, community-scale leaf traits and above-ground production?
   Location Perennial grassland in the French Massif Central.
   Methods Monoliths extracted from the study grassland were exposed to a simulated climate change corresponding to the air temperature, atmospheric CO 2 and summer rainfall conditions projected for 2080. We examined impacts of climate treatments on above-ground biomass and community structure for 4 yr, and investigated the relationship between biomass production, species diversity and three key functional traits: specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content and leaf N content.
   Results Both warming and simultaneous application of warming, summer drought and elevated CO 2 were associated with an increase in annual above-ground biomass at the start of the study, but biomass responses became progressively negative over the course of the experiment. Decreases in vegetation N exports were also observed over time, possibly due to reduced soil N availability under climate change. Taxonomic diversity showed no response to climate treatments, but the relative abundance of grasses decreased under both warming and simultaneous application of warming, summer drought and elevated CO 2 after 3 yr. In parallel, legume relative abundance increased in all warmed treatments. Functional diversity responses varied depending on climate treatment and leaf trait. In the control treatment, patterns of variation in annual plant biomass were best explained by functional diversity during the study period. However, in warmed treatments, variation in annual plant biomass was more closely linked to the functional traits of dominant species.
   Conclusions Continuous, multi-year exposure to projected climate conditions has a negative impact on above-ground biomass in our grassland study system. Our data suggest that climate-induced decreases in above-ground biomass may be driven by changes in the relative abundance of plant functional groups, and could also reflect changes in soil nutrient availability. Unlike species diversity, community-level leaf traits and functional diversity appear to play an important role for above-ground biomass production, and may have indirect effects on ecosystem stability in changing climates.

AB Wildfire is the major type of disturbance in forest and shrubland ecosystems in Galicia (NW Spain). Soil stabilization and rehabilitation techniques are frequently used to minimize the impact of fire on the ecosystems affected. However, information concerning the specific effects of these post-fire practices on soil microbiota is particularly scarce. In the present study we assessed the effect of an experimental fin of low severity, alone and combined with one of two post-fire stabilization treatments (seeding and mulching), on soil microbial communities in a shrubland area in the region. Measurements of soil microorganism biomass (microbial C determined by both the fumigation-extraction and the substrate induced respiration techniques), activity (respiration, beta-glucosidase, urease and phosphatase) and diversity (community level physiological profiles by Biolog Ecoplates) were made at different times (1, 90, 180 and 365 days) after the fire and application of the stabilization treatments, and compared with the same measurements made in the respective unburned control soil. Microbial biomass and activity were generally reduced by fire, whereas the microbial diversity was increased by fire. However, the fire-induced changes in microbial communities were relatively small compared with the marked temporal variations in the microbial parameters analyzed, suggesting that this type of fire does not substantially change the soil functioning. This response can be partly explained by the relatively low temperature that the soil reached during the experimental fire. Mulching and seeding treatments did not have any effect on biomass, activity and diversity of soil microorganisms. The implications of these results for management practices are discussed.

AB In response to climate change and other threatening processes there is renewed interest in the role of refugia and refuges. In bioregions that experience drought and fire, micro-refuges can play a vital role in ensuring the persistence of species. We develop and apply an approach to identifying potential micro-refuges based on a time series of remotely sensed vegetation greenness (fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the sunlit canopy; fPAR). The primary data for this analysis were NASA MODIS 16-day L3 Global 250 m (MOD13Q1) satellite imagery. This method draws upon relevant ecological theory (source sink habitats, habitat templet) to calculate a micro-refuge index, which is analyzed for each of the major vegetation ecosystems in the case-study region (the Great Eastern Ranges of New South Wales, Australia). Potential ecosystem greenspots were identified, at a range of thresholds, based on an index derived from: the mean and coefficient of variance (COV) of fPAR over the 10-year time series; the minimum mean annual (PAR; and the COV of the 12 values of mean monthly fPAR. These greenspots were mapped and compared with (1) an index of vascular plant species composition, (2) environmental variables, and (3) protected areas. Potential micro-refuges were found within all vegetation ecosystem types. The total area of ecosystem greenspots within the upper 25% threshold was 48 406 ha; around 0.2% of the total area of native vegetation (23.9 x 10(6) ha) in the study region. The total area affected by fire was 3.4 x 10(6) ha. The results of the environmental diagnostic analysis suggest deterministic controls on the geographical distribution of potential micro-refuges that may continue to function under climate change. The approach is relevant to other regions of the world where the role of micro-refuges in the persistence of species is recognized, including across the world's arid zones and, in particular, for the Australian, southern African, and South American continents. Micro-refuge networks may play an important role in maintaining beta-diversity at the bio-region scale and contribute to the stability, resilience, and adaptive capacity of ecosystems in the face of ever-growing pressures from human-forced climate change, land use, and other threatening processes.

AB Aim Urbanization is a major driver of global land-use change, substantially modifying patterns of biodiversity. Managing these impacts has become a conservation priority. The creation and maintenance of greenways, such as river corridors, is frequently promoted as a strategy for mitigating habitat fragmentation in urban areas by bringing semi-natural habitat cover into city centres. However, there is little evidence to support this assertion. Here, we examine whether riparian zones maintain semi-natural habitat cover in urban areas and how species richness varies along such zones. Location Sheffield, Northern England. Methods Multiple taxonomic groups (birds, butterflies, plants) were surveyed at 105 sites spanning seven riparian corridors that transect the study system. For all groups, we model the relationships between species richness and environmental variables pertinent to an urban system. To test whether riparian zones can act to maintain semi-natural habitats within a city, we modelled the proportion of semi-natural land cover within 250 m grid squares that do, and do not, contain a river. Results Species richness varied markedly in relation to distance from the urban core. Trends differed both between taxonomic groups and between rivers, reflecting the complex patterns of environmental variation associated with cities. This suggests that biodiversity surveys that focus on a single group or transect cannot reliably be used as surrogates even within the same city. Nonetheless, there were common environmental predictors of species richness. Plant, avian and butterfly richness all responded positively to Habitat Diversity and the latter two declined with increases in sealed surface. Main conclusions Multiple transects and taxonomic groups are required to describe species richness responses to urbanization as no single pattern is evident. Although riparian zones are an important component of the mosaic of urban habitats, we find that river corridors do not disproportionately support tree and Natural Surface Cover when compared to non-riverine urban areas.

   health; Ocean Health Index; reference point; target
ID WATER-QUALITY; CONSERVATION; INDICATORS; RECOVERY
AB The benefits provided by a healthy ocean are receiving increasing attention in policy and management spheres. A fundamental challenge with assessing ocean health and ecosystem services is that we lack a scientific framework for expressing ecosystem conditions quantitatively in relation to management goals. Here we outline and operationalize a conceptual framework for identifying meaningful reference points and quantifying the current ecosystem state relative to them. The framework requires clear articulation of management goals and is built on a review of current scientific understanding and assessment of data availability. It develops a structured approach for choosing among three classes of reference points, including: (1) functional relationships that establish the ocean state that can be produced and sustained under different environmental conditions, (2) time series approaches that compare current to previous capacities to obtain a particular ocean state in a specific location, and (3) spatial reference points that compare current capacities to achieve a desired ocean state across regional (or, if necessary, global) scales. We illustrate this general framework through the lens of ocean health defined in terms of a coupled social-ecological system, with examples from fisheries, marine livelihoods, and water quality in the USA. Assessment of ocean health and ecosystem services can be significantly influenced by the choice of indicators used to track changes in a management goal, the type of reference point selected, and how one measures the distance of the current state from the reference point. This framework provides flexible, standardized methods for evaluating ocean health and ecosystem services that can advance important components of ecosystem-based management, including marine spatial planning, ecosystem service valuation, and integrated ecosystem assessments.

   EXPLANATION
AB Cranial ornamentation is widespread throughout the extinct non-avialian Ornithodira, being present throughout Pterosauria, Ornithischia and Saurischia. Ornaments take many forms, and can be composed of at least a dozen different skull bones, indicating multiple origins. Many of these crests serve no clear survival function and it has been suggested that their primary use was for species recognition or sexual display. The distribution within Ornithodira and the form and position of these crests suggest sexual selection as a key factor, although the role of the latter has often been rejected on the grounds of an apparent lack of sexual dimorphism in many species. Surprisingly, the phenomenon of mutual sexual selection -where both males and females are ornamented and both select mates -has been ignored in research on fossil ornithodirans, despite a rich history of research and frequent expression in modern birds. Here, we review the available evidence for the functions of ornithodiran cranial crests and conclude that mutual sexual selection presents a valid hypothesis for their presence and distribution. The integration of mutual sexual selection into future studies is critical to our understanding of ornithodiran ecology, evolution and particularly questions regarding sexual dimorphism.

AB Aim Analyses of species distributions are complicated by various origins of spatial autocorrelation (SAC) in biogeographical data. SAC may be particularly important for invasive species distribution models (iSDMs) because biological invasions are strongly influenced by dispersal and colonization processes that typically create highly structured distribution patterns. We examined the efficacy of using a multi-scale framework to account for different origins of SAC, and compared non-spatial models with models that accounted for SAC at multiple levels.
   Location We modelled the spatial distribution of an invasive forest pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum, in western USA.
   Methods We applied one conventional statistical method (generalized linear model, GLM) and one nonparametric technique (maximum entropy, Maxent) to a large dataset on P. ramorum occurrence (n = 3787) to develop four types of model that included environmental variables and that either ignored spatial context or incorporated it at a broad scale using trend surface analysis, a local scale using autocovariates, or multiple scales using spatial eigenvector mapping. We evaluated model accuracies and amounts of explained spatial structure, and examined the changes in predictive power of the environmental and spatial variables.
   Results Accounting for different scales of SAC significantly enhanced the predictive capability of iSDMs. Dramatic improvements were observed when fine-scale SAC was included, suggesting that local range-confining processes are important in P. ramorum spread. The importance of environmental variables was relatively consistent across all models, but the explanatory power decreased in spatial models for factors with strong spatial structure. While accounting for SAC reduced the amount of residual autocorrelation for GLM but not for Maxent, it still improved the performance of both approaches, supporting our hypothesis that dispersal and colonization processes are important factors to consider in distribution models of biological invasions.
   Main conclusions Spatial autocorrelation has become a paradigm in biogeography and ecological modelling. In addition to avoiding the violation of statistical assumptions, accounting for spatial patterns at multiple scales can enhance our understanding of dynamic processes that explain ecological mechanisms of invasion and improve the predictive performance of static iSDMs.

AB The aim of the present work was to compare the physiological responses to water stress and recovery of seedlings and saplings of three different Mediterranean species (Olea europaea var. sylvestris, Rhamnus alaternus and Cneorum tricoccon), pre-conditioning and aged in nursery and presenting different ages and pot sizes. Our hypothesis was that the ratio of plant size to soil volume (which constrains root development leading to low root-to-shoot ratios) rather than any of the two factors separately determines the seedling response to water stress. Seedlings (1-y) and saplings (3 to 4-y) were transplanted into pots bigger than those used during growth in the nursery and irrigation was stopped to each species x age/size combination. Leaf water potential (psi), net CO2 assimilation (A(N)), stomatal (g(s)) and mesophyll (g(m)) conductances, and the rate of photosynthetic electron transport (ETR) were determined every few days. Plants were re-watered when A(N) dropped below 70% of control values.
   Saplings of each species presented larger total leaf area (TLA) and reached lower psi than seedlings. Even under irrigation, saplings showed lower A(N), which was not related to g(s) but to lower g(m) and ETR. During water stress, A(N) decreased slowly in seedlings due to stomatal limitations, while in saplings it decreased fast and mainly associated to non-stomatal limitations (g(m) and ETR). Upon re-watering, seedlings recovered maximum A(N) within a few days, while recovery was slow and incomplete in saplings. At the end of the experiment, significant leaf die-back occurred in saplings but not in seedlings except for Cneorum. The minimum psi achieved during water stress was strongly linearly related to TLA when pooling all species and ages, and leaf die-back was strongly dependent on psi and on the appearance of non-stomatal limitations to photosynthesis. Therefore, we conclude that the total amount of leaf area for a given volume of substrate (i.e., maximum water availability), rather than plants pre-conditioning in nurseries or plant age, determines seedling/sapling responses to water stress and re-watering in Mediterranean species.

AB Relationships between events in one period of the annual cycle and behaviour in subsequent seasons are key determinants of individual life histories and population dynamics. However, studying such associations is challenging, given the difficulties in following individuals across seasons, particularly in migratory species. Relationships between breeding performance and subsequent winter ecology are particularly poorly understood, yet are likely to be profoundly important because of the costs of reproduction. Using geolocation technology, we show that black-legged kittiwakes that experienced breeding failure left their colony in southeast Scotland earlier than successful breeders. Moreover, a greater proportion of unsuccessful breeders (94% versus 53% successful) travelled over 3000 km to the West Atlantic, whereas fewer visited the East Atlantic (31% versus 80% successful), less than 1000 km from the colony. The two groups did not differ in the timing of return to the colony the following spring. However, 58 per cent of males made a previously undescribed long-distance pre-breeding movement to the central Atlantic. Our results demonstrate important links between reproductive performance and winter distribution, with significant implications for population dynamics. Furthermore, macro-scale segregation associated with breeding outcome is relevant to defining important wintering areas, in particular among declining species experiencing increasingly regular breeding failure.

AB Top-down control has been extensively documented in food webs based on living plants, where predator limitation of herbivores can cascade to facilitate plant growth (the green-world hypothesis), particularly in grasslands and aquatic systems. Yet the ecosystem role of predators in detrital food webs is less explored, as is the potential effect of climate warming on detritus-based communities. We here show that predators have a "brown-world" role in decomposer communities via a cascading top-down control on plant growth, based on the results of an experiment that factorially manipulated presence and size of two predator species as well as temperature (warmed vs. unwarmed). The inclusion of predatory beetles significantly decreased abundance of coprophagous beetles and thus the rate of dung decomposition and productivity of plants growing surrounding the dung. Moreover, the magnitude of these decreases differed between predator species and, for dung loss, was temperature dependent. At ambient temperature, the larger predators tended to more strongly influence the dung loss rate than did the smaller predators; when both predators were present, the dung loss rate was higher relative to the treatments with the smaller predators but comparable to those with the larger ones, suggesting an antagonistic effect of predator interaction. However, warming substantially reduced dung decomposition rates and eliminated the effects of predation on dung decomposition. Although warming substantially decreased dung loss rates, warming only modestly reduced primary productivity. Consistent with these results, a second experiment exploring the influence of the two predator species and warming on dung loss over time revealed that predatory beetles significantly decreased the abundance of coprophagous beetles, which was positively correlated with dung loss rates. Moreover, experimental warming decreased the water content of dung and hence the survival of coprophagous beetles. These results confirm that the "brown-world" effect of predator beetles was due to cascading top-down control through coprophagous beetles to nutrient cycling and primary productivity. Our results also highlight potentially counterintuitive effects of climate warming. For example, global warming might significantly decrease animal-mediated decomposition of organic matter and recycling of nutrients in a future warmed world.

AB The extinction of a species is inevitably preceded by the extirpation of a series of local populations. Ecological theory predicts that vulnerability to extirpation varies between populations and is ultimately linked to environmental heterogeneity. If populations of a species are present in multiple regions separated by abrupt changes in environmental conditions (e.g., biomes), spatial variation in vulnerability to extirpation may be closely linked to the distribution of these regions. In the absence of abrupt shifts in environmental conditions, populations at the edge of a species' range should have low growth rates and be more vulnerable to extirpation, whereas populations located in the core of the species' range should be exposed to more favorable environmental conditions, have higher growth rates, and be less vulnerable. Here, we ask whether the distribution of biomes or range position better reflects spatial variation in vulnerability for 43 mammal species distributed through four continents. We control for the distribution of human threats and quantify the importance of protected areas in population persistence. We conclude that the distribution of biomes is a better predictor of vulnerability than position in the geographic range. We also find that core populations are less vulnerable than edge populations (after controlling for threats levels and protected areas). Protected areas are important for the persistence of most species we studied. By providing a measure of vulnerability linked directly to the distribution of threats, our results offer insights for scaling up from species vulnerability to extinction risk.

AB Soil CO2 efflux is the main source of CO2 from forest ecosystems and it is tightly coupled to the transfer of recent photosynthetic assimilates belowground and their metabolism in roots, mycorrhiza and rhizosphere microorganisms feeding on root-derived exudates. The objective of our study was to assess patterns of belowground carbon allocation among tree species and along seasons. Pure (CO2)-C-13 pulse labelling of the entire crown of three different tree species ( beech, oak and pine) was carried out at distinct phenological stages. Excess C-13 in soil CO2 efflux was tracked using tuneable diode laser absorption spectrometry to determine time lags between the start of the labelling and the appearance of C-13 in soil CO2 efflux and the amount of C-13 allocated to soil CO2 efflux. Isotope composition (delta C-13) of CO2 respired by fine roots and soil microbes was measured at several occasions after labelling, together with delta C-13 of bulk root tissue and microbial carbon. Time lags ranged from 0.5 to 1.3 days in beech and oak and were longer in pine (1.6-2.7 days during the active growing season, more than 4 days during the resting season), and the transfer of C to the microbial biomass was as fast as to the fine roots. The amount of C-13 allocated to soil CO2 efflux was estimated from a compartment model. It varied between 1 and 21% of the amount of (CO2)-C-13 taken up by the crown, depending on the species and the season. While rainfall exclusion that moderately decreased soil water content did not affect the pattern of carbon allocation to soil CO2 efflux in beech, seasonal patterns of carbon allocation belowground differed markedly between species, with pronounced seasonal variations in pine and beech. In beech, it may reflect competition with the strength of other sinks (aboveground growth in late spring and storage in late summer) that were not observed in oak. We report a fast transfer of recent photosynthates to the mycorhizosphere and we conclude that the patterns of carbon allocation belowground are species specific and change seasonally according to the phenology of the species.

AB The outcomes of a series of tests of the ARDI (Actors, Resources, Dynamics, and Interactions) method in complex cases or conflict-ridden situations is presented. ARDI is part of a companion modeling approach that makes it possible to engage a broad spectrum of stakeholders in the design and development of land and water management plans. It is based on participatory workshops that set out to collaboratively imagine a future open, dynamic management system, capable of adaptation and anticipation, by gathering the various stakeholders in a partnership to examine conservation of the natural resources and promoting a sustainable development. Its originality lies in the co-construction of a "conceptual model" of the functioning of the territory, according to an overarching, negotiated development question. The approach is based on the collective articulation of the key elements of a context or territory by stakeholders such as managers, representatives, socio-professional technicians, nongovernmental organizations, experts, and scientists, and local policy makers. This sharing of representations is done by means of a series of collective workshops during which Actors, Resources, Dynamics, and Interactions constituting the profile of the territory are identified and clarified. This work of co-construction is conducted within a precise methodological framework that we present in a step-by-step format. The method is grounded in concrete experience gleened from tests conducted by the authors over the past five years. Finally, the requirement for specific skills as well as pitfalls to avoid when applying the method are discussed.

AB The objectives of this work were to examine the past, current and potential influence of global climate change on the spatial distribution of some commercially exploited fish and to evaluate a recently proposed new ecological niche model (ENM) called nonparametric probabilistic ecological niche model (NPPEN). This new technique is based on a modified version of the test called Multiple Response Permutation Procedure (MRPP) using the generalized Mahalanobis distance. The technique was applied in the extratropical regions of the North Atlantic Ocean on eight commercially exploited fish species using three environmental parameters (sea surface temperature, bathymetry and sea surface salinity). The numerical procedure and the model allowed a better characterization of the niche (sensu Hutchinson) and an improved modelling of the spatial distribution of the species. Furthermore, the technique appeared to be robust to incomplete or bimodal training sets. Despite some potential limitations related to the choice of the climatic scenarios (A2 and B2), the type of physical model (ECHAM 4) and the absence of consideration of biotic interactions, modelled changes in species distribution explained some current observed shifts in dominance that occurred in the North Atlantic sector, and particularly in the North Sea. Although projected changes suggest a poleward movement of species, our results indicate that some species may not be able to track their climatic envelope and that climate change may have a prominent influence on fish distribution during this century. The phenomenon is likely to trigger locally major changes in the dominance of species with likely implications for socio-economical systems. In this way, ENMs might provide a new management tool against which changes in the resource might be better anticipated.

AB Exotic plants are major constituents of species pools in modern landscapes. Managing succession for restoration of degraded ecosystems thus requires an understanding of novel trajectories unfolding in mixed, native/exotic plant assemblages. We examined trends in native and exotic species abundance over 20 years of old-field succession on set-aside farmland in the Inland Pampa, Argentina. Changes in plant cover and species richness were annually monitored on adjacent permanent plots established in different years (1978-1989). Both native and exotic species occurred in early, mid and late successional stages, exhibiting similar life-form replacement patterns, from annual forbs, through annual to perennial grasses. Exotic plant richness declined with plot age. Yet, four exotic grasses remained dominant through succession (50-70% cover), with plots initiated in later years showing increased exotic cover. While native perennial grasses occurred from the onset of succession, increasing from 5 to 12 spp/plot, they only showed transient peaks below 30% cover. Cluster analysis of 113 plot-year samples identified alternative community states for early, mid and late successional stages, which were connected by a complex network of interweaving dynamic pathways. Depending on the plot. vegetation dynamics comprised directional temporal trajectories as well as nondirectional pathways, and arrested community states dominated by exotic grasses. Our results illustrate the overwhelming role of exotic species in modern old-field succession, and their potential to hinder recovery of native communities on former agricultural land. Community states with novel, native/exotic plant mixtures could be managed to deliver specific ecosystem services (e.g. forage production, carbon sequestration). However, meeting conservation goals may require active restoration measures, including exotic plant removals and native grass seeding. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Admixture between genetically divergent populations facilitates genomic studies of the mechanisms involved in adaptation, reproductive isolation, and speciation, including mapping of the loci involved in these phenomena. Little is known about how pre- and postzygotic barriers will affect the prospects of "admixture mapping'' in wild species. We have studied 93 mapped genetic markers (microsatellites, indels, and sequence polymorphisms, similar to 60,000 data points) to address this topic in hybrid zones of Populus alba and P. tremula, two widespread, ecologically important forest trees. Using genotype and linkage information and recently developed analytical tools we show that (1) reproductive isolation between these species is much stronger than previously assumed but this cannot prevent the introgression of neutral or advantageous alleles, (2) unexpected genotypic gaps exist between recombinant hybrids and their parental taxa, (3) these conspicuous genotypic patterns are due to assortative mating and strong postzygotic barriers, rather than recent population history. We discuss possible evolutionary trajectories of hybrid lineages between these species and outline strategies for admixture mapping in hybrid zones between highly divergent populations. Datasets such as this one are still rare in studies of natural hybrid zones but should soon become more common as high throughput genotyping and resequencing become feasible in nonmodel species.

AB Plant invasions are known to have negative impacts on native plant communities, yet their influence on higher trophic levels has not been well documented. Past studies investigating the effects of invasive plants on herbivores and carnivores have been largely observational in nature and thus lack the ability to tease apart whether differences are a cause or consequence of the invasion. In addition, understanding how plant traits and plant species compositions change in invaded habitats may increase our ability to predict when and where invasive plants will have effects that cascade to animals. To assess effects on arthropods, we experimentally introduced a non-native plant (Microstegium vimineum, Japanese stiltgrass) in a community re-assembly experiment. We also investigated possible mechanisms through which the invader could affect associated arthropods, including changes in native plant species richness, above-ground plant biomass, light availability and vegetation height. In experimentally invaded plots, arthropod abundance was reduced by 39%, and species richness declined by 19%. Carnivores experienced greater reductions in abundance than herbivores (61% vs 31% reduction). Arthropod composition significantly diverged between experimentally invaded and control plots, and particular species belonging to the abundant families Aphididae (aphids), Formicidae (ants) and Phalacridae (shining flower beetles) contributed the most to compositional differences. Among the mechanisms we investigated, only the reduction in native plant species richness caused by invasion was strongly correlated with total arthropod abundance and richness. In sum, our results demonstrate negative impacts of M. vimineum invasion on higher trophic levels and suggest that these effects occur, in part, indirectly through invader-mediated reductions in the richness of the native plant community. The particularly strong response of carnivores suggests that plant invasion could reduce top-down control of herbivorous species for native plants.

AB The altitudinal treeline ecotone is a windy environment where wind velocities and directions are controlled by local mountain topography and also by the distribution pattern and structures of tree stands. Wind may override the role of heat deficiency in determining treeline position, spatial pattern, ecological conditions, and tree growth. Regular strong permanent winds restrict tree height and usually cause asymmetric and suppressed growth forms that are common in the treeline ecotone. Apart from direct physiological and mechanical effects on trees and ground vegetation, wind also disperses seeds, relocates snow, and locally erodes soils in the treeline ecotone. Wind effects must be considered an important factor that may delay or even preclude establishment of seedling trees on wind-swept terrain. Discussions of a potential climatically driven upward shift of the treeline at the landscape and smaller scales should give greater attention to the varying wind effects because warming cannot compensate for these other factors. The relative importance of microsite facilitation providing shelter from the wind will increase in parallel with the upslope migration of the tree limit into a much windier environment.

AB Establishment of plants through seeds is often constrained by the quality of microsites, which is in part controlled by the nature and amount of ground cover. The latter consists of living shoots of vascular plants or bryophytes and/or the dead remains of the dominant species. In the present article, we report the results of a controlled pot experiment with five species characteristic of floodplain grasslands. We manipulated the amounts of grass litter and/or mosses to study (1) differences between ground cover types with respect to their effects on microenvironment and seedling emergence and (2) how these effects interact with seed size and seed sowing position. Increasing amounts of both cover types led to increasing soil humidity, whereas temperature amplitude and illumination were decreased. However, since grass litter decomposed much faster than bryophytes, light conditions for germination under grass litter improved considerably with time. Although seedling emergence varied significantly between species, ground cover types and cover amounts, seed position alone explained about 50% of the variation in the data set. Additionally, we found an important interaction between seed size, seed position and cover type: large-seeded species showed a fitness advantage when seeds were situated beneath a cover, irrespective of cover type, which disappeared when seeds were shed on top of a cover layer. We suggest that this interaction may be ecologically and evolutionarily relevant because it may lead to changes in species composition and diversity of plant communities as a consequence of changes in the amount and type of ground cover.

AB Recently, there has been increasing interest in behavioral syndrome research across a range of taxa. Behavioral syndromes are suites of correlated behaviors that are expressed either within a given behavioral context (e.g., mating) or between different contexts (e.g., foraging and mating). Syndrome research holds profound implications for animal behavior as it promotes a holistic view in which seemingly autonomous behaviors may not evolve independently, but as a "suite" or "package." We tested whether laboratory-reared male and female European house crickets, Acheta domesticus, exhibited behavioral syndromes by quantifying individual differences in activity, exploration, mate attraction, aggressiveness, and antipredator behavior. To our knowledge, our study is the first to consider such a breadth of behavioral traits in one organism using the syndrome framework. We found positive correlations across mating, exploratory, and antipredatory contexts, but not aggression and general activity. These behavioral differences were not correlated with body size or condition, although age explained some of the variation in motivation to mate. We suggest that these across-context correlations represent a boldness syndrome as individual risk-taking and exploration was central to across-context mating and antipredation correlations in both sexes.

AB P> Many hypotheses about species coexistence involve differential resource use and trade-offs in species' life-history traits. Quantifying resource use across most species in diverse communities, although, has seldom been attempted.
   We use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to quantify the light dependence of recruitment in 263 woody species in a 50-ha long-term forest census plot in Panama. Data on sapling recruitment were obtained using the 1985-1990 and 1990-1995 census intervals. Available light was estimated for each recruit from yearly censuses of canopy density.
   We use a power function (linear log-log relationship) to model the light effect on recruitment. Different responses of recruitment to light are expressed by the light effect parameter b. The distribution of b had a central mode at 0.8, suggesting that recruitment of many species responds nearly linearly to increasing light.
   Nearly every species showed increases in recruitment with increasing light. Just nine species (3%) had recruitment declining with light, while 198 species (75%) showed increasing recruitment in both census intervals. Most of the increases in recruitment were decelerating, i.e. the increase was less at higher light (b < 1). In the remaining species, the response to light varied between census intervals (24 species) or species did not have recruits in both intervals (41 species).
   Synthesis. Nearly all species regenerate better in higher light, and recruitment responses to light are spread along a continuum ranging from modest increase with light to a rather strict requirement for high light. These results support the hypothesis that spatio-temporal variation in light availability may contribute to the diversity of tropical tree species by providing opportunities for niche differentiation with respect to light requirements for regeneration.

AB Although the effect of forest management on lichens in temperate forests has been widely examined, little is known about the influence of management-related factors on their biodiversity relative to factors that cannot be altered by management. Here we determined whether forest structure or climate determines lichen diversity in the Bavarian Forest National Park in southeastern Germany, taking spatial variables into account. We investigated 517 single tree stems along 4 transects in 113 pre-stratified plots (8 m in diameter) in this montane forest. We grouped environmental variables into three sets: climate (macroclimate, non-manageable), forest structure (manageable), and space. The explanatory powers of these sets of variables for lichen diversity were compared using variance partitioning for the lichen community, species density, and threatened species density. The relationships of single characteristics of forest structure with lichen species diversity were analyzed using generalized linear models (GLM). Lichen diversity was better explained by stand structures than by climate. Spatial effects influenced the number of species per plot. Among the structural features, the availability of dead wood and sycamore maple as well as forest continuity were most important for the enhancement of lichen diversity. Open canopy structures affected the total diversity positively. Although the availability of large trees was not an influential factor in the GLM at the plot level, high diversity levels were generally associated with large stem diameters at the level of single stems. We provide recommendations for sustainable forest-management practices that aim at specifically enhancing lichen diversity in temperate areas experiencing low levels of air pollution. m (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Understanding the effects of disturbance by human trampling on ecosystem processes is essential for the management of recreational areas. Discussions on recreational impacts are based either oil data front trampling experiments or oil field Survey data from sites subjected to long-term recreational use, but rarely on a combination of both. We examined whether results from a short-term trampling experiment reflect the impact of long-term trampling around frequently used fire places. We compared short- and long-term effects of human trampling on above-ground forest vegetation and soil physical, chemical and microbial characteristics. We found both similarities and differences in short- and long-term trampling effects. Both short- and long-term trampling reduced plant cover, plant height and species density, though long-term effects were more pronounced than short-term effects. In both approaches, leaf litter biomass decreased, whereas soil density increased with trampling intensity. Other soil characteristics including soil moisture, total soil organic matter content and total organic nitrogen content were not or only marginally affected by short- and long-term trampling. Furthermore, soil microbial biomass and the activity of dehydrogenase did not change in both approaches. in contrast, the activity of beta-glucosidase was only reduced by short-term trampling, whereas activity of phos phomonoesterase was reduced only by long-term trampling. Soil compaction was one factor reducing microbial activities at low and medium trampling intensities in our experiment and in the highly compacted area around the fire rings. We conclude that it could be problematic to use the results of short-term trampling experiments to predict general long-term trampling effects. Our results imply also that the restoration of degraded sites might be hampered by the low nutrient turnover resulting from the reduced litter layer and changes in enzyme activities, mitigating a successful re-establishment and growth of plants.

AB Concentrations of persistent contaminants often vary widely among individuals within a population. We hypothesized that such variation was caused mainly by differences in diet (biomagnification) and in coastal systems by the tendency of marine systems to act as contaminant sinks. We examined the relationship between contaminant concentrations and stable isotope ratios in nestling plasma from an apex predator with a particularly broad diet. Our study included freshwater, estuarine, inshore and pelagic breeding sites. Bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) at the pelagic marine sites showed high trophic level and marine input, eagles at the freshwater sites showed low trophic level and marine input, and eagles at the estuarine and inshore marine sites had intermediate values. The relationship between trophic level and marine input may reflect longer food chains in pelagic compared to terrestrial ecosystems. Sigma PCBs and DDE concentrations generally increased with trophic level and marine input, with the exception of the freshwater sites, while Sigma PBDEs, hydroxylated-PBDEs and hydroxylated-PCBs increased with marine input, but were independent of trophic level. The relationships for Sigma PCBs and DDE were often slightly stronger with marine input than trophic level, suggesting that oceanographic processes may be more important than trophic level. At freshwater locations, spatial variation may be more important than trophic level due to the heterogeneity of contaminant profiles between feeding locations (lakes, rivers, agricultural fields). Adults had similar isotopic composition to their chicks but higher contamination. Based on nests where prey composition was determined independently, isotopic enrichment values for nestling plasma were 1.6 +/- 0.1 (delta N-15) and -0.4 +/- 0.2 (delta C-13). We conclude that trophic level and marine influence are significant factors influencing PCB and DDE concentrations in eagles. However, trophic level in particular did not influence PBDEs, possibly due to their being metabolized by eagles. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Using species distribution data from 111 aquifers distributed in nine European regions, we examined the pairwise relationships between local species richness (LSR), dissimilarity in species composition among localities, and regional species richness (RSR). In addition, we quantified the relative contribution of three nested spatial units - aquifers, catchments and regions - to the overall richness of groundwater crustaceans.
   2. The average number of species in karst and porous aquifers (LSR) varied significantly among regions and was dependent upon the richness of the regional species pool (RSR). LSR-RSR relationships differed between habitats: species richness in karstic local communities increased linearly with richness of the surrounding region, whereas that of porous local communities levelled off beyond a certain value of RSR.
   3. Dissimilarity in species composition among aquifers of a region increased significantly with increasing regional richness because of stronger habitat specialisation and a decrease in the geographic range of species among karst aquifers. Species turnover among karst aquifers was positively related to RSR, whereas this relationship was not significant for porous aquifers.
   4. The contribution of a given spatial unit to total richness increased as size of the spatial unit increased, although 72% of the overall richness was attributed to among-region diversity. Differences in community composition between similar habitats in different regions were typically more pronounced than between nearby communities from different habitats.
   5. We conclude by calling for biodiversity assessment methods and conservation strategies that explicitly integrate the importance of turnover in community composition and habitat dissimilarity at multiple spatial scales.

AB Some studies on the effects of helpers in cooperatively breeding vertebrates show a positive effect of helper presence on reproductive output whereas others find no effect. One possibility for this discrepancy is that helpers may have a positive effect when breeding conditions are adverse, while their effect might go unnoticed under good conditions. We investigate this hypothesis on sociable weavers Philetairus socius, a colonial cooperatively breeding passerine that inhabits a semi-arid region where breeding conditions vary markedly. We used multivariate mixed models to analyse the effect of helpers on reproduction under contrasting environmental and social conditions while controlling for parental and colony identity. We found that reproductive success in sociable weavers was primarily influenced by nest predation and rainfall. In addition, colony size was negatively associated with hatching and fledging success and number of young fledged per season. Helpers had a less prominent but significant influence on feeding rates and reproductive outcome. In agreement with expectations, the presence of helpers counteracted some of the negative effects of breeding in periods of low rainfall or in large colonies and was also associated with an increased number of young fledged per season. Our results illustrate that the effect of helpers might be detectable mostly under unfavourable conditions, but can contribute to improve reproductive performance in those situations.

AB The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is the de facto standard for object-oriented software analysis and design modeling. However, few empirical studies exist which investigate the costs and evaluate the benefits of using UML in realistic contexts. Such studies are needed so that the software industry can make informed decisions regarding the extent to which they should adopt UML in their development practices. This is the first controlled experiment that investigates the costs of maintaining and the benefits of using UML documentation during the maintenance and evolution of a real nontrivial system, using professional developers as subjects, working with a state-of-the-art UML tool during an extended period of time. The subjects in the control group had no UML documentation. In this experiment, the subjects in the UML group had, on average, a practically and statistically significant 54 percent increase in the functional correctness of changes (p = 0.03) and an insignificant 7 percent overall improvement in design quality (p = 0.22), though a much larger improvement was observed on the first change task ( 56 percent), at the expense of an insignificant 14 percent increase in development time caused by the overhead of updating the UML documentation (p = 0.35).

AB The convergent quantum yield hypothesis (CQY) assumes that thermodynamics and natural selection jointly limit variation in the maximum energetic efficiency of photosynthesis in low light under otherwise specified conditions (e.g. temperature and CO2 concentration). A literature survey of photosynthetic quantum yield (phi) studies in terrestrial plants from C-3, C-4, and CAM photosynthetic types was conducted to test the CQY hypothesis. Broad variation in phi values from C-3 plants could partially be explained by accounting for whether the measuring conditions were permissive or restrictive for photorespiration. Assimilatory quotients (AQ), calculated from the CO2 phi:O-2 phi ratios, indicated that 49% and 29% of absorbed light energy was allocated to carbon fixation and photorespiration in C-3 plants, respectively. The unexplained remainder (22%) may represent diversion to various other energy-demanding processes (e.g. starch synthesis, nitrogen assimilation). Individual and cumulative effects of these other processes on photosynthetic efficiency are poorly quantified. In C-4 plants, little variation in phi values was observed, consistent with the fact that C-4 plants exhibit little photorespiration. As before, AQ values indicate that 22% of absorbed light energy cannot be accounted for by carbon fixation in C-4 plants. Among all three photosynthetic types, the phi of photosynthesis in CAM plants is the least studied, appears to be highly variable, and may present the greatest challenge to the CQY hypothesis. The high amount of energy diverted to processes other than carbon fixation in C-3 and C-4 plants and the poor characterization of photosynthetic efficiency in CAM plants are significant deficiencies in our otherwise robust understanding of the energetics of terrestrial photoautotrophy.

AB 1. Invaded landscapes and ecosystems are composed of multiple interacting networks and feed-back loops, sometimes leading to unexpected effects of management actions. In order to plan management for invaded systems we need to explicitly consider management goals before putting actions in place. Actions taken must be justified in terms of their amelioration of impacts of invaders, contribution to the management goals and the costs incurred.
   2. This Special Profile brings together papers on the management of invasive plants, transgenes, animals and diseases, leading to conclusions with clear policy and management relevance and contributing to some of the hottest current topics in invasion ecology: unexpected impacts of invaders, restoration of invasion resistance, distribution mapping, spatial epidemiology, escape of transgenes, community interactions and complex effects of management.
   3. As papers in this Special Profile demonstrate, management for amelioration of the impacts of invasive species will include a wide range of manipulations, not just of the invader itself but of both abiotic and biotic components of the system. In fact, several papers in this Special Profile show that indirect management of the community may be more effective than removal of the invader alone.
   4. As little information is generally available at the beginning of a management programme, an adaptive approach should be taken and the management objectives/goals revised throughout the management process. New methods are emerging for adaptive management; an example is presented in this Special Profile where a Bayesian model used for assessing eradication goals can be updated throughout the management process leading to refinement of management.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Applied research should be directed at providing decision support for managers throughout the management process and can be used to provide predictive tools for risk assessment of new invaders. The science of invasion ecology has much to contribute to the new challenge of natural or enhanced movement of organisms in relation to climate change. Methods and information from invasion ecology can be used to assess management goals, management actions and the risks of potential translocations before they are put in place.

AB Failures in reforestation are often attributed to nutrient limitation for tree growth. We compared tree performance and nitrogen and phosphorus relations in adjacent mixed-species plantings of contrasting composition, established for forest restoration on Ultisol soil, originally covered by tropical semi-deciduous Atlantic Forest in Southeast Brazil. Nutrient relations of four tree species occurring in both planting mixtures were compared between a legume-dominated, species-poor direct seeding mixture of early-successional species ("legume mixture"), and a species-diverse, legume-poor mixture of all successional groups ("diverse mixture"). After 7 years, the legume mixture had 6-fold higher abundance of N(2)-fixing trees, 177% higher total tree basal area, 22% lower litter C/N, six-fold higher in situ soil resin-nitrate, and 40% lower in situ soil resin-P, compared to the diverse mixture. In the legume mixture, non-N(2)-fixing legume Schizolobium parahyba (Fabaceae-Caesalpinioideae) had significantly lower proportional N resorption, and both naturally regenerating non-legume trees had significantly higher leaf N concentrations, and higher proportional P resorption, than in the diverse mixture. This demonstrate forms of plastic adjustment in all three non-N(2)-fixing species to diverged nutrient relations between mixtures. By contrast, leaf nutrient relations in N(2)-fixing Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Fabaceae-Mimosoideae) did not respond to planting mixtures. Rapid N accumulation in the legume mixture caused excess soil nitrification over nitrate immobilization and tighter P recycling compared with the diverse mixture. The legume mixture succeeded in accelerating tree growth and canopy closure, but may imply periods of N losses and possibly P limitation. Incorporation of species with efficient nitrate uptake and P mobilization from resistant soil pools offers potential to optimize these tradeoffs.

AB The ecological consequences of climate change are determined by many climate parameters, not just by the commonly investigated changes in mean temperature and rainfall. More comprehensive studies, including analyses of climate variability, extremes and aggregate changes in the climate system, can improve the understanding of the nature, and therefore possible consequences, of recent changes in climate. Here climate trends on the sub-Antarctic Marion Island are documented (between 1949 and 2003) in more detail than previously. Significant trends in biologically-relevant, and previously unexplored, parameters were observed, and the potential ecological consequences of these changes discussed. For example, the decline in precipitation experienced on the island comprises a trend for longer dry spells punctuated by fewer and smaller precipitation events. This more detailed understanding of the island's drying trends enables more accurate predictions about its impacts, including, for example, particularly severe effects on plant species growing in soils with poor water-holding capacity. Therefore, in addition to changes in average conditions, more inclusive climate analyses should also examine trends in climatic variability and extremes, for individual climate parameters as well as for the climate system as a whole.

AB Research examining the relationship between community diversity and invasions by normative species has raised new questions about the theory and management of biological invasions. Ecological theory predicts, and small-scale experiments confirm, lower levels of nonnative species invasion into species-rich compared to species-poor communities, but observational studies across a wider range of scales often report positive relationships between native and nonnative species richness. This paradox has been attributed to the scale dependency of diversity-invasibility relationships and to differences between experimental and observational studies. Disturbance is widely recognized as an important factor determining invasibility of communities, but few studies have investigated the relative and interactive roles of diversity and disturbance on nonnative species invasion. Here, we report how the relationship between native and nonnative plant species richness responded to an experimentally applied disturbance gradient (from no disturbance up to clearcut) in oak-dominated forests. We consider whether results are consistent with various explanations of diversity-invasibility relationships including biotic resistance, resource availability, and the potential effects of scale (I m 2 to 2 ha). We found no correlation between native and normative species richness before disturbance except at the largest spatial scale, but a positive relationship after disturbance across scales and levels of disturbance. Post-disturbance richness of both native and normative species was positively correlated with disturbance intensity and with variability of residual basal area of trees. These results suggest that more nonnative plants may invade species-rich communities compared to species-poor communities following disturbance.

AB Research into the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has mainly focused on the effects of species diversity on ecosystem properties in plant communities and, more recently, in food webs. Although there is growing recognition of the significance of nontrophic interactions in ecology, these interactions are still poorly studied theoretically, and their impact on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is largely unknown. Existing models of mutualism usually consider only one type of species interaction and do not satisfy mass balance constraints. Here, we present a model of an interaction web that includes both trophic and nontrophic interactions and that respects the principle of mass conservation. Nontrophic interactions are represented in the form of interaction modifications. We use this model to study the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem properties that emerges from the assembly of entire interaction webs. We show that ecosystem properties such as biomass and production depend not only on species diversity but also on species interactions, in particular on the connectance and magnitude of nontrophic interactions, and that the nature, prevalence, and strength of species interactions in turn depend on species diversity. Nontrophic interactions alter the shape of the relationship between biodiversity and biomass and can profoundly influence ecosystem processes. (

AB Artificial neural networks were used to quantify the distribution of macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups (FFGs) in relation to physical variables and to land-cover in the Adour-Garonne stream system (SW France; 116,000 km(2)). The relative abundances of 5 FFGs were calculated from macroinvertebrate data recorded at 165 sampling sites. Each site was characterized using 5 physical variables (elevation, stream order, stream width, distance from the source, slope) and 3 land-cover variables (% forested, % urban areas, % agricultural areas). The sites were first classified using the Self-Organizing Map algorithm (SOM), according to the physical and land-cover variables. Two major clusters of sites corresponded to anthropogenically modified and natural areas, respectively. Anthropogenically modified areas were clearly divided into agricultural and urban landscapes. Each major cluster was divided into 3-4 subsets of sites according to a topographic gradient of physical variables. To examine the variability of the communities, FFG proportions at the 165 sites were examined on the SOM trained with physical and land-cover variables. When the riverine landscape was natural, FFG patterns responded to the upstream-downstream gradient in physical variables. When the landscape was altered by agriculture or urbanization, the effects of land-cover on FFGs overcame the influence of the physical variables. The categorization of the landscape into forested, agricultural, and urban areas was relevant to detect changes in FFG patterns. In light of increasing development along riparian zones, the use of SOMs to detect responses of FFGs to landscape alterations at regional scales exemplifies an effective technique for assessing river health based on ecological indicator groups.

AB Depredation of livestock by large carnivores is an important but poorly understood source of human-carnivore conflict. We examined patterns of livestock depredation by jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor) on a ranch-wildlife reserve in western Brazil to assess factors contributing to prey mortality. We predicted jaguars would kill a greater proportion of calves than yearling and adult cattle and that proximity to suitable habitat would increase mortality risk. We further speculated that exposure to predation risk would promote livestock grouping and increased movement distance. We recorded 169 cattle mortality incidents during 2003 2004, of which 19% were due to predation by jaguars and pumas. This level of mortality represented 0.2-0.3% of the total livestock holdings on the ranch. Jaguars caused most (69%) cattle predation events, and survival in allotments was lower for calves than for other age classes. Forest proximity was the only variable we found to explain patterns of livestock mortality, with predation risk increasing as distance to forest cover declined. Due to low predation risk, cattle movement patterns and grouping behavior did not vary relative to level of spatial overlap with radiocollared jaguars. The overall effect of predation on cattle was low and livestock likely constituted an alternative prey for large cats in our study area. However, selection of calves over other age cohorts and higher predation risk among cattle in proximity to forest cover is suggestive of selection of substandard individuals. Cattle ranchers in the Pantanal region may reduce cattle mortality rates by concentrating on losses due to nonpredation causes that could be more easily controlled.

AB Most ecological risk assessments for global change are restricted to the effects of trends in climate or atmospheric carbon dioxide. In order to move beyond investigation of the effects of climate alone, the CLIMAX (TM) model was extended to investigate the effects of species interactions, in the same or different trophic levels, along environmental gradients on a geographical scale. Specific needs that were revealed during the investigations include: better treatment of the effects of temporal and spatial climatic variation; elucidation of the nature of boundaries of species ranges; data to quantify the role of species traits in interspecies interactions; integrated observational, experimental, and modelling studies on mechanisms of species interactions along environmental gradients; and high-resolution global environmental datasets. Greater acknowledgement of the shared limitations of simplified models and experimental studies is also needed. Above all, use of the scientific method to understand representative species ranges is essential. This requires the use of mechanistic approaches capable of progressive enhancement.

AB The timing and degree of reliance on maize agriculture in the Four Corners region of the American Southwest has been a central issue in studies that examine the origins of Puebloan society. Both diffusionist (various, but see Wills 1995) and migrationist (Berry and Berry 1986; Matson 1991) models have been proposed to explain the processes responsible for the movement of maize (Zea mays) north into the Four Corners region. This paper reports bone collagen stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values with paired accelerator radiocarbon dates on a large collection of human remains from western Basketmaker II/III sites in Marsh Pass and other areas of northeastern Arizona, as well as data on a small number of Puebloan remains including Chacoan Great House burials. The results make clear that Basketmaker II people were heavily dependent on maize by 400 B. C. Moreover, their degree of dependence is similar to that of Pueblo II and III farmers of the Four Corners region. These findings and the apparent rapidity of maize dependence support a migrationist model for the origins of maize farming in the northern Southwest.

AB In the highlands of northern Ethiopia, remnants of the original Afromontane forest vegetation are largely restricted to church yards and other sacred groves in a matrix of cropland and semiarid degraded savanna. To assess the potential for natural forest regeneration, species composition and diversity of all forest fragments (10) in a study area of 13,000 ha were analyzed in relation to environmental and soil variables. Using a random design and a density of approximately one plot per 2 ha in all fragments, 31 20x20 m plots were sampled. Indicator species analysis and MRPP tests yielded five communities representing two forest types and one degraded savanna habitat. The forest fragments had a species-poor tree and shrub community in which plots were rather homogeneous and most species abundant. NMDS and analysis of variance indicated that a topographical gradient correlated to soil phosphorus, soil depth, stoniness and the proximity to the river system explained the major differences in species composition and separated moist and dry Afromontane forest communities. The grazing intensity further partitioned the habitats. Present communities and their environmental correlates indicate that the secondary climax forest in the area probably consisted of dry Afromontane forest interlaced by broad strips of moist Afromontane forest along rivers and streams and not a continuous, mono-dominant Juniperus forest as is often presumed. Negative effects of the degraded matrix on forest fragments increased with decreasing patch area and increasing shape irregularity. Nevertheless, all remaining fragments are important for their role in the landscape ecology of the region as refuges and species pools and should be protected and managed accordingly. If seed dispersal from forest fragments into exclosures and subsequent tree recruitment are both successful, the vegetation type most likely to establish is Afromontane savanna woodland, and if managed properly, eventually dry Afromontane forest may arise. Increasing the size of small patches and placing forest plantations and exclosures in the vicinity of small forest fragments is expected to yield the most immediate results. This approach may increase the likelihood of patch colonisation by frugivorous forest birds and thus foster the regeneration of native woody species.

AB The genetic analysis of mate choice is fraught with difficulties. Males produce complex signals and displays that can consist of a combination of acoustic, visual, chemical and behavioural phenotypes. Furthermore, female preferences for these male traits are notoriously difficult to quantify. During mate choice, genes not only affect the phenotypes of the individual they are in, but can influence the expression of traits in other individuals. How can genetic analyses be conducted to encompass this complexity? Tighter integration of classical quantitative genetic approaches with modern genomic technologies promises to advance our understanding of the complex genetic basis of mate choice.

AB This paper reviews the abundance and species richness, and factors that cause these parameters to vary, of mesofauna and macrofauna in an upland grassland soil studied intensively under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Programme. The concept that competitive exclusion does not act within soil communities is reviewed in light of these findings, which are placed in the context of the wider literature relating to earthworm, enchytraeid, collembolan and mite diversity, and factors that influence these, with particular reference to land management. The second half of the paper reviews laboratory and field C-13-tracer studies, carried out under the programme, that assess linkages between specific biota and ecosystem processes. The concept of functional redundancy in soil food webs is discussed in the context of these studies. We conclude that competitive interactions occur most widely amongst soil macrofauna, and that competitive exclusion amongst mesofauna is potentially limited by both fine-scale spatial heterogeneity and predation. The most profound impacts of soil fauna on soil properties at Sourhope appeared to be due to the presence of macrofauna in soil communities. There was also evidence for functional redundancy at the species level amongst soil biota, but this was dependent upon which ecosystem process was measured. We conclude that it is likely that functional redundancy at the species level occurs most widely in species rich faunal groups with generalist feeding behaviour. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Most recent ecological Studies of testate amoebae were conducted in acid Sphagnum-dominated mires. Little data exists about the variation in testacean assemblages along the complete gradient from extremely poor acid fens to strongly calcareous spring fens. This so called poor-rich gradient is the most important gradient for the majority of mire biota and can display a time dimension as well. In order to fill this gap we studied modern testacean assemblages in spring fens in the Western Carpathians (Czech Republic and Slovakia). The DCA of all testacean assemblages revealed two major factors controlling species variation, the poor-rich gradient and the microhabitat-type: waterlogged bare sediments versus bryophytes. Sampled sediments of poor acidic fens have species composition similar to that of bryophyte tufts from mineral-richer fens. The ordination of the subset of samples taken from bryophyte tufts shows the clear poor-rich gradient on the first axis and moisture gradient causing variation of "acid" samples along the second axis. Based of DCA results, testacean assemblages were divided into six major types for which the diagnostic species were determined using phi-coefficient. Nearly all types are dominated by Euglyphidae, Centropyxidae, Cyclopyxidae and Difflugiidae were characteristic for calcareous habitats. Species richness did not correlate with the poor-rich gradient. The species variation in testate amoebae assemblages is better predicted by both the species composition of the vegetation as a whole and by the composition of bryophyte tuft than by long-term averages of water chemistry variables. The autecology of many species living in acid Sphagnum fens corresponds well with published data with several exceptions. On the other hand, the study of the complete poor-rich gradient revealed different species optima reported from higher pH Sphagnum fens, and thus it changed our view on the indicative value of some species.

AB In 1993, experiments on the restoration of calcareous grasslands on ex-arable fields were started in order to provide new habitats for species of a small nature reserve with ancient grasslands north of Munich (Germany). The effects of diaspore transfer by the application of seed-containing hay on vegetation establishment were studied on restoration fields with and without topsoil removal for 5 years. The aim of the study was to assess plant diversity for the evaluation of restoration success by different methods including determination of species with viable seeds in the hay by germination tests, phenological investigations on hay-transfer source sites at the time of harvest, and vegetation analyses on the restoration sites. Total seed content of the hay and the number and composition of plant species with viable seeds were affected by the time of harvesting and differed between a site which had been used as arable field until 1959 and ancient grassland sites. Nevertheless, the number of established hay-transfer species showed only few differences between restoration fields. The proportion of species transferred to restoration fields in relation to the number of species with viable seeds in the hay was between 69 and 89%. Five years after the hay transfer, the proportion of the established species was still between 58 and 76%. Up to now, topsoil removal had no significant effect on the number of established hay-transfer species. After triple hay application the absolute number of transferred grassland species was higher than on sites with single hay application, but restoration efficiency was lower because many of the species with viable seeds in the hay did not establish. In general, our results showed that the transfer of autochthonous hay is a successful method to overcome dispersal limitation in restoration projects.

AB Myricaria laxiflora is restricted to the riverbanks of the Yangtze River valley and will be completely lost owing to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. Genetic diversity and structure of nine natural and one ex situ populations were investigated using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). A moderate level of gene diversity was found in natural populations, while the ex situ population had the highest. The F statistics calculated by different approaches consistently revealed a high genetic differentiation among natural populations, contributing > 45% of the total gene diversity. The Bayesian-based analysis differentiated nine independent populations in accordance with the sites sampled. Estimates of gene flow by F-ST and coalescent-based simulation analysis indicated a restricted recurrent gene exchange among populations (Nm = 0.290-0.401), whereas genetic distance-based clustering and coalescent-based assignment analyses revealed significant genetic isolation among populations. The migration pattern in M. laxiflora is best explained by a classical metapopulation model, but with a unique unidirectional direction underlined by hydrochoric force that drove dispersal of seeds and propagules from upstream toward downstream populations. Previous efforts in preserving genomic integrity in ex situ conservation were evaluated, and the results provide valuable information to formulate conservation guidelines for successfully reintroducing M. laxiflora to the wild.

AB 1. In many animals, the size of secondary sexual ornaments is known to be related to the probability of victory in fights between males, and hence to fighting ability. However, few studies have attempted to link fighting ability to any physical performance measures.
   2. Here we show that horn size in the dung beetle Euoniticellus intermedius accurately predicts two types of whole-organism performance, independent of body size, that are likely to play an important role in male contests: the force required to pull a beetle out of a tunnel, and the distance the beetle was able to run before exhaustion (maximum exertion).
   3. Body length is also a statistically significant predictor of pulling force, but not of exertion, suggesting that horn size is a more reliable predictor of performance than body size alone, a result that is consistent with a previous finding that horn size becomes more important in determining victory in male-male contests as body size increases.
   4. This study is the first to establish direct links between whole-organism performance abilities, male armaments and fighting ability in the same species. Our findings suggest that physiological performance capacities are important factors underlying the evolution of signal expression in E. intermedius, and should be considered in future studies of the evolution of animal signalling.

AB In order to evaluate the degree of carbon autonomy for fruit development, the carbon source-sink relationship in fruit-bearing branchlets of mature deciduous forest trees was manipulated in situ. The tests included half and complete defoliation, girdling or the combination of both treatments, which were applied on fruiting branchlets by using a canopy crane. Concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) were analysed in different branchlet tissues and fruits, to identify situations of carbon imbalances induced by the treatments. NSC concentrations of branchlets were generally lower under treatments resulting in decreased fruit growth. All three investigated species (Carpinus betulus, Fagus sylvatica and Tilia platyphyllos) exhibited complete carbon autonomy of fruiting at the level of whole, undisturbed branchlets, since neither a decrease of total infructescence biomass, nor of individual fruit mass occurred on girdled, un-defoliated branchlets. On girdled, 100% defoliated branchlets, fruit biomass relative to controls decreased by approximately 50% in Carpinus and Tilia, but by almost 80% in Fagus, which can be explained by different proportions of photosynthetically active infructescence tissues among the species. In contrast to the other two species, Tilia branchlets did not import carbon to compensate for assimilate loss after defoliation.

AB Female ornaments are expected to evolve through sexual selection when male parental investment is high. Blue-footed boobies are socially monogamous seabirds with a long period of biparental care. Males and females have colourful feet that are displayed ostentatiously during courtship, both before and after pairing, and extrapair copulations are frequent. We manipulated the foot colour of paired females to test whether this trait influences male courting behaviour, used here as an index of male preferences. There were no differences in time spent at the courting site, frequency of female courtship or frequency of copulations of 11 control and 15 experimental pairs. Experimental females, which had duller feet, received less intra- and extrapair courtship, suggesting that foot colour influences female attractiveness and opportunities for extrapair interactions. Our results support the idea that female foot colour in the blue-footed booby is favoured by sexual selection through male preference. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study, of Animal Behaviour.

AB The effects of restorative grazing on species composition and community structure of butterflies and moths were studied in mesic semi-natural grasslands differing in their management history: (1) old continuously grazed pastures, (2) restored pastures with similar to5 yr of reinitiated grazing, and (3) abandoned former pastures. Butterflies and moths were counted with a transect method during 1999 and 2000 in 33 study sites in southwest Finland. In a multivariate ordination (NMDS), the studied grasslands were separated from each other on the basis of their species composition so that the actively grazed pastures differed from abandoned pastures. The first ordination, axis represented most (73%) of the variation in species composition, and it was strongly correlated with variables describing the current grazing intensity. Species richness and total abundance were highest in abandoned pastures, both for all species and for grassland-preferring species. In contrast, relative diversity (N-1, N-2, and alpha) and evenness (Alatalo's evenness index) were in most cases highest in old pastures and lowest in abandoned pastures. Generalized linear models (GLM) were constructed for four response variables: total species richness, grassland species richness, abundance of all species, and abundance of grassland species. The derived models explained 78-84% of the total variation for species richness and 92-93% for abundance, and the type of grazing history explained the largest proportion of variation. Mean vegetation height was included in the abundance models as a quadratic function, which indicated that butterflies and moths were most abundant at an intermediate level of grazing intensity, as predicted by the "dynamic equilibrium model." The results suggest that grazing management is a useful tool in the restoration of insect communities of abandoned semi-natural grasslands. In order to enhance the survival of species suffering from continuously high grazing intensity, the existing management instructions should be developed toward construction of regional networks of semi-natural grasslands, which would allow differing grazing intensities or rotational grazing on the patch level, but simultaneously ensure continuity of varying management regimes on a regional level.

AB Common raccoons (Procyon lotor (L., 1758)), Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana Kerr, 1792), and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis (Schreber, 1776)) are common urban inhabitants, yet their relative demographic response to urbanization is unknown. Urbanization often affects community structure, and understanding these effects is essential in rapidly changing landscapes. We examined mesopredator-community structure in small and large patches of natural habitat surrounded by urban, suburban, or rural matrices. We created generalized logit models using road-survey and livetrapping data to examine effects of surrounding land use on proportions of opossums and skunks relative to raccoons, while accounting for effects of season and year and their interactions. For large sites, the land use x season model was chosen for both data sets, and occurrence of opossums and skunks relative to raccoons was higher at the rural site (P < 0.001 for all tests). For small sites, the land-use model best fit the road-survey data, with a higher occurrence of skunks relative to raccoons at the rural site (chi(2) = 21.06, df = 1, P < 0.001). However, the season model best fit the trapping data for small sites. Our data indicated that raccoons exhibited a greater demographic response to urbanization, suggesting that they exploit anthropogenic resources more efficiently. Although numerous reasons exist for disparity in anthropogenic-resource use, differences in intraspecific tolerance and the role of learning in foraging behaviors were best supported by our observations.

AB To further assess the usefulness of stable isotope ratios for understanding elemental cycling and fungal ecology, we measured delta(15)N and delta(13)C in ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic macrofungi, plants, woody debris and soils from two old-growth conifer forests in Olympic National Park, Washington, USA.
   Ecosystem isotope patterns were similar at the two forests, but differences existed that appear to reflect soil nitrogen availability and C allocation within the ectomycorrhizal symbioses. delta(15)N and delta(13)C of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi differed in both forests, and a dual delta(15)N/delta(13)C plot provided the best means of distinguishing them. Within both groups, delta(15)N and delta(13)C differed among genera and species, and the difference in species composition was an important determinant of the different overall delta(15)N of the ectomycorrhizal fungi at the two forests.
   Variation in multiple ecophysiological traits such as organic N use, mycelial morphology and transfer of N to phytobionts appears to underlie the variation in the isotope signatures of ectomycorrhizal fungi.
   The varied isotope signatures of ectomycorrhizal fungi suggest considerable functional diversity among them. Life-history strategies could provide a framework for interpreting these patterns.

AB The number of greater prairie-chickens in Wisconsin has decreased by 91% since 1932. The current population of approximately 1500 birds exists primarily in four isolated management areas. In previous studies of the Wisconsin populations we documented low levels of genetic variation at microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial DNA control region. Here we investigate changes in genetic structure between the four management areas in Wisconsin over the last 50 years. We estimated the harmonic mean effective population size (N-e) over the last 50 years by comparing allele frequencies from the early 1950s with those from contemporary samples. Using a pseudo-likelihood approach that accounted for migration, estimates of N-e (15-32 prairie-chickens within each management area) were 10 times lower than census numbers from booming-ground counts. These low estimates of N-e are consistent with increased habitat fragmentation and an increase in genetic isolation between management areas over the last 50 years. The reduction of gene flow between areas has reduced N-e, increased genetic drift and, consequently, reduced genetic variation. These results have immediate consequences for the conservation of the prairie-chicken, and highlight the importance of how mating systems and limited dispersal may exacerbate the loss of genetic variation in fragmented populations.

AB Although there has been a clear quantitative and qualitative decline in traditional hedgerow network landscapes during last century, hedgerows are crucial for the conservation of rural biodiversity, functioning as an important habitat, refuge and corridor for numerous species. To safeguard this conservation function, insight in the basic organizing principles of hedgerow plant communities is needed. The vegetation composition of 511 individual hedgerows situated within an ancient hedgerow network landscape in Flanders, Belgium was recorded, in combination with a wide range of explanatory variables, including a selection of spatial variables. Non-parametric statistics in combination with multivariate data analysis techniques were used to study the effect of individual explanatory variables. Next, variables were grouped in five distinct subsets and the relative importance of these variable groups was assessed by two related variation partitioning techniques, partial regression and partial canonical correspondence analysis, taking into account explicitly the existence of intercorrelations between variables of different factor groups. Most explanatory variables affected significantly hedgerow species richness and composition. Multivariate analysis showed that, besides adjacent land use, hedgerow management, soil conditions, hedgerow type and origin, the role of other factors such as hedge dimensions, intactness, etc., could certainly not be neglected. Furthermore, both methods revealed the same overall ranking of the five distinct factor groups. Besides a predominant impact of abiotic environmental conditions, it was found that management variables and structural aspects have a relatively larger influence on the distribution of plant species in hedgerows than their historical background or spatial configuration.

AB We inferred past admixture processes in the European population from genetic diversity at eight loci, including autosomal, mitochondrial and Y-linked polymorphisms. Admixture coefficients were estimated from multilocus data, assuming that most current populations can be regarded as the result of a hybridization process among four or less potential parental populations. Two main components are apparent in the Europeans' genome, presumably corresponding to the contributions of the first, Paleolithic Europeans, and of the early, Neolithic farmers dispersing from the Near East. In addition, only a small fraction of the European alleles seems to come from North Africa, and a fourth component reflecting gene flow from Northern Asia is largely restricted to the northeast of the continent. The estimated Near Eastern contribution decreases as one moves from east to west, in agreement with the predictions of a model in which (Neolithic) immigrants from the Near East contributed a large share of the alleles in the genome of current Europeans. Several tests suggest that probable departures from the admixture models, due to factors such as choice of the putative parental populations and more complex demographic scenarios, may have affected our main estimates only to a limited extent.

ID TETRAO-UROGALLUS; SUCCESS; HABITAT; SIZE
AB 1. The capercaillie Tetrao urogallus and black grouse Tetrao tetrix are declining in the UK, and low breeding success has been identified as the key factor in the decline of the former. To investigate possible causes, breeding productivity was studied in relation to predation, weather, vegetation changes and deer numbers over an 11-year period (1989-99) within native pinewood at Abernethy Forest, Scotland. The abundance of predators (crows Corvus corone and red foxes Vulpes vulpes) was experimentally manipulated in 1992-96 by culling. Productivity (chicks reared per female) was compared between forests with and without experimental predator management.
   2. During predator control, the number of breeding crows was reduced from 10 pairs to one. The attempted reduction in red fox abundance was unsuccessful; only small numbers of adults were killed, and neither scat nor den counts declined significantly.
   3. Predation on artificial nests containing six hen eggs and a hen egg filled with wax was measured as an index of predator activity from 1991 to 1999. Predation was lowest during the last three years of predator control, 1994-96. Predators could sometimes be distinguished by signs on depredated eggs. Predation on artificial nests by crows was highest during 1991-93. However, after predator removal stopped in 1997 few crows returned, and increased predation on artificial nests did not involve increased signs of crow predation. Pine marten Martes martes numbers increased during the study period and became significant predators of artificial nests.
   4. The total number of capercaillie eggs and nests depredated by crows was estimated from the number of depredated capercaillie eggs found and the proportion of crow-predated hen eggs in artificial nests. The values ranged from 18 to 158 eggs over 3 years, equivalent to 3-23 capercaillie nests year(-1).
   5. Capercaillie productivity was low (< 1 chick per female) during 1989-93 and 1997-99 but higher during 1994-96. Compared with nine other forests in Scotland, changes in capercaillie productivity at Abernethy were different. Productivity at Abernethy was negatively related to June rainfall, and to the minimum daily predation rate on artificial nests by crows. There was also a significant interaction in that capercaillie were most productive when low rainfall coincided with low predation by crows on artificial nests.
   6. The productivities of black grouse and capercaillie were positively correlated, but greater in the former. As in capercaillie, black grouse productivity was negatively related both to June rainfall and the minimum daily predation rate on artificial nests by crows, and there was an interaction.
   7. Synthesis and applications. The long-term increase in crows and red foxes and the predicted increase in rainfall in Scotland may have negative effects on capercaillie and black grouse. In the short term, control of crows is likely to improve productivity. In the long term, increased woodland size and some reversal of fragmentation might decrease the access to woodland of predators associated with the interface between farmland and woodland.

AB A critical but poorly understood pattern in macroecology is the often unimodal species - body size distribution ( also known as body size - diversity relationship) in a local community ( embedded in a much larger regional species pool). Purely neutral community models that assume functional equivalence among species are incapable of explaining this pattern because body size is the key determinant of functional differences between species. Several niche-based explanations have been offered, but none of them is completely satisfactory. Here we develop a simple model that unites a neutral community model with niche-based theory to explain the relationship. In the model, species of similar size are assumed to belong to the same size guild. Within a size guild, all individuals are equivalent in their competition for resources, sensu Hubbell's neutral community model; they have the same speciation rate and dispersal capacities. Between size guilds, however, the total number of individuals, the speciation rate, and the dispersal capacities differ, but using known allometric scaling laws for these properties, we can describe the differences between size guilds. Our model predicts that species richness reaches an optimum at an intermediate body size, in agreement with observations. The optimum at intermediate body size is basically the result of a trade-off between, on the one hand, allometric scaling laws for the number of individuals and the speciation rate that decrease with body size and, on the other hand, the scaling law for active dispersal that increases with body size.

AB To investigate whether changes in land use and associated forest patch turnover affected genetic diversity and structure of the forest herb Primula elatior, historical data on landscape changes were combined with a population genetic analysis using dominant amplified fragment length polymorphism markers. Based on nine topographic maps, landscape history was reconstructed and forest patches were assigned to two age classes: young (less than 35 years) and old (more than 35 years). The level of differentiation among Primula populations in recently established patches was compared with the level of differentiation among populations in older patches. Genetic diversity was independent of population size (P > 0.05). Most genetic variation was present within populations. Within-population diversity levels tended to be higher for populations located in older forests compared with those for populations located in young forests (H-j = 0.297 and 0.285, respectively). Total gene diversity was also higher for old than for young populations (H-t = 0.2987 and 0.2828, respectively). The global fixation index F-ST averaged over loci was low, but significant. Populations in older patches were significantly more differentiated from each other than were populations in recently established patches and they showed significant isolation by distance. In contrast, no significant correlations between pairwise geographical distance and F-ST were found for populations in recently established patches. The location of young and old populations in the studied system and altered gene flow because of increased population density and decreased inter-patch distances between extant populations may explain the observed lower genetic differentiation in the younger populations. This study exemplifies the importance of incorporating data on historical landscape changes in population genetic research at the landscape scale.

AB In this paper, we present a statistical method called STATICO that can be used to analyze series of pairs of ecological tables. The objective of this method is to find the stable part in the dynamics of the relationships between the species and their environment. The treateddata are a sequence of pairs of ecological tables. Each pair is made of a species abundance table (species in columns) and an environmental variables table (variables in columns). The sampling sites (in rows) must be the same for the two tables of one pair, but they may be different among the pairs. The environmental variables must be the same in all the environmental tables, and the list of species must be the same in all the species tables too, although some species may be absent from some tables (the corresponding columns will contain all zeros). From a statistical point of view, STATICO is a multitable analysis (partial triadic analysis) performed on the series of cross-tables resulting from the co-inertia analysis of each pair of tables. A small ecological example data set is analyzed and the results are discussed to show how this method can be used to extract the stable part of species-environment relationships. All computations and graphical displays can be performed with free software available on Internet.

AB Experimental CO2 enrichment of mature Larix decidua and Pinus uncinata trees and their understory vegetation was used to test the carbon limitation hypothesis of treeline formation at the alpine treeline in Switzerland.
   Forty plots (each 1.1 m(2)) were established; half of them were exposed to elevated (566 ppm) atmospheric CO2 using a free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) system releasing pure CO2, and the other half were treated as controls at current ambient [CO2].
   Reliable and adequate CO2 control was achieved, with 63% and 90% of 1-min averages having a [CO2] within +/-10% and +/-20% of the target value, respectively, which is comparable to previous FACE systems. Both tree species showed higher net photosynthesis, lower stomatal conductance, and increased accumulation of nonstructural carbohydrates in response to CO2 in the first year of treatment. Quite unexpectedly, shoot length increment increased significantly at elevated CO2 (up to 23%) compared with controls in both species.
   The pure CO2 release technology proved suitable for CO2 enrichment of native trees on this remote mountain slope. Our results suggest an improved C balance and growth of treeline trees in response to elevated CO2. However, it is unclear whether this initial growth stimulation will persist in the longer term.

AB This study aims at testing whether whole plant and aerial metamer traits of Rubia peregrina L., a small clonal shrub, differed in magnitude of response to variations in light, nutrient or water availability, comparing plants at the same age. The second aim was to test whether it was possible to identify a limited set of traits to assess phenotypic plasticity. Almost all traits significantly differed among treatments. These differences were partly due to changes in plant size for two whole plant and one metamer traits. No difference in grand plasticity, calculated with adjusted means correcting for size effect, was found between whole plant and aerial metamer traits. Some traits responded only to one resource (e.g. mean internode length to light) or two resources (e.g. SLA to light and nutrient). Root Mass Ratio was the most responsive of traits showing similar magnitude of plasticity to each of the three resources. These results suggest that (i) no clear difference in plasticity exists between whole plant and aerial metamer traits; (ii) allocation-related traits are of more general value than aerial metamer traits to assess the plasticity of a species.

AB [1] The northern latitudes have warmed by similar to0.8degreesC since the early 1970s, but not all areas have warmed equally. Eurasia shows an overall warming trend, while North America exhibits warming at a lower rate and even a slight cooling trend during the last 50 years in the eastern United States. We analyzed a recently developed satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data set (July 1981 to December 1999) to assess vegetation response to these temperature changes. An index of persistence of the NDVI trend was used to generate patches of different levels of persistence. The persistence data were analyzed for patch area, patch perimeter, patch number, patch coherence, largest patch size, patch fragmentation, pixel contiguity, pixel clustering, and conditional probability of pixel adjacency. We address two questions: (1) Is there a difference in the spatial pattern of long-term NDVI increase in comparison to short-term increase? and (2) Are there differences in the spatial patterns of patches between Eurasia and North America? The results indicate a persistent and spatially extensive and connected greening trend in Eurasia, relative to North America. The regions showing short-term greening in Eurasia show a scattered pattern of spatially remote small patches. In North America the long-term greening pattern is spatially fragmented, and a mixture of short-and long-term NDVI increase is found, unlike in Eurasia. Therefore we conclude that the greening trend in Eurasia is more persistent and spatially extensive than in North America, which is qualitatively consistent with near-surface air temperature observations.

AB One of the main tasks confronting community ecologists is to explain why a particular site harbours a certain number of species. The site might range from a drop of water to the whole Earth, and the species might be drawn from a very restricted taxon or include all living organisms. The common problem, however, is to understand the relative importance of speciation and extinction and, more locally, of immigration and loss. speciation is the ultimate motor driving biodiversity and ecologists need to know the factors influencing rates of speciation, and whether there is a feedback, positive or negative, between species numbers and the generation of new tare. However, the relative importance of speciation and other factors determining species numbers varies crucially across different scales of enquiry. Here, we explore some of these issues as we move from a macro- to microscale perspective, focusing on a limited number of studies that we believe make important advances in the field.

AB Most aquatic beetles in the family Dytiscidae are tightly associated either with running (lotic) or stagnant (lentic) water bodies. The range size of lotic species is known to be, on average, much smaller than that of lentic species, presumably as a result of differences in dispersal strategies in each habitat type. We explored possible effects of these differences on clade evolution and speciation rates by comparing species-level phylogenies based on cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and 16S rRNA mitochondrial genes for two genera, the lentic Ilybius and the lotic Deronectes. The expectation that species turnover is higher in lotic lineages due to their lower dispersal propensity compared to lentic species was not strongly supported. Deronectes displays a higher frequency of recent splits than Ilybius, consistent with the hypothesis, but the difference was not significant compared to expected patterns under a constant speciation rate null model. Similarly, when the degree of sympatry was plotted against relative node age, more allopatric splits were evident in the lentic Deronectes, suggesting a slower rate of range movement since speciation, but the differences were not significant. We discuss two explanations for our failure to detect differences between the two clades. First, current methods for analysing species-level phylogenies may be sensitive to taxonomic and sampling artefacts. Second, lentic and lotic clades may indeed display similar levels of species turnover despite occupying very different habitats at different spatial scales. More work is needed to investigate the effects of population level processes and spatial scale on macroevolutionary dynamics.

TI Habitat loss and raptor predation: disentangling long- and short-term

AB The number of red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) shot in the UK has declined by 50% during the 20th century. This decline has coincided with reductions in the area of suitable habitat and recoveries in the populations of some avian predators. Here we use long-term records of shooting bags and a large-scale manipulation of raptor density to disentangle the effects of habitat loss and raptor predation on grouse populations. The numbers of grouse harvested on the Eskdale half of Langholm Moor in southern Scotland declined significantly during 1913-1990 and grouse bags from the whole moor from 1950 to 1990 exhibited an almost identical but non-significant trend. Hen harriers (Circus cyaneus) and peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) were absent or bred at low densities on this moor throughout this period but heather-dominant vegetation declined by 48% between 1948 and 1988. Harrier and peregrine breeding numbers on Langholm Moor increased to high levels following protection in 1990 whilst grouse density and grouse bags declined year after year until shooting was abandoned in 1998. The prediction of a peak in grouse bags on Langholm Moor in 1996 based on the patterns of bags during 1950-1990 was supported by the observed peaks in 1997 on two nearby moors with few raptors which formerly cycled in synchrony with Langholm Moor. This study demonstrates that, whilst long-term declines in grouse bags were most probably due to habitat loss, high levels of raptor predation subsequently limited the grouse population and suppressed a cycle. This study thus offers support to theoretical models which predict that generalist predators may suppress cycles in prey populations.

AB A drastic decline has occurred in the size of the Uganda elephant population in the last 40 years, exacerbated by two main factors; an increase in the size of the human population and poaching for ivory. One of the attendant consequences of such a decline is a reduction in the amount of genetic diversity in the surviving populations due to increased effects of random genetic drift. Information about the amount of genetic variation within and between the remaining populations is vital for their future conservation and management. The genetic structure of the African elephant in Uganda was examined using nucleotide variation of mitochondrial control region sequences and four nuclear microsatellite loci in 72 individuals from three localities. Eleven mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes were observed, nine of which were geographically localized. We found significant genetic differentiation between the three populations at the mitochondrial locus while three out of the four microsatellite loci differentiated KV and QE, one locus differentiated KV and MF and no loci differentiated MF and QE. Expected heterozygosity at the four loci varied between 0.51 and 0.84 while nucleotide diversity at the mitochondrial locus was 1.4%. Incongruent patterns of genetic variation within and between populations were revealed by the two genetic systems, and we have explained these in terms of the differences in the effective population sizes of the two genomes and male-biased gene now between populations.

AB The utility of regression and correspondence models for deducing climate from leaf physiognomy was evaluated by the comparative application of different predictive models to the same three leaf assemblages. Mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), and growing season precipitation (GSP) were estimated from the morphological characteristics of samples of living leaves from two extant forests and an assemblage of fossil leaves. The extant forests are located near Gainesville, Florida, and in the Florida Keys; the fossils were collected from the Eocene Clarno Nut Beds, Oregon. Simple linear regression (SLR), multiple linear regression (MLR), and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to estimate temperature and precipitation. The SLR models used only the percentage of species having entire leaf margins as a predictor for MAT and leaf size as a predictor for MAP. The MLR models used from two to six leaf characters as predictors, and the CCA used 31 characters. In comparisons between actual and predicted values for the extant forests, errors in prediction of MAT were 0.6 degrees-5.7 degrees C, and errors in prediction of precipitation were 6-89 cm (=6-66%). At the Gainesville site, seven models underestimated MAT and only one overestimated it, whereas at the Keys site, all eight models overestimated MAT. Precipitation was overestimated by all four models at Gainesville, and by three of them at the Keys. The MAT estimates from the Clarno leaf assemblage ranged from 14.3 degrees to 18.8 degrees C, and the precipitation estimates from 227 to 363 cm for MAP and from 195 to 295 cm for GSP.

AB Successful habitat conservation or restoration must be biologically based, which requires an understanding of habitat variables most influencing fish; the relative influence of each habitat variable and the spatial scale over which each operates. Determining necessary habitat conditions requires examination from several perspectives, including observation of individual fish during all seasons and population analysis over a range of spatial scales. There is a definite spatial hierarchy of influences that must be addressed to separate those habitat conditions responsible for presence and abundance from those habitat conditions responsible for within-stream distribution. A case study of habitat factors influencing smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) in Missouri streams indicates that examination at the smallest spatial scales allows one to determine the influence of habitat conditions (depths, velocities, cover factors) relating mainly to the fish's distribution in a stream reach. Evaluation of populations at the stream-system level allows an understanding of how individual fish preferences relate to amounts of habitat as determined by geomorphic and fluvial dynamic forces and how this influences standing stocks throughout a stream system. Evaluation at the ecoregion level shows the overriding influence of physiographic variables on both the presence and abundance of fish across stream systems, as well as the importance of land use.

AB 1. Macroinvertebrate species and information on thirty-nine variables were recorded at forty-six sites on twelve Cornish streams affected to varying extents by past metalliferous mining.
   2. Relationships between macroinvertebrate communities and environmental variables were examined using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Copper was the strongest correlate with Axis 1 of the analysis, suggesting that it may have a major role in determining community structure. There were also strong correlations between Axis 1 and aluminium, alkalinity, pH, dissolved organic matter and algal cover, and between Axis 2 and discharge.
   3. CCA distinguished four site groupings. In spite of seasonal changes in position on the ordination, as revealed through CCA and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), sites retained their group membership. There were differences in the proportions of the major taxa within the four CCA-derived groups. In the group with the highest copper concentration, Ephemeroptera were absent, but triclads and chironomids were abundant, with Orthocladiinae the dominant group.
   4. Changes in the occurrence of species along the metal gradient reflected changes in sensitivity. 'Tolerance' plots of selected species based on the CCA site ordination diagram were used to identify environmental thresholds.
   5. As well as direct toxic effects of copper and aluminium on invertebrate communities, co-precipitation of these two metals could be an important physical factor. Further modifying influences resulting from interactions between toxic metals and pH, alkalinity, hardness and dissolved organic matter contributed to the complexity of conditions affecting the faunal community in metal-contaminated streams.
   6. The most severely contaminated sites, with mean copper concentration exceeding 500 mugl-1, were all characterized by a reduced community dominated by the flatworm Phagocata vitta, the chironomids Chaetocladius melaleucus and Eukiefferiella claripennis and the net-spinning caddis Plectrocnemia conspersa. The necessity for species identification is demonstrated in relation to variation in metal tolerance.

AB A search in the database of known three-dimensional protein structures with the structure of a plant endochitinase revealed a subtle but unambiguous similarity to lysozymes from animals and phages. An evolutionary connection between plant endochitinases and lysozymes is supported by similar overall topology of fold, overlapping substrate specificities and remarkable conservation of some sequence and architectural detail around the active site. Much of the knowledge about lysozyme can now be extended by analogy to endochitinase. New insights into the mechanism of endochitinase are expected to stimulate genetic engineering studies into plant defense mechanisms against pests and pathogens.

AB It is becoming increasingly clear that densities and dynamics of various organisms often cannot be understood from the processes occurring within separate habitat patches. Effects from surrounding areas also have to be considered; a landscape perspective has to be employed. Habitat mosaics affect diversity and dynamics both in pristine and managed boreal landscapes. There is increasing interest in the landscape ecology of boreal forests and many important processes have been identified as being driven or affected by environmental heterogeneity. Comparisons between ecological processes in original and managed boreal landscapes are urgently needed.

AB Short-distance dispersal in cooperatively breeding birds is demonstrated and a new model describes how it could be causally related to delayed breeding. Nonbreeders are hypothesized to wait for specific, adjacent territories of high quality. Strong, predictable differences in territory quality select for extended natal philopatry in comparison with species whose young disperse upon maturity. A nonbreeder's ability to discriminate territory quality, and competitive advantages of age and proximity in obtaining nearby breeding positions, are necessary conditions of this model. Direct benefits to both males (potential for inheritance of a breeding position on the natal territory) and females (priority to nearby territories of high quality) result from philopatry. This model differs from most others by emphasizing potential direct benefits of delayed dispersal, rather than assuming constraints, such as habitat saturation. Short-distance dispersal is widespread in other bird and mammal social systems characterized by natal philopatry and delayed breeding, suggesting a general application of this model.

AB Plant growth is usually constrained by the availability of nutrients, water, or temperature, rather than photosynthetic carbon (C) fixation. Under these condi-tions leaf growth is curtailed more than C fixation, and the surplus photosynthates are exported from the leaf. In plants limited by nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P), photosynthates are converted into sugars and secondary metabolites. Some surplus C is translocated to roots and released as root exudates or transferred to root-associated microorganisms. Surplus C is also produced under low moisture availability, low temperature, and high atmospheric CO2 concentrations, with similar below-ground effects. Many interactions among aboveand below ground ecosystem components can be parsimoniously explained by the production, distribution, and release of surplus C under conditions that limit plant growth.

   PROBLEM
AB Quantitative knowledge of the surface energy balance is essential for the prediction of weather and climate. However, a multitude of studies from around the world indicate that the turbulent heat fluxes are generally underestimated using eddy-covariance measurements, and hence, the energy balance is not closed. This energy-balance-closure problem, which has been heavily covered in the literature for more than 25 years, is the topic of the present review, in which we provide an overview of the potential reason for the lack of closure. We demonstrate the effects of the diurnal cycle on the energy balance closure, and address questions with regard to the partitioning of the energy balance residual between the sensible and the latent fluxes, and whether the magnitude of the flux underestimation can be predicted based on other variables typically measured at micrometeorological stations. Remaining open questions are discussed and potential avenues for future research on this topic are laid out. Integrated studies, combining multi-tower experiments and scale-crossing, spatially-resolving lidar and airborne measurements with high-resolution large-eddy simulations, are considered to be of critical importance for enhancing our understanding of the underlying transport processes in the atmospheric boundary layer.

AB Adaptive radiation plays a fundamental role in our understanding of the evolutionary process. However, the concept has provoked strong and differing opinions concerning its definition and nature among researchers studying a wide diversity of systems. Here, we take a broad view of what constitutes an adaptive radiation, and seek to find commonalities among disparate examples, ranging from plants to invertebrate and vertebrate animals, and remote islands to lakes and continents, to better understand processes shared across adaptive radiations. We surveyed many groups to evaluate factors considered important in a large variety of species radiations. In each of these studies, ecological opportunity of some form is identified as a prerequisite for adaptive radiation. However, evolvability, which can be enhanced by hybridization between distantly related species, may play a role in seeding entire radiations. Within radiations, the processes that lead to speciation depend largely on (1) whether the primary drivers of ecological shifts are (a) external to the membership of the radiation itself (mostly divergent or disruptive ecological selection) or (b) due to competition within the radiation membership (interactions among members) subsequent to reproductive isolation in similar environments, and (2) the extent and timing of admixture. These differences translate into different patterns of species accumulation and subsequent patterns of diversity across an adaptive radiation. Adaptive radiations occur in an extraordinary diversity of different ways, and continue to provide rich data for a better understanding of the diversification of life.

   TOXICITY; DECLINES; EXPOSURE; ARRIVAL; TRENDS
AB Neonicotinoids are neurotoxic insecticides widely used as seed treatments, but little is known of their effects on migrating birds that forage in agricultural areas. We tracked the migratory movements of imidacloprid-exposed songbirds at a landscape scale using a combination of experimental dosing and automated radio telemetry. Ingestion of field-realistic quantities of imidacloprid (1.2 or 3.9 milligrams per kilogram body mass) by white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys) during migratory stopover caused a rapid reduction in food consumption, mass, and fat and significantly affected their probability of departure. Birds in the high-dose treatment stayed a median of 3.5 days longer at the site of capture after exposure as compared with controls, likely to regain fuel stores or recover from intoxication. Migration delays can carry over to affect survival and reproduction: thus, these results confirm a link between sublethal pesticide exposure and adverse outcomes for migratory bird populations.

AB The use of semi-isolated habitats such as oceanic islands, lakes and mountain summits as model systems has played a crucial role in the development of evolutionary and ecological theory. Soon after the discovery of life in caves, different pioneering authors similarly recognized the great potential of these peculiar habitats as biological model systems. In their 1969 paper in Science, 'The cave environment', Poulson and White discussed how caves can be used as natural laboratories in which to study the underlying principles governing the dynamics of more complex environments. Together with other seminal syntheses published at the time, this work contributed to establishing the conceptual foundation for expanding the scope and relevance of cave-based studies. Fifty years after, the aim of this review is to show why and how caves and other subterranean habitats can be used as eco-evolutionary laboratories. Recent advances and directions in different areas are provided, encompassing community ecology, trophic-webs and ecological networks, conservation biology, macroecology and climate change biology. Special emphasis is given to discuss how caves are only part of the extended network of fissures and cracks that permeate most substrates and, thus, their ecological role as habitat islands is critically discussed. Numerous studies have quantified the relative contribution of abiotic, biotic and historical factors in driving species distributions and community turnovers in space and time, from local to regional scales. Conversely, knowledge of macroecological patterns of subterranean organisms at a global scale remains largely elusive, due to major geographical and taxonomical biases. Also, knowledge regarding subterranean trophic webs and the effect of anthropogenic climate change on deep subterranean ecosystems is still limited. In these research fields, the extensive use of novel molecular and statistical tools may hold promise for quickly producing relevant information not accessible hitherto.

AB We estimate global terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) based on models that use satellite data within a simplified light-use efficiency framework that does not rely upon other meteorological inputs. Satellite-based geometry-adjusted reflectances are from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and provide information about vegetation structure and chlorophyll content at both high temporal (daily to monthly) and spatial (similar to 1 km) resolution. We use satellite-derived solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) to identify regions of high productivity crops and also evaluate the use of downscaled SIF to estimate GPP. We calibrate a set of our satellite-based models with GPP estimates from a subset of distributed eddy covariance flux towers (FLUXNET 2015). The results of the trained models are evaluated using an independent subset of FLUXNET 2015 GPP data. We show that variations in light-use efficiency (LUE) with incident PAR are important and can be easily incorporated into the models. Unlike many LUE-based models, our satellite-based GPP estimates do not use an explicit parameterization of LUE that reduces its value from the potential maximum under limiting conditions such as temperature and water stress. Even without the parameterized downward regulation, our simplified models are shown to perform as well as or better than state-of-the-art satellite data-driven products that incorporate such parameterizations. A significant fraction of both spatial and temporal variability in GPP across plant functional types can be accounted for using our satellite-based models. Our results provide an annual GPP value of similar to 140 Pg C year(-1) for 2007 that is within the range of a compilation of observation-based, model, and hybrid results, but is higher than some previous satellite observation-based estimates.

AB Green spaces embedded within the urban matrix, particularly residential yards, could mitigate negative aspects of urban development and provide pollinator habitat. Lawns represent a dominant green space, and their management consists of frequent mowing to inhibit the growth of ostensibly "weedy" species (e.g., dandelions and clover). Since widespread population declines of bees and other pollinators from habitat loss are a growing concern, these spontaneous flowers could provide pollen and nectar sources throughout the growing season. We experimentally tested whether different lawn mowing frequencies (1, 2 or 3 weeks) influenced bee abundance and diversity in 16 suburban western Massachusetts yards by increasing lawn floral resources. Lawns mowed every three weeks had as much as 2.5 times more lawn flowers than the other frequencies. Interestingly, lawns mowed every two weeks supported the highest bee abundance yet the lowest bee richness and evenness. We suggest these patterns were driven by a combination of more abundant floral resources (compared with 1-week yards), easier access to lawn flowers due to shorter grass and a more drastic impact on grass biomass and floral resources (compared with 3-week yards), and the dominance of a few generalist bees overwhelming our samples, thus driving richness and evenness. Our results highlight a "lazy lawnmower" approach to providing bee habitat. Mowing less frequently is practical, economical, and a timesaving alternative to lawn replacement or even planting pollinator gardens. Given the pervasiveness of lawns coupled with habitat loss, our findings provide immediate solutions for individual households to contribute to urban conservation.

AB Adaptation in the wild often involves standing genetic variation (SGV), which allows rapid responses to selection on ecological timescales. However, we still know little about how the evolutionary histories and genomic distributions of SGV influence local adaptation in natural populations. Here, we address this knowledge gap using the threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as a model. We extend restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to produce phased haplotypes approaching 700 base pairs (bp) in length at each of over 50,000 loci across the stickleback genome. Parallel adaptation in two geographically isolated freshwater pond populations consistently involved fixation of haplotypes that are identical-by-descent. In these same genomic regions, sequence divergence between marine and freshwater stickleback, as measured by d(XY), reaches tenfold higher than background levels and genomic variation is structured into distinct marine and freshwater haplogroups. By combining this dataset with a de novo genome assembly of a related species, the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), we find that this habitat-associated divergent variation averages six million years old, nearly twice the genome-wide average. The genomic variation that is involved in recent and rapid local adaptation in stickleback has therefore been evolving throughout the 15-million-year history since the two species lineages split. This long history of genomic divergence has maintained large genomic regions of ancient ancestry that include multiple chromosomal inversions and extensive linked variation. These discoveries of ancient genetic variation spread broadly across the genome in stickleback demonstrate how selection on ecological timescales is a result of genome evolution over geological timescales, and vice versa.

AB Positive relationships between biodiversity and urban ecosystem services (UES) are widely implied within both the scientific and policy literatures, along with the tacit suggestion that enhancing urban green infrastructure will automatically improve both biodiversity and UES. However, it is unclear how much published empirical evidence exists to support these assumptions. We conducted a review of studies published between 1990 and May 2017 that examined urban biodiversity ecosystem service (BES) relationships. In total, we reviewed 317 publications and found biodiversity and UES metrics mentioned 944 times. Only 228 (24%) of the 944 mentions were empirically tested. Among these, 119 (52%) demonstrated a positive BES relationship. Our review showed that taxonomic metrics were used most often as proxies for biodiversity, with very little attention given to functional biodiversity metrics. Similarly, the role of particular species, including non-natives, and specific functional traits are understudied. Finally, we found a paucity of empirical evidence underpinning urban BES relationships. As urban planners increasingly incorporate UES delivery consideration to their decision-making, researchers need to address these substantial knowledge gaps to allow potential trade-offs and synergies between biodiversity conservation and the promotion of UES to be adequately accounted for.

We used an El Nino drought event as a natural experiment to test whether postdrought recovery of gas exchange could be predicted by properties of the water transport system, or if metabolism, primarily high abscisic acid concentration, might delay recovery.
   We monitored detailed physiological responses, including shoot sapflow, leaf gas exchange, leaf water potential and foliar abscisic acid (ABA), during drought and through the subsequent rehydration period for a sample of eight canopy and understory species.
   Severe drought caused major declines in leaf water potential, elevated foliar ABA concentrations and reduced stomatal conductance and assimilation rates in our eight sample species. Leaf water potential surpassed levels associated with incipient loss of leaf hydraulic conductance in four species. Following heavy rainfall gas exchange in all species, except those trees predicted to have suffered hydraulic impairment, recovered to prestressed rates within 1 d.
   Recovery of plant gas exchange was rapid and could be predicted by the hydraulic safety margin, providing strong support for leaf vulnerability to water deficit as an index of damage under natural drought conditions.

AB Macroecology seeks to understand broad-scale patterns in the diversity and abundance of organisms, but macroecologists typically study aboveground macroorganisms. Belowground organisms regulate numerous ecosystem functions, yet we lack understanding of what drives their diversity. Here, we examine the controls on belowground diversity along latitudinal and elevational gradients. We performed a global meta-analysis of 325 soil communities across 20 studies conducted along temperature and soil pH gradients. Belowground taxa, whether bacterial or fungal, observed along a given gradient of temperature or soil pH were equally likely to show a linear increase, linear decrease, humped pattern, trough-shaped pattern, or no pattern in diversity along the gradient. Land-use intensity weakly affected the diversity-temperature relationship, but no other factor did so. Our study highlights disparities among diversity patterns of soil microbial communities. Belowground diversity may be controlled by the associated climatic and historical contexts of particular gradients, by factors not typically measured in community-level studies, or by processes operating at scales that do not match the temporal and spatial scales under study. Because these organisms are responsible for a suite of key processes, understanding the drivers of their distribution and diversity is fundamental to understanding the functioning of ecosystems.

AB Generating negative emissions by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is a key requirement for limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees C, or even 1.5 degrees C, and therefore for achieving the long-term climate goals of the recent Paris Agreement. Despite being a relatively young topic, negative emission technologies (NETs) have attracted growing attention in climate change research over the last decade. A sizeable body of evidence on NETs has accumulated across different fields that is by today too large and too diverse to be comprehensively tracked by individuals. Yet, understanding the size, composition and thematic structure of this literature corpus is a crucial pre-condition for effective scientific assessments of NETs as, for example, required for the new special report on the 1.5 degrees C by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In this paper we use scientometric methods and topic modelling to identify and characterize the available evidence on NETs as recorded in the Web of Science. We find that the development of the literature on NETs has started later than for climate change as a whole, but proceeds more quickly by now. A total number of about 2900 studies have accumulated between 1991 and 2016 with almost 500 new publications in 2016. The discourse on NETs takes place in distinct communities around energy systems, forests as well as biochar and other soil carbon options. Integrated analysis of NET portfolios-though crucial for understanding how much NETs are possible at what costs and risks-are still in their infancy and do not feature as a theme across the literature corpus. Overall, our analysis suggests that NETs research is relatively marginal in the wider climate change discourse despite its importance for global climate policy.

AB Until now, nonnative plant species were rarely found at high elevations and latitudes. However, partly because of climate warming, biological invasions are now on the rise in these extremely cold environments. These plant invasions make it timely to undertake a thorough experimental assessment of what has previously been holding them back. This knowledge is key to developing efficientmanagement of the increasing risks of cold-climate invasions. Here, we integrate human interventions (i.e., disturbance, nutrient addition, and propagule input) and climatic factors (i.e., temperature) into one seed-addition experiment across two continents: the subantarctic Andes and subarctic Scandinavian mountains (Scandes), to disentangle their roles in limiting or favoring plant invasions. Disturbance was found as the main determinant of plant invader success (i.e., establishment, growth, and flowering) along the entire cold-climate gradient, explaining 40-60% of the total variance in our models, with no indication of any facilitative effect from the native vegetation. Higher nutrient levels additionally stimulated biomass production and flowering. Establishment and flowering displayed a hump-shaped response with increasing elevation, suggesting that competition is the main limit on invader success at low elevations, as opposed to low-growing-season temperatures at high elevations. Our experiment showed, however, that nonnative plants can establish, grow, and flower well above their current elevational limits in high-latitude mountains. We thus argue that cold-climate ecosystems are likely to see rapid increases in plant invasions in the near future as a result of a synergistic interaction between increasing human-mediated disturbances and climate warming.

AB Given the predicted expansion of cities throughout the world, understanding the effect of urbanization on bee fauna is a major issue for the conservation of bees. The aim of this study was to understand how urbanization affects wild bee assemblages along a gradient of impervious surfaces and to determine the influence of landscape composition and floral resource availability on these assemblages. We chose 12 sites with a proportion of impervious surfaces (soil covered by parking, roads, and buildings) ranging from 0.06% to 64.31% within a 500m radius. We collected using pan trapping and estimated the landscape composition of the sites within a 500m radius and the species richness of plant assemblages within a 200 m radius. We collected 1104 bees from 74 species. The proportion of impervious surfaces at the landscape scale had a negative effect on wild bee abundance and species richness, whereas local flower composition had no effect. Ground-nesting bees were particularly sensitive to the urbanization gradient. This study provides new evidences of the impact of urbanization on bee assemblages and the proportion of impervious surfaces at the landscape scale emerged as a key factor that drives those assemblages.

AB Genetic diversity is shaped by the interaction of drift and selection, but the details of this interaction are not well understood. The impact of genetic drift in a population is largely determined by its demographic history, typically summarized by its long-term effective population size (N-e). Rapidly changing population demographics complicate this relationship, however. To better understand how changing demography impacts selection, we used whole-genome sequencing data to investigate patterns of linked selection in domesticated and wild maize (teosinte). We produce the first whole-genome estimate of the demography of maize domestication, showing that maize was reduced to approximately 5% the population size of teosinte before it experienced rapid expansion post-domestication to population sizes much larger than its ancestor. Evaluation of patterns of nucleotide diversity in and near genes shows little evidence of selection on beneficial amino acid substitutions, and that the domestication bottleneck led to a decline in the efficiency of purifying selection in maize. Young alleles, however, show evidence of much stronger purifying selection in maize, reflecting the much larger effective size of present day populations. Our results demonstrate that recent demographic change-a hall-mark of many species including both humans and crops-can have immediate and wide-ranging impacts on diversity that conflict with expectations based on long-term N-e alone.

AB Dispersal syndromes and networks must be used cautiously in conserving and restoring seed-dispersal processes. In many tropical forests most tree and shrub species require dispersal by animals for local persistence and for migration in response to environmental change. The most important errors to avoid in practical use of both dispersal syndromes (suites of fruit and seed characteristics that attract different dispersal agents) and network modules (groups of interacting dispersal agents and plants bearing fruits or seeds that they eat) are: (1) assuming that use of fruit resources by fruit-eating animals implies effective seed dispersal; (2) assuming that superficially similar fruits imply equally effective dispersal by similar animals, and (3) assuming that fruit resources at issue support animal populations. This essay explores strengths and weaknesses of uses of dispersal syndromes and disperser networks modules in conservation and restoration. Examples include some that are consistent with expectations from syndrome categorization and some that are not. An unappreciated weakness in using either dispersal syndromes or network modules is that contingent foraging by animals in highly disturbed habitats, now comprising 60%-70% of tropical land biomes, may not resemble foraging choices or consequences in protected closed forests, where most research on tropical seed dispersal is done. General prescriptions for the future include maintaining or creating habitat heterogeneity in largely deforested landscapes where remnant closed forests still exist, and active restoration in landscapes where little heterogeneity remains. In both cases, adaptations of multiple frame-work tree approaches have the best chance of preserving or enhancing populations of animal-dispersed trees and their seed vectors, and in opening migration paths in response to climate change.

AB Sex-biased dispersal is expected to homogenize nuclear genetic variation relative to variation in genetic material inherited through the philopatric sex. When site fidelity occurs across a heterogeneous environment, local selective regimes may alter this pattern. We assessed spatial patterns of variation in nuclear-encoded, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and sequences of the mitochondrial control region in bonnethead sharks (Sphyrna tiburo), a species thought to exhibit female philopatry, collected from summer habitats used for gestation. Geographic patterns of mtDNA haplotypes and putatively neutral SNPs confirmed female philopatry and male-mediated gene flow along the northeastern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. A total of 30 outlier SNP loci were identified; alleles at over half of these loci exhibited signatures of latitude-associated selection. Our results indicate that in species with sex-biased dispersal, philopatry can facilitate sorting of locally adaptive variation, with the dispersing sex facilitating movement of potentially adaptive variation among locations and environments.

   oxygen consumption
ID OXIDATIVE STRESS; MITOCHONDRIAL; GROWTH; CONSUMPTION
AB There is increasing interest in the effect of energy metabolism on oxidative stress, but much ambiguity over the relationship between the rate of oxygen consumption and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Production of ROS (such as hydrogen peroxide, H2O2) in the mitochondria is primarily inferred indirectly from measurements in vitro, which may not reflect actual ROS production in living animals. Here, we measured in vivo H2O2 content using the recently developed MitoB probe that becomes concentrated in the mitochondria of living organisms, where it is converted by H2O2 into an alternative form termed MitoP; the ratio of MitoP/MitoB indicates the level of mitochondrial H2O2 in vivo. Using the brown trout Salmo trutta, we tested whether this measurement of in vivo H2O2 content over a 24 h-period was related to interindividual variation in standard metabolic rate (SMR). We showed that the H2O2 content varied up to 26-fold among fish of the same age and under identical environmental conditions and nutritional states. Interindividual variation in H2O2 content was unrelated to mitochondrial density but was significantly associated with SMR: fish with a higher massindependent SMR had a lower level of H2O2. The mechanism underlying this observed relationship between SMR and in vivo H2O2 content requires further investigation, but may implicate mitochondrial uncoupling which can simultaneously increase SMR but reduce ROS production. To our knowledge, this is the first study in living organisms to show that individuals with higher oxygen consumption rates can actually have lower levels of H2O2.

AB Soaring throughput, plummeting costs, and increased sensitivity for assaying degraded or low-concentration DNA are driving a revolution in the way that we monitor biodiversity. Arguably the biggest game-changer' is environmental DNA (eDNA), which refers to free-floating DNA released by organisms into their environment. Rare or elusive species can be detected with greater sensitivity and accuracy using eDNA than by most conventional methods, and we have the capability to screen and describe whole communities, as well as perform targeted monitoring of single species. This paper discusses the basic approaches for molecular monitoring of biodiversity, provides case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques, and considers any challenges and limitations that could impact molecular biological recording. It is argued that eDNA surveys offer exciting new opportunities to engage the public in biological recording and that molecular approaches will complement conventional surveys, enabling unprecedented insights into species distributions. Finally, with the number of eDNA studies increasing at a rapid pace, it is argued that there is a need to rapidly establish ways of managing molecular records. Integrating molecular records into existing biological records databases would enhance our understanding of species distributions and may be something that the Biological Records Centre should be considering to mark its landmark anniversary.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London.

AB Trait-based approaches provide a mechanistic framework to understand and predict the structure and functioning of microbial communities. Resource utilization traits and tradeoffs are among key microbial traits that describe population dynamics and competition among microbes. Several important trade-offs have been identified for prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial taxa that define contrasting ecological strategies and contribute to species coexistence and diversity. The shape, dimensionality, and hierarchy of trade-offs may determine coexistence patterns and need to be better characterized. Laboratory measured resource utilization traits can be used to explain temporal and spatial structure and dynamics of natural microbial communities and predict biogeochemical impacts. Global environmental change can alter microbial community composition through altering resource utilization by different microbes and, consequently, may modify biogeochemical impacts of microbes.

AB Environmental selection and dispersal limitation are two of the primary processes structuring biotic communities in ecosystems, but little is known about these processes in shaping soil microbial communities during secondary forest succession. We examined the communities of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi in young, intermediate and old forests in a Chinese subtropical ecosystem, using 454 pyrosequencing. The EM fungal community consisted of 393 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), belonging to 21 EM fungal lineages, in which three EM fungal lineages and 11 EM fungal OTUs showed significantly biased occurrence among the young, intermediate and old forests. The EM fungal community was structured by environmental selection and dispersal limitation in old forest, but only by environmental selection in young, intermediate, and whole forests. Furthermore, the EM fungal community was affected by different factors in the different forest successional stages, and the importance of these factors in structuring EM fungal community dramatically decreased along the secondary forest succession series. This study suggests that different assembly mechanisms operate on the EM fungal community at different stages in secondary subtropical forest succession.

AB Exchanges of carbon, water and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere are monitored by eddy covariance technique at the ecosystem level. Currently, the FLUXNET database contains more than 500 registered sites, and up to 250 of them share data (free fair-use data set). Many modelling groups use the FLUXNET data set for evaluating ecosystem models' performance, but this requires uninterrupted time series for the meteorological variables used as input. Because original in situ data often contain gaps, from very short (few hours) up to relatively long (some months) ones, we develop a new and robust method for filling the gaps in meteorological data measured at site level. Our approach has the benefit of making use of continuous data available globally (ERA-Interim) and a high temporal resolution spanning from 1989 to today. These data are, however, not measured at site level, and for this reason a method to downscale and correct the ERA-Interim data is needed. We apply this method to the level 4 data (L4) from the La Thuile collection, freely available after registration under a fair-use policy. The performance of the developed method varies across sites and is also function of the meteorological variable. On average over all sites, applying the bias correction method to the ERA-Interim data reduced the mismatch with the in situ data by 10 to 36%, depending on the meteorological variable considered. In comparison to the internal variability of the in situ data, the root mean square error (RMSE) between the in situ data and the unbiased ERA-I (ERA-Interim) data remains relatively large (on average over all sites, from 27 to 76% of the standard deviation of in situ data, depending on the meteorological variable considered). The performance of the method remains poor for the wind speed field, in particular regarding its capacity to conserve a standard deviation similar to the one measured at FLUXNET stations.

AB Expanding of karst rocky desertification (RD) area in southwestern China is strangling the sustainable development of local agricultural economy. It is important to evaluate the soil fertility at RD regions for the sustainable management of karst lands. The changes in 19 different soil fertility-related variables along a gradient of karst rocky desertification were investigated in five different counties belonging to the central Hunan province in China. We used principal component analysis method to calculate the soil data matrix and obtained a standardized integrate soil fertility (ISF) indicator to reflect RD grades. The results showed that the succession of RD had different impacts on soil fertility indicators. The changing trend of total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) was potential RD (PRD) > light RD (LRD) > moderate RD (MRD) > intensive RD (IRD), whereas the changing trend of other indicators was not entirely consistent with the succession of RD. The degradation trend of ISF was basically parallel to the aggravation of RD, and the strength of ISF mean values were in the order of PRD > LRD > MRD > IRD. The TOC, MBC, and MBN could be regarded as the key indicators to evaluate the soil fertility.

AB Mid-domain effect (MDE) models predict that the random placement of species' ranges within a bounded geographical area leads to increased range overlap and species richness in the center of the bounded area. These models are frequently applied to study species-richness patterns of macroorganisms, but the MDE in relation to microorganisms is poorly understood. In this study, we examined the characteristics of the MDE in richness patterns of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi, an ecologically important group of soil symbionts. We conducted intensive soil sampling to investigate overlap among species ranges and the applicability of the MDE to EM fungi in four temperate forest stands along an elevation gradient on Mount Fuji, Japan. Molecular analyses using direct sequencing revealed 302 EM fungal species. Of 73 EM fungal species found in multiple stands, 72 inhabited a continuous range along the elevation gradient. The maximum overlap in species range and the highest species richness occurred at elevations in the middle of the gradient. The observed richness pattern also fit within the 95% confidence interval of the mid-domain null model, supporting the role of the MDE in EM fungal richness. Deviation in observed richness from the mean of the mid-domain null estimation was negatively correlated with some environmental factors, including precipitation and soil C/N, indicating that unexplained richness patterns could be driven by these environmental factors. Our results clearly support the existence of microbial species' ranges along environmental gradients and the potential applicability of the MDE to better understand microbial diversity patterns.

AB The fraction of incident photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the photosynthesizing tissue in a canopy (fAPAR) is a key variable in the assessment of vegetation productivity. It also plays tremendous role in accurate retrieval of light use efficiency, which is essential for assessing vegetation health status. The main goal of this work was to study in detail relationships of fAPAR absorbed by photosynthetically active vegetation (fAPAR(green)) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for two crops with contrasting leaf structures (C3 vs. C4) and canopy architectures, using close range (6 m above the canopy) radiometric data and daily MODIS data taken during eight growing seasons over three irrigated and rainfed maize and soybean sites. Our specific goal was to understand differences in fAPAR(green)/NDVI relationship when crop canopy was almost vertically homogeneous (with respect to leaf area and leaf chlorophyll content), as in vegetative stage, and vertically heterogeneous as in reproduction stage. Firstly, we established fAPAR(green)/NDVI relationships for NDVI, taken at close range, and assessed noise equivalent of fAPAR(green) estimation by NDVI, and then we established relationships for NDVI retrieved from daily MODIS 250 m data. Daily MODIS data illuminated fine details of this relationship and detected effects of canopy heterogeneity on fAPAR(green)/NDVI relationship. In vegetative stage, the fAPAR/NDVI relationships for contrasting in leaf structures and canopy architectures crops were almost linear allowing accurate estimation of fAPAR(green) as it is below 0.7. However, very different fAPAR(green)/NDVI relationships in reproductive stages for both crops were observed, showing that canopy architecture and leaf structure greatly affect the relationship as leaf chlorophyll content changes and vertical distribution of chlorophyll content and green LAI inside the canopy becomes heterogeneous. We have found fine details of the fAPAR(green)/NDVI relationships with two types of hysteresis that prevent the use of a single relationship for fAPAR(green) estimation by NDVI over the whole growing season and suggested mechanisms for each type of hysteresis that should be further studied using radiative transfer models.

AB Discerning the relative roles of adaptive and nonadaptive processes in generating differences among populations and species, as well as how these processes interact, is a fundamental aim in biology. Both genetic and phenotypic divergence across populations can be the product of limited dispersal and gradual genetic drift across populations (isolation by distance), of colonization history and founder effects (isolation by colonization) or of adaptation to different environments preventing migration between populations (isolation by adaptation). Here, we attempt to differentiate between these processes using island populations of Berthelot's pipit (Anthus berthelotii), a passerine bird endemic to three Atlantic archipelagos. Using microsatellite markers and approximate Bayesian computation, we reveal that the northward colonization of this species ca. 8500years ago resulted in genetic bottlenecks in the colonized archipelagos. We then show that high levels of genetic structure exist across archipelagos and that these are consistent with a pattern of isolation by colonization, but not with isolation by distance or adaptation. Finally, we show that substantial morphological divergence also exists and that this is strongly concordant with patterns of genetic structure and bottleneck history, but not with environmental differences or geographic distance. Overall, our data suggest that founder effects are responsible for both genetic and phenotypic changes across archipelagos. Our findings provide a rare example of how founder effects can persist over evolutionary timescales and suggest that they may play an important role in the early stages of speciation.

AB Until now, decomposition of abundance-sensitive gamma (regional) phylogenetic diversity measures into alpha and beta (within- and between-group) components has been based on an additive partitioning of phylogenetic generalized entropies, especially Rao's quadratic entropy. This additive approach led to a phylogenetic measure of differentiation between assemblages: (gamma - alpha)/gamma. We show both empirically and theoretically that this approach inherits all of the problems recently identified in the additive partitioning of non-phylogenetic generalized entropies. When within-assemblage (alpha) quadratic entropy is high, the additive beta and the differentiation measure (gamma - alpha)/gamma always tend to zero (implying no differentiation) regardless of phylogenetic structures and differences in species abundances across assemblages. Likewise, the differentiation measure based on the phylogenetic generalization of Shannon entropy always approaches zero whenever gamma phylogenetic entropy is high. Such critical flaws, inherited from their non-phylogenetic parent measures (Gini-Simpson index and Shannon entropy respectively), have caused interpretational problems. These flaws arise because phylogenetic generalized entropies do not obey the replication principle, which ensures that the diversity measures are linear with respect to species addition or group pooling. Furthermore, their complete partitioning into independent components is not additive (except for phylogenetic entropy). Just as in the non-phylogenetic case, these interpretational problems are resolved by using phylogenetic Hill numbers that obey the replication principle. Here we show how to partition the phylogenetic gamma diversity based on Hill numbers into independent alpha and beta components, which turn out to be multiplicative. The resulting phylogenetic beta diversity (ratio of gamma to alpha) measures the effective number of completely phylogenetically distinct assemblages. This beta component measures pure differentiation among assemblages and thus can be used to construct several classes of similarity or differentiation measures normalized onto the range [0,1]. We also propose a normalization to fix the traditional additive phylogenetic similarity and differentiation measures, and we show that this yields the same similarity and differentiation measures we derived from multiplicative phylogenetic diversity partitioning. We thus can achieve a consensus on phylogenetic similarity and differentiation measures, including N-assemblage phylogenetic generalizations of the classic Jaccard, SOrensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn measures. Hypothetical and real examples are used for illustration.

AB Eukaryotes have evolved and diversified in the context of persistent colonization by nonpathogenic microorganisms. Various resident microorganisms provide a metabolic capability absent from the host, resulting in increased ecological amplitude and often evolutionary diversification of the host. Some microorganisms confer primary metabolic pathways, such as photosynthesis and cellulose degradation, and others expand the repertoire of secondary metabolism, including the synthesis of toxins that confer protection against natural enemies. A further route by which microorganisms affect host fitness arises from their modulation of the eukaryotic-signaling networks that regulate growth, development, behavior, and other functions. These effects are not necessarily based on interactions beneficial to the host, but can be a consequence of either eukaryotic utilization of microbial products as cues or host-microbial conflict. By these routes, eukaryote-microbial interactions play an integral role in the function and evolutionary diversification of eukaryotes.

AB Hybridization among animal species has recently become more recognized as an important phenomenon, especially in the context of recent radiations [1-9]. Here we show that complex hybridization has led to contrasting patterns of genomic composition among closely related species of the Neotropical cat genus Leopardus. We show strong evidence of ancient hybridization and introgression between the pampas cat (L. colocolo) and northeastern populations of tigrina (L. tigrinus), leading to remarkable cytonuclear discordance in the latter. In contrast, southern tigrina populations show recent and continuing hybridization with Geoffroy's cat (L. geoffroyi), leading to extreme levels of interspecific admixture at their contact zone. Finally, we demonstrate that two seemingly continuous Brazilian tigrina populations show no evidence of ongoing gene flow between them, leading us to support their formal recognition as distinct species, namely L. tigrinus in the northeast and L. guttulus in the south.

AB The utilization of remotely sensed observations for light use efficiency (LUE) and tower-based gross primary production (GPP) estimates was studied in a USDA cornfield. Nadir hyperspectral reflectance measurements were acquired at canopy level during a collaborative field campaign conducted in four growing seasons. The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) and solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), were derived. SIF retrievals were accomplished in the two telluric atmospheric oxygen absorption features centered at 688 nm (O-2-B) and 760 nm (O-2-A). The PRI and SIF were examined in conjunction with GPP and LUE determined by flux tower-based measurements. All of these fluxes, environmental variables, and the PRI and SIF exhibited diurnal as well as day-to-day dynamics across the four growing seasons. Consistent with previous studies, the PRI was shown to be related to LUE (r(2) = 0.54 with a logarithm fit), but the relationship varied each year. By combining the PRI and SIF in a linear regression model, stronger performances for GPP estimation were obtained. The strongest relationship (r(2) = 0.80, RMSE = 0.186 mg CO2/m(2)/s) was achieved when using the PRI and SIF retrievals at 688 nm. Cross-validation approaches were utilized to demonstrate the robustness and consistency of the performance. This study highlights a GPP retrieval method based entirely on hyperspectral remote sensing observations.

AB Question: Many functional diversity indices require the calculation of functional trait dissimilarities between species. However, very little is known about how the dissimilarity measure used might affect conclusions about ecological processes drawn from functional diversity.
   Methods: We simulated real applications of functional diversity, to illustrate the key properties of the two most common families of dissimilarity measures: (1) Gower' distance, using only mean trait' value per species and then standardizing each trait, e.g. relative to its range; (2) trait overlap' between species, which takes into account within-species trait variability. We then examine how these approaches could affect conclusions about ecological processes commonly assessed with functional diversity. We also propose a new R function (trova', i.e. TRait OVerlAp) which performs computations to estimate species trait dissimilarity with different types of data.
   Results: The trait overlap approach generally produces a less context-dependentmeasure of functional dissimilarity. For example, the results are less dependent on the transformation of trait data (often required in empirical datasets) and on the particular pool of species considered (i. e. trait range, regularity and presence of outliers). The results therefore could bemore easily compared across studies and biomes. Further, trait overlap more reliably reproduces patterns expected when niche differentiation structures communities. The Gower approach, on the contrary, more reliably detects environmental filtering effects.
   Conclusion: The two approaches imply different conceptions of how species dissimilarities relate to niche differentiation. Trait overlap is suitable for testing the effect of species interactions on functional diversity within local communities, especiallywhen relatively small differences in species traits are linked to different resource acquisition. Gower is better suited to detecting changes in functional diversity along environmental gradients, as greater differences in trait values reflect increased niche differentiation. Combining trait overlap and Gower approachesmay provide a novel way to assess the joint effects of environmental filtering and niche complementarity on community assembly. We suggest that attention should be given not only to the index of functional diversity considered but also whether the dissimilarity used is appropriate for the study context.

AB Global bioclimatic datasets are being widely used in ecological research to estimate the potential distribution of species using Climate Envelope Models (CEMs). These datasets are easily available and offer high resolution information for all land areas globally. However, they have not been tested rigorously in smaller regions, and their use in regional CEM studies may pose problems derived from their poor representation of local climate features. Moreover, these problems may be enhanced when using CEMs for future climate projections-a topic of current active research-due to the uncertainty derived from the future altered climate scenarios. In this paper we use distributional data of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) in Northern Iberian Peninsula to analyze the discrepancies of the CEMs (predictive skill, variable importance and consistency using different predictor subsets) resulting from three alternative public, high-resolution climate datasets: a benchmarking regional climate dataset developed for the area of study (UC), the University of Barcelona Atlas for the Iberian Peninsula (UAB) and the worldwide WorldClim bioclimatic dataset (WC). The same CEM techniques (multiple logistic regression and multivariate adaptive regression splines) were applied to the different datasets, showing that the quality of the baseline climate has a great impact on the resulting models, as manifested by the different contributions of the bioclimatic predictors to the resulting models. Artifactual bioclimatic variables were found in some datasets, representing topographical features and spatial gradients, rather than true climatic patterns, thus significantly contributing to the models, although not for the right reasons. This causes a misleading model interpretation and problems for extrapolation in future climate conditions, as evidenced analyzing the future projections obtained using state-of-the-art regional climate projections from the ENSEMBLES project.

AB Plants represent a large reservoir of organic carbon comprised primarily of recalcitrant polymers that most metazoans are unable to deconstruct. Many herbivores gain access to nutrients in this material indirectly by associating with microbial symbionts, and leaf-cutter ants are a paradigmatic example. These ants use fresh foliar biomass as manure to cultivate gardens composed primarily of Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, a basidiomycetous fungus that produces specialized hyphal swellings that serve as a food source for the host ant colony. Although leaf-cutter ants are conspicuous herbivores that contribute substantially to carbon turnover in Neotropical ecosystems, the process through which plant biomass is degraded in their fungus gardens is not well understood. Here we present the first draft genome of L. gongylophorus, and, using genomic and metaproteomic tools, we investigate its role in lignocellulose degradation in the gardens of both Atta cephalotes and Acromyrmex echinatior leaf-cutter ants. We show that L. gongylophorus produces a diversity of lignocellulases in ant gardens and is likely the primary driver of plant biomass degradation in these ecosystems. We also show that this fungus produces distinct sets of lignocellulases throughout the different stages of biomass degradation, including numerous cellulases and laccases that likely play an important role in lignocellulose degradation. Our study provides a detailed analysis of plant biomass degradation in leaf-cutter ant fungus gardens and insight into the enzymes underlying the symbiosis between these dominant herbivores and their obligate fungal cultivar.

AB Understanding diversity patterns along environmental gradients and their underlying mechanisms is a major topic in current biodiversity research. In this study, we investigate for the first time elevational patterns of vascular plant species richness and endemism on a long-isolated continental island (Crete) that has experienced extensive post-isolation mountain uplift. We used all available data on distribution and elevational ranges of the Cretan plants to interpolate their presence between minimum and maximum elevations in 100-m elevational intervals, along the entire elevational gradient of Crete (0-2400 m). We evaluate the influence of elevation, area, mid-domain effect, elevational Rapoport effect and the post-isolation mountain uplift on plant species richness and endemism elevational patterns. Furthermore, we test the influence of the island condition and the post-isolation mountain uplift to the elevational range sizes of the Cretan plants, using the Peloponnese as a continental control area. Total species richness monotonically decreases with increasing elevation, while endemic species richness has a unimodal response to elevation showing a peak at mid-elevation intervals. Area alone explains a significant amount of variation in species richness along the elevational gradient. Mid-domain effect is not the underlying mechanism of the elevational gradient of plant species richness in Crete, and Rapoport's rule only partly explains the observed patterns. Our results are largely congruent with the post-isolation uplift of the Cretan mountains and their colonization mainly by the available lowland vascular plant species, as high-elevation specialists are almost lacking from the Cretan flora. The increase in the proportion of Cretan endemics with increasing elevation can only be regarded as a result of diversification processes towards Cretan mountains (especially mid-elevation areas), supported by elevation-driven ecological isolation. Cretan plants have experienced elevational range expansion compared to the continental control area, as a result of ecological release triggered by increased species impoverishment with increasing elevation.

AB Mid-winter movements of up to several hundreds of kilometres are typical for many migratory bird species wintering in Africa. Unpredictable temporary food concentrations are thought to result in random movements of such birds, whereas resightings and recoveries of marked birds suggest some degree of site fidelity. Only detailed (e.g. satellite) tracking of individual migrants can reveal the relative importance and the causes of site choice flexibility and fidelity. The present study investigates how mid-winter movements of a Palaearctic-African migratory raptor, Montagu's harrier Circus pygargus, in the Sahel of West Africa are related to the availability of food resources. Thirty harriers breeding or hatched in northern Europe were satellite tracked (20052009). On average, four home ranges, each separated by c. 200 km, were visited during one overwinter stay in the Sahel. Wintering home ranges were similar in size to breeding season home ranges (average over wintering and breeding home range size c. 200 km2), and harriers showed high site fidelity between years. Most preferred habitat types in the Sahel were mosaics of grass- and cropland, indicating similar habitat preferences in both the breeding- and wintering seasons. The main prey of Montagu's harriers in the Sahel were grasshoppers Acrididae. Highest grasshopper numbers in the field occurred at relatively low vegetation greenness [normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values 0.170.27]. We used NDVI as a proxy of food availability for harriers. During their overwinter stay, Montagu's harriers moved in a SouthSouth-western direction between consecutive home ranges. The birds selected areas within the range of NDVI values associated with high grasshopper numbers, thus tracking a green belt of predictable changes in highest grasshopper availability. Contrary to earlier hypotheses of random movements in the Sahelian-wintering quarters, the present study shows that Montagu's harriers visited distinct home ranges, they were site-faithful and tracked seasonal changes in food availability related to previous rainfall patterns, caused by the shifting Intertropical Convergence Zone. Itinerancy may be the rule rather than an exception among insectivorous birds wintering in African savannahs.

AB Environmental filtering and niche differentiation are processes proposed to drive community assembly, generating nonrandom patterns in community trait distributions. Despite the substantial intraspecific trait variation present in plant communities, most previous studies of trait-based community assembly have used species mean trait values and therefore not accounted for intraspecific variation. Using a null model approach, I tested for environmental filtering and niche differentiation acting on three key functional traits-vegetative height, specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf dry matter content (LDMC)-in old-field plant communities. I also examined how accounting for intraspecific variation at the among-plot and individual levels affected the detection of nonrandom assembly patterns. Tests using fixed species mean trait values provided evidence of environmental filtering acting on height and SLA and niche differentiation acting on SLA. Including plot-level intraspecific variation increased the strength of these patterns, indicating an important role of intraspecific variation in community assembly. Tests using individual trait data indicated strong environmental filtering acting on all traits, but provided no evidence of niche differentiation, although these signals may have been obscured by the effects of dispersal limitation and spatial aggregation of conspecific individuals. There was also strong evidence of nonrandom assembly of individuals within single species, with the strength of environmental filtering varying among species. This study demonstrates that, while analyses using fixed species mean trait values can provide insights into community assembly processes, accounting for intraspecific variation provides a more complete view of communities and the processes driving their assembly.

AB Bryophytes are a dominant vegetation component of the boreal forest, but little is known about their associated fungal communities, including seasonal variation within them. Seasonal variation in the fungal biomass and composition of fungal communities associated with three widespread boreal bryophytes was investigated using HPLC assays of ergosterol and amplicon pyrosequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region of rDNA. The bryophyte phyllosphere community was dominated by Ascomycota. Fungal biomass did not decline appreciably in winter (P = 0.272). Significant host-specific patterns in seasonal variation of biomass were detected (P = 0.003). Although seasonal effects were not the primary factors structuring community composition, collection date significantly explained (P = 0.001) variation not attributed to locality, host, and tissue. Community homogenization and a reduction in turnover occurred with the onset of frost events and subzero air and soil temperatures. Fluctuations in the relative abundance of particular fungal groups seem to reflect the nature of their association with mosses, although conclusions are drawn with caution because of potential methodological bias. The moss-associated fungal community is dynamic, exhibiting seasonal turnover in composition and relative abundance of different fungal groups, and significant fungal biomass is present year-round, suggesting a winter-active fungal community.

AB The area of forests planted with exotic tree species is increasing worldwide in order to fulfill various economic and environmental demands. Numerous species currently used in forest plantations are considered to be invasive in many parts of the world. Exotic plantation tree species are endowed with a series of life-history traits that are characteristic of invasive species: easy establishment, fast growth, high propagule pressure, and low or intermediate shade tolerance. In addition, plantation forestry presents many features that increase ecosystem invasibility, including a regime of frequent and intensive canopy disturbances, a dense network of roads and trails with continuous traffic, and wide plantation areas. Exotic trees planted for production purposes have strong direct positive economic impacts on the local and national economies of many countries, often leading to notable conflicts of interest when the species becomes invasive, as well as to negative impacts on the ecosystem. Studies and management programs mainly focus on Pinus and Acacia, which are used as model species. Complementary management strategies have been established to control these species at different stages of the invasion process. Knowledge gained is useful to predict problems in other regions of the world with the same species and to guide research or management actions on other problematic but less studied tree species.

AB We conducted experimental feeding trials with larval and juvenile Bullfrogs (Litho bates catesbeianus) and Rough-skinned Newts (Taricha granulosa) to assess the accuracy of the scaled mass index (SMI). A control group was fed and a treatment group was starved within a randomized block design. After each of three trials, amphibian tissues were analyzed for lipid, protein, and water content. Mean pretreatment wet weight and SMI of individuals of each species and body form, representing two populations of equal body condition, were similar between control and treatment groups. Starved animals, representing a population in poor condition, had a 17-32% lower SMI than fed animals. Scaled fat and protein or lean mass were strongly correlated (r = 0.85-0.99) with SMI compared with percentages of fat, protein, or lean mass (r = 0.08-0.60). The SMI accurately reflected amphibian energy stores, but the depletion of energy stores differed by species and body form, with tadpoles retaining fat and the other species and body forms depleting fat stores. In addition, factors that we controlled in the laboratory (e.g., hydration, gut fill, reproductive state) may alter mass-length relationships in the field, so we advise collecting some specimens for body composition analyses to ensure the accuracy of the SMI when used in other applications.

AB Natural disturbance emulation (NDE) has been proposed as a general approach to ecologically sustainable forest management. We reviewed the concepts, theories, and strategies related to NDE in boreal forest management. We also reviewed publications that discussed NDE in the boreal forest in general and those that specifically compared NDE-based management with conventional even-aged management. The papers generally focused on northern North America and landscape-scale wildfire as the main disturbance factor, whereas information from Eurasia was exclusively theoretical. Within this limited scope, NDE was generally found to have a positive effect on biodiversity in terms of forest structure and species diversity when compared with conventional even-aged management. Studies on timber supply and social implications of NDE were so few that they preclude generalizations. We conclude that the ecological and economic performance of NDE as a management approach still remains poorly examined. To advance the development of NDE, particular attention should be given to (1) augmenting the knowledge base on natural range of variability of unmanaged forest ecosystems and evaluating the validity of this information in a changing climate, (2) fostering multidisciplinary research with better integration of ecological theory to both integrative and analytical research on NDE, and (3) better integration of socioeconomic concerns, adaptive management schemes, and international collaboration into NDE initiatives.

AB Despite the wide acceptance of the "big-leaf" upscaling strategy in evapotranspiration modeling (e. g., the Penman-Monteith model), its usefulness in simulating canopy photosynthesis may be limited by the underlying assumption of homogeneous response of carbon assimilation light-response kinetics through the canopy. While previous studies have shown that the separation of the canopy into sunlit and shaded parts (i.e., two-leaf model) is typically more effective than big-leaf models for upscaling photosynthesis from leaf to canopy, a systematic comparison between these two upscaling strategies among multiple ecosystems has not been presented. In this study, gross primary productivity was modeled using two-leaf and big-leaf upscaling approaches in the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator for shrublands, broadleaf, and conifer forest types. When given the same leaf-level photosynthetic parameters, the big-leaf approach significantly underestimated canopy-level GPP while the two-leaf approach more closely predicted both the magnitude and day-to-day variability in eddy covariance measurements. The underestimation by the big-leaf approach is mostly caused by its exclusion of the photosynthetic contributions of shaded leaves. Tests of the model sensitivity to a foliage clumping index revealed that the contribution of shaded leaves to the total simulated productivity can be as high as 70% for highly clumped stands and seldom decreases below similar to 40% for less-clumped canopies. Our results indicate that accurate upscaling of photosynthesis across a broad array of ecosystems requires an accurate description of canopy structure in ecosystem models.

AB One of the most popular approaches for investigating the roles of niche and neutral processes driving metacommunity patterns consists of partitioning variation in species data into environmental and spatial components. The logic is that the distance decay of similarity in communities is expected under neutral models. However, because environmental variation is often spatially structured, the decay could also be attributed to environmental factors that are missing from the analysis. Here, we use a spatial autocorrelation analysis protocol, previously developed to detect isolation-by-distance in allele frequencies, to evaluate patterns of species abundances under neutral dynamics. We show that this protocol can be linked with variation partitioning analyses. Moreover, in an attempt to test the neutral model, we derive three predictions to be applied both to original species abundances and to abundances predicted by a pure spatial model species abundances will be uncorrelated; Moran's I correlograms will reveal similar short-distance autocorrelation patterns; an increasing degree of non-neutrality will tend to generate patterns of correlation among abundances within groups of species with similar correlograms (i.e. within species with neutral and non-neutral dynamics). We illustrate our protocol by analyzing spatial patterns in abundance of 28 terrestrially breeding anuran species from Central Amazonia. We recommend that researchers should investigate spatial autocorrelation patterns of abundances predicted by pure spatial models to identify similar patterns of spatial autocorrelation at short distances and lack of correlation between species abundances. Therefore, the hypothesis that spatial patterns in abundances are primarily due to pure neutral dynamics (rather than to missing spatiallystructured environmental factors) can be confirmed after taking environmental variables into account.

AB Polyploidization is an important process in the evolution of eukaryotic genomes, but ensuing molecular mechanisms remain to be clarified. Autopolyploidization or whole-genome duplication events frequently are resolved in resulting lineages by the loss of single genes from most duplicated pairs, causing transient gene dosage imbalance and accelerating speciation through meiotic infertility. Allopolyploidization or formation of interspecies hybrids raises the problem of genetic incompatibility (Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller effect) and may be resolved by the accumulation of mutational changes in resulting lineages. In this article, we show that an osmotolerant yeast species, Pichia sorbitophila, recently isolated in a concentrated sorbitol solution in industry, illustrates this last situation. Its genome is amosaic of homologous and homeologous chromosomes, or parts thereof, that corresponds to a recently formed hybrid in the process of evolution. The respective parental contributions to this genome were characterized using existing variations in GC content. The genomic changes that occurred during the short period since hybrid formation were identified (e. g., loss of heterozygosity, unilateral loss of rDNA, reciprocal exchange) and distinguished from those undergone by the two parental genomes after separation from their common ancestor (i.e., NUMT (NUclear sequences of MiTochondrial origin) insertions, gene acquisitions, gene location movements, reciprocal translocation). We found that the physiological characteristics of this new yeast species are determined by specific but unequal contributions of its two parents, one of which could be identified as very closely related to an extant Pichia farinosa strain.

AB 1. Ecologists are debating the relative role of deterministic and stochastic determinants of community structure. Although the high diversity and strong spatial structure of soil animal assemblages could provide ecologists with an ideal ecological scenario, surprisingly little information is available on these assemblages.
   2. We studied species-rich soil oribatid mite assemblages from a Mediterranean beech forest and a grassland. We applied multivariate regression approaches and analysed spatial autocorrelation at multiple spatial scales using Moran's eigenvectors. Results were used to partition community variance in terms of the amount of variation uniquely accounted for by environmental correlates (e.g. organic matter) and geographical position. Estimated neutral diversity and immigration parameters were also applied to a soil animal group for the first time to simulate patterns of community dissimilarity expected under neutrality, thereby testing neutral predictions.
   3. After accounting for spatial autocorrelation, the correlation between community structure and key environmental parameters disappeared: about 40% of community variation consisted of spatial patterns independent of measured environmental variables such as organic matter. Environmentally independent spatial patterns encompassed the entire range of scales accounted for by the sampling design (from tens of cm to 100 m). This spatial variation could be due to either unmeasured but spatially structured variables or stochastic drift mediated by dispersal. Observed levels of community dissimilarity were significantly different from those predicted by neutral models.
   4. Oribatid mite assemblages are dominated by processes involving both deterministic and stochastic components and operating at multiple scales. Spatial patterns independent of the measured environmental variables are a prominent feature of the targeted assemblages, but patterns of community dissimilarity do not match neutral predictions. This suggests that either niche-mediated competition or environmental filtering or both are contributing to the core structure of the community. This study indicates new lines of investigation for understanding the mechanisms that determine the signature of the deterministic component of animal community assembly.

AB The contribution of deterministic and stochastic processes to species coexistence is widely debated. With the introduction of powerful statistical techniques, we can now better characterise different sources of uncertainty when quantifying niche differentiation. The theoretical literature on the effect of stochasticity on coexistence, however, is often ignored by field ecologists because of its technical nature and difficulties in its application. In this review, we examine how different sources of variability in population dynamics contribute to coexistence. Unfortunately, few general rules emerge among the different models that have been studied to date. Nonetheless, we believe that a greater understanding is possible, based on the integration of coexistence and population extinction risk theories. There are two conditions for coexistence in the presence of environmental and demographic variability: (1) the average per capita growth rates of all coexisting species must be positive when at low densities, and (2) these growth rates must be strong enough to overcome negative random events potentially pushing densities to extinction. We propose that critical tests for species coexistence must account for niche differentiation arising from this variability and should be based explicitly on notions of stability and ecological drift.

AB Plant litter often decomposes faster in the habitat from which it was derived (i.e. home) than when placed in foreign habitats (i.e. away), which has been called the home-field advantage (HFA) of litter decomposition. We tested whether the HFA of litter decomposition is driven by decomposer communities being specialized at decomposing litter in their home habitat, by reciprocally transplanting litter from grassland to early-successional forest. Unexpectedly, we found an overall disadvantage for at-home decomposition despite large differences in litter quality (lignin:N) between the two habitats. We found more evidence for habitat specialization among secondary decomposers (mites) than the primary decomposers (bacteria and fungi), suggesting that soil animals may be important in driving HFA patterns where they do exist. Grass litter decomposition in forest slowed down and became more fungal-based, while tree litter decomposition in grassland increased yet showed no shift to being bacterially-based, relative to 'at home' decomposition. This suggests a biological explanation for why a positive HFA was not observed. Our results highlight that both environmental context and soil biology can play an important and sometimes counter-intuitive role in modifying decomposition. A better understanding of the interaction between all three primary drivers of decomposition (the environment, litter quality and soil organisms) is necessary for reliable prediction of decomposition at global scales.

ID LOCI; POLYMORPHISM; POPULATIONS; DIVERGENCE
AB Motivation: Dominant markers (DArTs and AFLPs) are commonly used for genetic analysis in the fields of evolutionary genetics, ecology and conservation of genetic resources. The recent prominence of these markers has coincided with renewed interest in detecting the effects of local selection and adaptation at the level of the genome.
   Results: We present Mcheza, an application for detecting loci under selection based on a well-evaluated F-ST-outlier method. The application allows robust estimates to be made of model parameters (e.g. genome-wide average, neutral F-ST), provides data import and export functions, iterative contour smoothing and generation of graphics in an easy to use graphical user interface with a computation engine that supports multicore processors for enhanced performance. Mcheza also provides functionality to mitigate common analytical errors when scanning for loci under selection.

AB Several recent studies have documented considerable intraspecific and intrapopulation ecological variation in primates. However, we generally lack an understanding of how such variability may be linked to concomitant demographic variation among groups or populations of the same species, particularly in regard to large-bodied and wide-ranging species with high ecological flexibility, such as chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We compared the feeding ecology of chimpanzees inhabiting 2 sites in Kibale National Park, Uganda that differ 3-fold in chimpanzee density and support notably different plant communities. Chimpanzees at Ngogo, a site with the largest known chimpanzee community and unusually high chimpanzee density, spent a significantly lower percentage of time resting (and pregnant and lactating females spent more time feeding), incorporated higher percentages of ripe fruit in their diet, had lower dietary diversity values, and had shorter and less variable average patch residency times than did their counterparts at the nearby Kanyawara site, which supports a relatively low density of chimpanzees. In addition, feeding party size was significantly and positively related to feeding patch size at Ngogo, but not at Kanyawara. Together these findings aid in explaining the noted disparity in chimpanzee community size and density between Ngogo and Kanyawara by suggesting that the diet of Ngogo chimpanzees is of higher overall quality than that of Kanyawara chimpanzees. They also highlight the potentially profound influence of even small-scale habitat heterogeneity on the ecology of primates. Researchers must take such influences into account when attempting to draw conclusions about species- or population-level characteristics.

AB P>1. Pollination interactions comprise a network of connections between flowers and insect visitors. They are crucial for reproductive success in many angiosperms but are threatened by intensive agricultural practices. Although less intensive approaches, including organic farming, could improve farmland biodiversity, it is not clear whether or not these approaches enhance wild plant pollination and the stability of insect-flower interaction networks.
   2. We investigated the effects of organic vs. conventional farming on insect-flower interaction network size and structure, bee and hoverfly diversity, and pollination in 10 pairs of organic and conventional dairy farms in the Republic of Ireland.
   3. We found that insect-flower interaction networks on organic farms were larger and more asymmetrically structured than networks on conventional farms. Overall, however, networks contained fewer taxa and niche overlap and plant/animal ratios were relatively low compared with previously documented insect-flower interaction networks. Organic farms did attract higher numbers of bees partly because of higher floral abundances (mainly Trifolium sp.). Hoverfly evenness was greater in organic farms but neither abundance, richness nor evenness was related to floral abundance, suggesting organic farms provide additional resources for hoverflies. Pollination of Crataegus monogyna hawthorn was higher on organic farms, although pollen deposition was limited.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Organic dairy farming can increase the size and alter the structure of insect-flower interaction networks. However, network stability was not improved and all networks (organic and conventional) were vulnerable because of their small size, low niche overlap and low plant/animal ratios. Nonetheless, organic farming provided more flowers that attracted more flower visitors and improved pollination of C. monogyna. We suggest that strategic management of important flowers for pollinators in hedgerows and pastures should be endorsed in agri-environmental schemes. Sowing Trifolium spp., and allowing these plants to flower, could benefit bees, but more research into hoverfly ecology is necessary before realistic conservation recommendations can be made for this group. We conclude that organic farming, although not the solution in its present form, can benefit insect biodiversity, insect-flower interaction networks and insect-mediated pollination.

AB Urbanization induces changes in species abundance and richness that are beginning to be extensively described. However, the functional structure of urban communities still requires attention to provide a basis for a more accurate understanding of urban ecosystems' functioning. This study has been performed in order to assess functional changes in ecological communities related to changes of urban landscape features along an urbanization gradient. Species abundance and richness of birds and butterflies in the city parks of Marseille (south-east France) have been used to assess these changes. On the basis of easily accessible traits (reproduction parameters, size, feeding habits), we have examined whether different contexts of urbanization favour some strategies more than others. Some differences occur between butterflies and birds in terms of species abundance and richness through the urbanization gradient, showing that at least some species of birds manage to colonize city centre and/or exploit urban resources better than butterflies. But our results also clearly reveal general patterns in biological traits for both birds and butterflies that further reflect the gradient of urban features from outskirts to city centre. Species associated with the city centre tolerate a wide range of conditions whereas species associated with city outskirts have more specialized abilities. Urbanization acts as an environmental filter for bird and butterfly communities selecting species able to colonize and settle in the city centre on the basis of their biological traits. In our context, environmental filters induce a biotic homogenization with urbanization through loss of species (taxonomic homogenization) and over-representation of generalist species (functional homogenization). This homogenization reflects an underlying process of disruption of biotic interactions for butterflies and birds. This study has enabled us to identify a combination of biological traits sensitive to urban features that may represent useful indicators for both theoretical and applied purposes in order to understand the impact of urbanization on animal communities.

AB Recent studies have highlighted both the positive and negative impacts of species invasions. Most of these studies have been conducted on either immobile invasive plants or sessile fauna found at the base of food webs. Fewer studies have examined the impacts of vagile invasive consumers on native competitors. This is an issue of some importance given the controlling influence that consumers have on lower order plants and animals. Here, we present results of laboratory experiments designed to assess the impacts of unintended aquaculture releases of the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), in estuaries of the Gulf of Mexico, on the functionally similar redspotted sunfish (Lepomis miniatus). Laboratory choice tests showed that tilapia prefer the same structured habitat that native sunfish prefer. In subsequent interspecific competition experiments, agonistic tilapia displaced sunfish from their preferred structured habitats. When a piscivore (largemouth bass) was present in the tank with both species, the survival of sunfish decreased. Based on these findings, if left unchecked, we predict that the proliferation of tilapia (and perhaps other aggressive aquaculture fishes) will have important detrimental effects on the structure of native food webs in shallow, structured coastal habitats. While it is likely that the impacts of higher trophic level invasive competitors will vary among species, these results show that consequences of unintended releases of invasive higher order consumers can be important.

TI Can wind help explain seasonal differences in avian migration speed?

AB A bird's ground speed is influenced by the wind conditions it encounters. Wind conditions, although variable, are not entirely random. Instead, wind exhibits persistent spatial and temporal dynamics described by the general circulation of the atmosphere. As such, in certain geographical areas wind's assistance (or hindrance) on migratory flight is also persistent, being dependent upon the bird's migratory direction in relation to prevailing wind conditions. We propose that, considering the western migration route of nocturnal migrants through Europe, winds should be more supportive in spring than in autumn. Thus, we expect higher ground speeds, contributing to higher overall migration speeds, in spring. To test whether winds were more supportive in spring than autumn, we quantified monthly wind conditions within western Europe relative to the seasonal direction of migration using 30 years (1978-2008) of wind data from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis dataset. We found that supporting winds were significantly more frequent for spring migration compared to autumn and up to twice as frequent at higher altitudes. We then analyzed three years (2006-2008) of nocturnal migratory ground speeds measured with radar in the Netherlands which confirmed higher ground speeds in spring than autumn. This seasonal difference in ground speed suggests a 16.9% increase in migration speed from autumn to spring. These results stress the importance of considering the specific wind conditions experienced by birds when interpreting migration speed. We provide a simple methodological approach enabling researchers to quantify regional wind conditions for any geographic area and time period of interest.

AB Background: In adaptive radiations, ecological opportunity (i.e. niche availability) is considered to be an important driver to increase phenotypic variation, but diversity may also be constrained by historical factors related to colonization events.
   Question: How do ecological opportunity and post-glacial colonization history affect the phenotypic diversity in a young species lineage?
   Data: We quantified phenotypic diversity by the number of co-existing morphs and a heritable morphological trait (gill raker number) in 39 European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretto populations. Level of diversity was compared within and between three sub-arctic watercourses, and explored in relation to ecological opportunity (habitat availability and lake productivity) and colonization history (lake elevation and position).
   Results: We found three main distribution patterns of gill raker number: unimodal (approximate range 20-30), bimodal (20-30 vs. 30-40), and trimodal (15-20 vs. 20-30 vs. 30-40), representing monomorphic, dimorphic, and trimorphic populations respectively. In addition, a pattern intermediate to the monomorphic and dimorphic populations was recorded in all watercourses. Polymorphism increased from west to east among watercourses, which can mainly be explained by post-glacial colonization history. Higher diversity was also observed in downstream sites within each watercourse, and increased with lake size and productivity.
   Conclusion: Our findings confirm that both ecological opportunity and historical constraints related to post-glacial colonization influence phenotypic patterns in a diverging lineage.

AB Plant growth responses to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are highly variable, ranging from mutualism in a wide range of plants, to antagonism in some non-mycorrhizal plant species and plants characteristic of disturbed environments. Many agricultural weeds are non mycorrhizal or originate from ruderal environments where AMF are rare or absent. This led us to hypothesize that AMF may suppress weed growth, a mycorrhizal attribute which has hardly been considered. We investigated the impact of AMF and AMF diversity (three versus one AMF taxon) on weed growth in experimental microcosms where a crop (sunflower) was grown together with six widespread weed species. The presence of AMF reduced total weed biomass with 47% in microcosms where weeds were grown together with sunflower and with 25% in microcosms where weeds were grown alone. The biomass of two out of six weed species was significantly reduced by AMF (-66% & -59%) while the biomass of the four remaining weed species was only slightly reduced (-20% to -37%). Sunflower productivity was not influenced by AMF or AMF diversity. However, sunflower benefitted from AMF via enhanced phosphorus nutrition. The results indicate that the stimulation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in agro-ecosystems may suppress some aggressive weeds.

AB Disturbance and management approaches can contribute significantly to restoration of degraded grassland ecosystems. This study has examined the re-establishment of artificial grassland to renew extremely degraded black-soils in an alpine area of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, in China. We evaluated this method for which grassland ecosystem responses to this restoration approach are needed. Here, we evaluated the response of aboveground plant communities and belowground soil nutrient and soil carbon storage to the establishment of artificial grassland in grasslands on black-soils in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Three grasslands sites were selected: a degraded grassland on an original black-soil, and 3- and 6-year-old Elymus nutans artificial grasslands. Artificial grassland establishment significantly improved aboveground biomass, but also significantly decreased species richness, diversity and evenness for black-soil-type degraded grassland. Artificial grassland establishment resulted in significantly improved soil total nitrogen and phosphorus, and decreased soil organic matter, available nitrogen, and phosphorus, especially in the depth of 20-30 cm soil layer. Although artificial grassland establishment significantly improved soil organic carbon in the topsoil (0-10 cm), it decreased at depths of 10-20 and 20-30 cm. Six-year artificial grassland significantly increased soil carbon storage compared with black-soil-type degraded grasslands. Accordingly, artificial grassland can be used as effective restoration and rehabilitation approach to improve productivity and regulate community and soil properties in black-soil-type degraded grasslands. Our results suggest that ecosystem functions such as production of aboveground biomass, the provision of soil surface cover, and nutrient accumulation may be provided by artificial grassland. However, more time is needed for plant diversity and soil carbon storage functions to recover fully from degradation.

AB The uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) dramatically changed the topography and climate of Asia and affected the biodiversity of the plateau and its adjacent areas. However, the effects of the uplift on the dispersal, differentiation and adaptation of plants remain a puzzle when the date and processes of the uplift cannot be determined with certainty and the impacts of the Quaternary glaciations on plants on the QTP are unknown. To clarify the relationships among plants on the QTP with the plateau uplift and the Quaternary glaciations, the cpDNA trnT-trnF regions of 891 individuals from 37 populations of Hippophae tibetana, endemic to the QTP, were sequenced in the present study. A total of 50 haplotypes were found and a strong phylogeographic structure was revealed (N-ST = 0.854, G(ST) = 0.611, N-ST > G(ST), P < 0.01). The results show that three main lineages of the present populations of H. tibetana occupy the western, the middle, and the eastern geographical range, respectively, and their divergence time dates back to 3.15 Ma before present. Of 50 haplotypes, 33 (66%) are private haplotypes, which are restricted to single populations. These private haplotypes are scattered throughout the present geographical range of H. tibetana and originated from multiple differentiations in many lineages during more than 1.0 Ma period, strongly suggesting that multiple microrefugia of H. tibetana existed throughout the present geographical range during the last glacial maximum (LGM) and even earlier glaciations. Additionally, the average elevation of present populations is over 4500 m in the west and the equilibrium-line of glaciers in the LGM was 500-300 m lower than present in the major interior part of the plateau suggesting that at most sites in the west, LGM microrefugia of H. tibetana may have been above 4000 m above sea level, the highest of all known refugia. Moreover, the divergence times among and within the three lineages and their distinct distributions as well as dispersal barriers support the theory of the recent and rapid uplift of the QTP. The rapid uplift of the plateau within the last 3.4 Ma and the associated environmental changes may have affected the dispersal and differentiation of H .tibetana and shaped its phylogeographic structure.

AB Lack of independence, or pseudoreplication, in samples from ecological studies of insects reflects the complexity of working with living organisms: the finite and limited input of individuals, their relatedness (ecological and/or genetic), and the need to group organisms into functional experimental units to estimate population parameters (e.g., cohort replicates). Several decades ago, when the issue of pseudoreplication was first recognized, it was highlighted that mainstream statistical tools were unable to account for the lack of independence. For example, the variability as a result of differences across individuals would be confounded with that of the experimental units where they were observed (e.g., pans for mosquito larvae), whereas both sources of variability now can be separated using modern statistical techniques, such as the linear mixed effects model, that explicitly consider the different scales of variability in a dataset (e.g., mosquitoes and pans). However, the perception of pseudoreplication as a problem without solution remains. This study presents concepts to critically appraise pseudoreplication and the linear mixed effects model as a statistical solution for analyzing data with pseudoreplication, by separating the different sources of variability and thereby generating correct inferences from data gathered in studies with constraints in randomization.

AB P>1. The coexistence of leguminous trees and C-4 grasses in many African savannas forces competition between these two distinct plant life-forms. The nature of tree-grass coexistence and the consequent competition for resources remains poorly understood.
   2. We hypothesized that grass suppression of tree seedling growth was due to competition for N in plants not capable of fixing N-2 and due to the costs of N-2 fixation in those capable of nodulation.
   3. Growth and N-2 fixation of nodulating (Acacia karroo, Acacia nilotica, Acacia tortilis and Acacia nigrescens) and non-nodulating (Acacia ataxacantha Acacia brevispica and Acacia schweinfurthii) Acacia spp. in response to soil characteristics and fertilizer variations in irrigated field experiments were compared. The extent of N-2 fixation was determined from delta 15N values.
   4. Grass suppressed the growth of all species, but particularly of the non-nodulating species. The N-2-fixing tree seedlings had high tissue N and high water-use efficiencies (WUE, based on delta 13C) relative to non-nodulating legumes, making the N-2-fixing species strong competitors with C-4 grasses, which have low tissue N contents and high WUE. The suppression of seedling growth by grass was smaller for plants grown in a soil with 66 mg kg-1 than in a soil with 9 mg kg-1 of Bray II P. The tissue N : P ratios (15.1) indicated that P-limitation constrained growth of seedlings in soils with low Bray II P when grass was present, rather than the energetic costs of N-2 fixation.
   5.Synthesis. In Acacia savannas and in the absence of water limitation, competition for N is the main constraint imposed by grass on growth of Acacia seedlings and that the ability to fix N-2 overcomes this limitation. However, the growth of N-2 fixing Acacias may be additionally limited by grass competition for P.

AB Positive interactions are hypothesized to increase with stress (stress-gradient hypothesis, "SGH"), which is defined in terms of standing biomass at the community level. However, recent evidence suggests that facilitation may decrease or remain constant as stress increases. Several reasons for this discrepancy are possible: (i) the outcomes of biotic interactions depend on the component of the fitness considered; (ii) they are influenced by how vegetation affects local limiting resources; (iii) within a particular community, only species that are deviated from their physiological optima are likely to be facilitated. In a removal experiment, we quantified the deviations of species in subalpine grassland from their physiological optima, defined here as species-level "strain", and examined whether strain and vegetation effects on local resources can explain the outcome of biotic interactions. The experiment was performed along a gradient of standing biomass driven by contrasting land use and resource availability, and used five grass species with contrasting traits and ecological optima. Strain for each species was estimated by comparing growth without vegetation (target species only submitted to local abiotic factors) to growth in optimal conditions (under controlled conditions in an experimental garden). The outcomes of biotic interactions, recorded in terms of survival and growth, Could be predicted from the data about strain and vegetation effects on local limiting resources (light and water). Only highly strained species were affected by facilitation, which occurred when the surrounding vegetation alleviated the constraining factors. On the other hand, standing biomass was poorly related with the outcomes of biotic interactions. The "SGH" was only partially validated with growth data when strain and vegetation effects co-varied with standing biomass. As a consequence, strain (at species level) represents a mechanistic basis which could improve the prediction of the outcomes of biotic interactions along ecological gradients.

   TRANSPIRATION; CARBON; CO2
AB Temperature measurements in trunks and branches in a mature ca. 100 years-old mixed pine and spruce forest in central Sweden were used to estimate the heat storage in the tree biomass. The estimated heat flux in the sample trees and data on biomass distributions were used to scale up to stand level biomass heat fluxes. The rate of change of sensible and latent heat storage in the air layer below the level of the flux measurements was estimated from air temperature and humidity profile measurements and soil heat flux was estimated from heat flux plates and soil temperature measurements. The fluxes of sensible and latent heat from the forest were measured with an eddy covariance system in a tower. The analysis was made for a two-month period in summer of 1995. The tree biomass heat flux was the largest of the estimated storage components and varied between 40 and -35 W m(-2) on summer days with nice weather. Averaged over two months the diurnal maximum of total heat storage was 45 W m(-2) and the minimum was -35 W m(-2). The soil heat flux and the sensible heat storage in air were out of phase with the biomass flux and they reached maximum values that were about 75% of the maximum of the tree biomass heat storage. The energy balance closure improved significantly when the total heat storage was added to the turbulent fluxes. The slope of a regression line with sum of fluxes and storage as independent and net radiation as dependent variable, increased from 0.86 to 0.95 for half-hourly data and the scatter was also reduced. The most significant finding was, however, that during nights with strongly stable conditions when the sensible heat flux dropped to nearly zero, the total storage matched the net radiation very well. Another interesting result was that the mean energy imbalance started to increase when the Richardson number became more negative than ca. -0.1. In fact, the largest energy deficit occurred at maximum instability. Our conclusion is that eddy covariance measurements can function well during stable conditions but that the functioning under strong instabilities might be a so far unforeseen problem.

AB The seminal work of Stern and his coauthors on integrated control has had a profound and long-lasting effect on the development of IPM programs in western orchard systems. Management systems based solely on pesticides have proven to be unstable, and the success of IPM systems in western orchards has been driven by conservation of natural enemies to control secondary pests, combined with pesticides and mating disruption to suppress the key lepidopteran pests. However, the legislatively mandated changes in pesticide use patterns prompted by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 have resulted in an increased instability of pest populations in orchards because of natural enemy destruction. The management system changes have made it necessary to focus efforts on enhancing biological control not only of secondary pests but also of primary lepidopteran pests to help augment new pesticides and mating disruption tactics. The new management programs envisioned will be information extensive as well as time sensitive and will require redesign of educational and outreach programs to be successful. The developing programs will continue to use the core principles of Stern and his co-authors, but go beyond them to incorporate changes in society, technology and information transfer, as needed.

AB Despite extensive paleoecological analyses of spatial and temporal turnover in species composition, the fidelity with which time-averaged death assemblages capture variation in species composition and diversity partitioning of living communities remains unexplored. Do death assemblages vary in composition between sites to a lesser degree than do living assemblages, as Would be predicted from time-averaging? And is the higher number of species observed in death relative to living assemblages reduced with increasing spatial scale? We quantify the preservation of spatial and temporal variation in species composition using I I regional data sets based on samples of living molluscan communities and their co-occurring time-averaged death assemblages. (1) Compositional dissimilarities among living assemblages (LA) within data sets are significantly positively rank-correlated to dissimilarities among Counterpart pairs of death assemblages (DA), demonstrating that pairwise dissimilarity within a study area has a good preservation potential in the fossil record. Dissimilarity indices that downplay the abundance of dominant species return the highest live-dead agreement of variation in species composition. (2) The average variation in species composition (average dissimilarity) is consistently smaller in DAs than in LAs (9 of 11 data sets). This damping of variation might arise from DAs generally having a larger sample size, but the reduction by similar to 10-20%, mostly persists even in size-standardized analyses (4 to 7 of 11 data sets, depending on metric). Beta diversity expressed by the number of compositionally distinct communities is also significantly reduced in death assemblages in size-standardized analyses (by similar to 25%,). This damping of variation and reduction in beta diversity is in accord with the loss of temporal resolution expected from time-averaging, without invoking taphonomic bias (from differential preservation or postmortem transportation) or sample-size effects. The loss of temporal resolution should directly reduce temporal variation, and assuming time-for-space substitution owing to random walk within one habitat and/or temporal habitat shifting, it also decreases spatial variation in species composition. (3) DAs are more diverse than LAs at the alpha scale, but the difference is reduced at gamma scales because partitioning of alpha and beta components differs significantly between LAs and DAs. This indicates that the effects of time-averaging are reduced with increasing spatial scale. Thus, overall, time-averaged molluscan DAs do capture variation among samples of the living assemblage, but they tend to damp the magnitude of variation, making them a conservative means of inferring change over time or variation among regions in species composition and diversity, Rates of temporal and spatial species turnover documented in the fossil record are thus expected to be depressed relative to the turnover rates that are predicted by models of community dynamics, which assume higher temporal resolution. Finally, the capture by DAs of underlying variation in the LA implies little variation in the net preservation potential of death assemblages across environments, despite the different taphonomic pathways suggested by taphofacies studies.

AB Despite increasing evidence on the importance of species functional characteristics for ecosystem processes, two major hypotheses suggest different mechanisms: the 'mass ratio hypothesis' assumes that functional traits of the dominant species determine ecosystem processes, while the 'complementarity hypothesis' predicts that resource niches may be used more completely when a community is functionally more diverse. Here, we present a method which uses two different groups of biotic predictor variables being (1) abundance-weighted mean (=aggregated) trait values and (2) functional trait diversity based on Rao's quadratic diversity (FD(Q)) to test the competing hypotheses on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships after accounting for co-varying abiotic factors. We applied this method to data recorded on biodiversity-biomass relationships and environmental variables in 35 semi-natural temperate grasslands and used a literature-based matrix of fourteen plant functional traits to assess the explanatory power of models including different sets of predictor variables. Aboveground community biomass did not correlate with species richness. Abiotic factors, in particular soil nitrogen concentration, explained about 50% of variability in aboveground biomass. The best model incorporating functional trait diversity explained only about 30%, while the best model based on aggregated trait values explained about 54% of variability in aboveground biomass. The inclusion of all predictor variable groups in a combined model increased the predictive power to about 75%. This model comprised soil nitrogen concentration as abiotic factor, aggregated traits being indicative for species competitive dominance (rooting depth, leaf distribution, specific leaf area, perennial life cycle) and functional trait diversity in vegetative plant height, leaf area and life cycle. Our study strongly suggests that abiotic factors, trait values of the dominant species and functional trait diversity in combination may best explain differences in aboveground community biomass in natural ecosystems and that their isolated consideration may be misleading.

AB Stigma and spikelet characteristics play an essential role in hybrid seed production. A mini-core of 90 accessions developed from USDA rice core collection was phenotyped in field grown for nine traits of stigma and spikelet and genotyped with 109 DNA markers, 108 SSRs plus an indel. Three major clusters were built upon Rogers' genetic distance, indicative of indicas, and temperate and tropical japonicas. A mixed linear model combining PC-matrix and K-matrix was adapted for mapping marker-trait associations. Resulting associations were adjusted using false discovery rate technique. We identified 34 marker-trait associations involving 22 SSR markers for eight traits. Four markers were associated with single stigma exsertion (SStgE), six with dual exsertion (DStgE) and five with total exsertion. RM5_Chr1 played major role indicative of high regression with not only DStgE but also SStgE. Four markers were associated with spikelet length, three with width and seven with L/W ratio. Numerous markers were co-associated with multiple traits that were phenotypically correlated, i.e. RM12521_Chr2 associated with all three correlated spikelet traits. The co-association should improve breeding efficiency because single marker could be used to assist breeding for multiple traits. Indica entry 1032 (cultivar 50638) and japonica entry 671 (cultivar Linia 84 Icar) with 80.65 and 75.17% of TStgE, respectively are recommended to breeder for improving stigma exsertion.

AB Cryptic species are a major challenge for alpha-taxonomy in ants. Their reliable identification requires the application of elaborate methods such as Numeric Morphology-Based Alpha-Taxonomy or analysis of DNA and cuticular hydrocarbons. Complications caused by intraspecific polymorphism and interspecific hybridisation necessitate integrating these methods in multi-source approaches. The frequency of cryptic species was estimated in three ant genera subject to a thorough analysis as +/- 46% of about 94 Palaearctic Lasius species, +/- 43% of about 67 Palaearctic Formica species and +/- 52% of about 77 Cardiocondyla species worldwide. Similarly high ratios were predicted for other ant genera, although testable data are missing. Cryptic biodiversity is not evenly distributed within the evaluated ant genera. The indicative value of the following investigation methods was assessed in ants: Morphology-Based Alpha-Taxonomy (MOBAT), Numeric MOBAT (NUMOBAT), analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, cuticular hydrocarbons, pheromones, allozymes, karyotypes, ethology, and ecology. NUMOBAT is arguably the "backbone" of a testable integrative taxonomy, the deciding link to Zoological Nomenclature, the only useable method for DNA-degraded specimens and the only method to examine vouchers in which no damage is allowed. The unacceptably high ratios of paraphyly in mtDNA barcoding forbid its application as primary decision finder. In conclusion, no single method but only an integrative, multi-source alpha-taxonomy offers the most convincing approach towards recognition of real biodiversity.

AB The red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) is a well-known forest animal distributed all over Europe. Still, we are far from having a firm knowledge of the species' phylogeography. This study investigates the genetic differentiation of S. vulgaris across the species' Eurasian range, using sequence data from the mitochondrial DNA gene (D-loop, 252 base pairs, cytochrome b, 359 base pairs), and eight variable autosomal microsatellite loci genotyped for 236 individuals. The results reveal the presence of two main mitochondrial phylogroups. The first clade comprises the individuals from the region of Calabria in southern Italy, belonging to the subspecies S. v. meridionalis, while the second clade contains the remainder of the studied individuals. Bayesian analysis of microsatellite genotypes resulted in three main clusterings corresponding to the three S. vulgaris subspecies: infuscatus, meridionalis and fuscoater. Geographical distribution of mtDNA haplotypes and mismatch analysis suggest a common refugium for the red squirrel across most of its present range from which expansion happened rather rapidly. The genotype mixing of italicus with northern populations could be a residual of postglacial expansion. The lack of mixing between the Calabrian lineage and the rest of European red squirrel haplotypes can be seen as evidence for distinct histories throughout the Pleistocene. Calabrian mtDNA probably diverged in an ice age contraction and remained isolated from the neighbouring squirrel populations until very recent times.

AB Gross primary productivity (GPP) changes occur at different time-scales and due to various mechanisms such as variations in leaf area, chlorophyll content, rubisco activity, and stomatal conductance. Diagnostic estimates of primary productivity are obviously error prone when these changes are not accounted for. Additional complications arise when factors inuencing a biome-specific maximum light use efficiency (LUE) must be estimated over a large area. In these cases a direct estimation of ecosystem LUE could reduce uncertainty of GPP estimates. Here, we analyse whether a MODIS-based photochemical reectance index (PRI) is a useful proxy for the light use efficiency of a Mediterranean Quercus ilex forest. As the originally proposed reference band for PRI is not available on MODIS, we tested the reference bands 1 (620-670 nm), 4 (545-565 nm), 12 (546-556 nm), 13 (662-672 nm), and 14 (673-683 nm) using different atmospheric correction algorithms. We repeated the analysis with different temporal resolutions of LUE (half-hourly to daily). The strongest correlation between LUE and PRI was found when considering only a narrow range of viewing angles at a time (especially 0-10 degrees and 30-40 degrees). We found that the MODIS-based PRI was able to track ecosystem LUE even during severe summer time water limitation. For this Mediterranean-type ecosystem we could show that a GPP estimation based on PRI is a huge improvement compared to the MODIS GPP algorithm. In this study, MODIS spectral band 1 turned out to be the most suitable reference band for PRI, followed by the narrow red bands 13 and 14. As to date no universally applicable reference band was identified in MODIS-based PRI studies, we advocate thorough testing for the optimal band combination in future studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this study, we explore how a hurricane disturbance influenced carbon allocation for the production of new fine roots.
   Before and after a hurricane, we measured the age of carbon (time since fixation from the atmosphere) in fine root structural tissues using natural abundance radiocarbon (C-14) measured by accelerator mass spectrometry. Roots were sampled from five seasonally dry tropical forests ranging in age from 6 yr to a mature forest.
   Structural carbon in combined live + dead roots picked from soil cores sampled 1 month before the hurricane had mean ages ranging from 4 to 11 yr, whereas live roots alone had ages of 1-2 yr. Structural carbon in new live fine roots produced over a period lasting from 3 wk before the hurricane to 2 months after the event had mean ages of between 2 and 10 yr.
   Contrary to expectations, our results showed that plants allocate long-lived storage carbon pools to the production of new fine roots after canopy defoliation and root mortality. The age of the carbon allocated for new roots increased with forest age and forest above-ground biomass, suggesting an adaptation of plants to survive and recover from severe disturbances.

TI Hybridization among Three Native North American Canis Species in a
   Region of Natural Sympatry
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Population densities of many species throughout the world are changing due to direct persecution as well as anthropogenic habitat modification. These changes may induce or increase the frequency of hybridization among taxa. If extensive, hybridization can threaten the genetic integrity or survival of endangered species. Three native species of the genus Canis, coyote (C. latrans), Mexican wolf (C. lupus baileyi) and red wolf (C. rufus), were historically sympatric in Texas, United States. Human impacts caused the latter two to go extinct in the wild, although they survived in captive breeding programs. Morphological data demonstrate historic reproductive isolation between all three taxa. While the red wolf population was impacted by introgressive hybridization with coyotes as it went extinct in the wild, the impact of hybridization on the Texas populations of the other species is not clear.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We surveyed variation at maternally and paternally inherited genetic markers (mitochondrial control region sequence and Y chromosome microsatellites) in coyotes from Texas, Mexican wolves and red wolves from the captive breeding programs, and a reference population of coyotes from outside the historic red wolf range. Levels of variation and phylogenetic analyses suggest that hybridization has occasionally taken place between all three species, but that the impact on the coyote population is very small.
   Conclusion/Significance: Our results demonstrate that the factors driving introgressive hybridization in sympatric Texan Canis are multiple and complex. Hybridization is not solely determined by body size or sex, and density-dependent effects do not fully explain the observed pattern either. No evidence of hybridization was identified in the Mexican wolf captive breeding program, but introgression appears to have had a greater impact on the captive red wolves.

AB In this study we compared ground beetles (Carabidae) from a range of different forest fragments along an urbanization gradient in Brussels, Belgium. We address the following questions: (i) How does the degree of urbanization in the surrounding habitat affect forest beetles, and does it interact with the effects of patch size and distance to forest edge? (ii) Do these factors have a different effect at the level of individual species, habitat affinity groups or total community? During 2002 we sampled 13 forest plots in 10 forest patches, ranging in size from 5.27 to 4383 ha. The beetles were captured using transects of pitfall traps from the edge to a distance of 100 m into each woodland and identified to species level. Effects of urbanization, forest size and forest edge were evaluated on total species number, abundance and habitat affinity groups and ten abundant, widespread model carabid species. Overall, the effects of urbanization, forest size and edge effects slightly influenced total species richness and abundance but appeared to have a major effect on ground beetle assemblages through species specific responses. More urbanized sites had significantly fewer forest specialists and more generalist species. Large forest fragments were favoured by forest specialist species while generalist species and species frequently associated with forest (forest generalists) dominated the smaller forests. Forest edges mainly harboured generalist species while forest specialist species were more frequent into the forests if the forest patches were large enough, otherwise they disappeared due to the destruction or impoverishment of their habitat. Our results show the importance of differentiating between habitat affinity, especially habitat generalists versus specialists, the latter having a higher value in nature conservation, and merely the quantity of species represented in human-dominated areas.

AB Marine sediments of coastal margins are important sites of carbon sequestration and nitrogen cycling. To determine the metabolic potential and structure of marine sediment microbial communities, two cores were collected each from the two stations (GMT at a depth of 200 m and GMS at 800 m) in the Gulf of Mexico, and six subsamples representing different depths were analyzed from each of these two cores using functional gene arrays containing similar to 2,000 probes targeting genes involved in carbon fixation; organic carbon degradation; contaminant degradation; metal resistance; and nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorous cycling. The geochemistry was highly variable for the sediments based on both site and depth. A total of 930 (47.1%) probes belonging to various functional gene categories showed significant hybridization with at least 1 of the 12 samples. The overall functional gene diversity of the samples from shallow depths was in general lower than those from deep depths at both stations. Also high microbial heterogeneity existed in these marine sediments. In general, the microbial community structure was more similar when the samples were spatially closer. The number of unique genes at GMT increased with depth, from 1.7% at 0.75 cm to 18.9% at 25 cm. The same trend occurred at GMS, from 1.2% at 0.25 cm to 15.2% at 16 cm. In addition, a broad diversity of geochemically important metabolic functional genes related to carbon degradation, nitrification, denitrification, nitrogen fixation, sulfur reduction, phosphorus utilization, contaminant degradation, and metal resistance were observed, implying that marine sediments could play important roles in biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfate, and various metals. Finally, the Mantel test revealed significant positive correlations between various specific functional genes and functional processes, and canonical correspondence analysis suggested that sediment depth, PO43-, NH4+ Mn(II), porosity, and Si(OH)(4) might play major roles in shaping the microbial community structure in the marine sediments.

AB Aim To present a method that assesses the influence of environmental variables, including climate, substrate, topography, and anthropogenic disturbances, on the distribution of Andean forest at the tree line, and to compare this forest distribution between areas.
   Location Sangay National Park, on the eastern slopes of the Andes in central Ecuador.
   Methods A logistic regression model was built using topographical variables and environmental indices, derived from a digital elevation model, to explain forest cover, derived from a Landsat ETM image, in a zone around the average tree line altitude.
   Results The model shows that after altitude, which can explain about 80% of forest cover, wetness has the next strongest effect (areas accumulating water, but also cold air, were devoid of forest, resulting in inverted tree lines), followed by eastness (western slopes had forest to higher altitudes). Application of the model in two nearby areas showed that the real tree line was lower than the predicted tree line in both areas, probably owing mainly to macroclimatic differences in one area, and partly also to human land use in the other. The locations with the largest deviations could be the focus of further research concerning human impacts on tree line vegetation.
   Main conclusions The tree line is located at lower altitudes on east-facing slopes, which may be because high levels of radiation are received by east-facing slopes in the clear mornings, resulting in the photoinhibition of tree seedlings in the paramo. In spite of the limitations of the quality and resolution of the remote sensing data, the presented method provides indications for important ecological factors at the tree line. The method also allows the detection of differences in tree line position between areas, which may reflect climatic differences or the location of anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Growth during an animal's early ontogeny can have important consequences for its health, reproduction and survival during later life. We studied pre-weaning growth rates of two species of small altricial mammals, and assessed the impact and compared the importance of two main aspects of the animals' early environment: maternal characteristics and the number of litter siblings (i.e. litter size). Study animals were wild-type European rabbits living in a field enclosure and laboratory rats kept under standardized housing conditions. Growth of rabbit pups was best explained (to 47%) by the combined effects of litter size, maternal age and whether females had given birth to another litter shortly before. Similarly, growth in rat pups was best explained (to 75%) by the combined effects of litter size, maternal body mass and whether mothers had previously given birth. In both species, litter size correlated negatively with pup growth. In rabbits, growth was greatest in litters of middle-aged females. In rats, pup growth correlated positively with maternal mass. Pups of both species showed higher growth rates when the mother had not given birth to a previous litter. Despite major differences in maternal behaviour and study conditions between the two species, the findings point to a similar ranking in the importance of the different parameters tested: Litter size, i.e. sibling number, was the most important factor, followed by maternal mass or age, and then by mothers' history of previous reproductive activity. We therefore think it likely that these findings will be valid for other mammalian species giving birth to large litters of altricial young. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A comparative survey of weed vegetation in organic and conventional dryland winter cereal fields was performed in central Catalonia (NE Spain) in order to assess the effects of agricultural intensification on the diversity, structure and composition of weed communities. A total of 36 cereal fields were surveyed in nine agricultural sites, where a pair of one long-established organic and one conventional farms were selected. Weed surveys were carried out before harvest in 2003 and 2004, taking into account the spatial pattern. Organic practices produced an increase in weed cover, species richness and Hill's first order diversity (but not in equitability), as well as a shift in weed vegetation composition, which favoured potentially rare arable, broad-leaved, insect-pollinated and legume weeds. Weed diversity was concentrated in the crop edges, especially in the weed communities of conventional cereal fields, which were found to be more spatially heterogeneous than the organic ones.

AB This study is one of the first to show that invasive plant-induced changes in the soil microbial community can negatively impact native plant performance. This greenhouse experiment tested whether soil microbial communities specific to the rhizospheres of an invasive grass (Aegilops triuncialis) and two native plants (Lasthenia californica and Plantago erecta) affected invasive and/or native plant performance. Each of these species were grown in separate pots for 2 months to prime the soils with plant-specific rhizosphere microbial communities. Each plant species was then planted in native- and invasive-primed soil, and effects on plant performance were monitored. At 5 months, differences in microbial biomarker fatty acids between invaded and native soils mirrored previous differences found in field-collected soil. L. californica performance was significantly reduced when grown in invaded soil compared to native soil (flowering date was delayed, aboveground biomass decreased, specific root length increased, and root mass ratio increased). In contrast, P. erecta and A. triuncialis performance were unaffected when grown in invaded vs native soil. These results suggest that in some cases, invasion-induced changes in the soil microbial community may contribute to a positive feedback loop, leading to the increased dominance of invasive species in an ecosystem.

AB The distance at which an individual flees from a potential predator represents a measure of risk taking. If individuals are engaged in another activity that might affect fitness, trade-offs between the fitness benefits of flight and the other activity should determine the nearest distance of approach by a predator. In a comparative analysis of birds, flight distance represented a reliable measure of risk of predation by the sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus that increased with decreasing flight distance across species. To test the hypothesis that singing males adjusted their risk taking to the costs and benefits of early flight, we compared the flight distance of singing and nonsinging birds to an approaching human observing with a binocular. Singing birds on average fled at a greater distance than nonsinging birds, implying that singing birds took small risks. We used a standardized measure of difference in flight distance between singing and nonsinging individuals to investigate factors affecting interspecific variation in risk taking. Species that used more exposed song posts (sites used for singing) took smaller risks than species with less exposed song posts. Species that suffered from higher levels of parasitism as reflected by the prevalence of Plasmodium, but not by 3 other genera of blood parasites, took greater risks during singing compared with nonsinging activities. Likewise, species with high circulating levels of natural antibodies, and hence a history of natural selection caused by bacteria took relatively greater risks during singing than species with few natural antibodies. These findings suggest that risks taken by singing birds have been molded by natural and sexual selection, and that risk taking represents a compromise between the costs and benefits of flight from a potential predator.

AB We examined variation in the echolocation calls of Brazilian free-tailed bats, Tadarida brasiliensis, on a broad geographical scale and in response to local environmental variables. Significant differences in call structure were observed among populations throughout the species range in the United States, but this variation was not associated with geographical distance or local weather conditions. Observed variability between sites was primarily due to differences between bats, and the flexibility in call structure that can be achieved by individuals. During this study, we observed that bats recorded in the presence of highfrequency sounds from chorusing insects used higher call frequencies than bats recorded in silence. This led us to test the hypothesis that bats adjust echolocation call structure in response to local ambient noise. We broadcast experimentally manipulated ultrasonic insect sounds to free-flying Brazilian free-tailed bats and found a positive correlation between the frequency of the insect sound stimulus and the call frequencies used by bats. These results document that bats adjust echolocation call structure to avoid acoustic interference from ambient noise in their local environment.

AB Many Oreochromis species utilized in aquaculture were extensively introduced outside their native range in Africa. Given their recent evolutionary radiation, these species hybridize easily, posing a threat to the integrity of local adaptation. The objective of this work was to study the genetic diversity of the Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) in its native range, southern Africa, and provide a method for identifying hybrids with genetic markers. We genotyped the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (385 bp) of wild and farmed O. mossambicus, wild and farmed O. niloticus and morphologic wild hybrids. These data were complemented with published sequences of parapatric and sympatric Oreochromis taxa. Phylogeographic analysis showed the presence of two O. mossambicus lineages, the southernmost representing a recent Holocene radiation. Hybridization of O. mossambicus was indicated by the presence of O. niloticus and O. mortimeri-andersonii mtDNA specimens in the Limpopo basin and of O. karongae mtDNA in specimens from Malawi. We also genotyped seven suspected hybrid individuals from the Limpopo River, and 137 wild and farmed Mozambique and Nile tilapia samples with five microsatellite markers. Factorial Component Analysis, Bayesian clustering and assignment analyses consistently delineated an O. mossambicus and an O. niloticus group, with the putative hybrids positioned in between. Different levels of hybridization were detected by the Bayesian assignment. The complex nature of hybridization and introgression between cichlid species raises major concerns for the long-term integrity of Mozambique tilapia.

AB Biodiversity is an increasingly important criterion in designing ecological compensation areas and urban green areas. However, little is known about how important biodiversity is to the general public. This paper presents the results of two complementary studies investigating the meadow preferences of visitors to a botanical garden in Switzerland. In the first study, 152 people were asked to create their own favourite meadow patch by selecting 25 out of 779 local wild plants (54 species) that were displayed in flowerpots. In the second study, 143 people were asked with the help of a written questionnaire to imagine a bare piece of land the size of 100 m x 100 m close to their place of living and mentally create the meadow of their dreams. In both cases, study participants assembled meadows that were species-rich and rich in structural diversity (expressed by plant height and leaf forms). Moreover, they explicitly stated diversity as their main assemblage criterion. Although study participants favoured plants with large or colourful flowers, only a third of all plants in the meadows created with real plants were flowering and in people's imagined meadows grasses were frequently included, indicating that people like diverse meadows consisting of a green matrix with some colourful flowers.

AB Sudden oak death is an emerging forest disease caused by the pathogen Phytophthora ramorum that is invading the west coast of the United States and semi-natural areas in Europe. This disease causes lethal stem infections in oaks (Quercus spp.) and tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), as well as non-lethal foliar infections in a range of other species.
   We investigated two questions to evaluate the effect of landscape structure on the spread of P. ramorum: (i) does the spatial pattern of forested habitat predict P. ramorum disease severity, and is this relationship scale-dependent; and (ii) what influence does spatial pattern have on the optimal microclimate conditions for P. ramorum reproduction?
   We mapped the spatial distribution of suitable forest habitat for P. ramorum and established 86 randomly located field plots within a 20-km(2) region of northern California. For each plot, we quantified P. ramorum disease severity and measured the abundance of woody species. Disease severity in each plot was examined in relation to the surrounding landscape structure measured for nested landscapes of increasing scale.
   P. ramorum disease severity was greatest in plots surrounded by a high proportion of contiguous forest, after accounting for plot-level variables of host abundance, elevation, canopy cover and microclimate. The explanatory power of the model increased with increasing scale up to 200 m, but was not significant at scales less than 50 m.
   High disease severity was associated with lower temperatures in the field than the laboratory-determined optimal range for pathogen reproduction. Variation in microclimate conditions was explained by elevation, not the pattern of host vegetation, indicating that spatially varying disease severity was not a function of microclimate-related edge effects on pathogen growth and survival.
   Both landscape-scale configuration and local composition of host habitat are related to the severity of this destructive forest disease. Increased disease severity within contiguous woodlands may have a considerable impact on the composition of such woodlands, with cascading effects on the population dynamics of both host and pathogen.

AB Length of the sperm flagellum and of the female's primary sperm-storage organ, the seminal receptacle (SR), exhibit a pattern of rapid correlated evolution in Drosophila and other lineages. Experimental evolution studies with Drosophila melanogaster indicate that these traits have coevolved through sexual selection, with length of the SR representing the proximal basis of female sire discrimination, biasing paternity according to sperm length. Here, we examine the impact of experimentally varying the developmental environment, including larval density and larval and adult nutrition, on sperm length, SR length and on the pattern of sperm precedence. Expression of SR length was far more sensitive to variation among developmental environments than was sperm length. Nevertheless, there was striking co-variation in sperm and SR length. The developmental environment of both females and second males, but not first males, significantly contributed to variation in male competitive fertilization success.

AB 1. Loss in forest cover associated with human activities leads to forest islands within a fragmented landscape. Anthropogenic disturbance may also directly alter tree species diversity. Habitat fragmentation and disturbance may have implications for biodiversity conservation and can affect a variety of population and community processes over a range of temporal and spatial scales. Effects are manifest both within and between fragments. The complexity of this process challenges the predictive value of simple models based on island biogeographical theory.
   2. We analysed data on tree species diversity from 195 field plots in 16 tropical montane forest fragments in the Highlands of Chiapas, Mexico. Within this area we identified five community types. Variation in species diversity between fragments in each community was analysed by fitting linear models in which area, core area, edge/area ratio, and mean proximity index were related to mean plot diversity. Variations within fragments were then analysed using linear mixed-effects models in which the fixed effects were considered to be proximity to edge, canopy closure and a degradation index, whereas fragment-level variation was modelled as a random effect.
   3. Effects of fragmentation per se, defined as the reduction in area and connectivity between fragments, were not detectable. Within-fragment effects, however, were evident. Disturbance was associated with lower tree diversity at a local scale, and a notable impact on late successional species.
   4. While not statistically detectable, we expected fragmentation per se to be acting to reduce diversity in the long term. We therefore complemented our analysis by calculating the theoretical loss in species when the number of tree stems in a fragment was halved for each community type using resampled accumulation curves. These models predicted a maximum loss in transitional forest (12 species lost) and evergreen cloud forest fragments (seven to nine species lost) and a minimum loss in oak forest fragments (three species lost).
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results call into question the utility of island theory when setting conservation priorities for tree species. In our study region, and elsewhere, tree diversity is most immediately threatened by the effects of within-fragment disturbance. The few remaining areas of intact native forests should be prioritized for conservation regardless of their size and connectivity. If diversity is conserved within these fragments, the short-term effects of landscape-scale change may be minimized. They may then be reversed if long-term restoration initiatives can be implemented.

AB Bird fauna of the Madrid province (Central Spain) was analyzed according to urban development in a landscape mosaic of 700 km(2). Bird distribution and abundance was studied in urban versus several rural habitats and along a gradient of urban typologies. By means of tree regression analyses we identified the most important habitat structure variables affecting bird species richness and density in urban environments. Bird communities in urban environments were globally less diverse and had higher densities than any natural habitat of the study region. The number of urban-avoider species (n = 37) was greater than the number of species favoured by urban habitats (n = 8). Current housing developments of extense crowded terraced-houses, with shortage of gardens, supported the least diverse and dense bird populations. Nevertheless, differences in bird species abundance between urban and natural habitats mitigated in many species when considering the older gardened developments. The plots with the highest species richness (average of 14.5 spp./0.8 ha) were those with 15-28% of building cover, more than 43 medium-sized trees/ha (10-30 cm dbh), and 13-54 small trees/ha (less than 10 cm dbh). Subsequently, future land-use planning should stress the exclusion of urban developments from the most valuable habitats, such as open wooded valley areas devoted to cattle-grazing (mainly ash-groves), and the negative effect of dense, low-gardened housing developments.

AB The existence of suture zones in North America has recently been verified, yet the environmental factors responsible for the maintenance of their structure and position have remained undetermined. The Great Plains suture zone in the US is perhaps the most significant and broadly studied in North America. Numerous avian hybrid zones that cluster in this region have been extensively studied over the last half-century. A primary result of this work is that exogenous factors present in this region have promoted and maintained avian species divergence. Yet, to date the variables most important in the generation and the clustered positioning of these hybrid zones in relation to one another have not been determined. The present study aims to advance our understanding of this North American suture zone by using niche modelling to quantify which environmental variables are most important in its formation and maintenance. Through the generation of fundamental niches for four hybrids and their parental species, similarities linking the hybrid zones were uncovered. The results show that temperature holds this suture zone in position and also suggest that temperature played a primary role in promoting niche differentiation among these sister species pairs during Pleistocene glacial cycles.

The recent advances of biomolecular techniques have provided scientists with new tools to investigate these systems in greater detail and with higher resolution. Therefore existing concepts and hypotheses have been revisited and discussed with respect to their applicability for ecosystems ruled by microbial processes. This review has also led to some reflections on the suitability of the term "resilience" as a general goal in environmental policies.

AB Decreasing habitat fragment area and increasing isolation may cause loss of plant population genetic diversity and increased genetic differentiation between populations. We studied the relation between the historical and the present landscape configuration (i.e., patch area and patch connectivity), and the present management of calcareous grassland fragments on the one hand, and the within and between population genetic structure of 18 Anthyllis vulneraria populations on the other hand. Despite the long-time fragmentation history and the mainly selfing breeding system of the species, we detected very low genetic differentiation (phi(st) = 0.056) among habitat fragments and no significant isolation-by-distance relation. Average within fragment genetic diversity measured as molecular variance and expected heterozygosity, were relatively high (16.46 and 0.28, respectively), and weakly positively correlated with the current fragment area, most likely because larger fragments contained larger populations. We found no effects of the historical landscape configuration on the genetic diversity of the populations. Our data suggest that the consequences of habitat fragmentation for genetic differentiation and genetic diversity of A. vulneraria are relatively minor which is very likely due to the historical high levels of seed exchange among fragments through grazing and roaming livestock. This study provides indirect evidence that nature management by grazing not only positively affects habitat quality but that it might also mitigate the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation. From the conservation point of view, this study illustrates the importance of grazing and of the regular transport of livestock between fragments to prevent the long-term effects of fragmentation on the genetic diversity of the populations studied.

AB Sperm competition occurs when the gametes of two, or more, males compete for opportunities to fertilize a given set of ova. This study examined whether mammalian sperm morphology could be affected by sexual selection. Comparisons were made of linear and volumetric measurements of the sperm head, midpiece and flagellum for 123 species representing 71 genera of mammals having either single partner mating systems or multiple partner mating systems. Sperm midpiece volume was found to be significantly larger in those species were females mate with more than one male during a single peri-ovulatory period. A positive correlation was also found between relative testes sizes and sperm midpiece volumes, while no relationship was found with any other sperm measure. These results indicate that, within mammals, the evolution of sperm midpiece volume has been affected by selection pressures resulting from sperm competition. The significance of these findings may relate to the density of mitochondria within the sperm midpiece. The mitochondria provide the energy required for sperm motility, in the absence of glycolytic support. A higher mitochondrial loading may therefore be associated with enhanced sperm motility.

AB To test if some leaf parameters are predictors of productivity in a range of Populus deltoides (Bartr.) Marsh. x P. nigra L. clones, we assessed leaf traits and productivity in 2-month-old rooted cuttings from 31 clones growing in 4-1 pots in a greenhouse, under conditions of controlled temperature and optimal irrigation. We evaluated four groups of variables describing (1) productivity (total biomass), (2) leaf growth (total leaf number increment and total leaf area increment rate), (3) leaf structure (specific leaf area and nitrogen and carbon contents) and (4) carbon isotope discrimination (A), which is negatively correlated with time-integrated water-use efficiency. High-yielding clones did not necessarily display high leaf growth rates, but they displayed a larger total leaf area, lower specific leaf area and lower leaf nitrogen concentration than clones with low productivity. Total leaf area was mainly controlled by maximal individual leaf area and total leaf area increment rate (r = 0.51 and 0.56, respectively). Carbon isotope discrimination did not correlate with total biomass, but it was associated with total number of leaves and total leaf area increment rate (r = 0.39 and 0.45, respectively). Therefore, leaf area and specific leaf area were better indicators of productivity than leaf growth traits. The observed independence of A from biomass production provides opportunities for selecting poplar clones combining high productivity and high water-use efficiency.

AB Many ecological theories are based on the concept of patches. Patches are a useful starting point for conservation efforts, but a focus on patches alone will not always achieve desired conservation outcomes. Conservation strategies in the grazing landscapes of southeastern Australia suggest that large patches of trees are widely regarded as 'habitat' while other forms of habitat are largely ignored. We provide data on birds and reptiles from the Nanangroe grazing landscape that illustrate the potential habitat value of areas located between large patches of trees that is, the matrix. Despite evidence on its potential value, present conservation strategies rarely consider the matrix. Possible reasons for this bias relate to the economics of farming and the history of land use, the current environmental law framework, and also the reluctance of ecologists to study the matrix. More scientific evidence on the role of the matrix will be crucial if conservation strategies are to consider not only patches, but entire landscapes. However, for science to be relevant to land management, there is a need for new research approaches. First, an increased consideration of environmental policy and law will increase the likelihood of scientific findings being adopted by policy makers. Second, at an applied level, more practical on-ground research into farming practices and clearer communication are necessary to achieve more sustainable matrix management in Australian grazing landscapes.

AB In the past years, a number of studies have used experimental plant communities to test if biodiversity influences ecosystem functioning such as productivity. It has been argued, however, that the results achieved in experimental studies may have little predictive value for species loss in natural ecosystems. Studies in natural ecosystems have been equivocal, mainly because in natural ecosystems differences in diversity are often confounded with differences in land use history or abiotic parameters. In this study, we investigated the effect of plant diversity on ecosystem functioning in semi-natural grasslands. In an area of 10 x 20 km, we selected 78 sites and tested the effects of various measures of diversity and plant community composition on productivity. We separated the effects of plant diversity on ecosystem functioning from potentially confounding effects of community composition, management or environmental parameters, using multivariate statistical analyses. In the investigated grasslands, simple measures of biodiversity were insignificant predictors of productivity. However, plant community composition explained productivity very well (R-2=0.31) and was a better predictor than environmental variables (soil and site characteristics) or management regime. Thus, complex measures such as community composition and structure are important drivers for ecosystem functions in semi-natural grasslands. Furthermore, our data show that it is difficult to extrapolate results from experimental studies to semi-natural ecosystems, although there is a need to investigate natural ecosystems to fully understand the relationship of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

AB We assessed the degree of population subdivision among global populations of green sea turtles, Chelonia mydas, rising four microsatellite loci. Previously, a single-copy nuclear DNA study indicated significant male-mediated gene flow among populations alternately, fixed for different mitochondrial DNA haplotypes and that genetic divergence between populations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans was more common than subdivisions among populations within ocean basins. Even so, overall levels of variation at single-copy loci were low and inferences were limited. Here, the markedly, more variable microsatellite loci confirm the presence of male-mediated gene flow among populations within ocean basins. This analysis generally confirms the genetic divergence between the Atlantic and Pacific. As with the previous study, phylogenetic analyses of genetic distances based on the microsatellite loci indicate a close genetic relationship among eastern Atlantic and Indian Ocean populations. Unlike the single-copy study however, the results here cannot be attributed to an artifact of general low-variability and likely represent. recent. or ongoing migration between ocean basins. Sequence analyses of regions flanking the microsatellite repeat reveal considerable amounts of cryptic variation and homoplasy and significantly aid in our understanding of population connectivity. Assessment of the allele frequency distributions indicates that at least settle of the loci may not be evolving by the stepwise mutation model.

AB A three-step protocol described elsewhere is used to obtain a map of butterfly species density in Portugal on a 50x50 km grid. First, all available faunistic information was compiled and analysed to explore the historic patterns of butterfly sampling in Portugal, and to determine which grid cells are sufficiently prospected to produce reliable estimates of species richness. Then, we relate the estimated species richness scores from these areas to a set of environmental and spatial variables by means of General Linear Models, obtaining a function to extrapolate of species density scores to the rest of Portugal. Finally, the model is validated, results explored and outliers identified and deleted. Any spatial autocorrelation remaining in the residuals is examined. Lastly, model parameters are recalculated in absence of deleted outliers, and the resulting function is used to predict species richness scores throughout mainland Portugal. A highly-predictive function based on some variables previously related to butterfly composition at macro-scale, such as number of sunny days per year, temperature or environmental heterogeneity, was obtained. However, in Portugal those variables are highly spatially structured along a steep latitudinal gradient, leading to difficulty in ascertaining if the latitudinal gradient detected by our analysis is due to macroecological or historic effects. Information on European and Iberian butterfly assemblages and causal processes are discussed in the light of the patterns observed. Then, previous information obtained on Portuguese scarabs is added to identify conservation areas, biogeographically important for both insect groups. Finally, the main drawbacks and advantages of this approach to mapping biodiversity for conservation are discussed briefly.

AB We investigated the importance of water chemistry and water regime for vascular plant and bryophyte species distribution in Western Carpathian mires dominated by Sphagnum. Seventy-seven small circle plots distributed across a wide geographical area, a wide range of mineral richness and all possible microtopographical features were sampled in terms of species composition, physical-chemical water properties and water regime during one growing season. Both water chemistry and water regime were found to be important factors for vegetation composition. Bryophytes reflected only one clear gradient, connected to base-richness (pH, conductivity) and maximal water-level, whereas three different environmental gradients determined the occurrence of vascular plants: water-level amplitude, base-richness and an indistinct gradient presumably connected to peat layer thickness. When the entire data set was subjected to DCA ordination, the first resulting axis was governed by the bryophyte subset, whereas the second one was governed by the vascular plant subset. The species density of vascular plants was positively correlated with pH and conductivity. On the contrary, bryophyte species density showed no relationship to environmental factors. We further compared the pH values measured in groundwater and in water squeezed from bryophytes from the same plot; these plots were distributed along the base-richness gradient. Only in the acidic mires did the use of squeezed-water chemistry in the analyses give results similar to the use of groundwater pH. Further, we found that Sphagnum species with a similar response to the base-richness gradient had differentiated niches with respect to the water level gradient and vice versa. Sphagnum contortum and S. warnstorfii exhibiting the same demands for groundwater pH were segregated along the gradient of maximum water level. An analogous pattern was detected for acidophilous species Sphagnum magellanicum and S. papillosum.

AB Invasive plants are often more vigorous in novel habitats than in their native ranges. Sapium sebiferum (Chinese tallow tree) is a major invader of habitats in the southern United States. Long-term common garden experiments in Texas and Hawaii (USA) with S. sebiferant genotypes from its native range (Asia) and from areas in North America where it is invasive suggest that post-introduction evolutionary changes may contribute to its invasiveness in Texas. In Texas, where there was uniformly low herbivory, fast-growing, poorly defended invasive North American genotypes outperformed slower growing, better defended native Asian genotypes in common garden plots. In Hawaii, in contrast, an Asian herbivore, Adoretus sinicus (Chinese rose beetle) is abundant, and S. sebiferum is not invasive. In Hawaiian common garden plots, A. sinicus caused greater damage to North American genotypes, and Asian genotypes were competitively superior. Our results suggest that exotic plants freed from herbivory can evolve greater competitive ability, allowing them to become much more abundant than in their native ranges. This did not seem to occur, though, if herbivores from the native range were abundant.

AB Microsatellite analysis of the shortfin mako, shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) revealed very weak evidence of population structure. Samples collected from the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, North Pacific, South Pacific, and Atlantic, and Pacific coasts of South Africa were screened at four microsatellite loci. Multilocus measures of population subdivision were much lower than expected (F-ST = 0.0014, P = 0.1292; R-ST = 0.0029, P = 0.019). Power analysis revealed that the study had a high level of power (>0.995) to detect the magnitude of FST expected based on a previous study of mtDNA and assumptions of equal male and female dispersal. Thus, integrating the results from microsatellite- and mitochondrial-based studies may provide evidence for gender-biased dispersal for the shortfin mako.

AB Human growth in early life has major implications for fitness. During this period, the mother regulates the growth of her offspring through placental nutrition and lactation. However, parent-offspring conflict theory predicts that offspring are selected to demand more resources than the mother is selected to provide. This general issue has prompted the development of begging theory, which attempts to find the optimal Levels of offspring demand and parental provisioning. Several models have been proposed to account for begging behavior whether by biochemical or behavioral pathways, including: (1) blackmail of parents; (2) scramble competition between multiple offspring; (3) honest signaling of nutritional need; and (4) honest signaling of offspring worth. These models are all supported by data from nonhuman animals, with species varying according to which model is relevant. This paper examines the evidence that human suckling and crying signal nutritional demand, need, and worth to the mother. Mile suckling provides hormonal stimulation of breast milk production and signals hunger crying fulfills a different role, with evidence suggesting that it signals both worth and need for resources (nutrition and thermoregulation). The role of signaling in nutritional demand is examined in the context of three common health problems that have traditionally been assumed to have physiological rather than behavioral causes: excess weight gain, failure to thrive, and colic. The value of such an evolutionary approach lies in its Potential to enhance behavioral management of these conditions.

AB Resource allocation within individuals may often be hierarchical, and this may have important effects on genetic correlations and on trait evolution. For example, organisms may divide energy between reproduction and somatic growth and then subdivide reproductive resources. Genetic variation in allocation to pathways early in such hierarchies (e. g., reproduction) can cause positive genetic correlations between traits that trade off (e. g., offspring size and number) because some individuals invest more resources in reproduction than others. We used quantitative-genetic models to explore the evolutionary implications of allocation hierarchies. Our results showed that when variation in allocation early in the hierarchy exceeds subsequent variation in allocation, genetic covariances and initial responses to selection do not reflect trade-offs occurring at later levels in the hierarchy. This general pattern was evident for many starting allocations and optima and for whether traits contributed multiplicatively or additively to fitness. Finally, artificial selection on a single trait revealed masked trade-offs when variation in early allocation was comparable to subsequent variation in allocation. This result confirms artificial selection as a powerful, but not foolproof, method of detecting trade-offs. Thus, allocation hierarchies can profoundly affect life-history evolution by causing traits to evolve in the opposite direction to that predicted by trade-offs.

AB Giant Galapagos tortoises represent an interesting model for the study of patterns of genetic divergence and adaptive differentiation related to island colonization events. Recent mitochondrial DNA work elucidated the evolutionary history of the species and helped to clarify aspects of nomenclature. We used 10 microsatellite loci to assess levels of genetic divergence among and within island populations. In particular, we described the genetic structure of tortoises on the island of Isabela, where discrimination of different taxa is still subject of debate. Individual island populations were all genetically distinct. The island of Santa Cruz harboured two distinct populations. On Isabela, populations of Volcan Wolf, Darwin and Alcedo were significantly different from each other. On the other hand, Volcan Wolf showed allelic similarity with the island of Santiago. On Southern Isabela, lower genetic divergence was found between Northeast Sierra Negra and Volcan Alcedo, while patterns of gene flow were recorded among tortoises of Cerro Azul and Southeast Sierra Negra. These tortoises have endured heavy exploitation during the last three centuries and recently attracted much concern due to the current number of stochastic and deterministic threats to extant populations. Our study complements previous investigation based on mtDNA diversity and provides further information that may help devising tortoise management plans.

AB The copper rockfish (Sebastes caurinus) is a benthic, nonmigratory, rocky reef species with pelagic larval and juvenile stages lasting several months. Adults are commonly distributed in temperate coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean from British Columbia to southern California, including the inland waterways of Puget Sound, Washington, a semi-enclosed fjord system of known postglacial origin. Here, we report the distribution of genetic variation at six microsatellite DNA loci from six locations throughout the species' range. Among four coastal samples, significant population subdivision was detected (F-ST = 0.007), and a significant correlation between genetic and geographic distance was observed. Divergence was large and significant between Puget Sound proper and coastal samples (F-ST = 0.087). A sample taken only 100 km north of Puget Sound (the Canadian Gulf Islands) was also highly divergent from Puget Sound and coastal samples and was genetically intermediate between the two. The Puget Sound sample also displayed significantly lower allelic diversity and a more substantial presence of private alleles. The patterns of genetic divergence and diversity are most consistent with a historical colonization followed by limited oceanographic exchange among geographically proximate locations.

AB Studies on the impact of logging on tropical forest butterflies have been almost exclusively conducted in moist forest habitats. This study considers the impacts of small-scale logging on butterfly communities at three sites of varying disturbance intensity in a tropical dry forest in western Thailand. Butterfly species richness was similar at all sites, but the abundance of butterflies and diversity of the butterfly community decreased with increased logging disturbance. The recorded decrease in diversity at the relatively large sampling scale used lends further support to the hypothesis that disturbance effects are scale dependent. Species abundance data for butterflies fitted a log-normal distribution at all sites, but also a log-series distribution at the two disturbed sites. These analyses suggest a more complex butterfly community at the undisturbed site, but also that log-series and log-normal distributions may not to be sufficiently sensitive to be useful indicators of community changes following logging. Community ordination separates both the butterfly species and transect samples into three distinct regions corresponding to the three study locations. Ordination axes are correlated with tree density, understorey cover and understorey plant richness. Species with the smallest geographic ranges tend to be the least abundant and occurred most frequently in the undisturbed site. The observed diverging responses to disturbance among butterfly families diminishes the value of butterfly communities as biodiversity indicators, and forest managers should perhaps focus on restricted range species or of groups of recognized sensitive species for this purpose.

AB It is likely that plant invasions result from complex interactions between species traits, community traits, and abiotic conditions. Despite this, there have been few experimental studies that directly examine these interactions. Two morphologically similar perennial grass species in the genus Cortaderia are currently invasive pest's in California, but their patterns of invasion differ. In this study I experimentally compared the performance of the two species across four vegetation types in central California. I examined how the different invasive patterns of the species result from differential responses to environmental factors that vary over relatively small spatial and temporal scales.
   Cortaderia selloana had consistently higher seed germination than C. jubata, but germination rates interacted significantly with soil disturbance and habitat type, and these interactions varied between experimental years. When mammalian herbivores were excluded, the principal cause of transplant mortality was physiological stress, and C. selloana transplants had greater survivorship than C. jubata transplants in all habitats except maritime chaparral. In the presence of mammalian herbivores, however, herbivory became the dominant source of transplant mortality, and the survivorship of both species was indistinguishable in all habitats. At the seasonal wetland site, patterns of transplant survivorship varied significantly between years, probably as a result of increased competition for water during the second experimental year. Transplants of the two species did not differ significantly in growth except at the seasonal wetland site where C. selloana transplants added significantly more leaf area than C. jubata transplants.
   These results indicate that the relative invasive potential of C. selloana and C. jubata is strongly moderated by the presence of generalist herbivores. The influence of herbivory is in turn dependent on the community type. In addition, plant competitors can modify the invasive success of the two species, but the effect of competitors varies with seasonal differences in resource supply. Although important mechanisms that influence the invasion process can be identified, the complex invasion dynamics exhibited by these morphologically similar species across relatively small spatial and temporal scales suggest that overly broad invasion rules will be of little practical utility in the regional management of invasive species.

AB 1. A study on glacial stream ecosystems was carried out in six regions across Europe, from Svalbard to the French Pyrenees. The main aim was to test the validity of the conceptual model of Milner & Petts (1994) with regard to the zonation of chironomids of glacier-fed rivers along altitudinal and latitudinal gradient.
   2. Channel stability varied considerably, both on the latitudinal and altitudinal scale, being lowest in the northern regions (Svalbard, Iceland and Norway) and the Swiss Alps. Water temperature at the upstream sites was always <2<degrees>C.
   3. There was a prominent difference in taxonomic richness between the Alpine and the northern European regions, with a higher number of taxa in the south. In all regions, the chironomid community was characterized by the genus Diamesa and the subfamily Orthocladiinae. Of a total of 63 taxa. recorded, two (Diamesa bertrami and Orthocladius frigidus) were common in all the regions except Svalbard.
   4. On the basis of cluster analysis, seven distinct groups of sites were evident amongst glacial-fed systems of the five regions (Pyrenees excluded). This classification separated the glacier-fed streams on geographical, latitudinal and downstream gradients.
   5. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) of environmental variables was carried out using 41 taxa at 105 sites. Slope, water depth, distance from source, water temperature and the Pfankuch channel stability index were found to be the major explanatory environmental variables. The analysis separated Diamesinae and typical upstream orthoclads from the other chironomids by low temperature and high channel instability.
   6. In all six regions, Diamesa was present closest to the glacier. Within 200 m of the glacier snout, other genera of Diamesinae were found together with Orthocladiinae. Pioneer taxa like Diamesa species coexisted with later colonizers like Eukiefferiella minor/fittkaui in relatively unstable channels.
   7. The longitudinal succession of chironomid assemblages across altitudinal and latitudinal gradients in glacial streams followed the same pattern, with similar genera and groups of species. The general aspects of the conceptual model of Milner & Petts (1994) were supported. However, Diamesa species have wider temperature limits than predicted and other Diamesinae as well as Orthocladiinae colonize metakryal habitats.

AB A number of studies have failed to find evidence for negative effects of ultraviolet-B radiation (UVBR) on amphibian early-embryonic performance, leading to the conclusions, first, that the embryonic stages of many species are tolerant to UVBR, and second, that the increased amount of UVBR reaching the Earth's surface is not likely to have any direct negative effects on many amphibian populations. However, possible carry-over effects of exposure to UVBR in the embryonic stages to the larval stages have received less attention. We Studied the effects of UVBR experienced during the embryonic stages (age less than 11 days) on the later performance cage 11-75 days) of common frog, Rana temporaria, larvae. In a factorial laboratory experiment, newly fertilized embryos were divided into three different UVBR treatments (no UVBR (control), 1.25 kJ m(-2) (normal) and 1.58 kJ m(-2) enhanced)), after which the individual larvae were raised until metamorphosis in the absence of U-VBR. No effects of UVBR on embryonic survival rates. frequency of developmental anomalies or hatchling size were found, corroborating the earlier results indicating that R. temporaria embryos are tolerant to UVBR. However, analyses of larval performance revealed that larvae exposed to enhanced levels of UVBR as embryos suffered from an increased Frequency of developmental anomalies and metamorphosed later and at a smaller size than larvae that had been protected from UVBR as embryos. These results suggest, in contrast to the earlier studies, that UVBR has direct negative effects on R. temporaria embryos. but these effects are expressed mostly or only during the later life stages. To this end., our results support the contention that carry-over effects from one life stage to another may be an important source of phenotypic variation in fitness.

AB Nested species subset patterns consist in a hierarchical structure of species composition in related assemblages, with the species found in depauperate assemblages representing non-random subsets of progressively richer ones. This pattern has been found at the infracommunity level in about a third of the fish ectoparasite assemblages studied to date. Here we present evidence for another non-random structural pattern in assemblages of fish ectoparasites, anti-nestedness, which corresponds to situations in which parasite species are always absent from infracommunities richer than the most depauperate one in which they occur. We show that this pattern is exactly as common as nestedness, and that anti-nested assemblages are characterised by significantly lower prevalence and mean intensities of parasites than nested assemblages. in addition, we found a positive relationship between the prevalence and the mean intensity of parasites across the different assemblages. We propose a link between the nestedness/anti-nestedness continuum and the prevalence-intensity relationship that may involve colonisation-extinction processes. The results presented here suggest that, although nestedness may not be common in parasite communities, other departures from random species assembly are possible, and that some form of structure may be present in many communities. The continuum between nestedness and anti-nestedness also has implications for recent models of species coexistence in communities. (C) 2000 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

AB The collapse of various stock complexes of cod (Gadus morhua) in the northwest Atlantic has prompted a clarification of relationships among stock components. Here we examine the genetic composition of >2300 cod collected during 1994-1997 in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and its approaches to determine whether: (1) stock components can be genetically identified; (2) population structure is temporally stable; (3) components are always separated and, if not, where and when are they mixed; and (4) component contributions to mixtures can be estimated. We use polymorphism at six microsatellite DNA loci from cod collected on or near their spring and summer spawning grounds to examine structure and then employ maximum likelihood analyses to estimate contributions of each component to mixtures overwintering near the entrance to the Gulf. Estimates of genetic structure (F-ST and R-ST) reveal significant differences among cod populations during stock-separated periods, and the structure appears to be temporally stable. Multidimensional scaling analysis of estimates of genetic distance (D-A) suggest that the structure results from differences among cod collected within the Gulf of St. Lawrence and those collected near the entrance to the Gulf on either side of the Laurentian Channel in the Cabot Strait, as well as among cod collected south of Newfoundland along the north side of the Channel. Weak genetic heterogeneity among seven regional mixed-stock collections during the overwintering period suggests that cod aggregations characteristically found in the overwintering region represent population mixtures that differ in the proportion of cod contributed to them by the various stock components, Maximum likelihood estimates indicate no significant temporal changes in component contributions to the mixed-stock samples between 1996 and 1997 when all of the winter mixed-stock samples were pooled. The combined contribution of cod from the southern and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence to the mixed-stock samples ranged between 46% and 71% (expected 64%), More precise estimates of contributions from these two regions are precluded by the weak genetic differentiation detected in our samples. The contribution by cod from the Cape Breton Island region was small and estimated at 3%. Contributions by cod from the eastern Scotian Shelf, southwest Newfoundland and south-central Newfoundland were in the range of 13-14%, 4%, and 8%, respectively. Contributions by inshore cod from Placentia and Fortune Bays in south Newfoundland were small to negligible (similar to 3% each). The results indicate that future management could be designed around the spatial and temporal scale of the stock structure identified during the stock-separated period and around the spatially varying contributions to the overwintering mixed-stock fishery.

AB Late planting reduces soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] yields in soybean-winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) double-cropping systems. We evaluated the hypothesis that the use of early-maturing soybean cultivars to shift reproductive growth into a more favorable environment would avoid some or all of this yield penalty. Soybean cultivars Hardin and Kasota [maturity group (MG) I], Burlison and Elgin 87 (MG II), Pioneer 9392 and Probst (MG III), and Stressland and Penny-rile (MG IV) planted in 38-cm rows were used in a 3-yr irrigated experiment with two planting dates (early, mid-May; late, late June) at Lexington, KY (38 degrees N lat). Delayed planting reduced yield (7-36%) of all cultivars as a result of fewer seeds m(-2). Cultivars from MG I and II did not produce higher yields in the late plantings. A combination of narrow rows (19 cm) and high seeding rates (105 seeds m(-2)) had no effect on yield of cultivars from MGs I and II in either planting date. However, early maturity did provide an earlier harvest date without significant yield loss. Seed number was significantly related to crop growth rate (CGR) during flowering and pod set (r(2) = 0.36) and to length of flowering and pod set (r(2) = 0.56). Radiation use efficiency (g dry matter MJ(-1) intercepted photosynthetically active radiation) was generally reduced in the late plantings for MG III and TV cultivars but not for MG I and II. Early-maturing cultivars in an irrigated environment did not reduce the yield penalty associated with late plantings.

AB Prior to European settlement, the 450 000-ha Pine Barrens region in northwestern Wisconsin, USA, was characterized by a landscape mosaic of large, open patches, savannas, and closed forest stands of jack pine (Pinus banksiana). Crown-fires created large open patches that persisted on the droughty soils, providing important habitat for a number of area-sensitive, open-habitat species. Insect outbreaks may have contributed to periodic fires by increasing the fuel load.
   Today, fires are suppressed in the managed landscape, but insect defoliation remains a major disturbance. Salvage logging commonly follows insect outbreaks. Our objective was to evaluate landscape pattern changes caused by this interaction of natural disturbances and forest management. We examined changes in landscape pattern during the most recent (1990-1995) outbreak of jack pine budworm (Choristoneura pinus pinus) in northwestern Wisconsin using four Landsat TM satellite images (1987, 1991, 1993, and 1995). The 1987 image provided the basis for a species-level forest classification identifying mature jack pine and open habitat prior to the budworm outbreak. Each subsequent image was used to identify clearcuts in mature jack pine. The 1995 image was also used to classify stand development in the open habitat of the 1987 image so that the overall availability of open habitat in 1995 could be assessed. GIS data layers were used to analyze logging rates and clearcut sizes separately for different classes of land ownership and soils.
   Approximately 12 500 ha were salvage logged during the 1990-1995 outbreak. Logging rates were highest on the most infertile soils, and on private, industrial forest land. Annual logging rates of different landowners were 3-6 times higher during the outbreak than previous to it. Salvage cut sizes were larger than clearcuts prior to the outbreak. New cuts were mostly located next to previous cuts, thus increasing the size of openings on the landscape.
   Initial survey results by N. Niemuth show that populations of one area-sensitive open-habitat species (Sharp-tailed Grouse, Tympanuchus phasianellus) thrive on the salvage cuts. Insect defoliation and subsequent salvage logging did create new habitat for open-habitat species that were declining.
   Landscape pattern changes due to multiple interacting disturbances have rarely been studied. The interaction of jack pine budworm defoliation and salvage logging substantially changed landscape pattern in the Pine Barrens. We speculate that interaction between insect defoliation and fire may have significantly shaped the presettlement landscape.

ID COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; MACROFAUNA; ECOSYSTEM; BIOMASS; DENSITY; TRENDS
AB The assemblages of attached and freeliving epibenthic species in the North Sea are described, based on analysis of samples collected with a small beam trawl. Clustering of survey sites based on the presence or absence of attached species indicated chat three regions had characteristic assemblages: the northern North Sea, the central North Sea from 55 to 57 degrees N and the southern North Sea. Clustering of sites based on counts of free-living epibenthic species also revealed that the sites formed three major groups but these corresponded to regions in the north-east North Sea, the northern and western central North Sea and the southern and eastern central North Sea. Species which contributed most to the similarity within and dissimilarity between groups were identified. The environmental factors which best accounted for the grouping of sites were depth, winter temperature and the temperature difference between winter and summer for attached species and depth and the temperature difference between winter and summer for free-living species. The species richness of attached and free-living epibenthic species was higher in the central and northern North Sea than in the south. The number of abundant (Hill's N-1) and very abundant (Hill's N-2) free-living species also increased from south to north.

AB This paper aims at proposing efficient vegetation sampling strategies. It describes how the estimation of species richness and diversity of moist evergreen forest is affected by (1) sampling design (simple random sampling, random cluster sampling, systematic cluster sampling, stratified cluster sampling); (2) choice of species richness estimators (number of observed species vs, non-parametric estimators) and (3) choice of diversity index (Simpson vs. Shannon). Two sites are studied: a 28-ha area situated in the Western Ghats of India and a 25-ha area located at Pasoh in Peninsular Malaysia. The results show that: (1) whatever the sampling strategy, estimates of species richness depend on sample size in these very diverse forest ecosystems which contain many rare species; (2) Simpson's diversity index reaches a stable value at low sample sizes while Shannon's index is affected more by the addition of rare species with increasing sample size; (3) cluster sampling strategies provide a good compromise between cost and statistical efficiency; (4) 300-400 sample trees grouped in small clusters (10-50 individuals) are enough to obtain unbiased and precise estimates of Simpson's index; (5) the local topography of the Western Ghats has a major influence on forest composition, the steep slopes being richer and more diverse than the ridges and gentle slopes; (6) stratified duster sampling is thus an interesting alternative to systematic cluster sampling.

AB The diversity of trees (species richness, abundance and Shannon diversity) in a tropical rain forest of Malaysia has been studied from the point of view of its spatial organization in order to formulate hypotheses about the origin of the observed spatial patterns. The question that motivated this study is whether tropical forests communities are in a state of equilibrium or nonequilibrium. Three aspects have been examined: (1) changes in diversity were studied with respect to sampling area and sampling designs. A minimum area of 5-10 ha is recommended by the species-area curves, while 2-5 ha seem appropriate based on the Shannon diversity-area curves. Different sampling designs significantly affect the species-area curves. The power function, which can be derived under the equilibrium assumption, is not appropriate to fit the observed diversity-area curves. (2) The spatial features of diversity variables were then studied. Variograms showed that there are dominant short-range effects (around 150 m), obvious anisotropic distribution, and high random variation in the diversity data. (3) Partitioning the variation of the diversity measures into environmental (topographic) and spatial components indicated that the spatial organisation of that community was mostly unpredictable. There may be many processes controlling the formation of the spatial patterns in the tropical rain forest. Unidentified causes, affecting mainly the small-scale processes (< 20 m), seem responsible for the large amount of undetermined variation in the diversity data sets. The study suggests that the Pasoh forest of Malaysia may not be in a state of equilibrium.

AB Six old-growth, late postfire Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) dominated forest stands of the Vaccinium-Cladina type were selected along a latitudinal gradient in northern Sweden. In two of the stands, Scots pine seedlings that had naturally regenerated during the last 40 years were surveyed in relation to field- and bottom-layer vegetation. The most abundant forest floor species, viz. Cladina spp., occupied 41% of the ground cover and dominated the microhabitat of Scots pine seedlings less than or equal to 10 years old. The second most common species, Pleurozium schreberi (Bird.) Mitt., which occupied 10 and 20% of the ground cover at the two sites, was, in contrast, only found to cover less than 3% of the microhabitat of the seedlings less than or equal to 10 years old. With increasing age of seedlings (>10 years), however, the cover of Cladina spp. significantly decreased and the cover of P. schreberi and various ericaceous species slightly increased. Thus Scots pine seedlings initially establish in lichen-dominated vegetation but as they develop P. schreberi and ericaceous species gradually become more abundant in the ground vegetation. The relationships between natural establishment patterns and microhabitat were further empirically tested by sowing seeds of Scots pine in patches of Cladina spp. and patches of P. schreberi. Seeding was performed in six sites during 3 consecutive years. A significant higher number of established Scots pine seedlings were found in Cladina spp. vegetation than in P. schreberi dominated vegetation, and Scots pine seedlings in P. schreberi experienced a significantly higher mortality. Laboratory studies indicated a negative chemical influence by P. schreberi on Scots pine seed germination but not on radicle growth of pregerminated seeds. The negative influence of P. schreberi on Scots pine seed germination and seedling survival in the field experiments is interpreted as an effect of moisture factors, chemical interference, and barriers of nutrient availability. Age structures of naturally established Scots pine showed evidence of continuous regeneration over the last 40 years. The study emphasizes the importance of biotically mediated regeneration patterns in explaining spatial stand structure and temporal dynamics in northern boreal Scots pine forest ecosystems during prolonged absence of fire. Tree regeneration tends not to be associated with mesoscale characteristics such as gaps and tip-up mounds, but rather with microhabitat conditions. The results have implications for predicting the effect of climatic warming.

AB An outdoor flow-through experimental set-up, was used to study the effect of increased concentrations of inorganic nitrogen (IN) and phosphorus (IP) on the microalgae of a sandy sediment. The compositional changes following nutrient addition were investigated in terms of the dominance of major taxonomic groups as well as the species composition of diatoms. Fresh samples were used to assess the viable biomass of major taxonomic and size groups, and cleaned diatom frustules were used for identification to species level. Nutrient addition to the water column stimulated the growth of filamentous cyanobacteria, diatoms and flagellates. Although statistically significant compositional changes with respect to both time and treatment were observed, the microflora was not subjected to any substantial shift in the dominance of major taxonomic groups. Instead, the major change occurred at the macroscopic level as a rapid growth of a filamentous green algal species. Diatoms which accounted for ca 50% of the microalgal biomass, were not outcompeted by any other algal group, probably because the Si-pool of the sediment counteracted secondary Si-limitation and because temperature was too low to allow cyanobacteria to fully dominate the biomass. Counts of both living cells and cleaned frustules showed that the diatom flora was dominated by cells in the size group 7 - 12-mu-m, however, depending on the counting method and the level of resolution, different compositional changes were noted. Biomass values of size groups of living diatom cells showed that N + P addition favoured larger cells. Frustule counts, which enable identification at the species level, revealed also that some small-sized species were enhanced by the nutrient addition. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) based on frustule counts, showed that the succession in both non-enriched and enriched containers was in the same direction, though faster and proceeding further with N + P addition. The CCA revealed that the P + N addition also favoured some small-sized taxa, such as Nitzchia and Amphora species within the size range 7 - 12-mu-m. Oxygen bubbles produced by the stimulated photosynthetic activity at the sediment surface appeared to selectively resuspend large motile diatom species, e.g. Cylindrotheca.

AB The large 1950s fires that burned > 5500 km2 of land across a south-to-north climatic gradient in northern Quebec provide an opportunity to evaluate the role of fire in forest-tundra development on a demographic basis.  The tree population density before and almost-equal-to 30 yr after fire was estimated by censusing trees in plots of 400 m2 located in upland and lowland within four representative ecoregions of northern Quebec.  The analysis of tree recruitment before and after fire, in 410 randomly selected sites along a transect crossing the upper boreal forest and forest-tundra zones, indicated that wildfires induced substantial depletion of tree populations.  Taken as a whole, fires have significantly reduced the density of black spruce populations in forest-tundra uplands, but not in the lowlands.  A reduction in tree population density of greater-than-or-equal-to 75% was observed in 22% of upper boreal forest sites, and 45% and 93% of sites located in the forest and shrub subzones, respectively, of the forest-tundra zone.  Complete exclusion of tree populations by fire was observed in 43% of upland sites in the northern part of the transect, while complete removal was a rare event in the southern part.  Sustained reduction of tree population density after several destructive fires appears as one of the main deforestation processes in the subarctic zone.  This leads to the patchy distribution of forest stands and scattered tree populations typical of the forest-tundra biome.  Comparisons with paleoecological data suggest that the impact of the 1950s fires contributed to the expansion of the forest tundra into the upper boreal forest.  The ecological impact of these fires was probably similar to those fires responsible for development of the forest tundra during the Holocene.  It is suggested that the fire-climate interaction should be considered in order to predict the ecological impact of warming climate on high-latitude forest ecosystems.

AB A more detailed understanding of the micro-climatic thermal benefits of different urban tree species and the retrospective species characteristics is necessary to guide management decisions. In this review, we focused specifically on empirical data collected at ground level for below-canopy surface temperature (ST) and transpiration cooling (AT), using a meta-analysis method. Tree canopy density was clearly identified as the most influential driver of different mechanisms of cooling benefits. Secondly, climate of the cities where the trees were grown showed significant impacts on cooling potentials: trees grown in Oceanic and Continental climates showed a higher cooling potential compared to trees grown in Mediterranean climate for AT and sub-tropical climate for ST. Thirdly, tree growth in size and ground surface cover showed significant impact. ST decreases almost linearly with the increase of canopy density; however, the rate is significantly lower over transpiring grass surfaces. Transpiration of trees planted over grass was ten times higher (4.15 g m(-2) min(-1)) compared to a tree planted in paved cut-out pits (0.44 g m(-2) min(-1)). Moreover, diffuse porous wood anatomy and trees originating from temperate and resource-rich forests showed better cooling potentials. Among the leaf traits, dark green leaves, < 0.15 mm of thickness showed higher AT and ST benefit. The review pointed out the lack of standardized study protocols in determining tree cooling benefits and empirical data, particularly at tropical and sub-tropical climate. Finally, the study suggested some recommendations for plantings that optimize the cooling benefits from urban greenspaces.

AB Community assembly of crop-associated fungi is thought to be strongly influenced by deterministic selection exerted by the plant host, rather than stochastic processes. Here we use a simple, sorghum system with abundant sampling to show that stochastic forces (drift or stochastic dispersal) act on fungal community assembly in leaves and roots early in host development and when sorghum is drought stressed, conditions when mycobiomes are small. Unexpectedly, we find no signal for stochasticity when drought stress is relieved, likely due to renewed selection by the host. In our experimental system, the host compartment exerts the strongest effects on mycobiome assembly, followed by the timing of plant development and lastly by plant genotype. Using a dissimilarity-overlap approach, we find a universality in the forces of community assembly of the mycobiomes of the different sorghum compartments and in functional guilds of fungi.

AB There is a clear need for transformative change in the land management and food production sectors to address the global land challenges of climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, combatting land degradation and desertification, and delivering food security (referred to hereafter as "land challenges"). We assess the potential for 40 practices to address these land challenges and find that: Nine options deliver medium to large benefits for all four land challenges. A further two options have no global estimates for adaptation, but have medium to large benefits for all other land challenges. Five options have large mitigation potential (>3 Gt CO(2)eq/year) without adverse impacts on the other land challenges. Five options have moderate mitigation potential, with no adverse impacts on the other land challenges. Sixteen practices have large adaptation potential (>25 million people benefit), without adverse side effects on other land challenges. Most practices can be applied without competing for available land. However, seven options could result in competition for land. A large number of practices do not require dedicated land, including several land management options, all value chain options, and all risk management options. Four options could greatly increase competition for land if applied at a large scale, though the impact is scale and context specific, highlighting the need for safeguards to ensure that expansion of land for mitigation does not impact natural systems and food security. A number of practices, such as increased food productivity, dietary change and reduced food loss and waste, can reduce demand for land conversion, thereby potentially freeing-up land and creating opportunities for enhanced implementation of other practices, making them important components of portfolios of practices to address the combined land challenges.

AB The size and frequency of large wildfires in western North America have increased in recent years, a trend climate change is likely to exacerbate. Due to fuel limitations, recently burned forests resist burning for upwards of 30 years; however, extreme fire-conducive weather enables reburning at shorter fire-free intervals than expected. This research quantifies the outcomes of short-interval reburns in upland and wetland environments of northwestern Canadian boreal forests and identifies an interactive effect of post-fire drought. Despite adaptations to wildfire amongst boreal plants, post-fire forests at paired short- and long-interval sites were significantly different, with short-interval sites having lower stem densities of trees due to reduced conifer recruitment, a higher proportion of broadleaf trees, less residual organic material, and reduced herbaceous vegetation cover. Drought reinforced changes in proportions of tree species and decreases in tree recruitment, reinforcing non-resilient responses to short-interval reburning. Drier and warmer weather will increase the incidence of short-interval reburning and amplify the ecological changes such events cause, as wildfire activity and post-fire drought increase synergistically. These interacting disturbances will accelerate climate-driven changes in boreal forest structure and composition. Our findings identify processes of ongoing and future change in a climate-sensitive biome.

AB Exposure of plants and animals to ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B; 280-315 nm) is modified by stratospheric ozone dynamics and climate change. Even though stabilisation and projected recovery of stratospheric ozone is expected to curtail future increases in UV-B radiation at the Earth's surface, on-going changes in climate are increasingly exposing plants and animals to novel combinations of UV-B radiation and other climate change factors (e.g., ultraviolet-A and visible radiation, water availability, temperature and elevated carbon dioxide). Climate change is also shifting vegetation cover, geographic ranges of species, and seasonal timing of development, which further modifies exposure to UV-B radiation. Since our last assessment, there has been increased understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which plants perceive UV-B radiation, eliciting changes in growth, development and tolerances of abiotic and biotic factors. However, major questions remain on how UV-B radiation is interacting with other climate change factors to modify the production and quality of crops, as well as important ecosystem processes such as plant and animal competition, pest-pathogen interactions, and the decomposition of dead plant matter (litter). In addition, stratospheric ozone depletion is directly contributing to climate change in the southern hemisphere, such that terrestrial ecosystems in this region are being exposed to altered patterns of precipitation, temperature and fire regimes as well as UV-B radiation. These ozone-driven changes in climate have been implicated in both increases and reductions in the growth, survival and reproduction of plants and animals in Antarctica, South America and New Zealand. In this assessment, we summarise advances in our knowledge of these and other linkages and effects, and identify uncertainties and knowledge gaps that limit our ability to fully evaluate the ecological consequences of these environmental changes on terrestrial ecosystems.

AB The advent of high throughput sequencing and genotyping technologies enables the comparison of patterns of polymorphisms at a very large number of markers. While the characterization of genetic structure from individual sequencing data remains expensive for many nonmodel species, it has been shown that sequencing pools of individual DNAs (Pool-seq) represents an attractive and cost-effective alternative. However, analyzing sequence read counts from a DNA pool instead of individual genotypes raises statistical challenges in deriving correct estimates of genetic differentiation. In this article, we provide a method-of-moments estimator of F-ST for Pool-seq data, based on an analysis-of-variance framework. We show, by means of simulations, that this new estimator is unbiased and outperforms previously proposed estimators. We evaluate the robustness of our estimator to model misspecification, such as sequencing errors and uneven contributions of individual DNAs to the pools. Finally, by reanalyzing published Pool-seq data of different ecotypes of the prickly sculpin Cottus asper, we show how the use of an unbiased F-ST estimator may question the interpretation of population structure inferred from previous analyses.

AB Carbohydrates play a central role in plant functioning because they are building blocks and energy carriers for plant metabolic processes. Because plants are sessile organisms and cannot escape stressful environments they acclimate to unfavourable conditions by strategically allocating carbohydrate resources to overcome stress and promote survival, and build reserves for later use when demand is greater than supply from photosynthesis, like after defoliation. A mechanistic understanding of how plants and, in particular, long-lived organisms like trees allocate and remobilize stored carbohydrates is still very poor. Without such an understanding, however, integration of carbon dynamics from trees to ecosystems and to the globe becomes highly uncertain, especially under ongoing climate change.
   Studies of carbohydrate dynamics in trees are often carried out on tree seedlings due to logistical and technical constraints and criticism has been raised whether results can be extrapolated to mature trees. Here we combine a literature review with a critical evaluation of using seedling studies on carbohydrate dynamics to infer mature tree responses that can subsequently be integrated at ecosystem level and beyond. Despite obvious differences between seedlings and mature trees with respect to carbohydrate dynamics, we propose that a combination of approaches, including seedling studies in controlled environments, measurements on mature trees in the field and ecosystem flux measurements, may provide sound estimates of carbohydrate dynamics at larger scales. We show how sensitive predictions of vegetation responses to disturbance are to changes in available reserves and argue that the implementation of more realistic representations of storage dynamics will likely improve simulations of vegetation responses to environmental stress.

AB To better characterize the transport of neonicotinoid insecticides to the world's largest freshwater ecosystem, monthly samples (October 2015 September 2016) were collected from 10 major tributaries to the Great Lakes, USA. For the monthly tributary samples, neonicotinoids were detected in every month sampled and five of the six target neonicotinoids were detected. At least one neonicotinoid was detected in 74% of the monthly samples with up to three neonicotinoids detected in an individual sample (10% of all samples). The most frequently detected neonicotinoid was imidacloprid (53%), followed by clothianidin (44%), thiamethoxam (22%), acetamiprid (2%), and dinotefuran (1%). Thiacloprid was not detected in any samples. The maximum concentration for an individual neonicotinoid was 230 ng L-1 and the maximum total neonicotinoids in an individual sample was 400 ng L-1. The median detected individual neonicotinoid concentrations ranged from non-detect to 10 ng L-1. The detections of clothianidin and thiamethoxam significantly increased as the percent of cultivated crops in the basins increased (p = 0.73, P = .01; p = 0.66, P = .04, respectively). In contrast, imidacloprid detections significantly increased as the percent of the urbanization in the basins increased (p = 0.66, P = .03). Neonicotinoid concentrations generally increased in spring through summer coinciding with the planting of neonicotinoid-treated seeds and broadcast applications of neonicotinoids. More spatially intensive samples were collected in an agriculturally dominated basin (8 sites along the Maumee River, Ohio) twice during the spring, 2016 planting season to provide further information on neonicotinoid inputs to the Great Lakes. Three neonicotinoids were ubiquitously detected (clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam) in all water samples collected within this basin. Maximum individual neonicotinoid concentrations was 330 ng L-1 and maximum total neonicotinoid concentration was 670 ng L-1; median detected individual neonicotinoid concentrations were 7.0 to 39 ng L-1.

AB Assessing the relative importance of the various pathways to diversification is a central goal of biodiversity researchers. For plant biologists, and increasingly across the spectrum of biological sciences, among these pathways of interest is hybridization. New methodological developments are moving the field away from questions of whether natural hybridization occurs or hybrids can persist and toward more direct assessments of the long-term impact of hybridization on diversification and genome organization. Advances in theory and new data, especially phylogenomic data, have changed the face of this field, revealing extensive occurrences of hybridization at both shallow and deep levels, but lacking is a synthesis of these advancements. Here we provide an overview of methods that have been proposed for detecting hybridization with molecular data and advocate a time-extended, comparative view of reticulate evolution. In particular, we pose three overarching questions, newly placed within reach, that are critical for advancing our understanding of hybridization pattern and process: (1) How often is introgression biased toward certain genomes and loci, and is this bias selectively neutral? (2) What are the relative rates of formation of hybrid species and introgressants, and how does this compare to their subsequent fates? (3) Has the frequency of hybridization increased under historical periods of greater dynamism in climate and geographic range, such as the Pleistocene?

AB 1. Understanding the mechanisms that drive beta diversity (i.e. beta-diversity), an important aspect of regional biodiversity, remains a priority for ecological research. beta-diversity and its components can provide insights into the processes generating regional biodiversity patterns. We tested whether environmental filtering or dispersal related processes predominated along the stream watercourse by analysing the responses of taxonomic and functional diatom beta-diversity to environmental and spatial factors.
   2. We examined the variation in total beta-diversity and its components (turnover and nestedness) in benthic diatom species and ecological guilds (motile, planktonic, low-and high profile) with respect to watercourse position (up-, mid-and downstream) in 2,182 sites throughout France. We tested the effects of pure environmental and pure spatial factors on beta-diversity with partial Mantel tests. Environmental factors included eight physicochemical variables, while geographical distances between sites were used as spatial factors. We also correlated a and c-diversity, and the degree of nestedness (NODF metric) with environmental variables.
   3. Total beta-diversity and its turnover component displayed higher values upstream than mid-and downstream. The nestedness component exhibited low values, even when NODF values increased from up-to downstream. Pure environmental factors were highly significant for explaining total beta-diversity and turnover regardless of watercourse position, but pure spatial factors were mostly significant mid-and downstream, with geographical distance being positively correlated with beta-diversity. Across sites, nutrient enrichment decreased turnover but increased the degree of nestedness. Motile and low profile diatoms comprised the most abundant guilds, but their beta-diversity patterns varied in an opposite way. The lowest guild beta-diversity was observed upstream for low profile species, and downstream for motile species.
   4. In conclusion, environmental filtering seemed to play a major role in structuring metacommunities irrespective of site watercourse position. Filtering promoted strong turnover patterns, especially in disconnected upstream sites. The greater role of spatial factors mid-and downstream was consistent with mass effects rather than neutral processes because these sites had lower total beta-diversity than upstream sites. Motile species were most strongly affected by mass effects processes, whereas low profile species were primarily influenced by environmental conditions. Collectively, these findings suggest that partitioning of total beta-diversity into its components and the use of diatom ecological guilds provide a useful framework for assessing the mechanisms underlying metacommunity patterns along the stream watercourse.

AB Ambiguous empirical support for landscapes of fear' in natural systems may stem from failure to consider dynamic temporal changes in predation risk. The lunar cycle dramatically alters night-time visibility, with low luminosity increasing hunting success of African lions. We used camera-trap data from Serengeti National Park to examine nocturnal anti-predator behaviours of four herbivore species. Interactions between predictable fluctuations in night-time luminosity and the underlying risk-resource landscape shaped herbivore distribution, herding propensity and the incidence of relaxed' behaviours. Buffalo responded least to temporal risk cues and minimised risk primarily through spatial redistribution. Gazelle and zebra made decisions based on current light levels and lunar phase, and wildebeest responded to lunar phase alone. These three species avoided areas where likelihood of encountering lions was high and changed their behaviours in risky areas to minimise predation threat. These patterns support the hypothesis that fear landscapes vary heterogeneously in both space and time.

AB With the increasing availability of both molecular and topo-climatic data, the main challenges facing landscape genomics - that is the combination of landscape ecology with population genomics - include processing large numbers of models and distinguishing between selection and demographic processes (e.g. population structure). Several methods address the latter, either by estimating a null model of population history or by simultaneously inferring environmental and demographic effects. Here we present SAMbADA, an approach designed to study signatures of local adaptation, with special emphasis on high performance computing of large-scale genetic and environmental data sets. SAMbADA identifies candidate loci using genotype-environment associations while also incorporating multivariate analyses to assess the effect of many environmental predictor variables. This enables the inclusion of explanatory variables representing population structure into the models to lower the occurrences of spurious genotype-environment associations. In addition, SAMbADA calculates local indicators of spatial association for candidate loci to provide information on whether similar genotypes tend to cluster in space, which constitutes a useful indication of the possible kinship between individuals. To test the usefulness of this approach, we carried out a simulation study and analysed a data set from Ugandan cattle to detect signatures of local adaptation with SAMbADA, BAYENV, LFMM and an FST outlier method (FDIST approach in ARLEQUIN) and compare their results. SAMbADA - an open source software for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X available at http://lasig.epfl.ch/sambada - outperforms other approaches and better suits whole-genome sequence data processing.

AB One of the most important functions of catchments is the storage of water. Catchment storage buffers meteorological extremes and interannual streamflow variability, controls the partitioning between evaporation and runoff, and influences transit times of water. Hydrogeological data to estimate storage are usually scarce and seldom available for a larger set of catchments. This study focused on storage in prealpine and alpine catchments, using a set of 21 Swiss catchments comprising different elevation ranges. Catchment storage comparisons depend on storage definitions. This study defines different types of storage including definitions of dynamic and mobile catchment storage. We then estimated dynamic storage using four methods, water balance analysis, streamflow recession analysis, calibration of a bucket-type hydrological model Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning model (HBV), and calibration of a transfer function hydrograph separation model using stable isotope observations. The HBV model allowed quantifying the contributions of snow, soil and groundwater storages compared to the dynamic catchment storage. With the transfer function hydrograph separation model both dynamic and mobile storage was estimated. Dynamic storage of one catchment estimated by the four methods differed up to one order of magnitude. Nevertheless, the storage estimates ranked similarly among the 21 catchments. The largest dynamic and mobile storage estimates were found in high-elevation catchments. Besides snow, groundwater contributed considerably to this larger storage. Generally, we found that with increasing elevation the relative contribution to the dynamic catchment storage increased for snow, decreased for soil, but remained similar for groundwater storage.

AB Root endophytic fungi are found in a great variety of plants and ecosystems, but the ecological drivers of their biogeographic distribution are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the occurrence of root endophytes in the non-mycorrhizal plant genus Microthlaspi, and the effect of environmental factors and geographic distance in structuring their communities at a continental scale. We sampled 52 plant populations across the northern Mediterranean and central Europe and used a cultivation approach to study their endophytic communities. Cultivation of roots yielded 2601 isolates, which were grouped into 296 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by internal transcribed spacer sequencing of 1998 representative colonies. Climatic and spatial factors were the best descriptors of the structure of endophytic communities, outweighing soil characteristics, host genotype and geographical distance. OTU richness was negatively affected by precipitation, and the composition of communities followed latitudinal gradients of precipitation and temperature. Only six widespread OTUs belonging to the orders Pleosporales, Hypocreales and Helotiales represented about 50% of all isolates. Assessments of their individual distribution revealed particular ecological preferences or a cosmopolitan occurrence. Our findings support a strong influence of the local environment in determining root endophytic communities, and show a different niche occupancy by individual endophytes.

AB We analyzed the effects of sewage discharge on a subtropical estuary by comparing the functional diversity of intertidal macroinvertebrate assemblages in contaminated with non-contaminated reference areas. Functional structure was assessed using biological traits analysis (BTA) and four multivariate indices (FRic, FEve, FDis and Rao's Q) of functional diversity. Our results showed clear and temporally consistent changes in macrobenthic functional structure in contaminated areas. However, these results depended on whether abundance- or biomass-based measurements were used, with abundance-based analyses distinguishing most clearly between sewage contamination conditions. Differences between contaminated and non-contaminated conditions were also displayed by BTA for all the functional trait categories. FDis (functional divergence) and Rao's Q (functional dispersion) were higher in the non contaminated condition and increased with higher benthic environmental health, as measured by the AMBI index. These patterns of higher functional divergence and dispersion were driven by the numerical dominance of opportunistic annelids in the contaminated condition. We suggest that abundance-based BTA, and the FDis and/or Rao's Q indices are reliable approaches to detect changes in functional structure with respect to sewage pollution. They have a great potential for environmental assessment and monitoring of subtropical estuarine ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Behavioural responses to reduce predation risk might cause demographic costs of fear'. Costs differ among species, but a conceptual framework to understand this variation is lacking. We use a life-history framework to tie together diverse traits and life stages to better understand interspecific variation in responses and costs. We used natural and experimental variation in predation risk to test phenotypic responses and associated demographic costs for 10 songbird species. Responses such as increased parental attentiveness yielded reduced development time and created benefits such as reduced predation probability. Yet, responses to increased risk also created demographic costs by reducing offspring production in the absence of direct predation. This cost of fear varied widely across species, but predictably with the probability of repeat breeding. Use of a life-history framework can aid our understanding of potential demographic costs from predation, both from responses to perceived risk and from direct predation mortality.

AB The ecology and predator-prey dynamics of large felids in the tropics have largely been studied in natural systems where wild ungulates constitute the majority of the prey base. However, human-dominated landscapes can be rich in potential prey for large carnivores because of the high density of domestic animals, especially in tropical countries where pastoralism is an important livelihood activity. We report the almost complete dependence of leopards Panthera pardus on domestic animals as prey in the crop lands of Ahmednagar district, Maharashtra, India. From analysis of 85 confirmed leopard scats, 87% of the leopard's prey biomass consisted of domestic animals, with 39% consisting of domestic dogs Canis lupus familiaris alone. The only wild species that occurred in the leopard's diet were rodents, small indian civet Viverricula indica, bonnet macaque Macaca radiata and other primates Semnopithecus spp., mongoose Herpestes spp., and birds. Interviews conducted in 77 households distributed randomly in the study area documented a high density of domestic animals: adult cattle Bos taurus, calves, goats Capra aegagrus, dogs and cats Felis catus occurred at densities of 169, 54, 174, 24 and 61 per km(2), respectively. Ivlev's electivity index indicated that dogs and cats were over-represented in the leopard's diet, given the higher densities of goats and cattle. The standing biomass of dogs and cats alone was sufficient to sustain the high density of carnivores at the study site. Our results show that the abundance of potential domestic prey biomass present in human-use areas supports a relatively high density of predators, although this interaction could result in conflict with humans.

AB By mapping translated metagenomic reads to a microbial metabolic network, we show that ruminal ecosystems that are rather dissimilar in their taxonomy can be considerably more similar at the metabolic network level. Using a new network bi-partition approach for linking the microbial network to a bovine metabolic network, we observe that these ruminal metabolic networks exhibit properties consistent with distinct metabolic communities producing similar outputs from common inputs. For instance, the closer in network space that a microbial reaction is to a reaction found in the host, the lower will be the variability of its enzyme copy number across hosts. Similarly, these microbial enzymes that are nearby to host nodes are also higher in copy number than are more distant enzymes. Collectively, these results demonstrate a widely expected pattern that, to our knowledge, has not been explicitly demonstrated in microbial communities: namely that there can exist different community metabolic networks that have the same metabolic inputs and outputs but differ in their internal structure.

AB The degree to which changes in lifespan are coupled to changes in senescence in different physiological systems and phenotypic traits is a central question in biogerontology. It is underpinned by deeper biological questions about whether or not senescence is a synchronised process, or whether levels of synchrony depend on species or environmental context. Understanding how natural selection shapes patterns of synchrony in senescence across physiological systems and phenotypic traits demands the longitudinal study of many phenotypes under natural conditions. Here, we examine the patterns of age-related variation in late adulthood in a wild population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries) that have been the subject of individual-based monitoring for thirty years. We examined twenty different phenotypic traits in both males and females, encompassing vital rates (survival and fecundity), maternal reproductive performance (offspring birth weight, birth date and survival), male rutting behaviour, home range measures, parasite burdens, and body mass. We initially quantified age-related variation in each trait having controlled for annual variation in the environment, among-individual variation and selective disappearance effects. We then standardised our age-specific trait means and tested whether age trajectories could be meaningfully grouped according to sex or the type of trait. Whilst most traits showed age-related declines in later life, we found striking levels of asynchrony both within and between the sexes. Of particular note, female fecundity and reproductive performance declined with age, but male annual reproductive success did not. We also discovered that whilst home range size and quality decline with age in females, home range size increases with age in males. Our findings highlight the complexity of phenotypic ageing under natural conditions and, along with emerging data from other wild populations and laboratory models, suggest that the long-standing hypothesis within evolutionary biology that fitness-related traits should senesce in a synchronous manner is seriously flawed.

AB The Lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum L.) is the primary vector for pathogens of significant public health importance in North America, yet relatively little is known about its current and potential future distribution. Building on a published summary of tick collection records, we used an ensemble modeling approach to predict the present-day and future distribution of climatically suitable habitat for establishment of the Lone star tick within the continental United States. Of the nine climatic predictor variables included in our five present-day models, average vapor pressure in July was by far the most important determinant of suitable habitat. The present-day ensemble model predicted an essentially contiguous distribution of suitable habitat extending to the Atlantic coast east of the 100th western meridian and south of the 40th northern parallel, but excluding a high elevation region associated with the Appalachian Mountains. Future ensemble predictions for 2061-2080 forecasted a stable western range limit, northward expansion of suitable habitat into the Upper Midwest and western Pennsylvania, and range contraction along portions of the Gulf coast and the lower Mississippi river valley. These findings are informative for raising awareness of A. americanttmtransmitted pathogens in areas where the Lone Star tick has recently or may become established.

AB Adaptive radiation is the rapid and extensive ecological diversification of an organismal lineage to generate both phenotypic disparity (divergence) and similarity (convergence). Demonstrating particularly clear evidence of the power of natural selection, adaptive radiations serve as outstanding systems for studying the mechanisms of evolution. We review how the first wave of genomic investigation across major archetypal adaptive radiations has started to shed light on the molecular basis of adaptive diversification. Notably, these efforts have not yet identified consistent features of genomic architecture that promote diversification. However, access to a pool of ancient adaptive variation via genetic exchange emerges as an important driver of adaptive radiation. We conclude by highlighting avenues for future research on adaptive radiations, including the discovery of 'adaptation genes' based on genome scans using replicate convergent populations.

AB Accurate estimation of gross primary production (GPP) is critical for understanding ecosystem response to climate variability and change. Satellite-based diagnostic models, which use satellite images and/or climate data as input, are widely used to estimate GPP. Many models used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to estimate the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by vegetation canopy (FPAR(canopy)) and GPP. Recently, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) has been increasingly used to estimate the fraction of PAR absorbed by chlorophyll (FPAR(chl)) or green leaves (FPAR(green)) and to provide more accurate estimates of GPP in such models as the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), Temperature and Greenness (TG) model, Greenness and Radiation (GR) model, and Vegetation Index (VI) model. Although these EVI-based models perform well under non-drought conditions, their performances under severe droughts are unclear. In this study, we run the four EVI-based models at three AmeriFlux sites (rainfed soybean, irrigated maize, and grassland) during drought and non-drought years to examine their sensitivities to drought. As all the four models use EVI for FPAR estimate, our hypothesis is that their different sensitivities to drought are mainly attributed to the ways they handle light use efficiency CLUE), especially water stress. The predicted GPP from these four models had a good agreement with the GPP estimated from eddy flux tower in non-drought years with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) in the order of 2.17 (VPM), 2.47 (VI), 2.85 (GR) and 3.10 g C m(-2) day(-1) (TG). But their performances differed in drought years, the VPM model performed best, followed by the VI, GR and TG, with the RMSEs of 1.61, 232, 3.16 and 3.90 g C m(-2) day-1 respectively. TG and GR models overestimated seasonal sum of GPP by 20% to 61% in rainfed sites in drought years and also overestimated or underestimated GPP in the irrigated site. This difference in model performance under severe drought is attributed to the fact that the VPM uses satellite-based Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) to address the effect of water stress (deficit) on LUE and GPP, while the other three models do not have such a mechanism. This study suggests that it is essential for these models to consider the effect of water stress on GPP, in addition to using EVI to estimate FPAR, if these models are applied to estimate GPP under drought conditions.

AB Reciprocal interaction between plant and soil (plant-soil feedback, PSF) can determine plant community structure. Understanding which traits control interspecific variation of PSF strength is crucial for plant ecology. Studies have highlighted either plant-mediated nutrient cycling (litter-mediated PSF) or plant-microbe interaction (microbial-mediated PSF) as important PSF mechanisms, each attributing PSF variation to different traits. However, this separation neglects the complex indirect interactions between the two mechanisms. We developed a model coupling litter- and microbial-mediated PSFs to identify the relative importance of traits in controlling PSF strength, and its dependency on the composition of root-associated microbes (i.e. pathogens and/or mycorrhizal fungi). Results showed that although plant carbon: nitrogen (C:N) ratio and microbial nutrient acquisition traits were consistently important, the importance of litter decomposability varied. Litter decomposability was not a major PSF determinant when pathogens are present. However, its importance increased with the relative abundance of mycorrhizal fungi as nutrient released from the mycorrhizal-enhanced litter production to the nutrient-depleted soils result in synergistic increase of soil nutrient and mycorrhizal abundance. Data compiled from empirical studies also supported our predictions. We propose that the importance of litter decomposability depends on the composition of root-associated microbes. Our results provide new perspectives in plant invasion and trait-based ecology.

AB Anthropogenic noise is a major pollutant for organisms that live in urban areas. City birds modify their songs in ways that can increase their communication potential in spite of noise. However, these changes cannot prevent song masking by the extremely loud noises to which some urban bird populations are exposed. Here, we show that birds near a major airport advance their dawn singing time, thus reducing overlap with periods of intense aircraft noise. This modification was stronger in species whose normal singing time was relatively late, those which overlapped the most with aircraft noise. Although suggestive of a causal relationship, this pattern does not allow us to tell apart the effect of aircraft noise from that of other variables that may correlate with dawn singing time. In order to control for such potentially confounding variables, we replicated the study in several airports at different latitudes in Spain and Germany. The results show that indeed the overlap of song chorus with aircraft noise was the key factor that influenced time advancement. Aircraft traffic time was the main predictor of song advancement: across Europe, those bird populations whose singing time overlapped the most with aircraft traffic were those that advanced their song timing to a higher extent. Our results exemplify how behavioral plasticity may allow the survival of avian populations in areas of high noise pollution. However, such an adaptation likely involves departing from optimal singing times, leading to higher energetic costs and amplifying between-species differences in competitive ability and resilience.

AB Much of the recent changes in North American climate have occurred during the winter months, and as result, overwintering birds represent important sentinels of anthropogenic climate change. While there is mounting evidence that bird populations are responding to a warming climate (e.g., poleward shifts) questions remain as to whether these species-specific responses are resulting in community-wide changes. Here, we test the hypothesis that a changing winter climate should favor the formation of winter bird communities dominated by warm-adapted species. To do this, we quantified changes in community composition using a functional index - the Community Temperature Index (CTI) - which measures the balance between low- and high-temperature dwelling species in a community. Using data from Project FeederWatch, an international citizen science program, we quantified spatiotemporal changes in winter bird communities (n=38 bird species) across eastern North America and tested the influence of changes in winter minimum temperature over a 22-year period. We implemented a jackknife analysis to identify those species most influential in driving changes at the community level and the population dynamics (e.g., extinction or colonization) responsible for these community changes. Since 1990, we found that the winter bird community structure has changed with communities increasingly composed of warm-adapted species. This reshuffling of winter bird communities was strongest in southerly latitudes and driven primarily by local increases in abundance and regional patterns of colonization by southerly birds. CTI tracked patterns of changing winter temperature at different temporal scales ranging from 1 to 35years. We conclude that a shifting winter climate has provided an opportunity for smaller, southerly distributed species to colonize new regions and promote the formation of unique winter bird assemblages throughout eastern North America.

AB Direct gradient analyses in spatial genetics provide unique opportunities to describe the inherent complexity of genetic variation in wildlife species and are the object of many methodological developments. However, multicollinearity among explanatory variables is a systemic issue in multivariate regression analyses and is likely to cause serious difficulties in properly interpreting results of direct gradient analyses, with the risk of erroneous conclusions, misdirected research and inefficient or counterproductive conservation measures. Using simulated data sets along with linear and logistic regressions on distance matrices, we illustrate how commonality analysis (CA), a detailed variance-partitioning procedure that was recently introduced in the field of ecology, can be used to deal with nonindependence among spatial predictors. By decomposing model fit indices into unique and common (or shared) variance components, CA allows identifying the location and magnitude of multicollinearity, revealing spurious correlations and thus thoroughly improving the interpretation of multivariate regressions. Despite a few inherent limitations, especially in the case of resistance model optimization, this review highlights the great potential of CA to account for complex multicollinearity patterns in spatial genetics and identifies future applications and lines of research. We strongly urge spatial geneticists to systematically investigate commonalities when performing direct gradient analyses.

AB AimSpecies distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly used to address numerous questions in ecology, biogeography, conservation biology and evolution. Surprisingly, the crucial step of selecting the most relevant variables has received little attention, despite its direct implications for model transferability and uncertainty. Here, we aim to address this with a continent-wide, evaluation of which climate predictors provided the most accurate SDMs for bird distributions.
   LocationConterminous United States.
   MethodsFor 243 species, we used yearly data since 1971 (from the North American Breeding Bird Survey) to run SDMs (six different algorithms) with combinations of six relatively uncorrelated climate predictors (selected from 22 widely used climate variables). We then estimated the importance of each predictor - both spatially and over a 40-year time period - by comparing the accuracy of the model obtained with or without a given predictor.
   ResultsThree temperature-related variables (annual potential evapotranspiration, mean annual temperature and growing degree days) produced significantly more accurate SDMs than any other predictors. Among precipitation predictors, annual precipitation provided the most accurate results. Albeit only rarely used in SDMs, the moisture index performed similarly strongly. Interestingly, predictors that summarize average annual climate produced more accurate distributions than seasonal predictors, despite distinct seasonal movements in most species considered. Encouragingly, spatial and temporal (over 40years) evaluation of variables yielded very similar results.
   Main conclusionsThe approach presented here allowed us to identify the statistically most relevant predictors for birds in the USA and can be applied to other taxa and/or in different parts of the world. Appropriately selecting the most relevant predictors of species distributions at large spatial scale is vital to identifying ecologically meaningful relationships that provide the most accurate predictions under climate change or biological invasions.

AB Spatial structuring and segregation by sex and size is considered to be an intrinsic attribute of shark populations. These spatial patterns remain poorly understood, particularly for oceanic species such as blue shark (Prionace glauca), despite its importance for the management and conservation of this highly migratory species. This study presents the results of a long-term electronic tagging experiment to investigate the migratory patterns of blue shark, to elucidate how these patterns change across its life history and to assess the existence of a nursery area in the central North Atlantic. Blue sharks belonging to different life stages (n = 34) were tracked for periods up to 952 days during which they moved extensively (up to an estimated 28.139 km), occupying large parts of the oceanic basin. Notwithstanding a large individual variability, there were pronounced differences in movements and space use across the species' life history. The study provides strong evidence for the existence of a discrete central North Atlantic nursery, where juveniles can reside for up to at least 2 years. In contrast with previously described nurseries of coastal and semi-pelagic sharks, this oceanic nursery is comparatively vast and open suggesting that shelter from predators is not its main function. Subsequently, male and female blue sharks spatially segregate. Females engage in seasonal latitudinal migrations until approaching maturity, when they undergo an ontogenic habitat shift towards tropical latitudes. In contrast, juvenile males generally expanded their range southward and apparently displayed a higher degree of behavioural polymorphism. These results provide important insights into the spatial ecology of pelagic sharks, with implications for the sustainable management of this heavily exploited shark, especially in the central North Atlantic where the presence of a nursery and the seasonal overlap and alternation of different life stages coincides with a high fishing mortality.

AB Mountain ecosystems are particularly susceptible to climate change. Characterizing intraspecific variation of alpine plants along elevational gradients is crucial for estimating their vulnerability to predicted changes. Environmental conditions vary with elevation, which might influence plastic responses and affect selection pressures that lead to local adaptation. Thus, local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity among low and high elevation plant populations in response to climate, soil and other factors associated with elevational gradients might underlie different responses of these populations to climate warming. Using a transplant experiment along an elevational gradient, we investigated reproductive phenology, growth and reproduction of the nutrient-poor grassland species Ranunculus bulbosus, Trifolium montanum and Briza media. Seeds were collected from low and high elevation source populations across the Swiss Alps and grown in nine common gardens at three different elevations with two different soil depths. Despite genetic differentiation in some traits, the results revealed no indication of local adaptation to the elevation of population origin. Reproductive phenology was advanced at lower elevation in low and high elevation populations of all three species. Growth and reproduction of T. montanum and B. media were hardly affected by garden elevation and soil depth. In R. bulbosus, however, growth decreased and reproductive investment increased at higher elevation. Furthermore, soil depth influenced growth and reproduction of low elevation R. bulbosus populations. We found no evidence for local adaptation to elevation of origin and hardly any differences in the responses of low and high elevation populations. However, the consistent advanced reproductive phenology observed in all three species shows that they have the potential to plastically respond to environmental variation. We conclude that populations might not be forced to migrate to higher elevations as a consequence of climate warming, as plasticity will buffer the detrimental effects of climate change in the three investigated nutrient-poor grassland species.

AB High variability in the literature is reported on the soil depth affected by forest fires because many factors are involved. We study the fire-induced changes on properties related to soil erodibility as water repellency (WR), soil aggregate stability (SAS) and organic matter at topsoil centimeter-scale (O horizon, and Ah horizon at 1,2 and 3 cm depth). In order to achieve this aim, topsoil monoliths (Rendzic Phaeozem) were sampled from an Aleppo pine forest, with no recent history of forest fires and burned in an outdoor combustion tunnel. Fire caused an immediate and significant decrease in WR, total organic carbon (TOC) and pyrolyzed carbon (PyC) in the O horizon. The Ah horizon was also affected by burning but only up to 2 cm soil depth and with a different intensity according to the soil property: TOC was not significantly affected; WR and PyC decreased up to the upper centimeter and SAS up to 2 cm Ah horizon depth. Soil burning involved the loss of 2/3 of the pre-fire TOC of the O horizon and 1/3 of the TOC of the upper centimeter of the Ah horizon. Fire also modified the structural composition of organic matter, an effect that was apparent again only above 2 cm depth. Specifically the relative abundance of typical vegetation markers (terpenes, resinic acids) and lignin markers (methoxyphenols) decreased. Fire fragmented the long-chain molecules of the alkylic series (n-alkanes, alkenes, fatty acids and methylated fatty acids). This observation, together with a conspicuous reduction in the amount of organic molecules with functional groups in the upper centimeters of the soil monoliths, may be related to the fire-induced decreases in WR and SAS. In conclusion, moderate burning of a mollic horizon in the laboratory produced changes in the hydrophobicity, aggregation, and organic matter only up to 2 cm depth. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB There is an ongoing debate about whether communities are closely integrated and bound together via interactions such as competition or facilitation, or are disintegrated and dominated by chance. We still lack community-wide data on the intensities of interactions and randomness, and measurements of their impacts on community structure. Using a long-term data set, we sought to measure the effects of interactions and stochasticity in structuring a highly diverse (>100 species) semi-arid grassland plant community, testing for positive and negative interactions at different stages of population growth of all species. During the colonization of new patches, most species were facilitated or inhibited by several others. These opposite effects can potentially have a large effect on species abundances, but they were correlated and cancelled out at the community level. Nevertheless, competition during colonization was strong enough to cause poor competitors to have small population sizes. The subsequent phase of population growth (increase and subsequent change in numbers within occupied patches) was mainly driven by intraspecific density dependence, and we found little evidence for interspecific interactions. Model results showed that stochasticity and recurrent colonization of transient, favourable patches maintained diversity, keeping poor competitors from becoming extinct.Synthesis: Our results, taken together with recent studies on tropical forests, suggest that weak interactions among established plants may be a general phenomenon, but that local interactions during colonization are important drivers of community composition. Most of the variance in species abundance in our community was explained by intraspecific competition and stochasticity, with interspecific interactions playing a minor role due to their overall weakness, interaction changes over ontogeny, and the cancellation of opposite-sign interactions when all the species in the community are considered. Despite this, some species were rare seemingly because they cannot withstand interspecific competition. Thus, to untangle the effects of interactions on community structure, future research should focus on interactions occurring at different phases of population growth and on whole communities.

AB Dispersal, the tendency for organisms to reproduce away from their parents, influences many evolutionary and ecological processes, from speciation and extinction events, to the coexistence of genotypes within species or biological invasions. Understanding how dispersal evolves is crucial to predict how global changes might affect species persistence and geographical distribution. The factors driving the evolution of dispersal have been well characterized from a theoretical standpoint, and predictions have been made about their respective influence on, for example, dispersal polymorphism or the emergence of dispersal syndromes. However, the experimental tests of some theories remain scarce partly because a synthetic view of theoretical advances is still lacking. Here, we review the different ingredients of models of dispersal evolution, from selective pressures and types of predictions, through mathematical and ecological assumptions, to the methods used to obtain predictions. We provide perspectives as to which predictions are easiest to test, how theories could be better exploited to provide testable predictions, what theoretical developments are needed to tackle this topic, and we place the question of the evolution of dispersal within the larger interdisciplinary framework of eco-evolutionary dynamics.

AB The presence of soluble carbohydrates in the cambial zone, either from sugars recently produced during photosynthesis or from starch remobilized from storage organs, is necessary for radial tree growth. However, considerable uncertainties on carbohydrate dynamics and the consequences on tree productivity exist. This study aims to better understand the variation in different carbon pools at intra-annual resolution by quantifying how cambial zone sugar and starch concentrations fluctuate over the season and in relation to cambial phenology. A comparison between two physiologically different species growing at the same site, i.e., the evergreen Picea abies Karst. and the deciduous Larix decidua Mill., and between L. decidua from two contrasting elevations, is presented to identify mechanisms of growth limitation. Results indicate that the annual cycle of sugar concentration within the cambial zone is coupled to the process of wood formation. The highest sugar concentration is observed when the number of cells in secondary wall formation and lignification stages is at a maximum, subsequent to most radial growth. Starch disappears in winter, while other freeze-resistant non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) increase. Slight differences in NSC concentration between species are consistent with the differing climate sensitivity of the evergreen and deciduous species investigated. The general absence of differences between elevations suggests that the cambial activity of trees growing at the treeline was not limited by the availability of carbohydrates at the cambial zone but instead by environmental controls on the growing season duration.

AB Elevated [CO2] and temperature may alter the drought responses of tree seedling growth, photosynthesis, respiration and total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) status depending on drought intensity and duration. Few studies have addressed these important climatic interactions or their consequences. We grew Eucalyptus globulus Labill. seedlings in two [CO2] concentrations (400 and 640 mu l l(-1)) and two temperatures (28/17 and 32/21 degrees C) (day/night) in a sun-lit glasshouse, and grew them in well-watered conditions or exposed them to two drought treatments having undergone different previous water conditions (i.e., rewatered drought and sustained drought). Progressive drought in both drought treatments led to similar limitations in growth, photosynthesis and respiration, but reductions in TNC concentration were not observed. Elevated [CO2] ameliorated the impact of the drought during the moderate drought phase (i.e., Day 63 to Day 79) by increasing photosynthesis and enhancing leaf and whole-plant TNC content. In contrast, elevated temperature exacerbated the impact of the drought during the moderate drought phase by reducing photosynthesis, increasing leaf respiration and decreasing whole-plant TNC content. Extreme drought (i.e., Day 79 to Day 103) eliminated [CO2] and temperature effects on plant growth, photosynthesis and respiration. The combined effects of elevated [CO2] and elevated temperature on moderate drought stressed seedlings were reduced with progressive drought, with no sustained effects on growth despite greater whole-plant TNC content.

AB Climate change has already altered the distribution of marine fishes. Future predictions of fish distributions and catches based on bioclimate envelope models are available, but to date they have not considered interspecific interactions. We address this by combining the species-based Dynamic Bioclimate Envelope Model (DBEM) with a size-based trophic model. The new approach provides spatially and temporally resolved predictions of changes in species' size, abundance and catch potential that account for the effects of ecological interactions. Predicted latitudinal shifts are, on average, reduced by 20% when species interactions are incorporated, compared to DBEM predictions, with pelagic species showing the greatest reductions. Goodness-of-fit of biomass data from fish stock assessments in the North Atlantic between 1991 and 2003 is improved slightly by including species interactions. The differences between predictions from the two models may be relatively modest because, at the North Atlantic basin scale, (i) predators and competitors may respond to climate change together; (ii) existing parameterization of the DBEM might implicitly incorporate trophic interactions; and/or (iii) trophic interactions might not be the main driver of responses to climate. Future analyses using ecologically explicit models and data will improve understanding of the effects of inter-specific interactions on responses to climate change, and better inform managers about plausible ecological and fishery consequences of a changing environment.

AB Recent advances in sequencing methods have transformed the field of microbial ecology, making it possible to determine the composition and functional capabilities of uncultured microorganisms. These technologies have been instrumental in the recognition that resident microorganisms can have profound effects on the phenotype and fitness of their animal hosts by modulating the animal signaling networks that regulate growth, development, behavior, etc. Against this backdrop, this review assesses the impact of microorganisms on insect-plant interactions, in the context of the hypothesis that microorganisms are biochemical brokers of plant utilization by insects. There is now overwhelming evidence for a microbial role in insect utilization of certain plant diets with an extremely low or unbalanced nutrient content. Specifically, microorganisms enable insect utilization of plant sap by synthesizing essential amino acids. They also can broker insect utilization of plant products of extremely high lignocellulose content, by enzymatic breakdown of complex plant polysaccharides, nitrogen fixation, and sterol synthesis. However, the experimental evidence for microbial-mediated detoxification of plant allelochemicals is limited. The significance of microorganisms as brokers of plant utilization by insects is predicted to vary, possibly widely, as a result of potentially complex interactions between the composition of the microbiota and the diet and insect developmental age or genotype. For every insect species feeding on plant material, the role of resident microbiota as biochemical brokers of plant utilization is a testable hypothesis.

AB Although urban areas are often considered to have uniformly negative effects on biodiversity, cities are most accurately characterized as heterogeneous mosaics of buildings, streets, parks, and gardens that include both good' and bad' areas for wildlife. However, to date, few studies have evaluated how human impacts vary in direction and magnitude across a heterogeneous urban landscape. In this study, we assessed the distribution of floral resources and flower-visiting insects across a variety of land uses in New York City. We visited both green spaces (e.g. parks, cemeteries) and heavily developed neighborhood blocks (e.g. with high or low density residential zoning) and used structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of median income, vegetation, and development intensity on floral resources and insects in both settings. Abundance and taxonomic richness of flower-visiting insects was significantly greater in green spaces than neighborhood blocks. The SEM results indicated that heavily-developed neighborhoods generally had fewer flower-visiting insects consistent with reductions in floral resources. However, some low-density residential neighborhoods maintained high levels of floral resources and flower-visiting insects. We found that the effects of surrounding vegetation on floral resources, and thus indirect effects on insects, varied considerably between green spaces and neighborhood blocks. Along neighborhood blocks, vegetation consisted of a mosaic of open gardens and sparsely distributed trees and had a positive indirect effect on flower-visiting insects. In contrast, vegetation in urban green spaces was associated with increased canopy cover and thus had a negative indirect effect on flower-visiting insects through reductions in floral resources. In both neighborhood blocks and green spaces, vegetation had a positive direct effect on flower-visiting insects independent of the influence of vegetation on floral resources. Our results demonstrate how inter-related components of an urban ecosystem can vary with respect to one another across a heterogeneous urban landscape, suggesting that it is inappropriate to generalize about urban systems as a whole without first addressing differences among component land use types.

AB We investigated the effect of land use on differences in air temperature. We based our analysis on a decade of weather and energy flux measurements, collected over two contrasting landscapes, an oak savanna and an annual grassland, growing under the same climate conditions. Over the decade, the daily-averaged, potential air temperature above the aerodynamically rougher and optically darker oak savanna was 0.5 degrees C warmer than that above the aerodynamically smoother and optically brighter annual grassland. However, air temperature differences were seasonal. Smallest differences in potential air temperature occurred towards the end of spring, when much of the soil moisture reservoir was depleted. Largest differences in potential air temperature occurred during the winter rain season when the grass was green and transpiring and when the trees were senescent or deciduous. To understand the effect of land use on the local climate, we examined the concomitant changes in net radiation, sensible and latent heat exchange, the aerodynamic roughness (R-a), the surface resistance to water transfer (R-s), aerodynamic surface temperature and the growth of the planetary boundary layer, with measurements and model computations. Overall, these biophysical variables provide us with mechanistic information to diagnose and predict how changes in air temperature will follow changes in land use or management. In conclusion, land use change is responsible for having a marked impact on the local climate of a region. At the local level, the change in the surface energy balance, towards a darker and rougher surface, will produce an additive increment to climate warming induced by a greater greenhouse gas burden in the atmosphere.

AB Tropical mountains contain some of the world's richest animal communities as a result of high turnover of species along elevational gradients. We describe an approach to study the roles of biotic and abiotic factors in establishing elevational ranges, and to improve our ability to predict the effects of climate change on these communities. As a framework we use Hutchinson's concept of the fundamental niche (determined by the match between the physical environment and the organism's physiological and biophysical characteristics) and realized niche (the subset of the fundamental niche determined by biotic interactions). Using tropical birds as an example, we propose a method for estimating fundamental niches and discuss five biotic interactions that we expect to influence distributions of tropical montane animals: predation, competition, parasites and pathogens, mutualisms, and habitat associations. The effects of biotic factors on elevational ranges have been studied to some extent, but there is little information on physiological responses of tropical montane animals. It will be necessary to understand all of these ecological constraints in concert to predict current and future elevational ranges and potential threats to montane species. Given the importance of tropical mountains as global biodiversity hotspots, we argue that this area of research requires urgent attention.

AB The assembling of bacterial communities in conventional activated sludge (CAS) bioreactors was thought, until recently, to be chaotic and mostly unpredictable. Studies done over the last decade have shown that specific, and often, predictable random and non-random factors could be responsible for that process. These studies have also motivated a "structure-function'' paradigm that is yet to be resolved. Thus, elucidating the factors that affect community assembly in the bioreactors is necessary for predicting fluctuations in community structure and function. For this study activated sludge samples were collected during a one-year period from two geographically distant CAS bioreactors of different size. Combining community fingerprinting analysis and operational parameters data with a robust statistical analysis, we aimed to identify relevant links between system performance and bacterial community diversity and dynamics. In addition to revealing a significant beta-diversity between the bioreactors' communities, results showed that the largest bioreactor had a less dynamic but more efficient and diverse bacterial community throughout the study. The statistical analysis also suggests that deterministic factors, as opposed to stochastic factors, may have a bigger impact on the community structure in the largest bioreactor. Furthermore, the community seems to rely mainly on mechanisms of resistance and functional redundancy to maintain functional stability. We suggest that the ecological theories behind the Island Biogeography model and the species-area relationship were appropriate to predict the assembly of bacterial communities in these CAS bioreactors. These results are of great importance for engineers and ecologists as they reveal critical aspects of CAS systems that could be applied towards improving bioreactor design and operation.

AB Spatial and temporal patterns of soil water are major determinants of net primary production and plant functional composition in arid and semiarid ecosystems which cover approximately 30% of global land area. The ecohydrological niche defines the components of species' niche that are described by the relationship between ecohydrological conditions and species occurrence. We modelled the ecohydrological niche of different sagebrush ecosystems types, which are widespread in the semiarid western United States, and identified characteristics, which, if altered, will potentially lead to changes in their geographic distribution. We ran a daily soil water simulation model, SOILWAT, to simulate the water balance in space and time for sites from across the geographic range of sagebrush ecosystems. Additionally, to evaluate the relative importance of weather type, soil texture, soil depth, vegetation biomass, and phenology, we performed a sensitivity analysis using output from SOILWAT. Our results demonstrated that soil water dynamics in sagebrush ecosystems are characterized by spring recharge followed by a dry period (timing dependent on ecosystem type), where top soil layers dry earlier and more completely than the bottom layers. Most response variables were strongly influenced by weather type, followed by phenology of biomass, and soil depth. Reducing the availability of deep soil water during summer dry periods by increasing evaporative demand or reducing spring recharge will potentially lead to shifts in the range of sagebrush ecosystems. Characterizing the ecohydrological niche will be essential for improving our understanding of how semiarid ecosystems will be affected by future climate and biological invasions. Published in 2011.

AB The large number of green space lawns in cities means that they shelter a high proportion of wild urban species, but the roles of landscape and management on the level of biodiversity in these spaces are little understood. We performed floristic inventories in 100 lawns in the southeast corner of Paris, France and linked their floristic diversity and composition to: (1) the characteristics of urbanization given by the Land Use Pattern and the distance from the centre of Paris, (2) local factors including luminosity and size of the lawn and (3) the type of management, including pesticide and fertilizer use, animal and public access, and mowing frequency. A total of 79 species were identified, of which 9% were naturalized. Distribution of the species was largely conditioned by the management methods applied to the green spaces: specific management strategies were associated with specific community traits and composition. As expected, the highest species richness and/or rarity were found in lawns submitted to private management, low use of pesticides and limited public access. But surprisingly high diversity was also sometimes found in small public lawns. The results establish relationships between human practices and characteristics of plant communities. We use them to make several recommendations on how best to optimize management of lawns with a view to conserving urban biodiversity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The widespread phenomenon of polyandry (mating by females with multiple males) is an evolutionary puzzle, because females can sustain costs from promiscuity, whereas full fertility can be provided by a single male. Using the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, we identify major fitness benefits of polyandry to females under inbreeding, when the risks of fertilization by incompatible male haplotypes are especially high. Fifteen generations after inbred populations had passed through genetic bottlenecks, we recorded increased levels of female promiscuity compared with noninbred controls, most likely due to selection from prospective fitness gains through polyandry. These data illustrate how this common mating pattern can evolve if population genetic bottlenecks increase the risks of fitness depression due to fertilization by sperm carrying genetically incompatible haplotypes.

AB For more than two decades, the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) has been considered a paradigm of disease vulnerability associated with low genetic diversity, particularly at the immune genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Cheetahs have been used as a classic example in numerous conservation genetics textbooks as well as in many related scientific publications. However, earlier studies used methods with low resolution to quantify MHC diversity and/or small sample sizes. Furthermore, high disease susceptibility was reported only for captive cheetahs, whereas free-ranging cheetahs show no signs of infectious diseases and a good general health status. We examined whether the diversity at MHC class I and class II-DRB loci in 149 Namibian cheetahs was higher than previously reported using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, cloning, and sequencing. MHC genes were examined at the genomic and transcriptomic levels. We detected ten MHC class I and four class II-DRB alleles, of which nine MHC class I and all class II-DRB alleles were expressed. Phylogenetic analyses and individual genotypes suggested that the alleles belong to four MHC class I and three class II-DRB putative loci. Evidence of positive selection was detected in both MHC loci. Our study indicated that the low number of MHC class I alleles previously observed in cheetahs was due to a smaller sample size examined. On the other hand, the low number of MHC class II-DRB alleles previously observed in cheetahs was further confirmed. Compared with other mammalian species including felids, cheetahs showed low levels of MHC diversity, but this does not seem to influence the immunocompetence of free-ranging cheetahs in Namibia and contradicts the previous conclusion that the cheetah is a paradigm species of disease vulnerability.

AB Outdoor educational programmes are generally believed to be a suitable alternative to conventional biology settings that improve participants' environmental attitudes and knowledge. Here we examine whether outdoor educational programmes focused solely on practical work with plants influence participants' knowledge of and attitudes towards plants. It was found that mean scores of participants' attitudes towards and knowledge of plants significantly increased after the outdoor programme. These effects remained significant even after three months' post-testing. No similar patterns were found in the control group. Interestingly, the proportion of participants who liked biology as a school subject also significantly increased after the outdoor programme in the experimental group. Females showed better knowledge of plants than males, but attitudes towards plants were similar between genders. Having a garden at home was not associated with better knowledge or attitudes towards plants. Our results reveal that outdoor programmes significantly relieve 'plant blindness' and make biology more attractive to pupils.

AB Biological invasions affect virtually all ecosystems on earth, but the degree to which different regions and biomes are invaded, and the quality of information from different regions, varies greatly. A large body of literature exists on the invasion of savannas in the Neotropics and northern Australia where invasive plants, especially African grasses, have had major impacts. Less has been published on plant invasions in African savannas, except for those in South Africa. Negative impacts due to plant invasions in African savannas appear to be less severe than in other regions at present. As savannas cover about 60% of the continent, with tens of millions of people relying on the services they provide, it is timely to assess the current status of invasions as a threat to these ecosystems. We reviewed the literature, contrasting the African situation with that of Neotropical and Australian savannas. A number of drivers and explanatory factors of plant invasions in savannas have been described, mostly from the Neotropics and Australia. These include herbivore presence, residence time, intentional introductions for pasture improvements, fire regimes, the physiology of the introduced species, and anthropogenic disturbance. After comparing these drivers across the three regions, we suggest that the lower extent of alien plant invasions in African savannas is largely attributable to: (1) significantly lower rates of intentional plant introductions and widespread plantings (until recently); (2) the role of large mammalian herbivores in these ecosystems; (3) historical and biogeographical issues relating to the regions of origin of introduced species; and (4) the adaptation of African systems to fire. We discuss how changing conditions in the three regions are likely to affect plant invasions in the future.

AB Density of conspecifics is considered as one of the main conditions affecting dispersal behavior and leading to a stabilization of population dynamics. Density-dependent dispersal can be induced by local competition at different phases during development and/or by density-related sources of social information. Here, we assessed the importance of population density on emigration rates and the degree to which the presence of silk threads at dispersal takeoff locations affects immediate dispersal decision making in the spider Erigone atra. By quantifying behaviors in wind tunnels under standardized laboratory conditions, silk-assisted long-and short-distance dispersal is quantified before the actual onset of the dispersal event.
   Increased densities during juvenile development only affected short-distance dispersal behavior. In females, short-distance dispersal increased with the female density experienced during development, whereas responses in males increased under combined high male/low female-experienced densities. Elevated densities at the onset of dispersal led to a general increase of predispersal behaviors. The presence of silk threads at takeoff platforms similarly induced an increase of dispersal displays, with specifically an increase in long-distance dispersal in both sexes.
   Our results demonstrate that the spider E. atra uses information related to density during development, most probably to avoid competition by performing short-distance dispersal. In contrast, density-related cues at the time of dispersal (i.e., increased densities and the presence of silk threads) increase general dispersal activities and long-distance ballooning events. Short-and long-distance dispersal strategies are consequently guided by differential density-related information use.

AB The EDGE (evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered) conservation program (www.edgeofexistence.org) uses a composite measure of threat and phylogenetic isolation to rank species for conservation attention. Using primates as a test case, we examined how species that rank highly with this metric represent the collective from which they are drawn. We considered the ecological and morphological traits, including body mass, diet, terrestriality, and home range size, of all 233 species of primates. Overall, EDGE score and the level of deviance from the mean of 20 different ecological, reproductive, and morphological variables were correlated (mean correlation r = 0.14, combined p = 1.7 x 10(-14)). Although primates with a high EDGE score had characteristics that made them seem odd, they did not seem to express more ancestral characteristics than expected. Sets of primate species with high EDGE scores will, therefore, collectively capture a broader than expected range of the biology of the clade. If similar patterns hold in other groups, the EDGE metric may be useful for prioritizing biodiversity for conservation.

AB P>1. Worldwide loss of biodiversity necessitates a clear understanding of the factors driving population declines as well as informed predictions about which species and populations are at greatest risk. The biggest threat to the long-term persistence of populations is the reduction and changes in configuration of their natural habitat.
   2. Inconsistencies have been noted in the responses of populations to the combined effects of habitat loss and fragmentation. These have been widely attributed to the effects of the matrix habitats in which remnant focal habitats are typically embedded.
   3. We quantified the potential effects of the inter-patch matrix by estimating occupancy and colonization of forest and surrounding non-forest matrix (NF). We estimated species-specific parameters using a dynamic, multi-species hierarchical model on a bird community in southwestern Costa Rica.
   4. Overall, we found higher probabilities of occupancy and colonization of forest relative to the NF across bird species, including those previously categorized as open habitat generalists not needing forest to persist. Forest dependency was a poor predictor of occupancy dynamics in our study region, largely predicting occupancy and colonization of only non-forest habitats.
   5. Our results indicate that the protection of remnant forest habitats is key for the long-term persistence of all members of the bird community in this fragmented landscape, including species typically associated with open, non-forest habitats.
   6.Synthesis and applications. We identified 39 bird species of conservation concern defined by having high estimates of forest occupancy, and low estimates of occupancy and colonization of non-forest. These species survive in forest but are unlikely to venture out into open, non-forested habitats, therefore, they are vulnerable to the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation. Our hierarchical community-level model can be used to estimate species-specific occupancy dynamics for focal and inter-patch matrix habitats to identify which species within a community are likely to be impacted most by habitat loss and fragmentation. This model can be applied to other taxa (i.e. amphibians, mammals and insects) to estimate species and community occurrence dynamics in response to current environmental conditions and to make predictions in response to future changes in habitat configurations.

AB Host trees can modify their soil abiotic conditions through their leaf fall quality which in turn may influence the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal community composition. We investigated this indirect interaction using a causal modelling approach. We identified ECM fungi on the roots of two coexisting oak species growing in two forests in southern Spain Quercus suber (evergreen) and Quercus canariensis (winter deciduous)-using a PCR-based molecular method. We also analysed the leaf fall, litter and soil sampled beneath the tree canopies to determine the concentrations of key nutrients. The total mycorrhizal pool was comprised of 69 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Tomentella and Russula were the most species-rich, frequent and abundant genera. ECM fungi with epigeous and resupinate fruiting bodies were found in 60% and 34% of the identified mycorrhizas, respectively. The calcium content of litter, which was significantly higher beneath the winter-deciduous oak species due to differences in leaf fall quality, was the most important variable for explaining ECM species distribution. The evaluation of alternative causal models by the d-sep method revealed that only those considering indirect leaf fall-mediated host effects statistically matched the observed covariation patterns between host, environment (litter, topsoil, subsoil) and fungal community variables.

AB Homoploid hybrid speciation is the formation of a new hybrid species without change in chromosome number. So far, there has been a lack of direct molecular evidence for hybridization generating novel traits directly involved in animal speciation. Heliconius butterflies exhibit bright aposematic color patterns that also act as cues in assortative mating. Heliconius heurippa has been proposed as a hybrid species, and its color pattern can be recreated by introgression of the H. m. melpomene red band into the genetic background of the yellow banded H. cydno cordula. This hybrid color pattern is also involved in mate choice and leads to reproductive isolation between H. heurippa and its close relatives. Here, we provide molecular evidence for adaptive introgression by sequencing genes across the Heliconius red band locus and comparing them to unlinked wing patterning genes in H. melpomene, H. cydno, and H. heurippa. 670 SNPs distributed among 29 unlinked coding genes (25,847bp) showed H. heurippa was related to H. c. cordula or the three species were intermixed. In contrast, among 344 SNPs distributed among 13 genes in the red band region (18,629bp), most showed H. heurippa related with H. c. cordula, but a block of around 6,5kb located in the 39 of a putative kinesin gene grouped H. heurippa with H. m. melpomene, supporting the hybrid introgression hypothesis. Genealogical reconstruction showed that this introgression occurred after divergence of the parental species, perhaps around 0.43Mya. Expression of the kinesin gene is spatially restricted to the distal region of the forewing, suggesting a mechanism for pattern regulation. This gene therefore constitutes the first molecular evidence for adaptive introgression during hybrid speciation and is the first clear candidate for a Heliconius wing patterning locus.

AB Historical photographs document that during the last century, forests have expanded upwards by 60-80 m into former tundra of the pristine Ural mountains. We assessed how the shift of the high-altitude treeline ecotone might affect soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics. On the gentle slopes of Mali Iremel in the Southern Urals, we (1) determined the differences in SOM stocks and properties from the tundra at 1360 m above sea level (a.s.l.) to the subalpine forest at 1260 m a.s.l., and (2) measured carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization from tundra and forest soils at 7 and 20 degrees C in a 6-month incubation experiment. C stocks of organic layers were 3.6 +/- 0.3 kg C m(-2) in the tundra and 1.9 +/- 0.2 kg C m(-2) in the forest. Mineral soils down to the bedrock stored significantly more C in the forest, and thus, total soil C stocks were slightly but insignificantly greater in the forest (+3 kg C m(-2)). Assuming a space for time approach based on tree ages suggests that the soil C sink due to the forest expansion during the last century was at most 30 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Diffuse reflective infrared spectroscopy and scanning calorimetry revealed that SOM under forest was less humified in both organic and mineral horizons and, therefore, contained more available substrate. Consistent with this result, C mineralization rates of organic layers and A horizons of the forest were two to four times greater than those of tundra soils. This difference was similar in magnitude to the effect of increasing the incubation temperature from 7 to 20 degrees C. Hence, indirect climate change effects through an upward expansion of forests can be much larger than direct warming effects (Delta 0.3 K across the treeline). Net N mineralization was 2.5 to six times greater in forest than in tundra soils, suggesting that an advancing treeline likely increases N availability. This may provide a nutritional basis for the fivefold increase in plant biomass and a tripling in productivity from the tundra to the forest. In summary, our results suggest that an upward expansion of forest has small net effects on C storage in soils but leads to changes in SOM quality, accelerates C cycling and increases net N mineralization, which in turn might stimulate plant growth and thus C sequestration in tree biomass.

AB The mechanisms shaping patterns of biodiversity along spatial gradients remain poorly known and controversial. Hypotheses have emphasized the importance of both environmental and spatial factors. Much of the uncertainty about the relative role of these processes can be attributed to the limited number of comparative studies that evaluate multiple potential mechanisms. This study examines the relative importance of six variables: temperature, precipitation, productivity, habitat heterogeneity, area, and the mid-domain effect on patterns of species richness for non-volant small mammals along four neighboring mountain ranges in central Utah. Along each of these elevational gradients, a hump-shaped relationship of richness with elevation is evident. This study evaluates whether the processes shaping this common pattern are also common to all gradients. Model selection indicates that no one factor or set of factors best explains patterns of species richness across all gradients, and drivers of diversity may vary seasonally. These findings suggest that commonality in the pattern of species richness, even among elevational gradients with a similar biogeographic history and fauna, cannot be attributed to a simple universal explanation.

AB Genomewide analyses of the transcriptome have confirmed that gene misexpression may underlie reproductive isolation mechanisms in interspecific hybrids. Here, using a 16,006 features cDNA microarray, we compared and contrasted gene expression divergence at two ontogenetic stages in incipient species of normal and dwarf whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) with that of first generation (normal x dwarf) and second-generation hybrid crosses (backcross: [normal x dwarf] x normal]. Our goal was to identify the main mode of action responsible for gene transcription and to discover key genes misexpressed in hybrids. Very few transcripts (five of 4,950 expressed) differed in mean expression level between parentals and hybrids at the embryonic stage, in contrast to 16-week-old juvenile fish for which 617 out of 5,359 transcripts differed significantly. We also found evidence for more misexpression in backcross hybrids whereby nonadditivity explained a larger fraction of hybrid inheritance patterns in backcross (54%) compared with F1-hybrids (9%). Gene expression in hybrids was more variable than in pure crosses and transgressive patterns of expression were ubiquitous in hybrids. In backcross embryos in particular, the expression of three key developmental genes involved in protein folding and mRNA translation was severely disrupted. Accordingly, gene misexpression in hybrids adds to other factors previously identified as contributing to the reproductive isolation of incipient species of lake whitefish.

AB Genetic compatibility may drive individual mate choice decisions because of predictable fitness effects associated with breeding with incompatible partners. In Gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae), females paired with genetically incompatible males of alternative color morphs overproduce sons, presumably to reduce investment in inviable daughters. We also observed a reduced overall investment in clutch size, egg size, and care to offspring resulting from incompatible matings. Within-female experimental pairings demonstrate that female birds have the ability to adaptively adjust the sex of their eggs and allocate resources on the basis of partner quality. Female Gouldian finches thus make cumulative strategic allocation decisions to minimize the costs of poor-quality pairings when faced with a genetically incompatible partner.

AB Human settlements have a strong influence on bird communities. To explore the size effect of the urbanized area in avian community structure, we examined changes in species richness, composition and abundance along urban-rural gradients of different extensions. We measured land-cover variables and surveyed birds along nine urban-rural gradients in the Pampean region of Argentina. In towns over 7000 inh, increasing constructed area was negatively related to species richness. In towns over 13 000 inh, the abundance of native species decreased towards the urban core whereas total abundance increased, decreased or remained constant depending on town characteristics. In villages (< 2000 inh), small (2000-14000 inh) and large towns (> 60000 inh), there was a constant representation of the rural community composition along gradients. In towns of intermediate sizes (> 14000-60 000 inh), species composition was more similar to that from the rural zone as this zone was approached. Similarity between both urban-core and peripheral points and the rural zone decreased with increasing gradient extension. It appears to be a size threshold for community sensitivity to urbanization below which the impact on community attributes is insignificant; increasing urbanization above the threshold level had pronounced effects on bird assemblages. Research approaches separating responses of native and exotic species to urbanization enhance our understanding to favor native birds and quality of urban bird communities. The size of the urbanized area is a key factor in policies designed to improve ecosystem health and human interactions with nature. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Both density dependent and density independent processes such as climate affect population dynamics in large herbivores. Understanding herbivore foraging patterns is essential to identify the underlying mechanisms behind variation in vital rates. However, very little is known about how animals vary their selection of habitat temporally, alone or in interaction with density during summer. At the foraging scale, we tested using a fully replicated experiment whether domestic sheep Ovis aries stocked at high (80 per km(2)) and low (25 per km(2)) densities (spatial contrasts) varied their habitat selection temporally over a four year period. We predicted reduced selection of high productivity vegetation types with increasing density, and that seasonal and annual variation in climate would affect this density dependent selection pattern by increasing competition for high quality habitats in late grazing season and in years with poor vegetation development and over time related to vegetation responses to grazing. As predicted from the Ideal free distribution model, selection of high productivity habitat decreased at high density. There was also a marked temporal variation in habitat selection. Selection of the most productive vegetation types declined towards the end of each grazing season, but increased over years both at low and high sheep density. There was only weak evidence for interactions, as selection ratio of highly productive habitats tended to increase more over years at low density as compared to high density. Limited interactive effects of density and annual variation on habitat selection during summer may explain why similar interactions in vital rates have rarely been reported for summer seasons. Our results are consistent with the view that variation in habitat selection is a central mechanism for climate and density related variation in vital rates.

AB Genetic variation and environmental heterogeneity fundamentally shape the interactions between plants of the same species. According to the resource partitioning hypothesis, competition between neighbors intensifies as their similarity increases. Such competition may change in response to increasing supplies of limiting resources. We tested the resource partitioning hypothesis in stands of genetically identical (clone-origin) and genetically diverse (seed-origin) Eucalyptus trees with different water and nutrient supplies, using individual-based tree growth models. We found that genetic variation greatly reduced competitive interactions between neighboring trees, supporting the resource partitioning hypothesis. The importance of genetic variation for Eucalyptus growth patterns depended strongly on local stand structure and focal tree size. This suggests that spatial and temporal variation in the strength of species interactions leads to reversals in the growth rank of seed-origin and clone-origin trees. This study is one of the first to experimentally test the resource partitioning hypothesis for intergenotypic vs. intragenotypic interactions in trees. We provide evidence that variation at the level of genes, and not just species, is functionally important for driving individual and community-level processes in forested ecosystems.

AB 1. Population estimates are of fundamental importance for setting conservation priorities and for numerous aspects of conservation biology.
   2. Distance sampling, which takes undetected individuals into account, is one of the most widely used methods for generating population estimates. We use this method to generate estimates of the national population size for all common and widespread non-marine breeding birds in the UK using Breeding Bird Survey data.
   3. There is a strong positive relationship between our distance-sampled estimates and estimates generated using other methods. This implies that most methods get the broad picture right, even if one of them is less precise for individual species.
   4. For some species, detectability may vary sufficiently between males and females to generate biases in population size estimates if these differences are not taken into account. We found a slight tendency for population estimates from distance sampling to be lower than existing estimates for species with marked sex biases in detectability. This may be a wider problem than is currently acknowledged in distance sampling.
   5. Distance sampling provides a method for estimating total population size. Other bird population survey methods, such as intensive territory mapping, aim to count the number of breeding pairs, and thus exclude non-breeding individuals. Not surprisingly, we found that distance-sampled estimates tended to be higher for species with a large proportion of non-breeders. Both approaches are valid, but when calculating, reporting and using population estimates attention needs to be paid to which variable is of most interest.
   6. The new estimates that we present are significantly larger than existing ones for species whose preferred habitat types were not previously well surveyed. This highlights the importance of sampling across all main habitat types.
   7. Synthesis and applications. This study reviews alternative methods used for producing estimates of population size for common and widespread breeding birds in the UK. We assess a number of factors affecting population estimates generated by distance sampling.

AB Altitudinal gradients are expected to heavily influence the general performance of mountain tree species. For this study we evaluated vitality, radial growth and reproductive efficiency in Polylepis australis (Rosaceae) throughout its complete altitudinal range in central Argentina. We selected seven forest fragments ranging from 900 to 2700 m a.s.l. In the field, we subjectively assigned vitality and seed productivity indexes to 12 P. australis trees per fragment. In addition, we cored and assessed for radial growth 10-18 trees per altitudinal level. In the laboratory, we individually weighed seeds from four or five trees from each altitudinal level and divided into two seed mass classes (light and heavy). We then tested for germination and monitored their seedlings for survival. Seedlings of three trees per altitudinal level were harvested after 40 days and assessed for dry mass. Seedlings of one to two trees per altitudinal level were monitored for survival until both leaves and roots had died. Our main results showed two types of responses to altitude: a unimodal relationship with an optimum at intermediate altitudes of around 1800 m a.s.l. for tree vitality, radial growth, seed productivity and seed mass; and an increase with altitude for in-vitro seed germination and seedling survival. A rise in temperature due to climate change could restrict P. australis to the upper most altitudes, where conservation of these forests will be a priority.

AB Worldwide genetic diversity in 200 individuals comprising 41 castor bean accessions was assessed using amplified fragment polymorphisms (AFLPs) and simple sequence repeats (SSRs). We found that, despite surveying five continents and 35 countries, genetic diversity in castor bean germplasm is relatively low (overall H(e) = 0.126 for AFLPs and 0.188 for SSRs) compared to estimates of genetic diversity in other plant species. Our data also show no geographic structuring of genotypes across continents or countries within continents. An assessment of the congruence between AFLP and SSRs indicates a low correlation (R(2) = 0.19) between the two data sets, but each marker class nonetheless shows similar patterns of low-genetic diversity and a lack of geographic structure. Our data do suggest that SSRs yield a higher percentage of polymorphic loci, higher heterozyosity and a greater range of genetic distances, and are therefore more informative than are AFLPs on a locus-by-locus basis. Based on comparisons with numerous other plant species, we suggest that the lower genetic variation in this worldwide collection may be due to one or more factors including: sampling strategies that have not captured the full extent of genetic variation in the species; artifactual variation due to long-term germplasm storage and seed regeneration; or intense selection followed by domestic cultivation of a limited number of castor bean genotypes, which are widely propagated for their horticultural and agro-economic value.

AB The activity and density of generalist predators, such as carabid beetles, rove beetles and spiders, may increase in response to: (1) increased availability of prey from the belowground subsystem and/or (2) enhanced complexity of aboveground vegetation. Organic farming practices support decomposer populations and enhance habitat complexity due to an increased weed density. A response by generalist predators to such below- or aboveground changes could affect predation rates on herbivores in the aboveground food web. We tested this hypothesis in a replicated field experiment conducted in a winter wheat field, where increased predator activity could lead to improved control of herbivorous pests. In a crossed design, we increased and lowered densities of decomposer prey, and manipulated vegetation complexity using artificial plants in order to examine the effect of structural complexity in isolation from effects of plant-attracted additional prey. Isotomid Collembola exhibited lowest activity-densities (AD) in plots treated with soil insecticide and had gradually increasing AD in untreated plots and plots receiving detrital subsidies. Carabid beetles and cursorial spiders did not respond to increased availability of isotomid prey, and they unexpectedly displayed higher AD in the structurally less-complex plots. Aphid density mirrored the positive response of isotomids to detrital subsidies, suggesting that aphids benefited from reduced predation due to predators switching to abundant prey in the decomposer subsystem. The absence of a numerical response by surface-active predators apparently strengthened this indirect effect of isotomids on aphids. Our results suggest that indirect predator-mediated prey-prey interactions can reduce beneficial effects of detrital subsidies on pest suppression. We further demonstrated that generalist predators may not per se benefit from structural complexity. Both results document the challenges associated with management practices that support generalist predators, as these measures may not necessarily improve herbivore suppression.

AB Despite the functional significance of melanin-based plumage coloration in social and sexual signaling, the mechanisms controlling its information content are poorly understood. The T-regulation hypothesis proposes that melanin ornaments signal competitive abilities via the effects of testosterone (T) mediating both melanization and sexual/aggressive behaviors. Using the phylogenetic comparative approach, we tested whether frontal black melanization is associated with elevated T around the time of breeding plumage development across all bird species with available T-data. We found a context-dependent relationship between melanization and T, varying with the type of ornamentation (patchy or full-black) and with the presumed taxonomic distribution of the hormonal control of plumage dichromatism. Within two taxa in which male plumage development is assumed androgen-dependent (Charadriiformes, Corvida), evolutionary increases in male melanization, and melanin dichromatism correlated with increases in T in most analyses but not within the basal lineage (ratites, Galloanseriformes) with androgen-independent male plumage. Among Passeroidea with presumably genetically or luteinizing-hormone-based male plumage, melanization and its dichromatism correlated with T only in species with < 100% frontal melanization. These results were robust as we controlled for several confounding variables such as mating and parental behaviors. This study is the first to test and support the T-regulation hypothesis interspecifically, suggesting that among-species differences in melanization may have evolved in response to differences in circulating T in certain avian taxa. Our results imply that the extent of black ornamentation may serve as an honest indicator of male competitiveness in those species that evolved an appropriate hormonal basis (T dependence) for color production.

AB There is a growing interest in monitoring the gross primary productivity (GPP) of crops due mostly to their carbon sequestration potential. Both within- and between-field variability are important components of crop GPP monitoring, particularly for the estimation of carbon budgets. In this letter, we present a new technique for daytime GPP estimation in maize based,on the close and consistent relationship between GPP and crop chlorophyll content, and entirely on remotely sensed data. A recently proposed chlorophyll index (CI), which involves green and near-infrared spectral bands, was used to retrieve daytime GPP from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data. Because of its high spatial resolution (i.e., 30 x 30 m/pixel), this satellite system is particularly appropriate for detecting not only between- but also within-field GPP variability during the growing season. The CI obtained using atmospherically corrected Landsat ETM+ data was found to be linearly related with daytime maize GPP: root mean squared error of less than 1.58 gC.m(-2).d(-1) in a GPP range of 1.88 to 23.1 gC.m(-2).d(-1); therefore, it constitutes an accurate surrogate measure for GPP estimation. For comparison purposes, other vegetation indices were also tested. These results open new possibilities for analyzing the spatiotemporal variation of the GPP of crops using the extensive archive of Landsat imagery acquired since the early 1980s.

AB The philopatric behaviour of albatrosses has intrigued biologists due to the high mobility of these seabirds. It is unknown how albatrosses maintain a system of fragmented populations without frequent dispersal movements, in spite of the long-term temporal heterogeneity in resource distribution at sea. We used both genetic (amplified fragment length polymorphism) and capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data to identify explicitly which among several models of population dynamics best applies to the wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans) and to test for migration-drift equilibrium. We previously documented an extremely low genetic diversity in this species. Here, we show that populations exhibit little genetic differentiation across the species' range (Theta(B) < 0.05, where Theta(B) is an F-ST analogue). Furthermore, there was no evidence of hierarchical structure or isolation-by-distance. Wright's F-ST between pairs of colonies were low in general and the pattern was consistent with a nonequilibrium genetic model. In contrast, CMR data collected over the last decades indicated that about one bird per cohort has dispersed among islands. Overall, F-ST values were not indicative of contemporary dispersal as inferred from CMR data. Moreover, all genotypes grouped together in a cluster analysis, indicating that current colonies may have derived from one ancestral source that had a low genetic diversity. A metapopulation dynamics model including a recent (postglacial) colonization of several islands seems consistent with both the very low levels of genetic diversity and structure within the wandering albatross. Yet, our data suggest that several other factors including ongoing gene flow, recurrent long-distance dispersal and source-sink dynamics have contributed to different extent in shaping the genetic signature observed in this species. Our results show that an absence of genetic structuring may in itself reveal little about the true population dynamics in seabirds, but can provide insights into important processes when a comparison with other information, such as demographic data, is possible.

AB The cyclic changes of the Pleistocene between cold and warm periods resulted in antagonistic responses within two different groups of organisms: one expanding during the warm periods and retracting during the cold phases and another with opposed responses. The latter group is composed of so-called arctic and alpine species. These species have recently become the focus of phylogeographical research. However, we still lack a comprehensive characterization of the different types of alpine and arctic-alpine disjunctions in the western Palearctic. Such an overview might facilitate the selection of different model species to test the different patterns of disjunctions for congruences revealing their past distribution. Therefore, we list all alpine and arctic-alpine disjunction types of the western Palearctic using butterflies and moths as a model group. We distinguish between (1) endemics of the Alps (alpha) with strongly restricted and (beta) with broader distributions; (2) alpine disjunct species (alpha) with perialpine disjunctions and (beta) with a wide western Palearctic distribution; (3) oro-Mediterranean species; and (4) arctic-alpine disjunct species. These types of distributions and further subtypes are exemplified using chorological data of butterfly and moth species. In this context, we discuss the intraspecific differentiation and the differentiation among sibling-species within and among disjunct parts of the distribution area. We also formulate hypotheses of the distribution patterns during the last ice age which might best explain the actual patterns. Finally, we suggest some case studies of genetic analyses to test the above mentioned hypotheses. (c) 2008 The Linnean Society of London.

AB The association between allelic diversity and ecogeographical variables was studied in natural populations of wild emmer wheat [Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides (Korn.) Thell.], the tetraploid progenitor of cultivated wheat. Patterns of allelic diversity in 54 microsatellite loci were analyzed in a collection of 145 wild emmer wheat accessions representing 25 populations that were sampled across naturally occurring aridity gradient in Israel and surrounding regions. The obtained results revealed that 56% of the genetic variation resided among accessions within populations, while only 44% of the variation resided between populations. An unweighted pair-group method analysis (UPGMA) tree constructed based on the microsatellite allelic diversity divided the 25 populations into six major groups. Several groups were comprised of populations that were collected in ecologically similar but geographically remote habitats. Furthermore, genetic differentiation between populations was independent of the geographical distances. An interesting evolutionary phenomenon is highlighted by the unimodal relationship between allelic diversity and annual rainfall (r = 0.74, P < 0.0002), indicating higher allelic diversity in populations originated from habitats with intermediate environmental stress (i.e. rainfall 350-550 mm year(-1)). These results show for the first time that the 'intermediate-disturbance hypothesis', explaining biological diversity at the ecosystem level, also dominates the genetic diversity within a single species, the lowest hierarchical element of the biological diversity.

AB The 'Movius-Schick hypothesis' claims that an absence of Levallois (Mode 3) technologies in East Asia is due to the lack of a strong ancestral Acheulean (Mode 2) tradition in that region. Hence, this hypothesis is based on the assumption that similarities between Acheulean handaxes and Levallois cores can be interpreted as being phylogenetically homologous (i.e. due to common technological ancestry) as opposed to being homoplasic (i.e. due to convergent technological evolution). Here, the phylogenetic basis of this hypothesis is tested using a formal cladistic procedure. Under the framework of an 'iterative' approach to phylogenetic analysis, a series of post-hoc tests and re-evaluations of results follow the initial cladistic analysis. Results of these combined analyses indicate that morphological similarities between Mode 2 Acheulean handaxes and Mode 3 Levallois cores can, most parsimoniously, be seen as phylogenctically homologous. Hence, these results support the tenets of the 'Movius-Schick' hypothesis in suggesting that a lack of Levallois industries in East Asia may be due to the paucity of an ancestral Acheulean tradition in that region. The implications of these phylogenetic analyses for the concept of Palaeolithic 'Modes' are discussed. It is further suggested that low demographic levels (i.e. small effective population sizes) in East Asia may have constrained the technological phylogenetic trajectory of East Asia compared with that seen in other regions of the Old World during the Lower Palaeolithic. In addition, it is hoped that several methodological issues discussed here will contribute to the growing field of cultural phylogenetic analysis.(c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An increasing awareness of the effects that the spatial scale of source maps may have on landscape analyses has lately prompted much research on this topic. Nevertheless, previous studies have just focused on describing the variations of different landscape metrics with scale, while the scale impact on the actual decision-making and landscape planning derived from connectivity analyses has not yet been tackled. We examined the influence of varying minimum mapping unit (MMU) and spatial extent on the prioritization of patches by their importance for the conservation of overall landscape connectivity, according to 10 different metrics as management support tools. We analyzed the forest patches distribution in three study zones within Spain with diverse spatial configuration from CORINE land cover data. Our results showed that the probability of connectivity, the area-weighted flux and the integral index of connectivity are the most robust metrics in terms of patches prioritization, while the results provided by the number of components, graph diameter and class coincidence probability are strongly scale-dependent. We found that scale sensitivity of the overall landscape metric value is not related to scale sensitivity in terms of patches prioritization. We provide guidelines for an appropriate selection of connectivity metrics and scale of analysis for landscape conservation planning and related applications. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB Aim A major endeavour of community ecology is documenting non-random patterns in the composition and body size of coexisting species, and inferring the processes, or assembly rules, that may have given rise to the observed patterns. Such assembly rules include species sorting resulting from interspecific competition, aggregation at patchily distributed resources, and co-evolutionary dynamics. However, for any given taxon, relatively little is known about how these patterns and processes change through time and vary with habitat type, disturbance history, and spatial scale. Here, we tested for non-random patterns of species co-occurrence and body size in assemblages of ground-foraging ants and asked whether those patterns varied with habitat type, disturbance history, and spatial scale.
   Location Burned and unburned forests and fens in the Siskiyou Mountains of southern Oregon and northern California, USA.
   Methods We describe ground-foraging ant assemblages sampled over two years in two discrete habitat types, namely Darlingtonia fens and upland forests. Half of these sites had been subject to a large-scale, discrete disturbance - a major fire - in the year prior to our first sample. We used null model analyses to compare observed species co-occurrence patterns and body-size distributions in these assemblages with randomly generated assemblages unstructured by competition both within (i.e. at a local spatial scale) and among (i.e. at a regional scale) sites.
   Results At local spatial scales, species co-occurrence patterns and body-size ratios did not differ from randomness. At regional scales, co-occurrence patterns were random or aggregated, and there was evidence for constant body-size ratios of forest ants. Although these patterns varied between habitats and years, they did not differ between burned and unburned sites.
   Main conclusions Our results suggest that the operation of assembly rules depends on spatial scale and habitat type, but that it was not affected by disturbance history from fire.

AB Human-induced changes in land use lead to major changes in plant community composition which have strong effects on ecosystem processes. Here, we tested the hypothesis that changes in traits of living plants induced by such changes resulted in changes in the quality and decay properties of the litter produced by the different communities. This was done in the context of a secondary succession following land abandonment in the Mediterranean region of Southern France.
   During the course of succession, species with high specific leaf area (the ratio of leaf area to leaf mass), low leaf dry matter content (the ratio of leaf dry mass to leaf fresh mass) and high leaf nitrogen concentration were progressively replaced by species with opposite characteristics. Accordingly, the initial litter concentrations of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) decreased, while their C:N ratio and their hemicellulose concentration increased with time after abandonment.
   Early-successional communities had faster rates of litter decay and N release from litter, but these differences damped out with decomposition time. Nitrogen release from litter was related to initial litter chemical composition, particularly to its N concentration. This also held for litter decay rate, but only during the first 18 months of decomposition.
   Community functional parameters (i.e. trait values weighed according to the relative abundance of species) were tightly linked to initial litter N concentration, and thereby to litter decay and N loss rates. The strongest correlations were found with leaf dry matter content, which therefore appears as a powerful marker of litter properties. This provides further evidence that characteristics of living leaves persist in litter, and that some ecosystem processes can be inferred from plant functional traits.

AB Environmental effects of aquaculture loadings have often been reviewed descriptively, and thus have not provided quantitative estimates of the overall response in the water column. Meta-analytical reviewing techniques allow the contextualisation of quantitative effects in the domain of current literature. In the present paper, more than 50 peer-reviewed articles were analysed and about 425 study cases used to test whether worldwide cultivations have a differential effect on dissolved nutrient levels. Meta-analysis feasibility depends on obtaining an estimate of the effect size from every study and the most common measure of effect size (Hedges' d) is the difference between means of controls and impacts standardised by dividing by the pooled standard deviation. Across all study cases, irrespective of cultivation and organism type, the cumulative effect size was large and significant (d > 0.8) for ammonium, nitrite and nitrate, medium (0.8 > d > 0.5) for dissolved phosphorus, and not significant (d < 0.2) for silicates. Effects were mainly correlated with the degree of openness in water bodies, and ammonium and the other nitrogen forms were the most highly informative descriptors of effects in the area surrounding farms, even though weakness in statistical approach was highlighted. The results partially contradict the common view that effects of aquaculture and associated environmental patterns are well defined throughout the current literature. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We studied frog biodiversity along an elevational gradient in the Hengduan Mountains, China. Endemic and non-endemic elevational diversity patterns were examined individually. Competing hypotheses were also tested for these patterns. Species richness of total frogs, endemics and non-endemics peaked at mid-elevations. The peak in endemic species richness was at higher elevations than the maxima of total species richness. Endemic species richness followed the mid-domain model predictions, and showed a nonlinear relationship with temperature. Water and energy were the most important variables in explaining elevational patterns of non-endemic species richness. A suite of interacting climatic and geometric factors best explained total species richness patterns along the elevational gradient. We suggest that the mid-domain effect was an important factor to explain elevational richness patterns, especially in regions with high endemism.

AB The stoichiometric composition of autotrophs can vary greatly in response to variation in light and nutrient availability, and can mediate ecological processes such as C sequestration, growth of herbivores, and nutrient cycling. We investigated light and nutrient effects on phytoplankton stoichiometry, employing five experiments on intact phytoplankton assemblages from three lakes varying in productivity and species composition. Each experiment employed two nutrient and eight irradiance levels in a fully factorial design. Light and nutrients interactively affected phytoplankton stoichiometry. Thus, phytoplankton C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios increased with irradiance, and slopes of the stoichiometric ratio versus irradiance relationships were steeper with ambient nutrients than with nutrients added. Our results support the light-nutrient hypothesis, which predicts that phytoplankton C:nutrient ratios are functions of the ratio of available light and nutrients; however, we observed considerable variation among lakes in the expression of this relationship. Phytoplankton species diversity was positively correlated with the slopes of the C:N and C:P versus irradiance relationships, suggesting that diverse assemblages may exhibit greater flexibility in the response of phytoplankton nutrient stoichiometry to light and nutrients. The interactive nature of light and nutrient effects may render it difficult to generate predictive models of stoichiometric responses to these two factors. Our results point to the need for future studies that examine stoichiometric responses across a wide range of phytoplankton communities.

AB The increasing occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in freshwaters is of great concern due to the ability of many cyanobacteria to produce cyanotoxins. In the present work, the eutrophied Vela Lake (Central Portugal), used for recreational purposes and as a water source for agriculture, was monitored every fortnight between 2000 and 2001. Phytoplankton diversity and densities were measured and correlated to environmental parameters. A seasonal phytoplanktonic succession was observed and it was mainly correlated with conductivity, temperature, total suspended solids and nutrients availability (particularly phosphorus). Diatoms were dominant during winter months (inferior temperatures and higher nutrients availability) followed by green algae in early spring and then cyanobacteria from late spring until early autumn (less nutrient availability and higher temperatures). A massive cyanobacterial bloom of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae occurred early in May 2001 and was preceded by the lowest nitrogen levels measured in the water during all the study period. At the time of this bloom senescence, dissolved oxygen was severely depleted and a massive death of ichthyofauna was recorded. A Microcystis aeruginosa bloom was also detected in July 2001 and it occurred following a rapid decrease in abundance of green algae and diatoms. By considering not only the environmental parameters but also the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms as explanatory variables in a canonical correspondence analysis, the variance explained for the phytoplanktonic assemblage during the study period was increased in about 7% achieving a total of 61.0%, indicating a correlation that may be due to the known competitive advantage and/or allelopathy of the bloom-forming cyanobacteria towards microalgae.

AB The resolution of taxonomic classifications for delphinid cetaceans has been problematic, especially for species in the genera Delphinus, Tursiops and Stenella. The frequent lack of correspondence between morphological and genetic differentiation in these species raises questions about the mechanisms responsible for their evolution. In this study we focus on the genus Delphinus, and use molecular markers to address questions about speciation and the evolution of population structure. Delphinus species have a worldwide distribution and show a high degree of morphological variation. Two distinct morphotypes, long-beaked and short-beaked, have been considered different species named D. capensis and D. delphis, respectively. However, genetic differentiation between these two forms has only been demonstrated in the Pacific. We analysed samples from eight different geographical regions, including two morphologically defined long-beaked form populations, and compared these with the eastern North Pacific populations. We found high differentiation among the populations described as long-beaked instead of the expected monophyly, suggesting that these populations may have evolved from independent events converging on the same morphotype. We observed low genetic differentiation among the short-beaked populations across a large geographical scale. We interpret these phylogeographical patterns in the context of life history and population structure in related species.

AB We studied factors affecting density and spacing patterns in the pine marten Martes martes population inhabiting temperate forests of Bialowieza National Park, eastern Poland. From 1985/1986 to 1995/1996 marten densities ranged from 3.63 to 7.57 individuals 10 km(-2) (mean 5.4) and were positively correlated with abundance of forest rodents in the previous year. The rate of marten population growth was inversely density-dependent and positively related to rodent density. Annual mortality rate averaged 0.384 and tended to be negatively related to marten densities. Mean annual home range of males (2.58 km(2), SE=0.24) was larger than that of females (1.41 km(2), SE=0.20). Seasonal home ranges also differed significantly between males and females. Both sexes held the smallest ranges in December-January. Female ranges increased in April-May, whereas those of males increased in June-September when they were mating. Fidelity of pine martens to their home ranges was very high. The mean shift between arithmetic centres of seasonal ranges was 0.25 km, and the ranges recorded in two consecutive seasons overlapped, on average, by 87-90%. We observed very little home range overlap between neighbouring male (mean 4-6%) or female (mean 6%) marten. Year round the neighbouring individuals of the same sex neither avoided nor attracted each other. Females attracted males only during the spring-summer mating season. A review of other studies has documented that winter severity and seasonal variation in ecosystem productivity were essential factors shaping the biogeographic variation in pine marten densities between 41(o) and 68(o)N. The density of marten populations increased in areas with mild winters and lower seasonality. Maximum population densities (indicative of habitat carrying capacity) were correlated with mean winter temperature. In Europe, male home ranges increased with decreasing forest cover in a study area, whereas female ranges varied positively with rodent abundance.

AB 1 We used the forest succession model FORCLIM simulate Holocene treeline dynamics along an elevational transect in the Central European Alps, in order to explore the extent and cause of changes in treeline altitude and composition.
   2 A temperature reconstruction independent of vegetation proxies was used to drive the model, and the simulation results were compared with Holocene pollen and macrofossil records from a nearby site close to the present-day treeline.
   3 The simulation results yielded treeline fluctuations of about +/- 100 m (2375-2600 m a.s.l.), confirming earlier palaeoecological studies and quantitatively corroborating the interpretation of most palaeoecologists that decadal- to centennial-scale Holocene fluctuations of pollen and plant macrofossil frequencies reflect treeline shifts rather than productivity changes alone.
   4 The simulated changes in species composition and treeline position show general agreement with palaeobotanical data between 11 000 and 4500 calibrated radiocarbon years BP. In the late Holocene, however, palaeobotanical evidence indicates a distinct lowering of the treeline, while simulation projected continuous forest cover up to an altitude of 2400 m a.s.l.
   5 Our results indicate that changes in temperature alone can account for changes in treeline elevation for the first half of the Holocene. The discrepancy between simulation results and palaeobotanical records since 4500 cal. BP supports the hypothesis of a strong human influence on the Alpine treeline during the late Holocene.
   6 Combining palaeoecological methods with vegetation modelling can disentangle climatic effects and early human impacts on long-term vegetation dynamics. Forest succession models may not only help palaeoecologists to achieve a better understanding of the factors driving past vegetation changes, but their validation with long-term empirical data is also an important step towards applying these models to the assessment of future vegetation dynamics in a changing climate.

AB 1. A major hypothesis of life history theory is that early development conditions affect future survival and reproductive success. However, although a growing number of studies have addressed this question, many of them are taxonomically biased, thereby impeding the generalization of this hypothesis.
   2. This study examines the factors influencing post-weaning survival in five weaned cohorts of subantarctic fur seal pups from Amsterdam Island, southern Indian Ocean. It used mark-recapture data from 7 consecutive years of different environmental conditions.
   3. The cohort return rate varied from 45% to 74% of weaned pups, depending on the year of weaning. In each cohort, 96% of weaned pups returned between 3 and 6 years of age, and none of the factors examined seemed to influence this timing pattern. The probability of survival to this first return was negatively related to sea-surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) of the 6 months following the weaning process. It increased with pup preweaning growth rate and differed between the sexes. Females' survival rate was significantly higher than males', except during years of extreme SSTa, where no difference was detected.
   4. The juvenile state represented young individuals after their first return on their native island. Annual juvenile tag loss rate was constant at 0.217 (SE = 0.027), whereas temporary emigration rate varied over cohorts and was higher in males 0.423 (SE = 0.035) than in females 0.170 (SE = 0.012). This dispersion pattern may be prolonged in some cases, as the yearly immigration probability was constant at 0.290 (SE = 0.065).
   5. Taking into account tag loss and temporary emigration, the estimated yearly survival probability of juveniles was 0.964 (SE = 0.022). This value was unrelated to any tested oceanographic or individual parameter including sex.
   6. Results support the hypothesis that early development traits affect short-term post-weaning survival. However, no long-term effect of maternal postnatal investment was detected after the first return to the native island. Results also indicate that the effect of early development traits on survival interacts with environmental conditions encountered shortly after independence of individuals.

AB We examined light as a niche partitioning factor between the late-successional European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and the mid-successional downy oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.), two dominant species in the sub-Mediterranean area of southern France. For these species we estimated sapling growth models (in radius and in height) as a function of light availability. Beech had a higher growth in low light and a higher asymptotic growth rate than oak. We estimated species-specific growth-mortality functions. Beech showed a higher tolerance to slow growth than oak. By linking light-growth functions and growth-mortality functions, we found that beech had a lower mortality at low light than oak. Beech saplings had a higher probability of survival than oak at low and at high light levels. Beech exhibited the highest plasticity of morphological traits (i.e., biomass allocation, leaf morphology, and architectural traits) as a function of light. Since beech has higher growth and survival than oak at variable light regimes, we conclude that niche partitioning for light cannot explain the coexistence of these two species. We propose that disturbance and water stress should be explicitly taken into account to understand niche partitioning and succession in the sub-Mediterranean area.

AB A theory of spatial structure in ecological communities is presented and tested. At the core of the theory is a simple allocation rule for the assembly of species in space. The theory leads, with no adjustable parameters, to nonrandorn statistical predictions for the spatial distribution of species at multiple spatial scales. The distributions are such that the abundance of a species at the largest measured scale uniquely determines the spatial-abundance distribution of the individuals of that species at smaller spatial scales. The shape of the species-area relationship, the endemics-area relationship, a scale-dependent community-level spatial-abundance distribution, the species-abundance distribution at small spatial scales, an index of intraspecific aggregation, the range-area relationship, and the dependence of species turnover on interpatch distance and on patch size are also uniquely predicted as a function solely of the list of abundances of the species at the largest spatial scale. We show that the spatial structure of three spatially explicit vegetation census data sets (i.e., a 64-m(2) serpentine grassland plot, a 50-ha moist. tropical forest plot, and a 9.68-ha dry tropical forest plot) are generally consistent with the predictions of the theory, despite the very simple statistical assumption upon which the theory is based, and the absence of adjustable parameters. However, deviations between predicted and observed distributions do arise for the species with the highest abundances; the pattern of those deviations indicates that the theory, which currently contains no explicit description of interaction mechanisms among individuals within species, could be improved with the incorporation of intraspecific density dependence.

AB In Swedish boreal forests, areas dominated by the dwarf shrub Empetrum hermaphroditum Hagerup are known for their poor regeneration of trees and one of the causes of this poor regeneration has been attributed to allelopathy (i.e. chemical interferences) by E. hermaphroditum. Fire-produced charcoal is suggested to play an important role in rejuvenating those ecosystems by adsorbing allelopathic compounds, such as phenols, released by E. hermaphroditum. In this study, we firstly investigated whether the adsorption capacity of charcoal of different plant species varies according to the wood anatomical structures of these, and secondly we tried to relate the adsorption capacity to wood anatomical structure. Charcoal was produced from eight boreal and one temperate woody plant species and the adsorption capacity of charcoal was tested by bioassays technique. Seed germination was used as a measurement of the ability of charcoal to adsorb allelochemicals. The charcoal porosity was estimated and the pore size distribution was then calculated in order to relate the wood anatomical features to the adsorption capacity. The results showed that the adsorption capacity of charcoal was significantly different between plant species and that deciduous trees had a significantly higher adsorption capacity than conifers and ericaceous species. The presence of macro-pores rather than a high porosity appears to be the most important for the adsorption capacity. These results suggest that fire-produced charcoal has different ability to adsorb phenols in boreal forest soil, and therefore may have differing effects on the germination of seeds of establishing tree seedlings.

AB Butler (2003) used first arrival dates (FADs) of 103 migrant birds in northeastern USA and found that both long-distance migrants (LDMs; wintering south of the USA) and short-distance migrants (SDMs; wintering in the southern USA) arrived earlier in the second half of the 20th century than they had in the first, consistent with scenarios of global warming; the trend was stronger in SDMs. Using FADs to characterize migration systems can be problematic because they are data from one tail of a distribution, they comprise a mostly male population and they may not correlate well with the balance of the migration period. FADs also provide no information about autumn migration. This paper uses a banding dataset from Long Point Bird Observatory, Ontario, for 14 passerines for a period of global warming (1975-2000), taking these issues into account. The data were filtered to minimize effects of unequal netting effort (147 491 resulting records), and the passage dates then calculated in each season of each year for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd quartiles for regression analysis. Only two of 13 species analysed in the spring showed significantly earlier passage times, although the overall trend was towards earlier spring migration, especially among SDMs. Autumn responses were more prevalent, however, and in some cases more dramatic with six of 13 species showing delayed migration (four SDMs, two LDMs). Two LDMs exhibited earlier autumn migration. Where earlier spring migration occurred, both sexes appeared to contribute to the change. Where delayed migration occurred in autumn, both sexes and both adults and hatch-year birds appeared to contribute in at least some cases. The spring FAD results are consistent with those of Butler, but when the whole migration is considered, change is far from universal in spring and is in fact more substantial and complex in autumn.

AB Here we investigate the relationships between modern planktonic foraminiferal species assemblages from Atlantic and Pacific core-top sediment samples and 35 water-column and preservation properties using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). CCA finds two faunal dimensions (axes) that are most highly correlated to the environmental variables, and describes each axis in terms of the best linear combination of environmental variables. CCA Axis 1 (30.4% of the faunal variance) is related primarily to mean annual sea-surface temperature (SST, r = -0.96). CCA Axis 2 (7.9% of the faunal variance) is related to environmental variability associated with an inverse relationship between SST and surface salinity, as well as pycnocline phosphate concentrations, the seasonal range in nitrate concentrations, water depth, and chlorophyll concentrations at the sea surface. Based on this clustering of nutrient and chlorophyll on Axis 2, we infer an ecological response to oceanic fertility. No evidence is found for a unique dissolution influence, suggesting that sea-floor carbonate ion concentration cannot be estimated reliably from planktonic foraminiferal assemblages.
   Our results support the use of foraminiferal assemblages to estimate mean annual SST. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Simple light use efficiency (epsilon) models of net primary production (NPP) have recently been given great attention (NPP = epsilon x absorbed photosynthetically active radiation). The underlying relationships have, however, not been much studied on a time step less than a month. In this study daily NPP was estimated as the sum of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and heterotrophic respiration (R-h) of a mixed pine and spruce forest in Sweden. NEE was measured by eddy correlation technique and R-h was estimated from measurements of forest floor respiration (R-f) and the root share of R-f. The total yearly NPP was on average 810 g C m(-2) year(-1) for 3 years and yearly epsilon was between 0.58 and 0.71 g C MJ(-1), which is high in comparison with other studies. There was a seasonal trend in epsilon with a relatively constant level of approximately 0.90 g C MJ(-1) from April to September Daily NPP did not increase for daily intercepted radiation above 6 MJ m(-2) d(-1), indicating that between-years variation in NPP is not directly dependent on total Q(i). The light was most efficiently used at an average daytime temperature of around 15 degreesC. At daytime vapour pressure deficit above 1400 Pa epsilon was reduced by approximately 50%.

AB The overlap of large carnivores, livestock and people can engender conflicts that often threaten the future viability of carnivore populations in the pastoral systems of Africa. A playback survey of lions Panthera leo, spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta and black-backed jackals Canis mesomelas and a transect count of wild herbivores was conducted in the Maasai Mara National Reserve and adjoining pastoral ranches to assess the effect of pastoralism and protection on the density and distribution of carnivores in June 2003. Reliability of the prey counts depended on an assumption of similar observability between the protected and pastoral areas, which we assessed using distance sampling in November 2003 and computer simulations and determined to be similar. Estimates of wild prey biomass density was 2.6 times higher in the ranches (14212 kg/km(2)) than in the reserve (5472 kg/km(2)) during this wet season count. Apparent hyena density estimates were 1.3 times higher in the ranches (0.561 hyenas/km(2)) than in the reserve (0.404 hyenas/km(2)), in correspondence with the regional pattern of prey density. This distribution of hyenas is biased towards the reserve, if it is dependent on prey density. Estimates of apparent jackal density were similar in both areas whereas lion density was anomalously 8.0 times lower in the ranches (0.046 lions/km(2)) than in the reserve (0.369 lions/km(2)). Lion and hyena densities and prey biomass did not differ between June 1991 (5172.273 kg/km(2)) and June 2003 (5472 kg/km(2)) in the reserve, but jackal density increased in the same period. Lions never responded to playbacks in the ranches, so the potential shift in lion behavioural response for different land use zones is another potential explanation for the patterns found here. We think a real shift in lion populations is a better explanation than a behavioural change in relation to playbacks based on additional data from independent systematic and intensive censuses and playback surveys conducted in the ranches. Lion populations in the pastoral ranches seemed headed for extinction, probably owing to conflicts with pastoralism, necessitating urgent conservation interventions that integrate pastoral economic welfare with large carnivore conservation goals to foster long-term viability of lion populations in the pastoral systems.

AB Urban areas have been considered "safe zones" for nesting birds because of low abundance of predators, and consequently low predation pressure. We studied risk of artificial ground nest predation across an urban gradient at regional (100 x 100 km) and local scales (5 x 5 km, within town) in Finland, Italy, and Spain. Risk of nest predation differed between countries, being greatest in Spain (66%), intermediate in Finland (51%), and lowest in Italy (29%). At the regional scale, risk of nest predation in Finland was lower in small villages and in forest area than in more urbanized sites. In Spain, the risk of nest predation was lower in villages than in the other habitat types. No differences in nest predation risk among habitat types were observed in Italy. At the local level, the risk of nest predation in Finland was higher within the town than in the surrounding forest. In Spain, the risk of nest predation in the surrounding forest area was as high as in the most urbanized areas. No difference in nest predation risk was observed between study plots in Italy at the local level analysis. Our results indicate that nest predation in town centers and their residential areas is similar to or higher than in villages and forest areas refuting the safe nesting zone hypothesis. Risk of nest predation also differed between residential area types within towns. Moreover, the abundance of potential nest predators differed between countries. Magpies and crows were more abundant in Finland than in Italy and Spain, whereas cats, dogs and pedestrians were less abundant in Finland than in the other countries. In Finland, risk of nest predation increased with the abundance of magpies. In Italy and Spain, risk of nest predation increased with the number of pedestrians and in Italy also with the number of cats. In all countries, the risk of nest predation increased with the visibility of the nest. According to our results, urban areas cannot be seen as "safe nesting zones". Actually, changes in nest predation pressure may cause changes in habitat selection patterns and affect bird community structure in urban environments.

AB A database of benthonic foraminiferal data from 298 sediment surface-samples from the northwest European (Ireland to Svalbard) and Iceland margin has been compiled. Samples deeper than 500 m on the continental slope and shallower than 30 m in coastal areas are not included. Bottom-water temperatures at the sites range between -1 and 12.5 degreesC and salinity between 33.5 and 35.5parts per thousand. Detrended correspondence analyses of percentage values of 65 benthonic foraminifera taxa, from 260 of the samples show a strong, statistically significant relationship between modem foraminiferal assemblages and summer temperature and salinity. Utilising weighted averaging partial least square regression, transfer functions for summer bottom-water temperature (T-s) and salinity (S-s) have been developed. The transfer functions have relatively low root-mean-square errors of prediction (expressed as a percentage of the range of the modem environmental gradient sampled)-for T-s, 3.9%, and for S-s, 9.02%-compared to transfer functions developed for other proxies, which commonly range from 8% to 20%. The distributions of benthonic foraminifera species are dependent on other factors than salinity and temperature such as nutrients, substrate, turbidity, current regime, different biological factors, different depth-related factors, etc. The present analyses demonstrate that for this group as for most other groups, there is an overall, but not necessarily direct, relationship with distribution and abundance and temperature and salinity conditions. The transfer functions have been tested on a late glacial-Holocene data set and an Eemian-Early Weichselian data set from the eastern North Sea region. These experiments suggest that transfer functions on benthonic foraminifera can be a useful new tool in palaeoceanographic and palaeoenvironmental work along the European North Atlantic seaboard.

AB A wildfire area in a boreal forest landscape dominated by Pinus sylvestris L., in the Vienansalo wilderness area in eastern Fennoscandia, was examined for its spatial characteristics and fire history. The boundaries of the 360-ha fire that occurred in 1969 were mapped, and the vegetation types of burnt and unburnt areas were inventoried. Fire history was investigated in 40 study plots, and fire scars, tree ages, and charcoal in peat or soil were used for evidence of past fires. The complex shape of the 1969 fire and the detected small-scale variation in past fire frequencies were concordant with the existing small-scale variation in site moisture and vegetation characteristics in the area. Moist depressions, swamps, and more fertile forest patches dominated by Picea abies (L.) Karst. often did not burn when the nearby dryish forest type did. There was also temporal variability in fire frequency. An abrupt increase in the number of fires occurred in the late 17th century. In the mid-19th century, both the number of fires and the annually burnt area in the region decreased. Our results show that in the examined wildfire area, there has been considerable and consistent small-scale spatial variation in fire frequency and that historical fire regime evidently has been strongly affected by human activity.

AB Many studies have demonstrated the adaptive advantage of elaborate secondary sexual traits, but few if any have shown compelling evidence for the limits to the elaboration of these traits that must exist. We describe such evidence in the exaggerated mandibles of stag beetles. In 1932, Huxley showed that the slope of the allometric relationship between mandible length and body size in some stag beetles declines in the largest males. We show that this curvature is most pronounced in species with relatively long mandibles, consistent with the hypothesis that the decrease in slope is caused by the increasing costs of large mandibles, which ultimately limit their size. Increasing depletion of resources in the prepupa and pupa by the rapidly growing mandibles is the most likely way in which these costs are manifested. The curved allometries have two components: intraspecific mandible allometry is steepest among small males of the species with the longest mandibles, but shallowest among the largest males of those same species. These patterns suggest that selection continues to favour positive allometry in species that invest relatively more in weaponry despite the limits to mandible exaggeration being reached in the largest males.

AB Few ecosystem restoration studies evaluate whether arthropods are important components of ecosystem recovery. We tested the hypothesis that ponderosa pine restoration treatments would increase adult butterfly species richness and abundance as a direct result of increased understory diversity and abundance. To examine mechanisms that potentially affect adult butterfly distribution, we quantified host plant frequency, nectar plant abundance, and insolation (light intensity) in restoration treatment and control forests. This study is unique, because this is the first invertebrate monitoring in ponderosa pine forest restoration treatments in the U.S. Southwest and also because these treatments are the first replicated ponderosa pine restoration treatments at a landscape scale. Three patterns emerged: (1) butterfly species richness and abundance were 2 and 3 times greater, respectively, in restoration treatment units than in paired control forests 1 year after treatment, and 1.5 and 3.5 times greater, respectively, 2 years after treatment, ordination of control and treatment sampling units using butterfly assemblages showed significant separation of control and restoration treatment units after restoration treatment; (2) host plant and nectar plant species richness showed little difference between treated and control forests even 2 years after treatment; and (3) insolation (light intensity) was significantly greater in treated forests after restoration. We suggest that changes in the butterfly assemblage may occur due to light intensity effects before plant community changes occur or can be detected. Butterfly assemblage differences will have additional cascading effects on the ecosystem as prey for higher trophic levels and through plant interactions including herbivory and pollination.

AB Understanding what causes the decreasing abundance of species at the margins of their distributions along environmental gradients has drawn considerable interest, especially because of the recent need to predict shifts in species distribution patterns in response to climatic changes. Here, we address the ecological range limit problem by focusing on the sedge, Carex curvula, a dominant plant of high-elevation grasslands in Europe, for which two ecologically differentiated but crosscompatible taxa have been described in the Alps. Our study heuristically combines an extensive phytoecological survey of alpine plant communities to set the niche attributes of each taxon and a population genetic study to assess the multilocus genotypes of 177 individuals sampled in typical and marginal habitats. We found that ecological variation strongly correlates with genetic differentiation. Our data strongly suggest that ecologically marginal populations of each taxon are mainly composed of individuals with genotypes resulting from introgressive hybridization. Conversely, no hybrids were found in typical habitats, even though the two taxa were close enough to crossbreed. Thus, our results indicate that genotype integrity is maintained in optimal habitats, whereas introgressed individuals are favored in marginal habitats. We conclude that gene flow between closely related taxa might be an important, although underestimated, mechanism shaping species distribution along gradients.

AB Often there are significant positive interspecific relationships between leaf area per unit dry mass (SLA) and foliar phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations ([P] and [N]). Most of these studies have been conducted on moderately acidic soils, and little is known of the generality of these relations as potentially affected by soil characteristics. We investigated foliage mineral composition in relation to leaf structure in a wooded meadow on calcareous alkaline soil, in a bog on strongly acidic soil, and in a flood plain on moderately acidic soil. Foliar nutrient contents and fertilization experiments indicated that foliage physiological activity was co-limited by both P and N availabilities in the wooded meadow, by P in the bog. and by N in the flood plain. In the wooded meadow and in the bog, there were positive relationships between SLA and P concentration ([P]), and no relationship between SLA and nitrogen concentration [N]. Given that the fraction of support tissues generally increases with decreasing SLA, the requirement for mineral nutrients is lower at low SLA. Thus, these contrasting relations between mineral nutrients and SLA suggest that P was distributed in a more "optimal" manner among the leaves with varying structure than N in P-limited communities. In the flood plain, SLA was positively related to both [P] and [N], possibly manifesting a strategy to cope with N limitations by enhancing N turnover, and accordingly, greater P requirement for nucleic acid formation in N-limited soils. Total variation in foliar structural and chemical characteristics was similar in all sites, and was mainly determined by variation among the species. Part of this variability was explained by life form and plant size. [P] was higher in trees than in shrubs, and [P] and P/N ratio increased with increasing total plant height, indicating that P nutrition was improved relative to N nutrition with increasing plant size. Since the capture of less mobile soil elements such as P is dependent on extensive root systems, but not that of readily mobile and temporarily variable elements such as N, this correlation was attributed to more extensive root systems in larger plants. Our study indicates that foliar structure vs. [N] and [P] relations may be separately regulated, but also that the generality of leaf structure vs. nutrient content relations may vary depending on soil conditions.

AB Little is known concerning the fine-scale diversity, population structure, and biogeography for Symbiodinium spp. populations inhabiting particular invertebrate species, including the gorgonian corals, which are prevalent members of reef communities in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and the western Atlantic. This study examined the Symbiodinium sp. clade B symbionts hosted by the Caribbean gorgonian Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae (Bayer). A total of 575 colonies of P. elisabethae were sampled in 1995 and 1998-2000 from 12 populations lying along an similar to450 km transect in the Bahamas and their Symbiodinium sp. clade B symbionts genotyped at two polymorphic dinucleotide microsatellite loci. Twenty-three unique, two-locus genotypes were identified in association with these P. elisabethae colonies. Most colonies hosted only a single Symbiodinium sp. clade B genotype; however, in some instances (n=25), two genotypes were harbored simultaneously. For 10 of the 12 populations, 66-100% of the P. elisabethae colonies hosted the same symbiont genotype. Added to this, in 9 of the 12 populations, a Symbiodinium sp. clade B genotype was either unique to a population or found infrequently in other populations. This distribution of Symbiodinium sp. clade B genotypes resulted in statistically significant (P<0.05 or <0.001) differentiation in 62 of 66 pairwise comparisons of P. elisabethae populations. Tests of linkage disequilibrium suggested that a combination of clonal propagation of the haploid phase and recombination is responsible for maintaining these distinct Symbiodinium sp. clade B populations.

AB The net primary productivity (NPP) of a plant community is often positively and linearly related to the amount of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by its canopy (APAR). The slope of this relationship is governed by the efficiency (epsilon) of APAR use in biomass production (NPP = APAR x epsilon). This intuitive model offers a promising means of generating large-scale NPP estimates, but its utility is compromised by our inability to explain considerable differences in epsilon across species, functional groups, and environments. Using data from the literature, we examined the possibility, that variation in epsilon was governed largely by two chemical and morphological characteristics of the vegetation, canopy nitrogen content (N-canopy) and the canopy average for leaf mass per unit area (M-area). Specifically, we hypothesized that epsilon was positively related to the quotient Of Ncanopy (adjusted for the fraction of incident PAR absorbed by the canopy,f(PAR)) and M-area. This epsilon index accounts for the dependence of light utilization on the quantity of photosynthetic "machinery" (N-canopy) and its inherent efficiency, which is inversely related to M-area. Across a wide array of C-3 species, functional groups and environments, epsilon (based on aboveground NPP) was strongly and positively related to [N-canopy/f(PAR)]/M-area (r(2) = 0.85, P < 0.0001). Adoption of the index as a basis for estimating epsilon could improve APAR-based predictions of terrestrial NPP, agricultural crop yield and vegetation responses to global change.

AB A major goal of insect community ecology is to understand how and why herbivorous insect species vary in the diversity of their parasitoid assemblages and the rates of parasitism that they experience. Most studies investigating these issues with Lepidoptera as hosts have relied on literature records of parasitoid-host associations that are. often of limited quality and that do not necessarily reflect local interactions between hosts and parasitoids. We sampled externally feeding Lepidoptera in mesquite-oak savanna habitats of southeastern Arizona (USA) to assess the ecological and evolutionary determinants of parasitoid community structure. We focused on parasitoids in the family Tachinidae (Diptera) due to their dominance as larval parasitoids of macrolepidoptera at our site. Host abundance, morphology, coloration, gregariousness, and diet breadth of the host were all significantly correlated with tachinid species richness among hosts. Tachinid species richness also varied according to host taxonomy (family), but most of this variation appeared to be better explained by morphology and ecology than by phylogenetic position. Characteristics of host habitat and body size had no significant effect on tachinid species richness. Tachinid parasitism rates were higher for abundant, hairy, non-aposematic, and gregarious hosts. Hymenopteran parasitism rates were low and Variable with, only host family explaining a significant amount of variation. In general, we found that a substantial amount of the variation in tachinid species richness and parasitism rates among hosts can be,explained by ecological attributes, and that interactions of host species with their host plants and predators may determine their suitability as hosts for parasitoids.

AB The spread of nonindigenous species (NIS) in aquatic ecosystems provides an opportunity to develop new perspectives on the invasion process. In this paper we review existing invasion models, most of which were developed to describe invasions of terrestrial habitats, and propose an alternative that explores long-distance invasions mediated by discharge of contaminated ballast water by ships inbound to the Great Lakes. Based on current knowledge of shipping traffic to the Great Lakes, our model predicts that mid-ocean exchange of ballast water lowers propagule delivery by approximately three to four orders of magnitude relative to unexchanged ballast water. Propagule pressure of individual ships that enter the Great Lakes loaded with cargo and that declare "no ballast on board" (NOBOB) is typically one to two orders of magnitude higher than that of vessels that exchange ballast. Because NOBOB vessels dominate (similar to90%) inbound traffic into the Great Lakes, these vessels collectively appear to pose the greatest risk of new introductions, even though their individual risks are low.

ID PAST; SALINITY; LAKES
AB Epipelic diatom assemblages collected from three wetlands connected to the Murray River displayed considerable variation in response to flooding and drying phases. Murray River water input usually generated diatom assemblages dominated by Aulacoseira species. After isolation, the diatom flora of two wetlands shifted to assemblages of small Fragilariaceae forms. Elevated nutrient levels corresponded with the appearance of eutraphentic taxa such as Cyclotella meneghiniana, Eolimna subminuscula, Luticola mutica and Nitzschia palea. Further evapoconcentration induced shifts to taxa tolerant of elevated salinity levels including Amphora coffeaeformis, Navicula incertata, Staurophora salina and Tryblionella hungarica. Ordination analyses reveal a strong chemical control on the diatom taxa present in the wetlands, in accordance with known ecological preferences for salinity and nutrients. The influence of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in controlling diatom assemblages was subordinate to salinity once conductivity values exceeded 1400 muS cm(-1). The results of such biomonitoring provide a means of interpreting wetland history from fossil assemblages contained in sediment sequences.

AB Constrained principal component analysis (CPCA) incorporates external information into principal component analysis (PCA) of a data matrix. CPCA first decomposes the data matrix according to the external information (external analysis), and then applies PCA to decomposed matrices (internal analysis). The external analysis amounts to projections of the data matrix onto the spaces spanned by matrices of external information, while the internal analysis involves the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD). Since its original proposal, CPCA has evolved both conceptually and methodologically; it is now founded on firmer mathematical ground, allows a greater variety of decompositions, and includes a wider range of interesting special cases. In this paper we present a comprehensive theory and various extensions of CPCA, which were not fully envisioned in the original paper. The new developments we discuss include least squares (LS) estimation under possibly singular metric matrices, two useful theorems concerning GSVD, decompositions of data matrices into finer components., and fitting higher-order structures. We also discuss four special cases of CPCA; 1) CCA (canonical correspondence analysis) and CALC (canonical analysis with linear constraints), 2) GMANOVA (generalized MANOVA), 3) Lagrange's theorem, and 4) CANO (canonical correlation analysis) and related methods. We conclude with brief remarks on advantages and disadvantages of CPCA relative to other competitors.

AB We examined epiphytic macrolichen communities in Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir) forests across the western Oregon landscape for relationships to environmental gradients, stand age and structure, and commercial thinning. We used a retrospective. blocked design through the Coast and the western Cascade ranges of Oregon. Each of our 17 blocks consisted of a young. unthinned stand (age 50-110 yr); an adjacent, thinned stand of equivalent age, and an old-growth stand (age > 200 vr). We found 110 epiphytic macrolichen taxa in the stands. Forage-providing alectorioid lichens and the nitrogen-fixing cyanolichen Lobaria oregana associated strongly with old-growth stands and remnant old trees in younger stands (unthinned + thinned). Relative to unthinned stands, thinned stands had a slightly higher abundance of alectorioid lichens and a greater presence of Hypogymnia imshaugii, However, thinned stands hosted a lower landscape-level (gamma) diversity, lacking many species that Occurred infrequently in the unthinned stands. Patterns in the lichen community composition correlated strongly with climatic gradients; the greatest variation in composition was between the Coast and Cascade ranges. The difference in communities between mountain ranges was greatest among stands 70-110 yr old, suggesting a difference in lichen successional dynamics between the ranges.

AB Mating pattern and gene flow were studied in the contact zone between two morphologically very similar Chiffchaff taxa (Phylloscopus collybita, P. brehmii) in SW France and northern Spain. Mating was assortative in brehmii, but not in collybita. Mixed matings were strongly asymmetric (excess of callybita male x brehmii female pairs), but did produce viable offspring in some cases. Sequence divergence of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene was 4.6%; Haplotypes segregated significantly with phenotype (only five 'mismatches' among 94 individuals), demonstrating that mitochondrial gene flow was very restricted. The estimated proportion of F-1 hybrids in the reproductive population was significantly lower than expected under a closed population model, indicating strong selection against hybrids. Genetic typing of 101 individuals at four microsatellite loci also showed significant population differentiation, but nuclear gene flow was estimated to be 75 times higher than mitochondrial gene flow. This strong discrepancy is probably due to unisexual hybrid sterility (Haldane's rule). Thus, there is a strong, but incomplete, reproductive barrier between these taxa.

AB The organic walled cyst content of 41 surface sediment samples from the south-eastern South Atlantic Ocean have been studied to create a dataset that can be used for palaeoceanographic reconstructions. In order to obtain insight into which environmental factors influence the distribution of individual cyst species, the cyst associations have been compared with oceanographic characteristics of the overlying water masses, i.e. temperature, salinity, density and stratification gradients. The associations and relationships have been established by Visual examination of the dataset and the multivariate ordination techniques, Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Special attention has been given to the factors of transport and preservation of the cysts. Five associations have been recognised as being characteristic of (1) areas influenced by coastal upwelling and/or river outflow, (2) open ocean, (3) Agulhas Current and southern Benguela Current, (4) Benguela Current and (5) Walvis Bay, shelf break area. The factors dominant in influencing either directly or indirectly the cyst distributions appear to be the stratification in the upper 50 m of the water column, nutrient concentration and seasonality. Variations in sea surface temperatures and salinities have only minor effect on cyst distribution. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Polymorphism at five microsatellite loci were screened to determine the genetic variability and the temporal stability of population structure in natural populations of European hake (Merluccius merluccius, L.) within the Bay of Biscay. In addition, the control region (900 bp) and two protein coding genes (ATPase, subunits 6 and 8, 842 bp and a partial sequence of the ND1, 800 bp) of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were sequenced from geographically distant populations from the extremes of the species range. One hundred individuals from either side of a supposed stock boundary within the bay were collected in autumn 1997. This sampling strategy was repeated during hake spawning seasons in late spring of 1998 and 1999. Low levels of population subdivision were found between putative populations within years. Similarly, low levels of differentiation were found between autumn 1997 northern samples and spring 1998 southern samples which were collected 7 months later on spawning grounds. These results are discussed in relation to ecological, behavioural and oceanographic information. Sampling effects, which may influence these results, are also discussed. Theta (theta) estimates were significantly different from zero in every other pairwise comparison between geographical areas (north and south of the Bay of Biscay) and between years within the same area (P < 0.05). Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) does not confirm the temporal persistence of population structure. These results are discussed in relation to variance in reproductive success, and temporal spawning patterns, which. may exist within the bay. mtDNA variability was very low between geographically distant samples from Norway and the Mediterranean Sea with only 10 variable sites found in a total of 2542 bp of mtDNA, these differences being exclusively in the D-loop.

AB In tropical moist forests, length of the dry period may have a profound influence on leaf dynamics, plant growth and survival. To evaluate the role of light and water availability oil seedling performance, a 1-y experiment was carried out in a tropical moist forest in the Bolivian Amazon in which seedlings of three tree species (Brosimum lactescens, Cedrela odorata and Schizolobium amazonicum) were planted in gaps and the understorey. Variation in length of the dry period was simulated by subjecting part of the seedlings to a water treatment at the end of the dry period. Gaps and understorey had a similar soil moisture content which varied between 39% in the wet season and 16% in the dry season. Height and leaf growth rates were higher in gap compared to understorey plants, and in the wet compared to the dry season. A high growth during the wet season provided gap plants with a decisive size advantage over understorey plants during the dry season. Their larger root system allowed gap plants to explore a larger surface area and deeper soil layers for water. Consequently, gap plants of Cedrela experienced a shorter deciduous period (22 d) compared to understorey plants (61 d). Watering at the end of the dry season cued the flushing of new leaves by Cedrela, although it did not lead to a higher plant growth.

AB Earlier models on the evolution of dispersal have suggested that evolutionarily stable dispersal rates should increase with the frequency of local extinctions. Most metapopulation models assume site saturation (i.e., no local population dynamics), yet the majority of species distributed as metapopulations rarely attain carrying capacity in all occupied patches. In this article, we relax this assumption and examine the evolutionarily stable dispersal rate under nonsaturated but still competitive demographic conditions. Contrary to previous predictions, we show that increasing local extinction rates may allow decreasing dispersal rates to evolve.

AB Food microbiologists generally use continuous sigmoidal functions such as the empirical Gompertz equation to obtain the kinetic parameters specific growth rate (mu) and lag phase duration (lambda) from bacterial growth curves. This approach yields reliable information on mu; however, values for have difficult to determine accurately due, in part, to our poor understanding of the physiological events taking place during adaptation of cells to new environments. Existing models also assume a homogeneous population of cells, thus there is a need to develop discrete event models which can account for the behavior of individual cells. Time to detection (t(d)) values were determined for Listeria monocytogenes using an automated turbidimetric instrument. and used to calculate mu. Mean individual cell lag times (t(L)) were calculated as the difference between the observed t(d) and the theoretical value estimated using mu. Variability in t(L) for individual cells in replicate wells was estimated using serial dilutions. A discrete stochastic model was applied to the individual cells, and combined with a deterministic population-level growth model. This discrete-continuous model incorporating t(L) and the variability in t(L) (expressed as standard deviation; S.D.(L)) predicted a reduced variability between wells with increased number of cells per well, in agreement with experimental findings. By combining the discrete adaptation step with a continuous growth function it was possible to generate a model which accurately described the transition from lag to exponential phase. This new model may serve as a useful tool for describing individual cell behavior, and thus increasing our knowledge of events occurring during the lag phase. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Nest predation is an important cause of mortality for many bird species, especially in grassland ecosystems where generalist predators have responded positively to human disturbance and landscape fragmentation. Our study evaluated the influence of the composition and configuration of the surrounding landscape on nest predation. Transects consisting of 10 artificial ground nests each were set up in 136 roadsides in six watersheds in south-central Iowa. Nest predation on individual roadside transects ranged from 0 to 100% and averaged 23%. The relationship of landscape structure within spatially-nested landscapes surrounding each roadside transect (within 200, 400, 800, 1200, and 1600 m of the transect line) to nest predation was evaluated by using multiple regression and canonical correlation analyses. The results of this multiscale landscape analysis demonstrated that predation on ground nests was affected by the surrounding landscape mosaic and that nest predators with different-sized home ranges and habitat affinities responded to landscapes in different ways. In general, wooded habitats were associated with greater nest predation, whereas herbaceous habitats (except alfalfa/pasture) either were associated with less nest predation or were not important. Different landscape variables were important at different spatial scales. Whereas some block-cover habitats such as woodland were important at all scales, others such as rowcrops and alfalfa/pasture were important at large scales. Some strip-cover habitats such as gravel roads and paved roads were important at small scales, but others such as wooded roadsides were important at all all scales. Most landscape metrics (e.g., mean patch size and edge density) were important at large scales. Our study demonstrated that the relationships between landscape structure and predator assemblages are complex, thus making efforts to enhance avian productivity in agricultural landscapes a difficult management goal.

AB A dynamic soil-crop model was developed to predict the date on which N deficiency occurs for winter wheat crops in the temperate climate of Northwest Europe. It is based on the daily simulation of soil N supply and crop N requirement for the period during which N-fertilizer is usually applied to wheat crops, the end of winter until flowering. The soil sub-model was derived from the 'balance-sheet method' used in France for nitrogen fertilization recommendations. It describes the net mineralization of various sources of organic matter (soil humus, crop residues, organic products). The crop sub-model simulates crop biomass production and its nitrogen content using a radiation use efficiency model and a critical dilution curve for nitrogen content. Both soil and crop sub-models require few parameters and inputs, most of which are readily available on commercial farms, together with daily climatic data. The model tested with various rates and timings of N application in three experiments accurately simulated the date on which nitrogen deficiency began in wheat crops, The interest in using the model for tactical and strategic approaches is discussed.

AB This paper describes an individual-based model of sympatric populations of brown and rainbow trout in a stream habitat. The model provides a tool for projecting flow and temperature effects on trout populations by linking the hydraulic component of the instream how incremental methodology/physical habitat simulation system (IFIM/PHABSIM) to an individual-based population model. PHABSIM simulates the spatial distribution of depth and velocity at different flows, and indirectly, the availability of spawning habitat, cover and feeding station. The individual-based model simulates reproduction, growth and mortality of individual trout as a function of flow and temperature. Population dynamics arise from the survival and reproduction of individual trout. The spatially explicit nature of the model permits evaluation of behavioral responses used by fish to changes in physical habitat. The model has been calibrated to a stream segment in the North Fork Middle Fork Tule River, California. Selected parameters were adjusted to calibrate the model for length and abundance (including production of a new year class) at the end of 1-year simulations for each of 9 years. Predicted and observed lengths were in good agreement, although neither varied appreciably among years. Predicted and observed abundances were not in as good agreement, and differed considerably for some years. These differences reflect a combination of uncertainties in the field data and uncertainties in the model structure and parameter values. Fifty-year simulations indicated that model projections of length and abundance were stationary, although abundance values fluctuated considerably. Seven advantages for using simulation models of this type are emphasized. How to most effectively interpret results from such simulation models as part of instream flow environmental assessments remains a challenge. Variability and uncertainty in both field data and replicate model simulations are realities that have implications for scientists, resource managers, and regulators in projecting growth and abundance responses of fish populations to alternative flow or temperature regimes.

AB We evaluated the consumption of Japanese Quail (Coturnix coturnix) eggs by captive reptiles, birds, and mammals in order to examine potential bias of nest predation experiments, and to determine whether predator identification through egg remains is reliable by the commonly used methods. Because none of the 86 individuals of 22 species of snakes consumed quail eggs in captivity, nest predation may be under-represented in artificial nest experiments. All three groups of predators left all types of egg remains, suggesting that researchers should refrain from classifying nest predators only by egg remains. The presence of scratches on quail eggs could be considered as a potential tool for reducing small-mouthed mammal bias on predation estimates in small-sized eggs in nest predation experiments.

SO MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES

DE carbon flux; ocean; food web; allometry; turnover time; residence time
ID BODY SIZE; DYNAMICS; MODEL; FISH
AB A central topic of modern biological oceanography is the flux of biogenic carbon (BC) towards large metazoans (i.e. renewable resources) and into deep waters (i.e. carbon sequestration, which may mitigate climate change). Two relevant characteristics of marine pelagic food webs are the turnover time of BC (tau) and the size ratio of consumers to their food particles (xi). Based on an extensive review of the literature, the present paper develops empirical equations to quantify the minimum turnover time (tau(min)) Of BC incorporated in marine pelagic organisms and the residence time (tau(s)) of BC above depth z(s) (e.g. 1000 m), below which BC cannot rapidly return to the surface waters or the atmosphere. Both tau(min), and tau(s) are used in conjunction with xi to assess the food-web regulation of BC fluxes. The paper shows that tau(min), tau(s), and xi provide objective criteria for defining functional groups of organisms that are well suited for studying food-web mediated C flux. As the size of organisms feeding on smaller prey increases, there is a proportional lengthening of tau(min) (incorporation of BC in the body mass of larger organisms) and proportional shortening of tau(s) (aggregation in faster sinking faecal pellets). The resulting increased flux towards the pools of long-lived organic C (10(-2) < tau < 10(2) yr) and sequestered BC (tau > 10(2) yr) are significant for renewable resources and climate change, respectively.

AB In this study we compared water-quality results obtained by a modified version of the biological Monitoring Working Party Score System (BMWP', a multimetric method) with those from multivariate methods-TWINSPAN and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA)-in a river basin in southern Spain affected by organic pollution. Main environmental variables correlated to macroinvertebrate distributions were identified by CCA. Biological quality of the water was assessed by the BMWP' biotic index, which classified the sites according to the tolerance of taxa to organic pollution. TWINSPAN was used to classify the sites according to benthic communities, and CCA was performed to establish the relationships among groups of sites, taxa, and abiotic variables. The results showed a clear separation of river sites according to their water composition and degree of pollution; nutrient content and water hardness were the main factors influencing the faunal distribution. Most of the sites in the study area were polluted, and consequently the most frequently encountered taxa were tolerant species. Moreover, the worsening of the water quality downstream was accompanied by a substitution of species, even within the same genus, from less to more pollution tolerant. The results obtained by the multivariate analyses used were highly satisfactory for correctly interpreting the assemblages and substitutions of macroinvertebrates, according to the main environmental variables measured in the basin. Moreover, the classification of sites according to macroinvertebrate requirements, provided by TWINSPAN analysis, was closely related to the classification according to tolerance to water pollution, provided by the biotic index. In addition, a significant part of the variance of each taxon as a pollution bioindicator, in the sites where they were found, was explained by the main canonical axis. Thus, the BMWP' biotic index, of easy applicability in river basins, proved to be an easy tool for water-quality assessment.

AB Faunal communities of the continental slope and rise seaward of North and South Carolina (U.S.A.) are strongly influenced by the Gulf Stream, the Western Boundary Undercurrent, and an increasingly steep declination of the slope toward Cape Hatteras. Sixteen stations in depths of 600-3500 m were sampled to characterize the sediment and benthic macrofauna. Box cores were taken along four transects: Cape Hatteras, Cape Lookout, Cape Fear and Charleston. On the Cape Hatteras transect infaunal densities at the 600-m station were as high as those typical of shallower waters, and the dominant organisms were species that are more characteristic of continental shelf depths. There is high, nearly continuous sedimentation of terrigenous fine sandy sediments that are funneled over the Cape Hatteras slope by southerly-flowing, long-shelf currents. We postulate that organic material is transported rapidly over the site and that the high depositional rates are enhanced by scavenging activities of filter-feeding organisms. Large, deep-burrowing deposit feeders serve to carry organic material deep into the sediments. The shallow stations on the Charleston transect were dominated by sand waves generated by the Gulf Stream, while deeper stations were enriched by macroalgae transported downslope. Transects off Cape Lookout and Cape Fear were more typical of those found elsewhere in the western North Atlantic.
   Macrofaunal analysis yielded 1202 species, 520 of which were new to science. Annelids were the dominant taxa in terms of density and numbers of species. A partial zoogeographic barrier was identified between Cape Lookout and Cape Fear. Species diversity was high at most stations, with the highest at an 800-m site off Charleston where 436 species were taken from nine box cores (0.81 m(2)). Diversity data from off the Carolinas support previously stated views that the deep sea is a resource of high species richness and biodiversity. Densities of macrofauna from all depths were generally higher than in previously published accounts. The faunal assemblage at each station was consistent over 2 years in that samples from one station were always more similar to one another than to any other station. Stations grouped into upper slope, middle slope, lower slope and continental rise assemblages; the upper slope stations were the most variable, both in density and community composition. Transect differences in types of sediment and macrofaunal communities along and across isobaths, indicated considerable regional heterogeneity.

AB To understand the factors that structure ectomycorrhizal-basidiomycete communities at a local scale, we measured the strength of the relations among the fungal communities, the tree communities, and the environment of a series of forest ecosystems in southern Quebec. We collected fruit bodies belonging to ectomycorrhizal-basidiomycete families and genera, sampled the woody vegetation, and described soils and landforms at 11 permanent sampling stations. We first calculated similarity matrices among stations, one for each descriptor (fungal species abundance, woody species abundance, and abiotic variables). We then explored the dependence among these matrices using Mantel and partial Mantel tests, path analysis, and comparisons of ordinations and classifications. Similarity among ectomycorrhizal fungus communities was strongly and significantly correlated with tree community similarity, even when controlling for the effect of environmental similarity. When the tests were made with a similarity matrix based on those tree species that are known to be hosts of ectomycorrhizal fungi, abiotic similarity explained a significant portion of the residual variation in the similarity among fungus communities. To explore this complex relationship further, we analyzed species associations. The preference of fungus associations for different sets of abiotic conditions showed that some factors affecting fungal species distribution were different from those affecting the distribution of their tree hosts. Direct and indirect gradient analyses showed that humus characteristics seemed to be important niche dimensions of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The continuum concept was useful to interpret the complex relations among symbiotic species. Trees were the main component of the realized niche of ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycetes, but the fungal symbionts of a particular tree species followed that tree species for only a part of the abiotic gradients over which the host tree was found. This type of distribution predicts that beta diversity of fungi would be generally higher than beta diversity of ectomycorrhizae-forming trees. It also means that the ratio of fungus species richness to woody species richness would be high for most community gradients. Our results and those of previous mycosynecological studies agree with these predictions. The results have implications for the conservation of biodiversity: site selection for conservation based on vegetation classification or mapping, or on distribution of tree species, may miss important fungal species.

   POSTFIRE REGENERATION OF BOREAL FOREST
SO CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPETITION; EXCLUSION
AB Beginning 1 year after an intense forest fire in the Interlake region of Manitoba, carabid beetles were sampled by pitfall trapping in two burned sites and two unburned control sites. Before the fire, one burned site had been dominated by aspen, Populus tremuloides Michx., and the other by conifers (mostly Picea spp.). During the 11-year study, burned sites became dominated by aspen saplings. Three carabid species were caught significantly more frequently in burned sites than in control sites. Two of these, Harpalus laticeps LeConte and H. egregius Casey, invaded soon after the fire and were caught in the burned sites for several years after the fire. Seventeen species were caught significantly less often in burned than in control sites; catches of another 13 common species were not significantly affected by burning of the site. Burning influenced the seasonal patterns of catches of Carabus taedatus F. and Pterostichus adstrictus Eschscholtz; this was attributed to higher litter and soil temperatures in burned sites. Seasonal patterns of other common species were not markedly affected by burning. In burned sites, the incidence of brachypterous species and the size of beetles increased with time after the fire. In control sites, the incidence of brachyptery was independent of time, but the percentage of brachypterous species was significantly higher in the conifer site than in the aspen site. Trends of brachyptery and size are those expected if early colonizers are super-tramp r-strategists and later invaders are K-strategists. Patterns of species occurrence during forest regeneration can be explained in terms of dispersal and competitive abilities, preference for physical attributes of the habitat, and responses to prey availability.

AB This review examines the role of the atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) in drought. AED is a complex concept and here we discuss possible AED definitions, the subsequent metrics to measure and estimate AED, and the different physical drivers that control it. The complex influence of AED on meteorological, environmental/agricultural and hydrological droughts is discussed, stressing the important spatial differences related to the climatological conditions. Likewise, AED influence on drought has implications regarding how different drought metrics consider AED in their attempts to quantify drought severity. Throughout the article, we assess literature findings with respect to: (a) recent drought trends and future projections; (b) the several uncertainties related to data availability; (c) the sensitivity of current drought metrics to AED; and (d) possible roles that both the radiative and physiological effects of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations may play as we progress into the future. All these issues preclude identifying a simple effect of the AED on drought severity. Rather it calls for different evaluations of drought impacts and trends under future climate scenarios, considering the complex feedbacks governing the climate system.

AB The pattern of a few abundant species and many rarer species is a defining characteristic of communities worldwide. These abundant species are often referred to as dominant species. Yet, despite their importance, the term dominant species is poorly defined and often used to convey different information by different authors. Based on a review of historical and contemporary definitions we develop a synthetic definition of dominant species. This definition incorporates the relative local abundance of a species, its ubiquity across the landscape, and its impact on community and ecosystem properties. A meta-analysis of removal studies shows that the loss of species identified as dominant by authors can significantly impact ecosystem functioning and community structure. We recommend two metrics that can be used jointly to identify dominant species in a given community and provide a roadmap for future avenues of research on dominant species. In our review, we make the case that the identity and effects of dominant species on their environments are key to linking patterns of diversity to ecosystem function, including predicting impacts of species loss and other aspects of global change on ecosystems.
