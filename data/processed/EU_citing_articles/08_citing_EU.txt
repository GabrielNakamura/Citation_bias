AB The analysis of hybridization and gene flow among closely related taxa is a common goal for researchers studying speciation and phylogeography. Many methods for hybridization detection use simple site pattern frequencies from observed genomic data and compare them to null models that predict an absence of gene flow. The theory underlying the detection of hybridization using these site pattern probabilities exploits the relationship between the coalescent process for gene trees within population trees and the process of mutation along the branches of the gene trees. For certain models, site patterns are predicted to occur in equal frequency (i.e., their difference is 0), producing a set of functions called phylogenetic invariants. In this article, we introduce HyDe, a software package for detecting hybridization using phylogenetic invariants arising under the coalescent model with hybridization. HyDe is written in Python and can be used interactively or through the command line using pre-packaged scripts. We demonstrate the use of HyDe on simulated data, as well as on two empirical data sets from the literature. We focus in particular on identifying individual hybrids within population samples and on distinguishing between hybrid speciation and gene flow.

AB Agriculture is currently facing unprecedented challenges: ensuring food, fiber and energy production in the face of global change, maintaining the economic performance of farmers and preserving natural resources such as bio-diversity and associated key ecosystem services for sustainable agriculture. Addressing these challenges requires innovative landscape scale farming systems that account for changing economic and environmental targets. These novel agricultural systems need to be recognized, accepted and promoted by all stakeholders, including local residents, and supported by public policies. Agroecosystems should be considered as socio-ecological systems and alternative farming systems should be based on ecological principles while taking societal needs into account. This requires an in-depth knowledge of the multiple interactions between sociological and ecological dynamics. Long Term Socio-Ecological Research platforms (LTSER) are ideal for acquiring this knowledge as they (i) are not constrained by traditional disciplinary boundaries, (ii) operate at a large spatial scale involving all stakeholders, and (iii) use systemic approaches to investigate biodiversity and ecosystem services. This study presents the socio-ecological research strategy from the LTSER "Zone Atelier Plaine & Val de Sevre" (ZA PVS), a large study area where data has been sampled since 1994. Its global aim is to identify effective solutions for agricultural development and the conservation of biodiversity in farmlands. Three main objectives are targeted by the ZAPVS. The first objective is intensive monitoring of landscape features, the main taxa present and agricultural practices. The second objective is the experimental investigation, in real fields with local farmers, of important ecosystem functions and services, in relation to pesticide use, crop production and farming socio-economic value. The third aimis to involve stakeholders through participatory research, citizen science and the dissemination of scientific results. This paper underlines the relevance of LTSERs for addressing agricultural challenges, while acknowledging that there are some yet unsolved key challenges. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change and biological invasions are threatening biodiversity and ecosystem services worldwide. It has now been widely acknowledged that climate change will affect biological invasions. A large number of studies have investigated predicted shifts and other changes in the geographic ranges of invasive alien species related to climate change using modeling approaches. Yet these studies have provided contradictory evidence, and no consensus has been reached. We conducted a systematic review of 423 modeling case studies included in 71 publications that have examined the predicted effects of climate change on those species. We differentiate the approaches used in these studies and synthesize their main results. Our results reaffirm the major role of climate change as a driver of invasive alien species distribution in the future. We found biases in the literature both regarding the taxa, toward plants and invertebrates, and the areas of the planet investigated. Despite these biases, we found for the plants and vertebrates studied that climate change will more frequently contribute to a decrease in species range size than an increase in the overall area occupied. This is largely due to oceans preventing terrestrial invaders from spreading poleward. In contrast, we found that the ranges of invertebrates and pathogens studied are more likely to increase following climate change. An important caveat to these findings is that researchers have rarely considered the effects of climate change on transport, introduction success, or the resulting impacts. We recommend closing these research gaps, and propose additional avenues for future investigations, as well as opportunities and challenges for managing invasions under climate change.

AB Grapevines are crops of global economic importance that will face increasing drought stress because many varieties are described as highly sensitive to hydraulic failure as frequency and intensity of summer drought increase. We developed and used novel approaches to define water stress thresholds for preventing hydraulic failure, which were compared to the drought stress experienced over a decade in two of the world's top wine regions, Napa and Bordeaux. We identified the physiological thresholds for drought-induced mortality in stems and leaves and found small intervarietal differences. Long-term observations in Napa and Bordeaux revealed that grapevines never reach their lethal water-potential thresholds under seasonal droughts, owing to a vulnerability segmentation promoting petiole embolism and leaf mortality. Our findings will aid farmers in reducing water use without risking grapevine hydraulic integrity.

AB A new dataset of ecological indicator values for species, subspecies and some varieties, hybrids and infrageneric species groups has been compiled for the vascular flora of the Czech Republic. Indicator values for light, temperature, moisture, (soil) reaction, nutrient availability and salinity were assigned to 2275 species and 801 other taxa, using the nine-degree (or 12-degree for moisture and 10-degree for salinity) ordinal scales proposed by Heinz Ellenberg for the flora of Germany. The values are compatible with Ellenberg indicator values, which were used as a baseline, but extensively revised based on our own field observations, literature, comparison with indicator value systems of other countries and an analysis of taxon co-occurrences in vegetation plots from the Czech National Phytosociological Database. Taxa in the Czech flora missing in the original Ellenberg tables were added. Compared with the original Ellenberg's dataset of indicator values, smaller proportions of taxa were classified as extremely basiphilous, extremely oligotrophic or strictly avoiding saline habitats. The revised values were tested by regressing unweighted site mean indicator values against measured environmental variables. In most cases, prediction of environmental conditions was slightly more accurate with the new Czech indicator values than with the original Ellenberg indicator values. The full dataset of indicator values is available in an electronic appendix to this paper.

AB Adaptation to new environments often occurs in the face of gene flow. Under these conditions, gene flow and recombination can impede adaptation by breaking down linkage disequilibrium between locally adapted alleles. Theory predicts that this decay can be halted or slowed if adaptive alleles are tightly linked in regions of low recombination, potentially favouring divergence and adaptive evolution in these regions over others. Here, we compiled a global genomic data set of over 1,300 individual threespine stickleback from 52 populations and compared the tendency for adaptive alleles to occur in regions of low recombination between populations that diverged with or without gene flow. In support of theory, we found that putatively adaptive alleles (FST and dXY outliers) tend to occur more often in regions of low recombination in populations where divergent selection and gene flow have jointly occurred. This result remained significant when we employed different genomic window sizes, controlled for the effects of mutation rate and gene density, controlled for overall genetic differentiation, varied the genetic map used to estimate recombination and used a continuous (rather than discrete) measure of geographic distance as proxy for gene flow/shared ancestry. We argue that our study provides the first statistical evidence that the interaction of gene flow and selection biases divergence toward regions of low recombination.

AB Different tree species influence litter decomposition directly through species-specific litter traits, and indirectly through distinct modifications of the local decomposition environment. Whether these indirect effects on decomposition are influenced by tree species diversity is presently not clear.
   We addressed this question by studying the decomposition of two common substrates, cellulose paper and wood sticks, in a total of 209 forest stands of varying tree species diversity across six major forest types at the scale of Europe.
   Tree species richness showed a weak but positive correlation with the decomposition of cellulose but not with that of wood. Surprisingly, macroclimate had only a minor effect on cellulose decomposition and no effect on wood decomposition despite the wide range in climatic conditions among sites from Mediterranean to boreal forests. Instead, forest canopy density and stand-specific litter traits affected the decomposition of both substrates, with a particularly clear negative effect of the proportion of evergreen tree litter.
   Our study suggests that species richness and composition of tree canopies modify decomposition indirectly through changes in microenvironmental conditions. These canopy-induced differences in the local decomposition environment control decomposition to a greater extent than continental-scale differences in macroclimatic conditions.

AB An acceleration of model-data synthesis activities has leveraged many terrestrial carbon datasets, but utilization of soil respiration (R-S) data has not kept pace.
   We identify three major challenges in interpreting R-S data, and opportunities to utilize it more extensively and creatively: (1) When R-S is compared to ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) measured from EC towers, it is not uncommon to find R-S > R-ECO. We argue this is most likely due to difficulties in calculating R-ECO, which provides an opportunity to utilize R-S for EC quality control. (2) R-S integrates belowground heterotrophic and autotrophic activity, but many models include only an explicit heterotrophic output. Opportunities exist to use the total R-S flux for data assimilation and model benchmarking methods rather than less-certain partitioned fluxes. (3) R-S is generally measured at a very different resolution than that needed for comparison to EC or ecosystem- to global-scale models. Downscaling EC fluxes to match the scale of R-S, and improvement of R-S upscaling techniques will improve resolution challenges.
   R-S data can bring a range of benefits to model development, particularly with larger databases and improved data sharing protocols to make R-S data more robust and broadly available to the research community.

AB Restricting global warming below 2 degrees C to avoid catastrophic climate change will require atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Current integrated assessment models (IAMs) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios assume that CDR within the energy sector would be delivered using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Although bioenergy-biochar systems (BEBCS) can also deliver CDR, they are not included in any IPCC scenario. Here we show that despite BECCS offering twice the carbon sequestration and bioenergy per unit biomass, BEBCS may allow earlier deployment of CDR at lower carbon prices when long-term improvements in soil fertility offset biochar production costs. At carbon prices above $1,000Mg(-1) C, BECCS is most frequently (P>0.45, calculated as the fraction of Monte Carlo simulations in which BECCS is the most cost effective) the most economic biomass technology for climate-change mitigation. At carbon prices below $1,000Mg(-1) C, BEBCS is the most cost-effective technology only where biochar significantly improves agricultural yields, with pure bioenergy systems being otherwise preferred.

AB We investigated seasonal and spatial patterns of phytoplankton variability in the East China Sea in order to understand biomass and compositional responses to environmental factors in the contemporary ocean. We used satellite imagery from 2002 to 2013 to define the mean seasonal climatology of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a. Phytoplankton and environmental measurements were synthesized for the study region and four seasons from 11 cruises conducted from 2006 to 2012. The results of CHEMTAX analyses on group-specific phytoplankton composition were consistent with those of microscopy and flow cytometry observations, revealing three patterns of seasonal variability. Canonical correspondence analysis and generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to resolve the spatiotemporal variations of major phytoplankton groups and their relationships to month, temperature, salinity, nutrients, mixed layer depth, and bottom depth. Monsoon forcing drove the distributional patterns of environmental factors and was critical to explaining phytoplankton dynamics at the seasonal scale. Compared to autumn and winter, significantly higher chlorophyll a concentrations were observed during spring and summer, associated with the spring bloom and the Changjiang (Yangtze) River plume, respectively. Diatoms dominated biomass over the East China Sea, especially during the summer months influenced by the Changjiang (Yangtze) River plume, whereas dinoflagellates were especially important during spring blooms. GAMs analysis showed the differences in their responses to environmental variability, with a clear mid-range salinity optimum (similar to 31) and a more pronounced temperature effect for dinoflagellates. The photosynthetic bacteria, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, both increased strongly with warming, but Prochlorococcus showed stronger sensitivity to variations in physical environmental parameters, whereas Synechococcus was more responsive to chemical (nutrient) variability, with broader tolerance of low-salinity conditions.

AB With anthropogenic impacts rapidly advancing into deeper waters, there is growing interest in establishing deep-sea marine protected areas (MPAs) or reserves. Reserve design depends on estimates of connectivity and scales of dispersal for the taxa of interest. Deep-sea taxa are hypothesized to disperse greater distances than shallow-water taxa, which implies that reserves would need to be larger in size and networks could be more widely spaced; however, this paradigm has not been tested. We compiled population genetic studies of deep-sea fauna and estimated dispersal distances for 51 studies using a method based on isolation-by-distance slopes. Estimates of dispersal distance ranged from 0.24 km to 2028 km with a geometric mean of 33.2 km and differed in relation to taxonomic and life-history factors as well as several study parameters. Dispersal distances were generally greater for fishes than invertebrates with the Mollusca being the least dispersive sampled phylum. Species that are pelagic as adults were more dispersive than those with sessile or sedentary lifestyles. Benthic species from soft-substrate habitats were generally less dispersive than species from hard substrate, demersal or pelagic habitats. As expected, species with pelagic and/or feeding (planktotrophic) larvae were more dispersive than other larval types. Many of these comparisons were confounded by taxonomic or other life-history differences (e.g. fishes being more dispersive than invertebrates) making any simple interpretation difficult. Our results provide the first rough estimate of the range of dispersal distances in the deep sea and allow comparisons to shallow-water assemblages. Overall, dispersal distances were greater for deeper taxa, although the differences were not large (0.3-0.6 orders of magnitude between means), and imbalanced sampling of shallow and deep taxa complicates any simple interpretation. Our analyses suggest the scales of dispersal and connectivity for reserve design in the deep sea might be comparable to or slightly larger than those in shallow water. Deep-sea reserve design will need to consider the enormous variety of taxa, life histories, hydrodynamics, spatial configuration of habitats and patterns of species distributions. The many caveats of our analyses provide a strong impetus for substantial future efforts to assess connectivity of deep-sea species from a variety of habitats, taxonomic groups and depth zones.

AB The focus on human-wildlife conflict has often been a constraint to wildlife conservation, as practitioners have centered their attention on reducing negative interactions, rather than on increasing positive relations between humans and wildlife. To work toward solutions that maximize conservation success, it is necessary to include positive interactions, coexistence, and attitudes of tolerance toward wildlife. In this article, clarification and definition of the terms conflict, coexistence, and tolerance are offered and human-wildlife interactions are explored along a continuum that ranges from negative to positive attitudes. Such an approach allows highlighting the multiple dimensions influencing human-wildlife relationships, thus drawing attention to other possible pathways to address wildlife issues.

AB There is compelling evidence from experiments and observations that climate warming prolongs the growing season in arctic regions. Until now, the start, peak, and end of the growing season, which are used to model influences of vegetation on biogeochemical cycles, were commonly quantified using above-ground phenological data. Yet, over 80% of the plant biomass in arctic regions can be below ground, and the timing of root growth affects biogeochemical processes by influencing plant water and nutrient uptake, soil carbon input and microbial activity.
   We measured timing of above- and below-ground production in three plant communities along an arctic elevation gradient over two growing seasons.
   Below-ground production peaked later in the season and was more temporally uniform than above-ground production. Most importantly, the growing season continued c. 50% longer below than above ground.
   Our results strongly suggest that traditional above-ground estimates of phenology in arctic regions, including remotely sensed information, are not as complete a representation of whole-plant production intensity or duration, as studies that include root phenology. We therefore argue for explicit consideration of root phenology in studies of carbon and nutrient cycling, in terrestrial biosphere models, and scenarios of how arctic ecosystems will respond to climate warming.

AB Climate change will affect tree species growth and distribution; however, under the same climatic conditions species may differ in their response according to site conditions. We evaluated the climate-driven patterns of growth for six dominant deciduous tree species in the southern Appalachians. We categorized species into two functional groups based on their stomatal regulation and xylem architecture: isohydric, diffuse porous and anisohydric, ring porous. We hypothesized that within the same climatic regime: (i) species-specific differences in growth will be conditional on topographically mediated soil moisture availability; (ii) in extreme drought years, functional groups will have markedly different growth responses; and (iii) multiple hydroclimate variables will have direct and indirect effects on growth for each functional group. We used standardized tree-ring chronologies to examine growth of diffuse-porous (Acer, Liriodendron, and Betula) and ring-porous (Quercus) species vs. on-site climatic data from 1935 to 2003. Quercus species growing on upslope sites had higher basal area increment (BAI) than Quercus species growing on mesic, cove sites; whereas, Acer and Liriodendron had lower BAI on upslope compared to cove sites. Diffuse-porous species were more sensitive to climate than ring porous, especially during extreme drought years. Across functional groups, radial growth was more sensitive to precipitation distribution, such as small storms and dry spell length (DSL), rather than the total amount of precipitation. Based on structural equation modeling, diffuse-porous species on upslope sites were the most sensitive to multiple hydroclimate variables (r(2)=0.46), while ring-porous species on upslope sites were the least sensitive (r(2)=0.32). Spring precipitation, vapor pressure deficit, and summer storms had direct effects on summer AET/P, and summer AET/P, growing season small storms and DSL partially explained growth. Decreasing numbers of small storms and extending the days between rainfall events will result in significant growth reduction, even in regions with relatively high total annual rainfall.

AB Higher temperatures associated with climate change are anticipated to trigger an earlier start to the growing season, which could increase the terrestrial C sink strength. Greater variability in the amount and timing of precipitation is also expected with higher temperatures, bringing increased drought stress to many ecosystems. We experimentally assessed the effects of higher temperature and drought on the foliar phenology and shoot growth of mature trees of two semiarid conifer species. We exposed field-grown trees to a similar to 45% reduction in precipitation with a rain-out structure ('drought'), a similar to 4.8 degrees C temperature increase with open-top chambers ('heat'), and a combination of both simultaneously ('drought + heat'). Over the 2013 growing season, drought, heat, and drought + heat treatments reduced shoot and needle growth in pinon pine (Pinus edulis) by >= 39%, while juniper (Juniperus monosperma) had low growth and little response to these treatments. Needle emergence on primary axis branches of pinon pine was delayed in heat, drought, and drought + heat treatments by 19-57 days, while secondary axis branches were less likely to produce needles in the heat treatment, and produced no needles at all in the drought + heat treatment. Growth of shoots and needles, and the timing of needle emergence correlated inversely with xylem water tension and positively with nonstructural carbohydrate concentrations. Our findings demonstrate the potential for delayed phenological development and reduced growth with higher temperatures and drought in tree species that are vulnerable to drought and reveal potential mechanistic links to physiological stress responses. Climate change projections of an earlier and longer growing season with higher temperatures, and consequent increases in terrestrial C sink strength, may be incorrect for regions where plants will face increased drought stress with climate change.

   categories; Stakeholder information needs; Information categorisation

AB Brownfield areas are a major concern in Europe because they are often extensive, persistent in time and compromise stakeholders' interests. Moreover, due to their complex nature, from the decision-making point of view, the regeneration of brownfields is a challenging problem requiring the involvement of the whole range of stakeholders. Many studies, projects and organisations have recognised the importance of stakeholder involvement and have promoted public participation. However, comprehensive studies providing an overview of stakeholders' perceptions, concerns, attitudes and information needs when dealing with brownfield regeneration are still missing.
   This paper presents and discusses a participatory methodology applied to stakeholders from five European countries to fill this research gap, to develop a system to support the categorisation of the needed information and to support the understanding of which typology of information is the most relevant for specific categories of stakeholders also in relation with their concerns.
   The engagement process consists of five phases: (i) planning and preparatory work, (ii) identification of stakeholder categories, (iii) engagement activities (e.g. focus groups and workshops), (iv) submission of a questionnaire and (v) provision of feedback to the involved stakeholders. Thanks to this process, appropriate stakeholders have been identified as well as their perceptions, concerns, attitudes and information needs. Stakeholders' perceptions proved to be different according to the country: German and Italian stakeholders perceive brownfields as complex systems, where several issues need to be addressed, while Romanian stakeholders consider contamination as almost the only issue to be addressed; Czech and Polish stakeholders address an intermediate number of issues. Attitudes and concerns seemed to be quite similar between countries. As far as information needs are concerned, similarities between some groups of stakeholders have been noticed: site owners and problem holders are primarily interested in information on planning and financing, while authorities and services providers are interested in more technical aspects like investigation, planning and risk assessment. Some outstanding outcomes emerged from the scientific community and research group, which showed an interest for remediation strategies and options and socio-economic aspects.
   The research outcomes allowed to create a knowledge base for the future development of tailored and customised approaches and tools for stakeholders working in the brownfield regeneration field. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Plants store compounds that supplement external resources to maintain primary functions. We reviewed the role of stored non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) and nitrogen (N) in juvenile woody species for spring growth and cold and drought stress tolerance, which are crucial processes for early performance of forest plantations. Plant functional types differed in NSC and N partitioning and allocation to new growth. In general, however, new leaves/shoots were more enriched in remobilized resources than new fine roots. Conifers used less remobilized resources than broadleaf species for fine root growth. New shoots/leaves were mostly comprised of remobilized N (> 60 %) in conifers and broadleaf deciduous species, while broadleaf evergreens relied more on soil N (< 50 % remobilized N). In contrast, few differences among functional groups existed in the contribution of remobilized carbon (C) to new leaves/shoots, which comprised 28-45 % of stored C reflecting the importance of current photosynthesis and distinctions in C and N remobilization physiology. The amount of N remobilized by an organ was positively related to its contribution to seedling N content. However, leaves are priority N sources in evergreens, which remobilized more N than predicted by their contribution to seedling N content. In contrast, roots in broadleaf evergreens and conifers were poor contributors of remobilized N. Under low stress, spring growth has little effect on NSC reserves. However, prolonged and intense photosynthesis depression strongly reduces NSC. In contrast, N reserves usually decline after planting and their replenishment takes longer than for NSC reserves. Strong storage reduction can hinder seedling stress acclimation and survival capacity. Resource storage can be promoted in the nursery by arresting plant growth and supplying resources at a higher rate than seedling growth and maintenance rate. We conclude that the way in which woody plants manage stored resources drives their growth and stress tolerance. However, plant functional types differ in storage physiology, which should be considered in silvicultural management.

AB The distributions of most infectious agents causing disease in humans are poorly resolved or unknown. However, poorly known and unknown agents contribute to the global burden of disease and will underlie many future disease risks. Existing patterns of infectious disease co-occurrence could thus play a critical role in resolving or anticipating current and future disease threats. We analyzed the global occurrence patterns of 187 human infectious diseases across 225 countries and seven epidemiological classes (human-specific, zoonotic, vector-borne, non-vector-borne, bacterial, viral, and parasitic) to show that human infectious diseases exhibit distinct spatial grouping patterns at a global scale. We demonstrate, using outbreaks of Ebola virus as a test case, that this spatial structuring provides an untapped source of prior information that could be used to tighten the focus of a range of health-related research and management activities at early stages or in data-poor settings, including disease surveillance, outbreak responses, or optimizing pathogen discovery. In examining the correlates of these spatial patterns, among a range of geographic, epidemiological, environmental, and social factors, mammalian biodiversity was the strongest predictor of infectious disease co-occurrence overall and for six of the seven disease classes examined, giving rise to a striking congruence between global pathogeographic and "Wallacean" zoogeographic patterns. This clear biogeographic signal suggests that infectious disease assemblages remain fundamentally constrained in their distributions by ecological barriers to dispersal or establishment, despite the homogenizing forces of globalization. Pathogeography thus provides an overarching context in which other factors promoting infectious disease emergence and spread are set.

AB Marine legislation is becoming ever more complex, so new cost-effective ways of obtaining and processing increasingly large data sets are required to support evidence-based policy making. Citizen science is one solution, but the uptake of the evidence generated by citizens among policy makers is often limited. Here, the importance of citizen science in delivery of the evidence-base that underpins marine policy was assessed using a series of case-studies. There was no consistent rationale for developing policy-relevant citizen science, but drivers included: lack of existing data, difficulty in collecting data by other means, the use of citizen science data by other organisations, and the capabilities of volunteers. Challenges to the uptake of marine citizen science were identified from policy-maker, scientist and citizen perspectives, and these related to data quality, data access, motivation of volunteers, and physical location. Citizen science has good potential to contribute to the evidence-base alongside traditional monitoring, remote sensing, and modelling, but only if outputs from citizen science projects are judged individually on quality. If this is the case, citizen science has an important role in delivery and understanding of future marine policy, but is only one part of an integrated solution.

AB The gut microbiota has been linked to metabolic diseases. However, information on the microbiome of young adults at risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) is lacking. The aim of this cross-sectional analysis was to investigate whether insulin resistant women with previous gestational diabetes (pGDM), a high risk group for T2D, differ in their stool microbiota from women after a normoglycemic pregnancy (controls). Bacterial communities were analyzed by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing using fecal samples from 42 pGDM and 35 control subjects 3-16 months after delivery. Clinical characterization included a 5-point OGTT, anthropometrics, clinical chemistry markers and a food frequency questionnaire. Women with a Prevotellaceae-dominated intestinal microbiome were overrepresented in the pGDM group (p < 0.0001). Additionally, the relative abundance of the phylum Firmicutes was significantly lower in women pGDM (median 48.5 vs. 56.8%; p = 0.013). Taxa richness (alpha diversity) was similar between the two groups and with correction for multiple testing we observed no significant differences on lower taxonomic levels. These results suggest that distinctive features of the intestinal microbiota are already present in young adults at risk for T2D and that further investigations of a potential pathophysiological role of gut bacteria in early T2D development are warranted.

AB Accurate estimation of the terrestrial latent heat flux (LE) for each plant functional type (PET) at high spatial and temporal scales remains a major challenge. We developed a satellite-based hybrid algorithm to determine the Priestley-Taylor (PT) parameter for estimating global terrestrial LE across multiple biomes. The hybrid algorithm combines a simple empirical equation with physically based ecophysiological constraints to obtain the sum of the weighted ecophysiological constraints (f(e)) from satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ground-measured air temperature (TO, relative humidity (RH), vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and LE for 2000 to 2009 provided by 240 globally distributed FLUXNET eddy covariance (ECOR) tower sites. Cross-validation analysis indicated that the optimization at a PFT level performed well with a RMSE of less than 0.15 and a R-2 between 0.61 and 0.88 for estimated monthly f(e). Cross-validation analysis also revealed good performance of the hybrid-based PT method in estimating seasonal variability with a RMSE of the monthly LE varying from 43 W/m(2) (for 6 deciduous needleleaf forest sites) to 18.1 W/m(2) (for 34 crop sites) and with a R-2 of more than 0.67. The algorithm's performance was also good for predicting among-site and inter-annual variability with a R-2 of more than 0.78 and 0.70, respectively. We implemented the global terrestrial LE estimation from 2003 to 2005 for a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees by recalibrating the coefficients of the hybrid algorithm using Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) meteorological data, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI product and ground-measured LE. This simple but accurate hybrid algorithm provides an alternative method for mapping global terrestrial LE, with a performance generally improved as compared to other satellite algorithms that are not calibrated with tower. The calibrated f(e) differs for different PFTs, and all driving forces of the algorithm can be acquired from satellite and meteorological observations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB There is good evidence that species' distributions are shifting poleward in response to climate change and wide interest in the magnitude of such responses for scientific and conservation purposes. It has been suggested from the directions of climatic changes that species' distribution shifts may not be simply poleward, but this has been rarely tested with observed data. Here, we apply a novel approach to measuring range shifts on axes ranging through 360 degrees, to recent data on the distributions of 122 species of British breeding birds during 1988-1991 and 2008-2011. Although previously documented poleward range shifts have continued, with an average 13.5km shift northward, our analysis indicates this is an underestimate because it ignores common and larger shifts that occurred along axes oriented to the north-west and north-east. Trailing edges contracted from a broad range of southerly directions. Importantly, these results are derived from systematically collected data so confounding observer-effort biases can be discounted.Analyses of climate for the same period show that whilst temperature trends should drive species along a north-north-westerly trajectory, directional responses to precipitation will depend on both the time of year that is important for determining a species' distribution, and the location of the range margin. Directions of species' range centroid shift were not correlated with spatial trends in any single climate variable. We conclude that range shifts of British birds are multidirectional, individualistic and probably determined by species-specific interactions of multiple climate factors. Climate change is predicted to lead to changes in community composition through variation in the rates that species' ranges shift; our results suggest communities could change further owing to constituent species shifting along different trajectories. We recommend more studies consider directionality in climate and range dynamics to produce more appropriate measures of observed and expected responses to climate change.

AB The African lion, Panthera leo, is threatened throughout much of its remaining range by human impacts such as loss of prey, habitat fragmentation and direct human-caused mortality, often in response to livestock predation. Lions' ability to adjust their behaviour to reduce direct contact with humans may affect their survival. We used fine-scale GPS data to measure lions' response to humans at two scales: between land use types (commercial ranches versus pastoral lands) and with proximity to human-occupied locations (i.e. livestock enclosures: 'bomas') within commercial ranch land. Study lions on commercial ranches reacted to the location and activity levels of humans on the local scale, showing no overall spatial avoidance but fine-scale temporal partitioning in their use of areas in close proximity to bomas, being closest at times when human activity was lowest (i.e. between 2300 and 0500 hours). At the land use scale, however, lions showed significant (but not total) spatial avoidance of pastoral land, despite similar prey densities and habitat structure on both land use types, indicating that lions' ability to utilize pastoral land was limited by pastoral people. When lions did utilize pastoral land, they were more likely to do so during the dark hours, when people were confined to bomas, than during the daylight hours. Lions moved faster and straighter in pastoral lands and when close to bomas, indicating that they adjust 'how' they move in response to humans. They were found closer to bomas with increasing rainfall and decreasing moonlight. Overall, lion movements suggested an ability to partition their activities spatiotemporally with those of humans such that risk of human-caused mortality was minimized while use of a human-dominated landscape was maximized.

AB The resilience of microbial communities to press disturbances and whether ecosystem function is governed by microbial composition or by the environment have not been empirically tested. To address these issues, a whole-ecosystem manipulation was performed in a full-scale activated sludge wastewater treatment plant. The parameter solids retention time (SRT) was used to manipulate microbial composition, which started at 30 days, then decreased to 12 and 3 days, before operation was restored to starting conditions (30-day SRT). Activated sludge samples were collected throughout the 313-day time series in parallel with bioreactor performance ('ecosystem function'). Bacterial small subunit (SSU) rRNA genes were surveyed from sludge samples resulting in a sequence library of >4417 000 SSU rRNA genes. A shift in community composition was observed for 12- and 3-day SRTs. The composition was altered such that r-strategists were enriched in the system during the 3-day SRT, whereas K-strategists were only present at SRTs >= 12 days. This shift corresponded to loss of ecosystem functions (nitrification, denitrification and biological phosphorus removal) for SRTs <= 12 days. Upon return to a 30-day SRT, complete recovery of the bioreactor performance was observed after 54 days despite an incomplete recovery of bacterial diversity. In addition, a different, yet phylogenetically related, community with fewer of its original rare members displaced the pre-disturbance community. Our results support the hypothesis that microbial ecosystems harbor functionally redundant phylotypes with regard to general ecosystem functions (carbon oxidation, nitrification, denitrification and phosphorus accumulation). However, the impacts of decreased rare phylotype membership on ecosystem stability and micropollutant removal remain unknown.

AB For climate change projections to be useful, the magnitude of change must be understood relative to the magnitude of uncertainty in model predictions. We quantified the signal-to-noise ratio in projected distributional responses of boreal birds to climate change, and compared sources of uncertainty. Boosted regression tree models of abundance were generated for 80 boreal-breeding bird species using a comprehensive data set of standardized avian point counts (349 629 surveys at 122 202 unique locations) and 4-km climate, land use, and topographic data. For projected changes in abundance, we calculated signal-to-noise ratios and examined variance components related to choice of global climatemodel (GCM) and two sources of species distribution model (SDM) uncertainty: sampling error and variable selection. We also evaluated spatial, temporal, and interspecific variation in these sources of uncertainty. The mean signal-to-noise ratio across species increased over time to 2.87 by the end of the 21st century, with the signal greater than the noise for 88% of species. Across species, climate change represented the largest component (0.44) of variance in projected abundance change. Among sources of uncertainty evaluated, choice of GCM (mean variance component = 0.17) was most important for 66% of species, sampling error (mean = 0.12) for 29% of species, and variable selection (mean = 0.05) for 5% of species. Increasing the number of GCMs from four to 19 had minor effects on these results. The range of projected changes and uncertainty characteristics across species differed markedly, reinforcing the individuality of species' responses to climate change and the challenges of one-size-fits-all approaches to climate change adaptation. We discuss the usefulness of different conservation approaches depending on the strength of the climate change signal relative to the noise, as well as the dominant source of prediction uncertainty.

AB Sexual selection has been widely implicated as a driver of speciation. However, allopatric forms are often defined as species based on divergence in sexually selected traits and it is unclear how much such trait differences affect reproductive isolation upon secondary contact, the defining feature of biological species. We show that in birds, divergence in song and plumage in allopatry corresponds poorly with whether species mate assortatively in hybrid zones and argue that this is because many other factors besides trait divergence affect propensity to hybridize, including rarity of conspecific mates and choice based on territory rather than male traits. We then present a general model for the establishment of sympatry that assumes a period of differentiation in allopatry followed by secondary contact and often hybridization, with hybridization subsequently reduced by reinforcement of mate preferences. We suggest that reinforcement commonly operates by a narrowing of a "window of recognition" for traits that are different between the species, rather than evolution of the traits themselves. Our arguments imply that it is important to study postmating as well as premating reproductive isolation in limiting sympatry and suggest that studies of reinforcement should focus on evolution of female preferences for diagnostic traits, rather than evolution of traits per se.

AB Acidobacteria is one of the most dominant and abundant phyla in soil, and was believed to have a wide range of metabolic and genetic functions. Relatively little is known about its community structure and elevational diversity patterns. We selected four elevation gradients from 1000 to 2800 m with typical vegetation types of the northern slope of Shennongjia Mountain in central China. The vegetation types were evergreen broadleaved forest, deciduous broadleaved forest, coniferous forest and sub-alpine shrubs. We analyzed the soil acidobacterial community composition, elevational patterns and the relationship between Acidobacteria subdivisions and soil enzyme activities by using the 16S rRNA meta-sequencing technique and multivariate statistical analysis. The result found that 19 known subdivisions as well as an unclassified phylotype were presented in these forest sites, and Subdivision 6 has the highest number of detectable operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A significant single peak distribution pattern (P < 0.05) between the OTU number and the elevation was observed. The Jaccard and Bray-Curtis index analysis showed that the soil Acidobacteria compositional similarity significantly decreased (P < 0.01) with the increase in elevation distance. Mantel test analysis showed the most of the soil Acidobacteria subdivisions had the significant relationship (P < 0.01) with different soil enzymes. Therefore, soil Acidobacteria may be involved in different ecosystem functions in global elemental cycles. Partial Mantel tests and CCA analysis showed that soil pH, soil temperature and plant diversity may be the key factors in shaping the soil Acidobacterial community structure.

AB Published in 2001, The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography (UNTB) emphasizes the importance of stochastic processes in ecological community structure, and has challenged the traditional niche-based view of ecology. While neutral models have since been applied to a broad range of ecological and macroecological phenomena, the majority of research relating to neutral theory has focused exclusively on the species abundance distribution (SAD). Here, we synthesize the large body of work on neutral theory in the context of the species abundance distribution, with a particular focus on integrating ideas from neutral theory with traditional niche theory. First, we summarize the basic tenets of neutral theory; both in general and in the context of SADs. Second, we explore the issues associated with neutral theory and the SAD, such as complications with fitting and model comparison, the underlying assumptions of neutral models, and the difficultly of linking pattern to process. Third, we highlight the advances in understanding of SADs that have resulted from neutral theory and models. Finally, we focus consideration on recent developments aimed at unifying neutral- and niche-based approaches to ecology, with a particular emphasis on what this means for SAD theory, embracing, for instance, ideas of emergent neutrality and stochastic niche theory. We put forward the argument that the prospect of the unification of niche and neutral perspectives represents one of the most promising future avenues of neutral theory research.

AB Seasonal droughts are predictable components of arid-land stream hydrology, and many arid-land aquatic taxa have adapted to their extreme environment. However, climate change is altering this predictable hydrology, producing longer and more severe droughts and creating novel disturbance regimes for resident organisms. The hydrologic transitions from flowing stream to fragmented pools to dry stream bed are frequently associated with steep decreases in taxonomic and functional diversity, referred to as thresholds of biodiversity loss. Less is known about how taxa respond between these thresholds, as fragmented pools gradually dry and abiotic conditions intensify. While an increasingly extreme environment may be expected to reduce taxonomic and trait richness, species adapted to predictable seasonal fragmentation may be resistant to declining water levels until all surface water is lost. We used aquatic mesocosms to test two competing hypotheses of the relationship between richness and pool drying for arid-land stream invertebrates: (i) the drought vulnerability hypothesis (richness gradually decreases with drying) and (ii) the drought resistance hypothesis (richness remains constant until complete drying occurs). We inoculated replicate mesocosms with aquatic invertebrates from arid-land streams in Arizona, U.S.A., and applied three drying treatments representing a continuum of drying stress commonly observed in local streams during the summer dry season (water depths: 10, 7 and 1cm). Mesocosms were covered to restrict dispersal and colonisation processes and to isolate resistance (in situ survival of species) from resilience (community recovery following disturbance). After 45days, we destructively sampled all invertebrates in the mesocosms and calculated various taxonomic and functional trait metrics. Taxonomic richness and composition did not differ between drying treatments, providing strong support for the drought resistance hypothesis. Severe drying was associated with lower invertebrate abundances and higher densities than the moderate and control treatments. This finding suggests that density-dependent processes generated by decreased available habitat may be more important determinants of community composition during droughts than abiotic stress in this system. We observed a near-complete overlap of trophic traits (body size and functional feeding group) and resistance traits (respiration mode and diapause) among the three treatments. This high functional redundancy may provide a buffer against changes to ecosystem functioning, even in cases of severe-drying-induced habitat contraction and fragmentation.

AB The endangered snow leopard is a large felid that is distributed over 1.83million km(2) globally. Throughout its range it relies on a limited number of prey species in some of the most inhospitable landscapes on the planet where high rates of human persecution exist for both predator and prey. We reviewed 14 published and 11 unpublished studies pertaining to snow leopard diet throughout its range. We calculated prey consumption in terms of frequency of occurrence and biomass consumed based on 1696 analysed scats from throughout the snow leopard's range. Prey biomass consumed was calculated based on the Ackerman's linear correction factor. We identified four distinct physiographic and snow leopard prey type zones, using cluster analysis that had unique prey assemblages and had key prey characteristics which supported snow leopard occurrence there. Levin's index showed the snow leopard had a specialized dietary niche breadth. The main prey of the snow leopard were Siberian ibex (Capra sibrica), blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur), Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus), argali (Ovis ammon) and marmots (Marmota spp). The significantly preferred prey species of snow leopard weighed 55 +/- 5 kg, while the preferred prey weight range of snow leopard was 36-76 kg with a significant preference for Siberian ibex and blue sheep. Our meta-analysis identified critical dietary resources for snow leopards throughout their distribution and illustrates the importance of understanding regional variation in species ecology; particularly prey species that have global implications for conservation.

AB Fires affect hundreds of millions of hectares annually. Above-ground community composition and diversity after fire have been studied extensively, but effects of fire on soil bacterial communities remain largely unexamined despite the central role of bacteria in ecosystem recovery and functioning. We investigated responses of bacterial community to forest fire in the Greater Khingan Mountains, China, using tagged pyrosequencing. Fire altered soil bacterial community composition substantially and high-intensity fire significantly decreased bacterial diversity 1-year-after-burn site. Bacterial community composition and diversity returned to similar levels as observed in controls (no fire) after 11 years. The understory vegetation community typically takes 20-100 years to reach pre-fire states in boreal forest, so our results suggest that soil bacteria could recover much faster than plant communities. Finally, soil bacterial community composition significantly co-varied with soil pH, moisture content, NH4+ content and carbon/nitrogen ratio (P < 0.05 in all cases) in wildfire-perturbed soils, suggesting that fire could indirectly affect bacterial communities by altering soil edaphic properties.

AB Purpose - Since the advent of the internet, social networking sites (SNS) have grown rapidly in popularity. This paper aims to explore Generation Y's information seeking and sharing behavior with regard to information about SNS; it also investigates the impact of consumer characteristics and gender differences on information seeking and sharing behaviors, to help marketers and researchers gain better insight into Generation Y consumers and social media marketing.
   Design/methodology/approach - A self-administered survey was conducted among Generation Y college students. Exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and Mann-Whitney U-tests were employed to address the research questions.
   Findings - Generation Y'ers are heavy users of SNS. Consumer opinion leadership (COL) and consumer susceptibility to interpersonal influence (CSII) affect Generation Y's dining information seeking and sharing behavior on SNS. No gender differences emerged.
   Research limitations/implications - This research extends COL and CSII, from general consumer behavior to dining-related behavior, and offers insights into the information seeking and sharing behavior of Generation Y. In practical terms, it raises marketers' awareness of Generation Y consumers and highlights the importance of social media marketing. A limitation of this study is the sample size and generalizability of the results.
   Originality/value - This study represents a first attempt to use COL and CSII to explain dining behavior and link these two consumer characteristics with social media marketing.

AB Both local- and landscape-scale processes drive succession of secondary forests in human-modified tropical landscapes. Nonetheless, until recently successional changes in composition and diversity have been predominantly studied at the patch level. Here, we used a unique dataset with 45 randomly selected sites across a mixed-use tropical landscape in central Panama to study forest succession simultaneously on local and landscape scales and across both life stages (seedling, sapling, juvenile and adult trees) and life forms (shrubs, trees, lianas, and palms). To understand the potential of these secondary forests to conserve tree species diversity, we also evaluated the diversity of species that can persist as viable metapopulations in a dynamic patchwork of short-lived successional forests, using different assumptions about the average relative size at reproductive maturity. We found a deterministic shift in the diversity and composition of the local plant communities as well as the metacommunity, driven by variation in the rate at which species recruited into and disappeared from the secondary forests across the landscape. Our results indicate that dispersal limitation and the successional niche operate simultaneously and shape successional dynamics of the metacommunity of these early secondary forests. A high diversity of plant species across the metacommunity of early secondary forests shows a potential for restoration of diverse forests through natural succession, when trees and fragments of older forests are maintained in the agricultural matrix and land is abandoned or set aside for a long period of time. On the other hand, during the first 32 years the number of species with mature-sized individuals was a relatively small and strongly biased sub-sample of the total species pool. This implies that ephemeral secondary forests have a limited role in the long-term conservation of tree species diversity in human-modified tropical landscapes.

AB Range maps provide important information in species conservation management, specially in the case of rare species of conservation interest. For the vast majority of cases, this information can only be estimated by means of species distribution modelling. When absence data is unavailable, modelled distribution maps represent the spatial variation of the degree of suitability for the species rather than their realised distribution. Although discerning potentially suitable areas for a given species is an important asset in conservation, it is necessary to estimate current distributions in order to preserve current populations. This work explores the use of species distribution modelling (Maxent) for species of conservation interest when their Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is well-known and there is quality occurrence data. In this case, derived binary maps of potentially suitable areas can be obtained and used to assess the conservation and protection status of a given species in combination with the EOO and existing protected area networks. Seven species, which are rare and endemic to the Western Mediterranean, have been used as an example. Valuable information for conservation assessment such as potentially suitable areas, EOO, Areas of Occupancy (AOO) and degree of protection is provided for this set of species. In addition, the existing informal view that among experts these species have range sizes much smaller than their potentially suitable area is confirmed. This could probably be attributed to important but currently unknown predictor variables and to historical phylogeographic factors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Intraspecific variation in the seasonal reproductive timing of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus sp.) has important implications for the resilience of salmon and for organisms in freshwater and terrestrial communities that depend on salmon resources. Stream temperature has well known associations with salmon spawn timing but how stream and watershed geomorphology relates to the variation in salmon spawn timing is less understood. We used multivariate statistics applied to five environmental variables to compare conditions across 36 watersheds in the Wood River basin in southwest Alaska. We found that the environmental conditions in the first two axes of a principal components analysis (PCA) explained 76% of the variation in summer temperature among streams and 45% of the variation in spawn timing of sockeye salmon. The average habitat characteristics of streams that characterized three spawn timing groups of sockeye salmon were significantly distinct from one another. Sites supporting early spawning populations tend to have steeper and smaller watersheds, while late spawning populations occur in streams draining large, lower gradient watersheds with lakes in the drainage network. Finally, we show that stream temperature and spawn timing among streams have little spatial correlation across the landscape, thereby producing a fine-scale mosaic of spawn timing across the river basin. These results demonstrate that geomorphology and hydrology interact to produce a heterogeneous thermal template for natural selection to influence salmon spawn timing across river basins.

AB Since Panayiotis Gennadius first identified the whitefly, Aleyrodes tabaci in 1889, there have been numerous revisions of the taxonomy of what has since become one of the world's most damaging insect pests. Most of the taxonomic revisions have been based on synonymising different species under the name Bemisia tabaci. It is now considered that there is sufficient biological, behavioural and molecular genetic data to support its being a cryptic species complex composed of at least 34 morphologically indistinguishable species. The first step in revising the taxonomy of this complex involves matching the A. tabaci collected in 1889 to one of the members of the species complex using molecular genetic data. To do this we extracted and then amplified a 496 bp fragment from the 3' end of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase one (mtCOI) gene belonging to a single whitefly taken from Gennadius' original 1889 collection. The sequence identity of this 123 year-old specimen enabled unambiguous assignment to a single haplotype known from 13 Mediterranean locations across Greece and Tunisia. This enabled us to unambiguously assign the Gennadius A. tabaci to the member of the B. tabaci cryptic species complex known as Mediterranean or as it is commonly, but erroneously referred to, as the 'Q-biotype'. Mediterranean is therefore the real B. tabaci. This study demonstrates the importance of matching museum syntypes with known species to assist in the delimitation of cryptic species based on the organism's biology and molecular genetic data. This study is the first step towards the reclassification of B. tabaci which is central to an improved understanding how best to manage this globally important agricultural and horticultural insect pest complex.

AB Species Temporal Turnover (STT) is one of the most familiar metrics to assess changes in assemblage composition as a consequence of climate change. However, STT mixes two components in one metric, changes in assemblage composition caused by a process of species loss or gain (i.e. the nestedness component) and changes in assemblage composition caused by a process of species replacement (i.e. the species replacement component). Drawing on previous studies investigating spatial patterns of beta diversity, we propose measures of STT that allow analysing each component (species replacement vs. nestedness), separately. We also present a mapping strategy to simultaneously visualize changes in species richness and assemblage composition. To illustrate our approach, we used the Mediterranean coastal fish fauna as a case study. Using Bioclimatic Envelope Models (BEMs) we first projected the potential future climatic niches of 288 coastal Mediterranean fish species based on a global warming scenario. We then aggregated geographically the species-level projections to analyse the projected changes in species richness and composition. Our results show that projected changes in assemblage composition are caused by different processes (species replacement vs. nestedness) in several areas of the Mediterranean Sea. In addition, our mapping strategy highlights that the coastal fish fauna in several regions of the Mediterranean Sea could experience a cul-de-sac effect if exposed to climate warming. Overall, the joint exploration of changes in species richness and composition coupled with the distinction between species replacement and nestedness bears important information for understanding the nature of climate change impacts on biodiversity. These methodological advances should help decision-makers in prioritizing action in the areas facing the greatest vulnerability to climate.

AB Humancarnivore conflicts on agricultural lands are a global conservation issue affecting carnivore population viability, and human safety and livelihoods. Locations of conflicts are influenced by both human presence and carnivore habitat selection, although these two aspects of conflict rarely have been examined concurrently. Advances in animal tracking have facilitated examination of carnivore habitat selection and movements affording new opportunities to understand spatial patterns of conflict. We reviewed 10 years of data on conflicts between grizzly bears and humans in southwestern Alberta, Canada. We used logistic regression models in a geographic information system to map the probability of bearhuman conflict from these data, and the relative probability of grizzly bear habitat selection based on global positioning system radiotelemetry data. We overlaid these maps to identify ecological traps, as well as areas of secure habitat. The majority of the landscape was seldom selected by bears, followed by ecological traps where most conflicts occurred. Only a small portion of the landscape was identified as secure habitat. Such mapping methods can be used to identify areas where conflict reduction strategies have the greatest potential to be effective. Our results highlight the need for comprehensive management to reduce conflicts and to identify areas where those conflicts are most problematic. These methods will be particularly useful for carnivores known to be in conflict with agriculture, such as large carnivores that prey on livestock, or pose a threat to human safety.

AB Which populations are replenished primarily by immigrants (open) and which by local production (closed) remains an important question for management with implications for response to exploitation, protection, and disturbance. However, we lack methods for predicting population openness. Here, we develop a model for openness and show that considering habitat isolation explains the existence of surprisingly closed populations in high-dispersal species, including many marine organisms. Relatively closed populations are expected when patch spacing is more than twice the standard deviation of a species' dispersal kernel. In addition, natural scales of habitat patchiness on coral reefs are sufficient to create both largely open and largely closed populations. Contrary to some previous interpretations, largely closed marine populations do not require mean dispersal distances that are unusually short, even for species with relatively long pelagic larval durations. We predict that habitat patchiness has strong control over population openness for many marine and terrestrial species with a highly dispersive life stage and relatively sedentary adults. This information can be used to make initial predictions about where populations will be more or less resilient to local exploitation and disturbance.

AB Spatial data on species distributions are available in two main forms, point locations and distribution maps (polygon ranges and grids). The first are often temporally and spatially biased, and too discontinuous, to be useful (untransformed) in spatial analyses. A variety of modelling approaches are used to transform point locations into maps. We discuss the attributes that point location data and distribution maps must satisfy in order to be useful in conservation planning. We recommend that before point location data are used to produce and/or evaluate distribution models, the dataset should be assessed under a set of criteria, including sample size, age of data, environmental/geographical coverage, independence, accuracy, time relevance and (often forgotten) representation of areas of permanent and natural presence of the species. Distribution maps must satisfy additional attributes if used for conservation analyses and strategies, including minimizing commission and omission errors, credibility of the source/assessors and availability for public screening. We review currently available databases for mammals globally and show that they are highly variable in complying with these attributes. The heterogeneity and weakness of spatial data seriously constrain their utility to global and also sub-global scale conservation analyses.

AB Inferences about species loss following habitat conversion are typically drawn from short-term surveys, which cannot reconstruct long-term temporal dynamics of extinction and colonization. A long-term view can be critical, however, to determine the stability of communities within fragments. Likewise, landscape dynamics must be considered, as second growth structure and overall forest cover contribute to processes in fragments. Here we examine bird communities in 11 Amazonian rainforest fragments of 1-100 ha, beginning before the fragments were isolated in the 1980s, and continuing through 2007. Using a method that accounts for imperfect detection, we estimated extinction and colonization based on standardized mist-net surveys within discreet time intervals (1-2 preisolation samples and 4-5 post-isolation samples). Between preisolation and 2007, all fragments lost species in an area-dependent fashion, with loss of as few as,10% of preisolation species from 100-ha fragments, but up to 70% in 1-ha fragments. Analysis of individual time intervals revealed that the 2007 result was not due to gradual species loss beginning at isolation; both extinction and colonization occurred in every time interval. In the last two samples, 2000 and 2007, extinction and colonization were approximately balanced. Further, 97 of 101 species netted before isolation were detected in at least one fragment in 2007. Although a small subset of species is extremely vulnerable to fragmentation, and predictably goes extinct in fragments, developing second growth in the matrix around fragments encourages recolonization in our landscapes. Species richness in these fragments now reflects local turnover, not long-term attrition of species. We expect that similar processes could be operating in other fragmented systems that show unexpectedly low extinction.

AB In this study, we used data from temperate grassland plant communities in Alberta, Canada to test two longstanding hypotheses in ecology: 1) that there has been correlated evolution of the leaves and roots of plants due to selection for an integrated whole-plant resource uptake strategy, and 2) that trait diversity in ecological communities is generated by adaptations to the conditions in different habitats. We tested the first hypothesis using phylogenetic comparative methods to test for evidence of correlated evolution of suites of leaf and root functional traits in these grasslands. There were consistent evolutionary correlations among traits related to plant resource uptake strategies within leaf tissues, and within root tissues. In contrast, there were inconsistent correlations between the traits of leaves and the traits of roots, suggesting different evolutionary pressures on the above and belowground components of plant morphology. To test the second hypothesis, we evaluated the relative importance of two components of trait diversity: within-community variation (species trait values relative to co-occurring species; alpha traits) and among-community variation (the average trait value in communities where species occur; beta traits). Trait diversity was mostly explained by variation among co-occurring species, not among-communities. Additionally, there was a phylogenetic signal in the within-community trait values of species relative to co-occurring taxa, but not in their habitat associations or among-community trait variation. These results suggest that sorting of pre-existing trait variation into local communities can explain the leaf and root trait diversity in these grasslands.

AB Since the development of industrialization, urbanization and agriculture, soils have been subjected to numerous variations in environmental conditions, which have resulted in modifications of the taxonomic diversity and functioning of the indigenous microbial communities. As a consequence, the functional significance of these losses/modifications of biodiversity, in terms of the capacity of ecosystems to maintain the functions and services on which humanity depends, is now of pivotal importance. In this context, one of the main challenges in soil microbial ecology is to better understand and predict the processes that drive soil microbial diversity and the link between diversity and ecosystem process. This review describes past, present and ongoing conceptual and methodological strategies employed to better assess and understand the distribution and evolution of soil microbial diversity with the aim of increasing our capacity to translate such diversity into soil biological functioning and, more widely, into ecosystem services.

AB One commonly accepted mechanism for biological invasions is that species, after introduction to a new region, leave behind their natural enemies and therefore increase in distribution and abundance. However, which enemies are escaped remains unclear. Escape from specialist invertebrate herbivores has been examined in detail, but despite the profound effects of generalist herbivores in natural communities their potential to control invasive species is poorly understood. We carried out parallel laboratory feeding bioassays with generalist invertebrate herbivores from the native (Europe) and from the introduced (North America) range using native and nonnative tetraploid populations of the invasive spotted knapweed, Centaurea stoebe. We found that the growth of North American generalist herbivores was far lower when feeding on C. stoebe than the growth of European generalists. In contrast, North American and European generalists grew equally well on European and North American tetraploid C. stoebe plants, lending no support for an evolutionary change in resistance of North American tetraploid C. stoebe populations against generalist herbivores. These results suggest that biogeographical differences in the response of generalist herbivores to novel plant species have the potential to affect plant invasions.

AB P>1. Recent climate change has affected a wide range of species, but predicting population responses to projected climate change using population dynamics theory and models remains challenging, and very few attempts have been made. The Southern Ocean sea surface temperature and sea ice extent are projected to warm and shrink as concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases increase, and several top predator species are affected by fluctuations in these oceanographic variables.
   2. We compared and projected the population responses of three seabird species living in sub-tropical, sub-Antarctic and Antarctic biomes to predicted climate change over the next 50 years. Using stochastic population models we combined long-term demographic datasets and projections of sea surface temperature and sea ice extent for three different IPCC emission scenarios (from most to least severe: A1B, A2, B1) from general circulation models of Earth's climate.
   3. We found that climate mostly affected the probability to breed successfully, and in one case adult survival. Interestingly, frequent nonlinear relationships in demographic responses to climate were detected. Models forced by future predicted climatic change provided contrasted population responses depending on the species considered. The northernmost distributed species was predicted to be little affected by a future warming of the Southern Ocean, whereas steep declines were projected for the more southerly distributed species due to sea surface temperature warming and decrease in sea ice extent. For the most southerly distributed species, the A1B and B1 emission scenarios were respectively the most and less damaging. For the two other species, population responses were similar for all emission scenarios.
   4. This is among the first attempts to study the demographic responses for several populations with contrasted environmental conditions, which illustrates that investigating the effects of climate change on core population dynamics is feasible for different populations using a common methodological framework. Our approach was limited to single populations and have neglected population settlement in new favourable habitats or changes in inter-specific relations as a potential response to future climate change. Predictions may be enhanced by merging demographic population models and climatic envelope models.

AB China's major paved road-ways (national roads, provincial roads, and county roads), railways and urban development are rapidly expanding. A likely consequence of this fast-paced growth is landscape fragmentation and disruption of ecological flows. In order to provide ecological information to infrastructure planners and environmental managers for use in landscape conservation, land-division from development must be measured. We used the effective-mesh-size (M-eff) method to provide the first evaluation of the degree of landscape division in China, caused by paved roads, railways, and urban areas. Using M-eff, we found that fragmentation by major transportation systems and urban areas in China varied widely, from the least-impacted west to the most impacted south and east of China. Almost all eastern provinces and counties, especially areas near big cities, have high levels of fragmentation. Several eastern-Chinese provinces and biogeographic regions have among the most severe landscape fragmentation in the world, while others are comparable to the least-developed areas of Europe and California. Threatened plant hotspots and areas with high mammal species diversity occurred in both highly fragmented and less fragmented areas, though future road development threatens already moderately divided landscapes. To conserve threatened biodiversity and landscapes, we recommend that national and regional planners in China consider existing land division before making decisions about further road development and improvement.

AB Aim
   To compare patterns and drivers of freshwater fish introductions across five climatically similar regions and evaluate similarities and differences in the non-native species introduced.
   Location
   Five mediterranean-climate regions: California (USA), central Chile, south-western Australia, the Iberian peninsula (Spain and Portugal) and the south-western Cape (South Africa).
   Methods
   Species presence-absence for native and non-native fishes were collated across the regions, and patterns of faunal change were examined using univariate and multivariate statistical approaches. Taxonomic patterns in freshwater fish introductions were evaluated by comparing the number of species introduced by order to the numbers expected from binomial probabilities. Factors influencing multiple introductions of freshwater fish species in mediterranean regions were determined using generalized linear modelling.
   Results
   High levels of endemism (70-90%) were revealed for south-western Cape, south-western Australia and Chile. Despite their high rates of endemism, all regions currently have more non-native species than endemic species. Taxonomic selection was found for five orders, although this was only significant for Salmoniformes across regions. The average increase in regional compositional similarity of fish faunas resulting from non-native fish introductions was 8.0%. Important factors predicting multiple introductions of a species include previous introduction success and mean latitude of its distribution
   Main conclusions
   The mediterranean-climate regions of the world, separated by vast distances, originally had a few fish species in common but are now more similar, owing to species introductions, illustrating the extent and importance of taxonomic homogenization. Introductions are largely driven by taxonomically biased human interests in recreational fisheries, aquaculture and ornamental pet species.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation are global conservation concerns, but animal species do not respond to these threats in the same manner. At the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP), located 80 km north of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil, the distribution and persistence of six native primate species differ among fragments that were isolated in 1980s. We identified both landscape and species characteristics predicting the presence of primates in these forest fragments. Fragment size positively and distance to nearest forested area negatively predicted primate species richness in the fragments; however, these relationships were not straightforward because these two variables were correlated. The proportion of fruit in a species' diet was the most important factor predicting its presence in the forest fragments, with species relying primarily on frugivory faring poorly. Home range size was the second-best predictor of a species' presence; however, some species with large home ranges were present in the 10-ha forest fragments. The extent to which the individual primate species traveled in and out of the fragments varied, suggesting that further research is necessary to determine the primary factors that lead to the animals' use of the matrix. We conclude that in addition to conserving large tracts of habitat, reducing the isolation of the forest fragments through the creation of forest corridors and through the presence of additional forest fragments within the agricultural matrix may increase animal movement across the landscape. Such changes to the matrix may be critical for those species that do not readily traverse non-forested areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We compile two data sets from C-14 uptake and dilution experiments conducted in surface waters of the global ocean to investigate the relationship between phytoplankton mass-specific growth rate and cell size. After temperature correction, both data sets suggest that this relationship might be described by a unimodal quadratic curve with the modal size (the size corresponding to the maximal growth rate) being 2.8 and 5.4 mu m in the C-14 and dilution data sets, respectively. Nutrient enrichment does not change the qualitative nature of the relationships, and we conclude that inherently low maximal growth rates of picophytoplankton, not ambient nutrient effects, play the major role in determining the positive relationships over the size range where phytoplankton size is below the modal size. Temperature-corrected phytoplankton grazing mortality rate is positively correlated with phytoplankton average size, but the proportion of daily primary production consumed by microzooplankton is negatively correlated with cell size, suggesting a reduced grazing effect as size increases. The unimodal relationship between phytoplankton growth rate and cell size is consistent with theoretical considerations and might reflect an adaptive response of phytoplankton to varying extents of nutrient limitation and grazing effect in marine systems.

AB The aim of this study was to detect suites of traits related to whole plant and seed morphology, phenology and resource use - including water - in species differing in successional status. Twenty traits were measured on 55 species representative of 5 successional stages in Mediterranean southern France, including eight pertaining to phenology and five to water economy. Suites of traits that changed along succession in agreement with the acquisition/conservation trade-off were completed by continuous changes in phenology. Early successional species had leaves with a high specific leaf area that were produced and lost continuously through the growing season. Late-successional species were taller with long-lived, high delta 13C leaves produced during short periods, most of them persisting during summer, and produced large seeds requiring a long ripening period. Replacement of species occurred with change in strategies of drought survival: early successional species escaped drought by dying before summer; later herbaceous species maintained favourable water status in relation to leaf shedding during summer; late successional trees with a large body allowing access to a large pool of resources, produced dense leaves that could tolerate desiccation. These changes occurred concomitantly with a shift in CSR strategies, using traits related to resource use, plant size and flowering phenology: ruderal herbs were replaced by more stress-tolerant herbs and shrubs throughout the succession, with competitive trees dominating the latest successional stage. These results suggest that the breadth of functional variability found in natura is not predicted by the CSR framework, and calls for a more integrated view of whole plant functioning.

AB Climate-change scenarios project significant temperature changes for most of South America. We studied the potential impacts of predicted climate-driven change on the distribution and conservation of 26 broad-range birds from South America Cerrado biome (a savanna that also encompass tracts of grasslands and forests). We used 12 temperature or precipitation-related bioclimatic variables, nine niche modeling techniques, three general circulation models, and two climate scenarios (for 2030, 2065, 2099) for each species to model distribution ranges. To reach a consensus scenario, we used an ensemble-forecasting approach to obtain an average distribution for each species at each time interval. We estimated the range extent and shift of each species. Changes in range size varied across species and according to habitat dependency; future predicted range extent was negatively correlated with current predicted range extent in all scenarios. Evolution of range size under full or null dispersal scenarios varied among species from a 5% increase to an 80% decrease. The mean expected range shifts under null and full-dispersal scenarios were 175 and 200 km, respectively (range 15-399 km), and the shift was usually toward southeastern Brazil. We predicted larger range contractions and longer range shifts for forest-and grassland-dependent species than for savanna-dependent birds. A negative correlation between current range extent and predicted range loss revealed that geographically restricted species may face stronger threat and become even rarer. The predicted southeasterly direction of range changes is cause for concern because ranges are predicted to shift to the most developed and populated region of Brazil. Also, southeastern Brazil is the least likely region to contain significant dispersal corridors, to allow expansion of Cerrado vegetation types, or to accommodate creation of new reserves.

AB Question
   Which management treatments are suitable to replace historically applied grazing regimes? How and why does vegetation structure change following changes in management?
   Location
   Semi-natural calcareous dry grasslands in southwest Germany.
   Methods
   We analysed changes in floristic and functional composition induced by different management treatments (grazing, mowing, mulching, succession) in long-term experimental sites. First, floristic and functional distances between the initial conditions and the following years were determined. Second, we used RLQ analyses to include data on abiotic conditions, vegetation composition and functional traits in one common analysis. Finally, we applied cluster analyses on RLQ species scores to deduce functional groups.
   Results
   In contrast to the historical management regime of grazing, all alternative management treatments led to changes in floristic and functional composition, depending on their intensity with respect to biomass removal. The distance analyses showed that mulching twice per year and mowing did not lead to strong changes in floristic or functional composition. However, RLQ analysis clearly provided evidence that only the grazed sites are in equilibrium, indicating that vegetation change still goes ahead.
   Conclusions
   The current study clearly shows that RLQ is a powerful tool to elucidate ongoing processes that may remain hidden when separately analysing floristic and functional data. Alternative management treatments are not appropriate to sustain the typical disturbance dynamics of species-rich semi-natural grasslands. The less frequent an alternative management treatment is with respect to biomass removal, the less the floristic and functional structure can be maintained.

AB The Quaternary fossil record has abundant evidence for ecologically nonanalogue communities made up of combinations of modern taxa not seen in sympatry today. A brief review of the literature detailing these nonanalogue communities is given with a discussion of their various proposed causes. The individualistic, Gleasonian, response of species to climate and environmental change is favoured by many. The degree to which communities are nonanalogue appears to increase with greater time depth, and this progressive process is a necessary outcome of the individualistic response of species to climate change through time. In addition, it is noted that populations within species, as well as the species as a whole, respond individualistically. This paper proposes that many elements of nonanalogue communities are extinct populations, which may explain their environmentally anomalous combinations. These extinct populations are, by definition, lineages without descendents. It is further proposed that the differential extinction of populations, as a result of continuous ecological reassembly, could amount to a significant evolutionary phenomenon.

AB This paper proposes a novel distributed differential evolution algorithm, namely Distributed Differential Evolution with Explorative-Exploitative Population Families (DDE-EEPF). In DDE-EEPF the sub-populations are grouped into two families. Sub-populations belonging to the first family have constant population size, are arranged according to a ring topology and employ a migration mechanism acting on the individuals with the best performance. This first family of sub-populations has the role of exploring the decision space and constituting an external evolutionary framework. The second family is composed of sub-populations with a dynamic population size: the size is progressively reduced. The sub-populations belonging to the second family are highly exploitative and are supposed to quickly detect solutions with a high performance. The solutions generated by the second family then migrate to the first family. In order to verify its viability and effectiveness, the DDE-EEPF has been run on a set of various test problems and compared to four distributed differential evolution algorithms. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient for most of the analyzed problems, and outperforms, on average, all the other algorithms considered in this study.

DE European wildcat; maximum entropy modelling; radiotracking;

ID FELIS-SILVESTRIS; CARNIVORES
AB Despite some populations of European wildcat Felis silvestris in central Europe are stable or increasing, the Iberian subpopulation is in decline and is listed as 'vulnerable'. In Portugal, little is known about wildcat populations, making conservation policies extremely difficult to define. Furthermore, the secretive behaviour of these mammals, along with low population densities, make data collection complicated. Thus, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical tools to interpret existing data for this species. In this study, we determine the home-range size and environmental factors related to wildcat spatial ecology in a Mediterranean ecosystem using a combined analysis of habitat selection and maximum entropy (Maxent) modelling. Simultaneously, we test the feasibility of using radio-tracking locations to construct an ecologically meaningful distribution model. Six wildcats were captured and tracked. The average home-range size (MCP95) was 2.28 km(2) for females and 13.71 km(2) for one male. The Maxent model built from radio-tracking locations indicated that the abundance of the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus and limited human disturbance were the most important correlates of wildcat presence. Habitat selection analysis revealed that wildcats tend to use scrubland areas significantly more than expected by chance. A mosaic of scrublands and agricultural areas, with a higher proportion of the former, benefits wildcat presence in the study area; however, species distribution is mainly constrained by availability of prey and resting sites. The Maxent model validation with camera-trapping data indicated that highly adequate model performance. This technique may prove useful for recovering small radio-tracking datasets as it provides a new alternative for handling data and maximizing the ecological information on a target population, which can then be used for conservation planning.

AB The concept of functional redundancy is at the core of theory relating changes in ecosystem functioning to species loss. However, few empirical studies have investigated the strength and form of the relationship between species and functional diversity (i.e., the presence of functional redundancy in ecological communities) in this context. In particular, we know little about how local extinctions in real communities might impact functional diversity. Here, we examined the relationship between species and functional diversity in plant communities along a grazing gradient across Mongolian rangeland ecosystems. We applied a recently described measure of functional diversity that incorporates species' dissimilarities defined from plant functional traits and tested several hypothesized forms of the relationship between species and functional diversity using linear and nonlinear modeling techniques. We found a significant sigmoid logistic relationship between species richness and functional diversity in relatively benign environmental conditions. This indicates high functional redundancy at low levels of species richness followed by a rapid increase at intermediate levels, until functional diversity reaches an asymptote at high levels (i.e., two-phase functional redundancy). In contrast, we generally observed a positive linear relationship between these parameters in relatively harsh environmental conditions, indicating low functional redundancy. Observed functional redundancy probably resulted from two factors, intrinsic redundancy in species' functional traits and extrinsic redundancy caused by nonrandom compositional change that is nonrandom with respect to functional traits. Lack of either intrinsic or extrinsic redundancy may result in low functional redundancy. Two-phase functional redundancy suggests that functional traits are abruptly lost from a community below a certain level of species richness, and a community then shifts into a contrasting state that has a few limited functional groups characterized by disturbance-resistant traits, as a consequence of disturbances such as livestock grazing. This study represents a major step forward in predicting the consequences of livestock grazing on the functioning of Mongolian rangeland ecosystems.

AB Genetic divergence in bat communities was assessed on both sides of the Straits of Gibraltar and cryptic diversity was examined. Screening was carried out using partial sequences of the mitochondrial (mt)DNA cytochrome b gene on 399 individual bats belonging to the 18 species found on both sides of the Straits of Gibraltar. For those bats that showed important genetic discontinuities, molecular markers (ND1 and nuclear RAG2 genes) were added to expand the sampling process. Phylogenetic reconstructions were obtained using maximum parsinomy, genetic distances, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian criteria. As an estimate of bats' flight performance, we measured for each species the wing aspect ratio and wing loading indexes, and correlated them with the maximum pairwise genetic distances obtained between southern Iberian and northern Moroccan populations. Genetic mtDNA distances between populations on both continents exceed 5% in seven out of 18 bat species analysed and unknown lineages were uncovered within the species complexes Myotis nattereri and Myotis mystacinus. We did not find a general pattern in the degree of permeability of the Straits of Gibraltar for bats. Genetic distances were not correlated with the ability to cross the Straits. Our study shows that the cryptic diversity uncovered among bats continues to increase as more regions are studied.

AB Sexual isolation is often assumed to arise because choosy females recognize and reject heterospecific males as mates. Yet in taxa in which both males and females are choosy, males might also recognize and reject heterospecific females. Here, we asked about the relative contribution of the sexes to the strong sexual isolation found in limnetic-benthic species pairs of threespine sticklebacks, which show mutual mate choice. We asked whether males and females of the two species recognize conspecifics and also prefer to mate with them. We found evidence for mate recognition by both sexes but only females prefer conspecifics. The nature of male courtship depended on which species of female they were courting, indicating that males recognized conspecific females and differentiated them from heterospecifics. However, males courted both species of females with equal vigor and changed courtship in a manner that would increase the chance of mating with heterospecifics. Females both recognized conspecifics and strongly preferred them. They responded very little to heterospecific male courtship and almost never mated with them. Therefore, males are likely to undermine sexual isolation, but females uphold it. Despite mutual mate choice and mate recognition in both sexes, females are primarily responsible for sexual isolation in these taxa.

AB 1. The re-establishment of large carnivores in Norway has led to increased conflicts and the adoption of regional zoning for these predators. When planning the future distribution of large carnivores, it is important to consider details of their potential habitat tolerances and strength of interspecific differentiation. We studied differentiation in habitat and kill sites within the large-carnivore community of south-eastern Norway.
   2. We compared habitat selection of the brown bear Ursus arctos L., Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx L., wolf Canis lupus L. and wolverine Gulo gulo L., based on radio-tracking data. Differences in kill site locations were explored using locations of documented predator-killed sheep Ovis aries L. We modelled each species' selection for, and differentiation in, habitat and kill sites on a landscape scale using resource selection functions and multinomial logistic regression. Based on projected probability of occurrence maps, we estimated continuous patches of habitat within the study area.
   3. Although bears, lynx, wolves and wolverines had overlapping distributions, we found a clear differentiation for all four species in both habitat and kill sites. The presence of bears, wolves and lynx was generally associated with rugged, forested areas at lower elevations, whereas wolverines selected rugged terrain at higher elevations. Some degree of sympatry was possible in over 40% of the study area, although only 1.5% could hold all four large carnivores together.
   4. Synthesis and applications. A geographically differentiated management policy has been adopted in Norway, aimed at conserving viable populations of large carnivores while minimizing the potential for conflicts. Sympatry of all four carnivores will be most successful if regional zones are established of adequate size spanning an elevational gradient. High prey densities, low carnivore densities, low dietary overlap and scavenging opportunities have most probably led to reduced competitive exclusion. Although regional sympatry enhances the conservation of an intact guild of large carnivores, it may well increase conflict levels and resistance to carnivore conservation locally.

AB Aim To analyse the effects of nine species trait variables on the accuracy of bioclimatic envelope models built for 98 butterfly species.
   Location Finland, northern Europe.
   Methods Data from a national butterfly atlas monitoring scheme (NAFI) collected from 1991-2003 with a resolution of 10 x 10 km were used in the analyses. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were constructed for 98 butterfly species to predict their occurrence as a function of climatic variables. Modelling accuracy was measured as the cross-validation area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic plot. Observed variation in modelling accuracy was related to species traits using multiple GAMs. The effects of phylogenetic relatedness among butterflies were accounted for by using generalized estimation equations.
   Results The values of the cross-validation AUC for the 98 species varied between 0.56 and 1.00 with a mean of 0.79. Five species trait variables were included in the GAM that explained 71.4% of the observed variation in modelling accuracy. Four variables remained significant after accounting for phylogenetic relatedness. Species with high mobility and a long flight period were modelled less accurately than species with low mobility and a short flight period. Large species (> 50 mm in wing span) were modelled more accurately than small ones. Species inhabiting mires had especially poor models, whereas the models for species inhabiting rocky outcrops, field verges and open fells were more accurate compared with other habitats.
   Main conclusions These results draw attention to the importance of species traits variables for species-climate impact models. Most importantly, species traits may have a strong impact on the performance of bioclimatic envelope models, and certain trait groups can be inherently difficult to model reliably. These uncertainties should be taken into account by downweighting or excluding species with such traits in studies applying bioclimatic modelling and making assessments of the impacts of climate change.

AB The process and consequences of hybridization are of interest to evolutionary biologists because of the importance of hybridization in understanding reproductive isolation, speciation, and the influence of introgression on population genetic structure. Recent studies of hybridization have been enhanced by the advent of sensitive, genetic marker-based techniques for inferring the degree of admixture occurring within individuals. Here we present a genetic marker-based analysis of hybridization in a large-bodied, long-lived mammal over multiple generations. We analysed patterns of hybridization between yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus) and anubis baboons (Papio anubis) in a well-studied natural population in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, using genetic samples from 450 individuals born over the last 36 years. We assigned genetic hybrid scores based on genotypes at 14 microsatellite loci using the clustering algorithm implemented in STRUCTURE 2.0, and assessed the robustness of these scores by comparison to pedigree information and through simulation. The genetic hybrid scores showed generally good agreement with previous morphological assessments of hybridity, but suggest that genetic methods may be more sensitive for identification of low levels of hybridity. The results of our analysis indicate that the proportion of hybrids in the Amboseli population has grown over time, but that the average proportion of anubis ancestry within hybrids is gradually decreasing. We argue that these patterns are probably a result of both selective and nonselective processes, including differences in the timing of life-history events for hybrid males relative to yellow baboon males, and stochasticity in long-distance dispersal from the source anubis population into Amboseli.

AB Macro-ecological theories relating species richness, abundance, range size, biological traits and environmental tolerance have rarely been tested in marine soft-sediments, despite the spatial extent of these habitats and the inherent richness of resident communities. This study examines the contribution of rare species to marine soft-sediment communities from New Zealand, focussing on the relationships of range size with abundance, environment, habitat diversity and life history traits. 54% of the 351 species sampled exhibited restricted ranges (found at <= 2 sites). In contrast to many terrestrial systems, we observed only a weak positive relationship between abundance and frequency of occurrence. Restricted-range species were not randomly distributed, with their distribution related to habitat characteristics, suggesting an important link between habitat diversity and rarity. They exhibited a similar range of traits to the total observed species pool, suggesting that they are not only important to biodiversity but could play a role in stability. Restricted range species were generally not small and this, together with the number of different biological traits represented, suggests that rare species are important to the functioning of marine systems. Thus, our results highlight the importance of considering rare species in habitat-based approaches to conservation. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID VIABILITY; INSECTS; FEMALES; NUMBERS; FROGS
AB Sperm competition theory predicts that males should increase their expenditure on the ejaculate with increasing risk of sperm competition, but decrease their expenditure with increasing intensity. There is accumulating evidence for sperm competition theory, based on examinations of testes size and/or the numbers of sperm ejaculated. However, recent studies suggest that ejaculate quality can also be subject to selection by sperm competition. We used experimental manipulations of the risk and intensity of sperm competition in the cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus. We found that males produced ejaculates with a greater percentage of live sperm when they had encountered a rival male prior to mating. However, when mating with a female that presented a high intensity of sperm competition, males did not respond to risk, but produced ejaculates with a reduced percentage of live sperm. Our data suggest that males exhibit a fine-tuned hierarchy of responses to these cues of sperm competition.

AB We employed a multilocus approach to examine the effects of population subdivision and natural selection on DNA polymorphism in 2 closely related wild tomato species (Solanum peruvianum and Solanum chilense), using sequence data for 8 nuclear loci from populations across much of the species' range. Both species exhibit substantial levels of nucleotide variation. The species-wide level of silent nucleotide diversity is 18% higher in S. peruvianum (pi(sil) approximate to 2.50%) than in S. chilense (pi(sil) approximate to 2.12%). One of the loci deviates from neutral expectations, showing a clinal pattern of nucleotide diversity and haplotype structure in S. chilense. This geographic pattern of variation is suggestive of an incomplete (ongoing) selective sweep, but neutral explanations cannot be entirely dismissed. Both wild tomato species exhibit moderate levels of population differentiation (average F-ST approximate to 0.20). Interestingly, the pooled samples (across different denies) exhibit more negative Tajima's D and Fu and Li's D values; this marked excess of low-frequency polymorphism can only be explained by population (or range) expansion and is unlikely to be due to population structure per se. We thus propose that population structure and population/range expansion are among the most important evolutionary forces shaping patterns of nucleotide diversity within and among denies in these wild tomatoes. Patterns of population differentiation may also be impacted by soil seed banks and historical associations mediated by climatic cycles. Intragenic linkage disequilibrium (LD) decays very rapidly with physical distance, suggesting high recombination rates and effective population sizes in both species. The rapid decline of LD seems very promising for future association studies with the purpose of mapping functional variation in wild tomatoes.

AB 1. Limiting similarity theory predicts that successful invaders should differ functionally from species already present in the community. This theory has been tested by manipulating the functional richness of communities, but not other aspects of functional diversity such as the identity of dominant species. Because dominant species are known to have strong effects on ecosystem functioning, I hypothesized that successful invaders should be functionally dissimilar from community dominants.
   2. To test this hypothesis, I added seeds of 17 different species to two different experiments: one in a natural oldfield community that had patches dominated by different plant species, and one in grassland mesocosms that varied in the identity of the dominant species but not in species richness or evenness. I used indicator species analyses to test whether invaders had higher establishment success in plots with functionally different dominant species.
   3. A large percentage of invader species (47-71%) in both experiments showed no difference in affinity across the different dominant treatments, although one-third of species did show some evidence for limiting similarity. Exotic invaders had much higher invasion success than native invaders, and seemed to be inhibited by dominant species that were functionally similar. However, even these invasion patterns were not consistent across the two experiments.
   4. The results from this study show that there is some evidence that dominant species suppress invasion by functionally similar species, beyond the effect of simple presence or absence of species in communities, although it is not the sole factor affecting invasion success. Patterns of invasion success were inconsistent across species and experiments, indicating that other studies using only a single species of invader to make conclusions about community invasibility should be interpreted with caution.

AB Male fertility has seldom been studied in natural populations because it has been assumed that strong selection would result in uniformly high values among males, and therefore mating success has been equated with fertilisation success. In contrast, male fertility has received much attention in studies of domestic livestock, where economic benefits rely on improving productivity, and in human infertility studies, where the efficiency of treatments depends on understanding which ejaculate traits explain reproductive failures and predict success at assisted conception. Despite years of efforts, no conclusive results have been obtained, probably because such studies have focused on opposite extremes of the range with little variation: domestic livestock have often been subject to strong artificial selection for high fertility, and human patients requiring treatment have compromised fertility. Recent findings from natural populations of red deer have shown that males differ markedly in their fertility, and have revealed the degree of variation found in different semen traits, both between and within males. Fertility trials have shown that male fertility is determined mainly by sperm swimming speed and the proportion of normal sperm, when sperm numbers are kept constant. Sperm design exerts a strong influence on sperm swimming speed, with faster swimming sperm having elongated heads, shorter midpieces and a longer principal plus terminal pieces in relation to total flagellum length. Thus, the large inter-male variation in sperm design found among natural populations underlies differences in sperm swimming speed which, in turn, determine differences in male fertility rates. Secondary sexual characters are honest indicators of male fertility, so males with large and elaborated antlers have larger testes and faster swimming sperm. Testosterone does not seem to mediate the relationship between antler size and semen quality, since it is associated with sperm production, but not with sperm quality or antler size. Finally, more fertile males produce a greater proportion of sons, who will inherit the semen traits which will enhance their fertility.

AB Aim We investigated whether climate change has affected the potential feeding activity of a winter active larva, the pine processionary moth (PPM), Thaumetopoea pityocampa L., and whether it may explain its range expansion.
   Location The study area is France and, at a smaller scale, the Paris Basin.
   Methods We used a statistical model derived from Huchon and Demolin [1970 Revue Forestiere Francaise (special issue: La lutte biologique en foret), 220-234] to test whether their model, updated with climate change, could explain the observed range expansion. Since Battisti and colleagues have recently shown that climate could affect survival of the PPM through its effect on feeding activity, we also developed a mechanistic model based on larval feeding requirements (night air temperature above 0 degrees C and temperature inside the nest above 9 degrees C on the preceding day). We reconstructed the geographical distribution of feeding activity and we compared the resulting change with the PPM range expansion.
   Results The statistical model did not successfully predict the observed expansion but the mechanistic model showed considerable change in the feeding activity of the PPM. In the Paris Basin, the PPM border coincided with a zone unfavourable for feeding activity in the period 1992-96. Feeding conditions became more favourable in the period 2001-04, and the PPM succeeded in crossing this zone. Over larger temporal and spatial scales improved feeding conditions in the north-western part of France were forecast by the mechanistic model.
   Main conclusions (1) The range distribution of the PPM in the Paris Basin is no longer limited by unfavourable feeding conditions. (2) The pattern of range expansion of the PPM is now governed mainly by its dispersal capabilities and host tree distribution. (3) At the country scale, this approach gives an approximate prediction of the potential distribution of the PPM, though the model may not be reliable in mountainous regions.

AB 1. Afforestation of agricultural land has become an important issue in Europe during the past two decades. In particular, broadleaf plantations have been promoted as multifunctional forests for biodiversity, timber production and recreation. The aim of this study was to analyse how the colonization of ground-layer plants in recently planted woodlands is affected by stand age, spatial isolation, former land-use type and canopy species.
   2. Colonization was studied in 50 plantations of pedunculate oak Quercus robur and 16 plantations of European sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus on former arable land and open pastures in the Torup-Skabersjo area of southern Sweden. Twelve oak plantations and 10 sycamore plantations on ancient woodland sites were used as reference areas.
   3. Woodland species richness increased continuously with stand age in plantations contiguous with ancient woodland. The oldest plantations (70-80 years) approached the species richness of ancient oak woodland. Species richness decreased with increasing distance from ancient woodlands, and there was no significant increase in species richness between stands aged 20 and 80 years in isolated plantations. Most species that regularly colonized isolated plantations had adhesive seeds or small, wind-dispersed diaspores.
   4. Ordination analysis showed clear differentiation between former land-use categories and spatiotemporal stand categories (recently isolated, recently contiguous and ancient). No consistent differences were found in vegetation patterns in oak and sycamore stands. Woodland species richness was similar on former arable land and open pastures. Pasture plantations were characterized by the presence of more acid-tolerant species, whereas the frequency of some acid-sensitive species was higher on former fields. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that new woodland should build out from cores of ancient woodland for optimal ground vegetation development. A species-rich ground vegetation can be achieved by spontaneous colonization within 70-80 years when plantations are contiguous with ancient woods. Formerly cultivated soils are generally well suited for understorey plants of forests on base-rich loamy soils as long as closed canopy conditions are maintained. However, many typical forest species are not able to disperse across open fields and their establishment in isolated stands will require sowing or planting.

AB All but one of the nine non-native marine species that established populations in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (sGSL) in the past decade initially invaded the sGSL via coastal and estuarine waters of Prince Edward Island (PEI). Almost half of these species are tunicates, and all but one still occur only in PEI. Recent introductions include Styela clava Herdman in 1997, Botryllus schlosseri (Pallas) in 2001, Botrylloides violaceus Oka in 2002, and Ciona intestinalis (Linnaeus) in 2004. The goal of this paper was to investigate which characteristics of PEI estuaries may have resulted in their being more susceptible to tunicate invasions than estuaries elsewhere in the sGSL. At least one genus that recently established viable populations in PEI was previously introduced to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, apparently without establishing permanent populations. This implies that either propagule pressure has increased or environmental factors are more conducive to establishment now than they were previously. The fluctuating resource availability model predicts increased invasibility of environments that experience pulses of resources such as space or nutrients. Intense development of both agriculture and aquaculture in PEI, and high population density compared to other areas of the sGSL, are associated with high and fluctuating estuarine nutrient levels and a large surface area of artificial substrates (mussel socks) that is kept relatively free of competitors, and is replaced regularly. Changes in nutrient loading and the development of aquaculture have also occurred within the past two to three decades. The provision of artificial structure is likely a critical factor in the successful establishment of tunicates in PEI, because natural hard substrates are scarce. Facilitation by green crabs (Carcinus maenas L.) may be a contributing factor in the spread of Styela. Only one estuary lacking green crabs has an established population of Styela, and at least two known inoculations of Styela into estuaries without green crabs have failed. A likely mechanism for facilitation is the consumption by green crab of the snail Astyris lunata, a known Styela predator. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The ecological causation hypothesis for secondary sexual dimorphism was tested in Salix glauca, a dioecious willow shrub. Plants growing in a Colorado Rocky Mountain (USA) krummholz mosaic of mesic and xeric patches were monitored for four consecutive years. Ecological causation is predicated on unique resource demands associated with sexual function. In S. glauca, seeds have twofold higher N and P concentrations compared to pollen. P, but not N, allocation costs differed between sexes at plant and flower scales. Ecological causation also predicts spatial segregation of sexes along underlying habitat gradients. In five populations of S. glauca, sexes displayed significant spatial segregation. The theory also predicts that sexes differ in performance across gradients of environmental stress or resource availability. Consistent with this hypothesis, females had lower drought tolerance than males under years of extreme aridity. Furthermore, over 10 years, annual shoot growth for females was greatest in mesic habitat patches, while males grew at a consistent rate regardless of habitat aridity. Because current shoot growth is correlated with future catkin production, habitat specialization likely provides a fitness payoff in females. Overall, this long-term study provides some of the strongest evidence to date for ecological causation of secondary sexual dimorphism in plants.

AB Relatively few studies have compared invasibility and species invasiveness among microhabitats within communities, synchronously We surveyed the abundance and performance of non-native Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb. (alligator weed), its co-occurring native congener, Alternanthera sessilis (L.) DC. (sessile joyweed), and other species in a wetland community along a riparian zone in southeast China to test the hypotheses that: i) degree of invasion differs between different types of microhabitats within the community; and ii) microhabitat types that differ in invasibility also differ in soil resource availability or in sediment characteristics likely to affect resource availability; iii) phenotypic plasticity of A. philoxeroides may play a key role in its adaptation to diverse habitats as can be concluded from its extremely low genetic diversity in China. The study riparian zone comprises different types of microhabitats including wet abandoned field, swamp, marsh dunes and gravel dunes. Consistent with these hypotheses, cover of A. philoxeroides was high in abandoned fields (73 +/- 2.9%) and swamps (94 +/- 1.3%), which had high soil nutrients and water availability. On the contrary, cover of native A. sessilis was relatively high in marsh dunes and grave dunes, which had coarse gravel surfaces, low soil nutrients and low water availability. A. philoxeroides showed greater morphological plasticity in response to habitat variation. In abiotically harsh habitats, stems had limited growth, and were prostrate with weak adventitious roots at nodes, forming thin, scattered patches. In the two richer habitats, the highly branched plants spread over the water or soil surface, supporting dense stronger leaf-bearing stems which grew vertically The growth pattern of A. sessilis among microhabitats did not exhibit significant variations. These results suggest that morphological plasticity and microhabitat types with high soil resources may facilitate invasions of A. philoxeroides. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Water molds attack aquatic eggs worldwide and have been associated with major mortality events in some cases, but typically only in association with additional stressors. We combined field observations and laboratory experiments to study egg stage defenses against pathogenic water mold in three temperate amphibians. Spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) wrap their eggs in a protective jelly layer that prevents mold from reaching the embryos. Wood frog (Rana sylvatica) egg masses have less jelly but are laid while ponds are still cold and mold growth is slow: American toad (Bufo americanus) eggs experience the highest infection levels. They are surrounded by thin jelly and are laid when ponds have warmed and mold grows rapidly. Eggs of all three species hatched early when infected, yielding smaller and less developed hatchlings. This response was strongest in B. americanus. Precocious hatching increased vulnerability of wood frog hatchlings to invertebrate predators. Finally, despite being potential toad hatchling predators, R. sylvatica tadpoles can have a positive effect on B. americanus eggs. They eat water mold off infected toad clutches, increasing their hatching success.

AB Age at primiparity plays a crucial role in population dynamics and life-history evolution. Long-term data on female North American red squirrels were analysed to study the fitness consequences of delaying first reproduction. Early breeders were born earlier, had a higher breeding success and achieved a higher lifetime reproductive success than females who delayed their first reproduction, which suggests a higher quality of early breeders. However, early breeders had similar mass when tagged, and similar number of food caches available at one year of age as late breeders. Nevertheless, we found evidence of survival costs of early primiparity. Early breeders had a lower survival between one and two years of age than late breeders and a lower lifespan. Our study points out that two reproductive tactics co-occurred in this population: a tactic based on early maturity at the cost of a lower survival versus a tactic based on delayed maturity and long lifespan. High quality individuals express the most profitable tactic by breeding early whereas low quality individuals do the best of a bad job by delaying their first reproduction.

AB Determining the genetic structure of isolated or fragmented species is of critical importance when planning a suitable conservation strategy. In this study, we use nuclear and chloroplast SSRs (simple sequence repeats) to investigate the population genetics of an extremely rare sunflower, Helianthus verticillatus Small, which is known from only three locations in North America. We investigated levels of genetic diversity and population structure compared to a more common congener, Helianthus angustifolius L., using both nuclear and chloroplast SSRs. We also investigated its proposed hybrid origin from Helianthus grosseserratus Martens and H. angustifolius. Twenty- two nuclear SSRs originating from the cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) expressed sequence tag (EST) database, and known to be transferable to H. verticillatus and its putative parental taxa, were used in this study thereby allowing for statistical control of locus-specific effects in population genetic analyses. Despite its rarity, H. verticillatus possessed significantly higher levels of genetic diversity than H. angustifolius at nuclear loci and equivalent levels of chloroplast diversity. Significant levels of population subdivision were observed in H. verticillatus but of a magnitude comparable to that of H. angustifolius. Inspection of multilocus genotypes also revealed that clonal spread is highly localized. Finally, we conclude that H. verticillatus is not of hybrid origin as it does not exhibit a mixture of parental alleles at nuclear loci, and it does not share a chloroplast DNA haplotype with either of its putative parents.

AB A principal challenge in ecology is to integrate physiological function (e.g. photosynthesis) across a collection of individuals (e.g. plants of different species) to understand the functioning of the entire ensemble (e.g. primary productivity). The control that organism size exerts over physiological and ecological function suggests that allometry could be a powerful tool for scaling ecological processes across levels of organization. Here we use individual plant allometries to predict how nutrient content and productivity scale with total plant biomass (phytomass) in whole plant communities. As predicted by our model, net primary productivity as well as whole community nitrogen and phosphorus content all scale allometrically with phytomass across diverse plant communities, from tropical forest to arctic tundra. Importantly, productivity data deviate quantitatively from the theoretically derived prediction, and nutrient productivity (production per unit nutrient) of terrestrial plant communities decreases systematically with increasing total phytomass. These results are consistent with the existence of pronounced competitive size hierarchies. The previously undocumented generality of these 'ecosystem allometries' and their basis in the structure and function of individual plants will likely provide a useful quantitative framework for research linking plant traits to ecosystem processes.

AB The Loess Plateau is one of the most environmentally sensitive regions in China. This study addresses the relationships between vegetation and climate of this area quantitatively at a large-scale, in order to determine the factors that control vegetation distribution. The Loess Plateau, located at 101 degrees 01 '-115 degrees 10 ' E and 34 degrees 02 '-40 degrees 40 ' N, covers an area of 52 million hectares. Vegetation data were collected from the vegetation map (1 : 500,000) and the Landsat Thematic Mapper scenes of the Loess Plateau. The Loess Plateau was divided into small districts of 30 ' latitude by 30 ' longitude on the vegetation map. In each district, areas with different vegetation were measured and used as vegetation data. The climatic data were average values of county meteorological records in each district in the past 25 years. GIS, TWINSPAN and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were employed for analysis. 257 small districts were clustered into 7 groups using TWINSPAN, representing 7 vegetation regions or subregions. The first three CCA axes had significant correlations with climate. The first CCA axis represented the variation of vegetation and climate along the latitude gradient, while the second CCA axis the variation along the longitude gradient. The distribution pattern of 171 vegetation formations on the CCA plot is identical to that of vegetation regions (districts). The spatial distribution of vegetation is closely related to climate variables on the Loess Plateau. Water variables and temperature are important in both latitude and longitude gradients, while the sunshine hours, accumulated temperature and wind speed are more important than water variables and temperature in longitude gradients.

AB Small populations may be expected to harbour less genetic variation than large populations, but the relation between census size (N), effective population size (N-e), and genetic diversity is not well understood. We compared microsatellite variation in four small peripheral Atlantic salmon populations from the Iberian peninsula and three larger populations from Scotland to test whether genetic diversity was related to population size. We also examined the historical decline of one Iberian population over a 50-year period using archival scales in order to test whether a marked reduction in abundance was accompanied by a decrease in genetic diversity. Estimates of effective population size (N-e) calculated by three temporal methods were consistently low in Iberian populations, ranging from 12 to 31 individuals per generation considering migration, and from 38 to 175 individuals per generation if they were regarded as closed populations. Corresponding N-e/N ratios varied from 0.02 to 0.04 assuming migration (mean=0.03) and from 0.04 to 0.18 (mean=0.10) assuming closed populations. Population bottlenecks, inferred from the excess of heterozygosity in relation to allelic diversity, were detected in all four Iberian populations, particularly in those year classes derived from a smaller number of returning adults. However, despite their small size and declining status, Iberian populations continue to display relatively high levels of heterozygosity and allelic richness, similar to those found in larger Scottish populations. Furthermore, in the R. Ason no evidence was found for a historical loss of genetic diversity despite a marked decline in abundance during the last five decades. Thus, our results point to two familiar paradigms in salmonid conservation: (1) endangered populations can maintain relatively high levels of genetic variation despite their small size, and (2) marked population declines may not necessarily result in a significant loss of genetic diversity. Although there are several explanations for such results, microsatellite data and physical tagging suggest that high levels of dispersal and asymmetric gene flow have probably helped to maintain genetic diversity in these peripheral populations, and thus to avoid the negative consequences of inbreeding.

AB Animals using sound communication have developed different strategies to overcome noise interference, but studies have rarely examined animals behaving in their natural environments. Males of the leptodactylid frog Eupsophus calcaratus exposed to natural noises of wind, rain, creek and sea surf and to a band-pass noise encompassing the main spectral components of the conspecific advertisement call increased their call rate in the presence of noises of moderate level, and this effect was particularly strong for the band-pass noise. Frogs exposed to band-pass noise of different intensities increased their call rate in response to exposures of 66-78 dB RMS sound pressure level. Call duration followed similar trends, but the effects of noise exposure on this measure of evoked vocal response were not as strong as those on call rate. The vocal responsiveness of males of this species in the presence of noise denotes adaptations to cope with high interference, in spite of the relatively simple acoustic environment of the austral temperate forest.

AB We used abundance data and the program Focus to determine the spatial scale at which 31 species of longhorned beetles ( Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) respond to forest habitat amount. We predicted that the spatial scale at which species respond would increase with body size, and that species using ephemeral larval habitat would respond at larger spatial scales than species using more stable larval habitat. We found that forest cover was a better measure of the amount of habitat for polyphagous species than for oligophagous species. Larger species of longhorned beetles responded to forest cover at larger scales. We did not find evidence that species using more ephemeral larval habitat conditions responded at larger scales than species developing in more stable habitat conditions. Our results highlight the importance of accurately describing habitat in studies of species - environment relationships. While scales of response may be species-specific, some generalizations across species are possible.

AB Numerous field reports of hybrid monkeys and documented cases of persistent hybrid zones suggest that natural hybridization is common among African cercopithecines. Both theoretical considerations and a review of cases lead us to conclude that parapatric hybridization among closely related allotaxa is a widespread, usually natural process whose incidence may be modified by human influence. Sympatric hybridization, between species ecologically distinct enough to have overlapping ranges, is rarer, and in monkeys tends to occur in settings where natural or anthropogenic habitat edges restrict migration and hence access to unrelated conspecific mates. Although sympatric hybridization occurs in the absence of human disturbance, and may even have been a creative force in cercopithecine evolution, anthropogenic habitat fragmentation may increase its incidence. Hybridization with a more abundant form may increase the level of threat faced by a species whose numbers and range have been severely restricted, either naturally or artificially.

AB Mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA markers were applied to infer the phylogeography, intraspecific diversity and dynamics of the distributional history of European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) with focus on its central and northern European distribution range. Phylogenetic and nested clade analyses revealed at least four major mtDNA lineages, which evolved in geographical isolation during the Pleistocene. These lineages should be recognized as the basic evolutionary significant units (ESUs) for grayling in central and northern Europe. In addition, and in contrast to previous work on grayling, the results of Bayesian analysis of individual admixture coefficients, two-dimensional scaling analysis and spatial analysis of molecular variance provided evidence for a high level of admixture among major lineages in contact zones between drainages (e.g. the low mountain range of Germany), most likely resulting from glacial perturbations and ancient river connections between drainages during the Pleistocene glaciations. Even within river systems, a high level of differentiation among populations was revealed as indicated by the microsatellite data. Grayling sampled from 29 sites displayed high levels of differentiation (overall F-ST = 0.367), a high number of private alleles and high bootstrap support for the genetic distance-based population clusters across 12 loci. We specifically discuss our results in context of phylogeograpic studies on other European freshwater fish species with habitat preferences similar to those of grayling. Our study shows that both large-scale phylogeographical and detailed genetic analyses on a fine scale are mandatory for developing appropriate conservation guidelines of endangered species.

AB Gross primary productivity (GPP) estimates derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) are converted to wheat yield and compared with observed yield for counties, climate districts and entire states for the 2001 and 2002 growing seasons in Montana and North Dakota. Analyses revealed that progressive levels of spatial aggregation generally improved the relations between estimated and observed wheat yield. However, only state level yield estimates were sufficiently accurate (<= 5% deviation from observed yield). The statewide yield results were encouraging because they were derived without the use of retrospective empirical analyses, which constitutes a new opportunity for timely wheat yield estimates for large regions. Additionally, this study identifies six practical limits to estimating wheat yield using MODIS GPP. As a result we describe three suggestions for improving wheat yield estimates for scientists willing to re-compute MODIS-derived GPP estimates using regionally specific inputs.

AB The role of hybridization in the evolution of animal species is poorly understood. Transgressive segregation is a mechanism through which hybridization can generate diversity and ultimately lead to speciation. In this report we investigated the capacity of hybridization to generate novel (transgressive) phenotypes in the taxonomically diverse cichlid fishes. We generated a large F-2 hybrid population by crossing two closely related cichlid species from Lake Malawi in Africa with differently shaped heads. Our morphometric analysis focused on two traits with different selective histories. The cichlid lower jaw (mandible) has evolved in response to strong directional selection, and does not segregate beyond the parental phenotype. The cichlid neurocranium (skull) has likely diverged in response to forces other than consistent directional selection (e.g., stabilizing selection), and exhibits marked transgressive segregation in our F2 population. We show that the genetic architecture of the cichlid jaw limits transgression, whereas the genetic basis of skull shape is permissive of transgressive segregation. These data suggest that natural selection, acting through the genome, will limit the degree of diversity that may be achieved via hybridization. Results are discussed in the context of the broader question of how phenotypic diversity may be achieved in rapidly evolving systems.

AB Southern India, one of the last strongholds of the endangered Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), harbours about one-fifth of the global population. We present here the first population genetic study of free-ranging Asian elephants, examining within- and among-population differentiation by analysing mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) and nuclear microsatellite DNA differentiation across the Nilgiris-Eastern Ghats, Anamalai, and Periyar elephant reserves of southern India. Low mtDNA diversity and 'normal' microsatellite diversity were observed. Surprisingly, the Nilgiri population, which is the world's single largest Asian elephant population, had only one mtDNA haplotype and lower microsatellite diversity than the two other smaller populations examined. There was almost no mtDNA or microsatellite differentiation among localities within the Nilgiris, an area of about 15000 km(2). This suggests extensive gene flow in the past, which is compatible with the home ranges of several hundred square kilometres of elephants in southern India. Conversely, the Nilgiri population is genetically distinct at both mitochondrial and microsatellite markers from the two more southerly populations, Anamalai and Periyar, which in turn are not genetically differentiated from each other. The more southerly populations are separated from the Nilgiris by only a 40-km-wide stretch across a gap in the Western Ghats mountain range. These results variably indicate the importance of population bottlenecks, social organization, and biogeographic barriers in shaping the distribution of genetic variation among Asian elephant populations in southern India.

AB We performed a combined evolutionary analysis of North American Boechera stricta, Boechera holboellii, and their hybrid Boechera X divaricarpa using information on ploidy level estimators, allelic microsatellite variation, noncoding regions of the plastidic genome (cpDNA), and sequences of the internal transcribed spacers I and 2 of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS). Somatic ploidy levels of herbarium specimens were estimated based on comparison of pollen size and the number of alleles per locus at seven microsatellites. Results indicate that B. stricta and B. holboellii are genetically distinct from each other, although we also find evidence for occasional introgression between both parental species. Microsatellite patterns for B. stricta from northeastern North America are genetically distinct from western populations, suggesting isolation in glacial refugia along the Southeastern margin of the continuous ice shield. Microsatellites Supported recent origin of B. Xdivaricarpa. Correspondence of nrDNA with cpDNA genetic variation for the majority of diploid B. holboellii accessions Suggests a basal, sexual evolutionary unit within a polymorphic B. holboellii group. Hybridization of genetically distinct lineage(s) evidently played an important role in the establishment of polyploid B. holboellii. Frequency of polyploid B. holhoellii is substantially higher in the southern United States. This trend corresponds to a southerly distribution of derived chloroplast haplotypes, suggesting an evolutionary advantage of polyploidy and associated apomixis in the colonization of the Sierra Nevada and the Southern Rocky Mountains.

AB Environmental manipulation experiments showed that species respond individualistically to each environmental-change variable. The greatest responses of plants were generally to nutrient, particularly nitrogen, addition. Summer warming experiments showed that woody plant responses were dominant and that mosses and lichens became less abundant. Responses to warming were controlled by moisture availability and snow cover. Many invertebrates increased population growth in response to summer warming, as long as desiccation was not induced. CO2 and UV-B enrichment experiments showed that plant and animal responses were small. However, some microorganisms and species of fungi were sensitive to increased UV-B and some intensive mutagenic actions could, perhaps, lead to unexpected epidemic outbreaks. Tundra soil heating, CO 2 enrichment and amendment with mineral nutrients generally accelerated microbial activity. Algae are likely to dominate cyanobacteria in milder climates. Expected increases in winter freeze-thaw cycles leading to ice-crust formation are likely to severely reduce winter survival rate and disrupt the population dynamics of many terrestrial animals. A deeper snow cover is likely to restrict access to winter pastures by reindeer/caribou and their ability to flee from predators while any earlier onset of the snow-free period is likely to stimulate increased plant growth. Initial species responses to climate change might occur at the sub-species level: an Arctic plant or animal species with high genetic/racial diversity has proved an ability to adapt to different environmental conditions in the past and is likely to do so also in the future. Indigenous knowledge, air photographs, satellite images and monitoring show that changes in the distributions of some species are already occurring: Arctic vegetation is becoming more shrubby and more productive, there have been recent changes in the ranges of caribou, and "new" species of insects and birds previously associated with areas south of the treeline have been recorded. In contrast, almost all Arctic breeding bird species are declining and models predict further quite dramatic reductions of the populations of tundra birds due to warming. Species-climate response surface models predict potential future ranges of current Arctic species that are often markedly reduced and displaced northwards in response to warming. In contrast, invertebrates and microorganisms are very likely to quickly expand their ranges northwards into the Arctic.

AB Whether cohort effects can be retrieved in adult phenotypes depends on the possibility for individuals to compensate for a good or bad start in life. This ability to compensate may itself depend on the environment and on individual sex. In large polygynous ungulates, male reproductive success relies more on body size than the reproductive success of females, which makes them more sensitive to a bad start in life. Based on current theories of life history evolution and sexual selection, we tested the following predictions in a moose population: 1) cohort effects and year effects occur in both male and female adult body mass, but due to 2) compensatory growth, cohort effects tend to fade away with the individual's age; and 3) males are more sensitive to cohort effects than females. In support of the first prediction, we found that density and climate during the year-of-birth and the year-of-harvest affected moose body mass in both sexes. However, the magnitude of the effects of environmental conditions at birth on adult body mass decreased with increasing age, but less so in males than in females. Thus, as expected based on our third prediction, environmental conditions early in life were more influential on adult body mass of males compared to females. Such a result supports the existence of sex-specific life history tactics, with males maximising growth rate and females rather trading-off growth for reproduction.

AB Biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes is considered a challenge for nature conservation. The complementation/supplementation hypothesis may be an appropriate theoretical background for butterfly conservation in agricultural landscapes, by considering not only one patch but also several patches fulfilling various or similar ecological requirements. The aim of this article was to determine if butterflies' use of the landscape may be explained by this hypothesis. Two predictions of the complementation/supplementation hypothesis were tested: (i) butterfly "use" of herbaceous patches depends on the nature of the herbaceous patches and their management; (ii) butterflies stay preferentially in certain patch types. Mark-recapture experiments and behaviour recording were carried out in western France farmlands on Maniola jurtina. Herbaceous patches were grouped into six types: road verge, lane, hedge bank, grazed, mown and unproductive meadows. The first prediction was validated as butterflies did not use the different patch types in the same way. The road verge and lane were mainly used for feeding which is consistent with their high value of nectar abundance. Flying was the main behaviour expressed by butterflies in the unproductive and grazed meadows. When considering other activities than flying, the unproductive meadow was principally used for feeding and the grazed meadow for resting behaviour. The second prediction was confirmed as butterflies stayed less in grazed meadows and road verges than in lanes. Perspectives brought by complementation/supplementation hypothesis to conservation plans in dynamic farmland mosaics are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The flora of clear-cuttings with soil scarification in forests was compared < 1-2 yr after cutting with that in mature herb-rich forests in SW Finland. The total and mean numbers of vascular plant species both in the study areas and in the sample plots, were almost double in clear-cut areas compared to mature forests. Clear-cuttings and mature forests were distinctly separated by multivariate analyses (DCA). Several dozen species not found in forests were common in clear-cut areas. Most of them probably belong to the neglected native species pool of early boreal forest succession and are dependent on the long-term persistent seed bank or effective wind dispersal. It is emphasized that in forests many plant species are confined to the very early stages (< 2 yr) after disturbance. The storage effect of the long-term persistent seed bank is crucial for the maintenance of plant diversity in boreal forests. Probably a considerable part of the flora of agricultural areas is composed of species that were originally disturbance dependent forest plants. Scarification is beneficial to disturbance dependent plants and may be useful in restoration of populations of species of early succession.

AB Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) is the latest in a series of surveys designed to measure and evaluate stock and change of land cover, landscape features, freshwaters, habitats and the vegetation of Great Britain. The ideas behind CS2000 developed during the 1960s and 1970s and culminated in the first survey of vegetation and land cover in 1978. One kilometer sample squares were selected at random using an environmental stratification. Subsequent surveys took place in 1984, 1990 and 1998, revisiting the original sample locations, whilst progressively expanding in scope and sample size; CS2000 included soils, breeding birds, remotely sensed imagery, freshwater biota and hydromorphology. Countryside Survey data may be interpreted using the pressure-state-response model, by selecting indicators of process and quality, and by identifying models of expected responses to different pressures. Thus, results showing losses of hedgerows between 1984 and 1990 stimulated new protection for these features. Ideally, CS2000 data should be used to stimulate experiments to distinguish between different pressures, in order to ensure that policy and management responses are both appropriate and achievable.
   The experience from CS2000 may prove helpful for the design and management of other large scale monitoring programmes of ecosystems. In particular, the scope of the survey, and the use to which the data are applied, have evolved through time, and yet continuity was essential for change to be detected efficiently. These objectives were reconciled by collecting the data in a disaggregated form, allowing a high degree of flexibility in both analysis and reporting. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Conceptual models predict counteractive effects of herbivores and nutrient enrichment on plant diversity and reversed effects of grazers under different nutrient regimes. I tested these hypotheses in I I field experiments with periphyton communities in three different aquatic habitats (a highly eutrophic lake, an meso-eutrophic lake, and an meso-eutrophic part of the Baltic Sea coast) and in different seasons. Grazer access and nutrient supply were manipulated in a factorial design. Species richness and evenness were chosen as response variables. Both manipulated factors had significant and contrasting effects on diversity, with variable effect strength between sites and seasons. From the two aspects of diversity, evenness well reflected the changes in community composition. Fertilization tended to increase the dominance of few species and thus to decrease evenness, whereas grazers counteracted these effects by removing dominant life forms. The response of species richness was not as expected, since grazers decreased richness throughout, whereas nutrients had weaker effects but tended to increase richness. Species richness rather reflected changes in periphyton architecture. Grazers reduced algal richness presumably by co-consumption of rare species in the tightly connected periphyton assemblages, whereas enrichment may increase richness by providing more structure via increased dominance of filamentous species. Although grazer and nutrient effects on richness and evenness were opposing, there was no change in the effect of one factor by manipulation of the other.

AB Widespread use of transgenic crops that express an insecticidal endotoxin from Bacillus thuringiensis increases the risk of evolution of resistance by the European corn borer and other insect pests. To delay resistance evolution, the high-dose refuge strategy is being implemented for Bt maize and Bt cotton. We develop a general modelling framework to understand the invasion and spread of alleles conferring resistance. We show that at least three processes are involved in explaining the effectiveness of the high-dose refuge strategy: the intensity of selection, assortative (non-random) mating due to spatial subdivision, and variation in male mating success also due to spatial subdivision. Understanding these processes leads to a greater range of possible resistance management tactics. For example, efforts to encourage adults to leave their natal fields may have the unwanted effect of speeding rather than slowing resistance evolution. Furthermore, when Bt maize causes high mortality to susceptible target pests, spraying insecticides in refuges to reduce pest populations may not greatly disrupt resistance management.

AB Phytophthora capsici isolates were recovered from pepper and cucurbit hosts at seven locations in Michigan from 1998 to 2000. Isolates were characterized for compatibility type (CT), mefenoxam sensitivity (MS), and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker profiles. In total, 94 AFLP bands were resolved. Individual populations were highly variable. Within populations, 39 to 49% of the AFLP bands were polymorphic and estimated heterozygosities ranged from 0.16 to 0.19. Of the 646 isolates fingerprinted, 70% (454) had unique AFLP profiles. No clones were recovered between years or locations. Pairwise F statistics (Phi (ST)) between populations from different locations ranged from 0.18 to 0.40. A tree based on unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic average cluster analysis indicates discrete clusters based on location. Isolates from the same location showed no clustering based on the year of sampling. Analysis of molecular variance partitioned variability among (40%) and within populations (60%). The overall estimated Phi (ST) was 0.34 (SD = 0.03). A1/A2 CT ratios were approximate to1:1, and MS frequencies were similar between years for the two locations sampled over time. These data suggest that P. capsici persists in discrete outcrossing populations and that gene flow among locations in Michigan is infrequent.

AB Many insects dependent on dead wood are considered threatened by modern forestry. This may partly be due to substrate patches being too widely scattered to be effectively colonized. We studied how rates of colonization by insect species breeding in polypore fruiting bodies are affected by interpatch distance and habitat matrix characteristics. In field experiments, fruiting bodies of Fomitopsis pinicola and Fomes fomentarius were put out at different distances from natural sources of insects. The anobiid beetles Dorcatoma spp. were the most successful colonizers of distant patches, and they readily flew over open fields. Cis beetles were less successful colonizers, despite their generally higher abundance. We hypothesize that the Dorcatoma spp. are inferior competitors, but superior colonizers of distant resources compared with Cis spp. The flies Leucophenga quinquema-culata (Drosophilidae) and Medetera impigra (Dolichopodidae) appeared to be more affected by distance than the beetles studied in their colonization of fungal fruiting bodies. Lower rates of parasitism were recorded on distant patches, and parasitoids appeared more affected by distance than their hosts. Most of the insect species studied can probably persist in the managed forest landscape if suitable breeding substrate is created continuously on a 1 km(2) scale.

AB 1. The forthcoming European Commission Water Framework Directive will introduce catchment management throughout Europe, and could have major impacts on the conservation and restoration of aquatic ecosystems. The Directive is outlined, and the proposed mechanisms for determining water quality status under the Directive are described.
   2. The Directive is assessed using the developing ideas of ecosystem health. These combine scientific validity with an open acknowledgement of the value judgements inherent in all assessments of ecological quality, and emphasize the importance of public involvement.
   3. Permitted derogations and exemptions are identified and their likely consequences discussed. These include substantial reductions in the potential of the Directive to improve water status in some cases. Existing bioassessment methods relevant to the proposed scheme are reviewed, and the sampling and statistical implications of the Directive are explored. Much work is needed on the development of ecological classification and referencing systems if the requirements of the Directive are to be met.
   4. The emphasis of the Directive on biological (and not just chemical) quality goals, and the introduction of a consideration of ecological functioning (as well as structure) is welcomed. Although the Directive requires the assessment of hydromorphological and chemical, in addition to biological, variables, in most cases biological assessment is given priority. We advocate inclusion of all three elements in quality assessments.
   5. The Directive gives little advice on policy integration for catchment management at European and national levels, and fails to provide for public involvement in the process of ecosystem management. These omissions will limit the ability of the Directive to deliver ecosystem health, and need to be addressed if the goals of the Directive are to be achieved. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The invasion by non-native plant species of an urban remnant of a species-rich Themeda triandra grassland in southeastern Australia was quantified and related to abiotic influences. Richness and cover of non-native species were highest at the edges of the remnant and declined to relatively uniform levels within the remnant. Native species richness and cover were lowest at the edge adjoining a roadside but then showed little relation to distance from edge. Roadside edge quadrats were floristically distinct from most other quadrats when ordinated by Detrended Correspondence Analysis.
   Soil phosphorus was significantly higher at the roadside edge but did not vary within the remnant itself. All other abiotic factors measured (NH4, NO3, S, pH and % organic carbon) showed little variation across the remnant. Non-native species richness and cover were strongly correlated with soil phosphorus levels. Native species were negatively correlated with soil phosphorus levels. Canonical Correspondence Analysis identified the perennial non-native grasses of high biomass as species most dependent on high soil nutrient levels. Such species may be resource-limited in undisturbed soils.
   Three classes of non-native plants have invaded this species-rich grassland. (1) generalist species (greater than or equal to 50 % frequency), mostly therophytes with non-specialized habitat or germination requirements; (2) resource-limited species comprising perennial species of high biomass that are dependent on nutrient increases and/or soil disturbances before they can invade the community and; (3) species of intermediate frequency (1-30 %), of low to high biomass potential, that appear to have non-specialized habitat requirements but are currently limited by seed dispersal, seedling establishment or the current site management. Native species richness and cover are most negatively affected by increases in non-native cover. Declines are largely evident once the non-native cover exceeds 40 %.
   Widespread, generalist non-native species are numerous in intact sites and will have to be considered a permanent part of the flora of remnant grasslands. Management must aim to minimize increases in cover of any non-native species or the disturbances that favour the establishment of competitive nonnative grasses if the native grassland flora is to be conserved in small, fragmented remnants.

AB A method for the national assessment of the biological quality of river sites is developed. Multivariate discrimination, based on site environmental characteristics, is used on a biological classification of reference sites to derive a procedure to predict the fauna to be expected in the absence of environmental stress. Various quality indices, based on a comparison of the observed with the expected fauna, are proposed. The sizes of the various sources of error and variation, and their effects on the rates of misclassification to quality bands, are examined.

AB Laboratory and greenhouse bioassays were used to test for inhibitory effects of senescent and decomposed leaves and aqueous extract from bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) against seed germination and seedling growth of aspen (Populus tremula L.), birch (Betula pendula Roth.). Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.]. Aqueous extracts from bilberry leaves were inhibitory to aspen seed germination and seedling growth and also induced root damage and growth abnormalities. Addition of activated carbon removed the inhibitory effects of extracts. Senescent leaves reduced pine and spruce seed germination, but rinsing of seeds reversed this inhibition. Senescent leaves were more inhibitory than decomposed leaf litter, suggesting that the inhibitory compounds in bilberry leaves are relatively soluble and released at early stages during decomposition. Spruce was generally less negatively affected by litter and aqueous extracts than the other tested species. This study indicates that chemical effects of bilberry litter have the potential to inhibit tree seedling recruitment, but these effects were not consistently strong. Phytotoxicity is unlikely to be of critical importance in determining success for spruce seedling establishment.

AB Diffusion modelling has shown that conservative demographic traits combined with feeding competition could explain red squirrel replacement by grey squirrels. We used field data from seven separate red and grey squirrel populations, in oak-hazel woods and Scots pines, to reject the hypothesis that red squirrel density and breeding is intrinsically poorer than that of grey squirrels. In oak-hazel woods, grey squirrel foraging, density and productivity were related to oak and acorn abundance. In contrast, red squirrels foraged where hazels were abundant; their relatively low density and breeding success were related to the abundance of hazel nuts. Red squirrels failed to exploit good acorn crops, although acorns were more abundant than hazels, but in Scots pines had densities and breeding success as high as grey squirrels in deciduous woods. Captive grey squirrels thrived on a diet of acorns, but red squirrels had a comparative digestive efficiency of only 59%, apparently because they were much less able than grey squirrels to neutralize acorn polyphenols. A model with simple competition for the autumn hazel crop, which was eaten by grey squirrels before the acorn crop, shows that red squirrels are unlikely to persist with grey squirrels in woods with more than 14% oak canopy. With oaks in most British deciduous woods giving grey squirrels a food refuge which red squirrels fail to exploit, replacement of red squirrels can be explained by feeding competition alone, exacerbated by the post-war decline in coppiced hazel.

AB 1. An optimal energy partitioning model is used to predict the optimum adult sizes of the soma, gonads and flight apparatus in insects. A comparison of the investment in gonads and lipoidal reserves in winged and unwinged individuals in species from three families of aphids is used to test the predictions and define the cost of developing a flight apparatus.
   2. In accordance with theoretical predictions winged aphids had smaller gonads than wingless aphids and there appeared to be a trade-off between the investment in gonads and lipoidal reserves in both morphs.
   3. Developing a flight apparatus prolongs development and resulted in a 20% reduction in gonad size.
   4. The length of time for which aphids survived starvation was positively correlated with the relative size of their lipoidal reserves.
   5. The relative size of the lipoidal reserves appeared to be negatively correlated with habitat quality and positively correlated with habitat fragmentation.
   6. In accordance with theoretical predictions autolysis of wing muscles was correlated with a great increase in the size of the gonads and occurred in aphids that live in fragmented habitats.
   7. The ecological significance of these findings are discussed in the context of the way in which phytophagous insects, and aphids in particular, might perceive their environment.

AB Diatom valves and chrysophyte scales were analyzed in sediment cores to assess historical (post-1860) and recent (since 1970) trends in lake water pH, total [Al], and [Ni] in Lumsden, George, and Acid lakes (Killarney Provincial Park, Ontario). Although acidification in Lumsden and Acid lakes started in the 1930s, rapid acidification only occurred since the 1960s. As lake water pH declined, inferred [Al] greatly increased causing the extirpation of the sport fisheries. In nearby George Lake, acidification started in the 1920s, and inferred lake water pH declined about 0.5 of a pH unit by 1960. The fish community in George Lake survived where the inferred acidification was less severe than Acid and Lumsden lakes. As in previous paleolimnological studies, chrysophytes generally indicate earlier and more marked acidification trajectories when compared with trends inferred from diatoms, probably because the vernal blooming and euplanktonic chrysophytes are tracking spring pH depressions. Although all three lakes have acidified and metal concentrations have increased during this century, our study provides evidence that these lakes, located as far as 60 km away from Sudbury, are showing signs of biological and chemical recovery as a result of recent reductions in SO2 emissions from the Sudbury smelters.

AB Understanding the relationship between the geographical distribution of taxa and their environmental conditions is a key concept in ecology and conservation. The use of ensemble modelling methods for species distribution modelling (SDM) have been promoted over single algorithms such as Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt). Nevertheless, we suggest that in cases where data, technical support or computational power are limited, for example in developing countries, single algorithm methods produce robust and accurate distribution maps. We fit SDMs for 114 Egyptian medicinal plant species (nearly all native) with a total of 14,396 occurrence points. The predictive performances of eight single-algorithm methods (maxent, random forest (rf), support-vector machine (svm), maxlike, boosted regression trees (brt), classification and regression trees (cart), flexible discriminant analysis (fda) and generalised linear models (glm)) were compared to an ensemble modelling approach combining all eight algorithms. Predictions were based originally on the current climate, and then projected into the future time slice of 2050 based on four alternate climate change scenarios (A2a and B2a for CMIP3 and RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 for CMIP5). Ensemble modelling, MaxEnt and rf achieved the highest predictive performances based on AUC and TSS, while svm and cart had the poorest performance. There is high similarity in habitat suitability between MaxEnt and ensemble predictive maps for both current and future emission scenarios, but lower similarity between rf and ensemble, or rf and MaxEnt. We conclude that single-algorithm modelling methods, particularly MaxEnt, are capable of producing distribution maps of comparable accuracy to ensemble methods. Furthermore, the ease of use, reduced computational time and simplicity of methods like MaxEnt provides support for their use in scenarios when the choice of modelling methods, knowledge or computational power is limited but the need for robust and accurate conservation predictions is urgent.

AB Carbon dots (CDs), a novel member of the renowned carbon-based nanomaterials family, have gained tremendous attention in various fields. Their extraordinary properties, including facile synthesis procedure, photoluminescence, biocompatibility, tunable surface functionalities, water solubility and low toxicity, have introduced them extensively in biological applications, such as bioimaging, biosensing, photocatalysis and molecule delivery. Recently, CDs have attracted significant interest in agriculture to improve the growth and production of plants and great progress has been achieved in this area. Here, we will review the interactions of CDs with plant systems for the first time, including symptomatic plant growth, internal physiological processes and other external factors involved in plant growth. Furthermore, the current challenges and future perspective of CDs in the field of agriculture are discussed. Looking forward, it indicates that CDs might play an important role in the future of agriculture.

AB Plant interactions and feedbacks with soil microorganisms play an important role in sustaining the functions and stability of terrestrial ecosystems, yet the effects of tree species diversity on soil microbial community in forest ecosystems are still not well understood. Here, we examined the effects of tree species richness (1-12 species) and the presence of certain influential tree species (sampling effect) on soil bacterial and fungal communities in Chinese subtropical forests, using high-throughput Illumine sequencing for microbial identification. We observed that beta rather than alpha diversities of tree species and soil microorganisms were strong coupled. Multivariate regression and redundancy analyses revealed that the effects of tree species identity dominated over tree species richness on the diversity and composition of bacterial and fungal communities in both organic and top mineral soil horizons. Soil pH, nutrients and topography were always identified as significant predictors in the best multivariate models. Tree species have stronger effect on fungi than bacteria in organic soil, and on ectomycorrhizal fungi than saprotrophic fungi in mineral topsoil. Concluding, tree species identity, along with abiotic soil and topographical conditions, were more important factors determining the soil microbial communities in subtropical forests than tree diversity per se.

AB Agricultural methane and nitrous oxide emissions represent around 10-12% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions and have a key role to play in achieving a 1.5 degrees C (above pre-industrial) climate stabilization target. Using a multi-model assessment approach, we quantify the potential contribution of agriculture to the 1.5 degrees C target and decompose the mitigation potential by emission source, region and mitigation mechanism. The results show that the livestock sector will be vital to achieve emission reductions consistent with the 1.5 degrees C target mainly through emission-reducing technologies or structural changes. Agriculture may contribute emission reductions of 0.8-1.4 Gt of CO2-equivalent (CO(2)e) yr(-1) at just US$20 per tCO(2)e in 2050. Combined with dietary changes, emission reductions can be increased to 1.7-1.8 GtCO(2)e yr(-1). At carbon prices compatible with the 1.5 degrees C target, agriculture could even provide average emission savings of 3.9 GtCO(2)e yr(-1) in 2050, which represents around 8% of current GHG emissions.

AB Climate-change assessments project increasing precipitation variability through increased frequency of extreme events. However, the effects of interannual precipitation variance per se on ecosystem functioning have been largely understudied. Here, we report on the effects of interannual precipitation variability on the primary production of global drylands, which include deserts, steppes, shrublands, grasslands, and prairies and cover about 40% of the terrestrial earth surface. We used a global database that has 43 datasets, which are uniformly distributed in parameter space and each has at least 10 years of data. We found (a) that at the global scale, precipitation variability has a negative effect on aboveground net primary production. (b) Expected increases in interannual precipitation variability for the year 2,100 may result in a decrease of up to 12% of the global terrestrial carbon sink. (c) The effect of precipitation interannual variability on dryland productivity changes from positive to negative along a precipitation gradient. Arid sites with mean precipitation under 300 mm/year responded positively to increases in precipitation variability, whereas sites with mean precipitation over 300 mm/year responded negatively. We propose three complementary mechanisms to explain this result: (a) concave-up and concave-down precipitation-production relationships in arid vs. humid systems, (b) shift in the distribution of water in the soil profile, and (c) altered frequency of positive and negative legacies. Our results demonstrated that enhanced precipitation variability will have direct impacts on global drylands that can potentially affect the future terrestrial carbon sink.

AB The human-mediated introduction of marine non-indigenous species is a centuries-if not millennia-old phenomenon, but was only recently acknowledged as a potent driver of change in the sea. We provide a synopsis of key historical milestones for marine bioinvasions, including timelines of (a) discovery and understanding of the invasion process, focusing on transfer mechanisms and outcomes, (b) methodologies used for detection and monitoring, (c) approaches to ecological impacts research, and (d) management and policy responses. Early (until the mid-1900s) marine bioinvasions were given little attention, and in a number of cases actively and routinely facilitated. Beginning in the second half of the 20th century, several conspicuous non-indigenous species outbreaks with strong environmental, economic, and public health impacts raised widespread concerns and initiated shifts in public and scientific perceptions. These high-profile invasions led to policy documents and strategies to reduce the introduction and spread of non-indigenous species, although with significant time lags and limited success and focused on only a subset of transfer mechanisms. Integrated, multi-vector management within an ecosystem-based marine management context is urgently needed to address the complex interactions of natural and human pressures that drive invasions in marine ecosystems.

AB A key challenge in ecology is to understand how nutrients and light affect the biodiversity and community structure of phytoplankton and plant communities. According to resource competition models, ratios of limiting nutrients are major determinants of species composition. At high nutrient levels, however, species interactions may shift to competition for light, which might make nutrient ratios less relevant. The "nutrient-load hypothesis" merges these two perspectives, by extending the classic model of competition for two nutrients to include competition for light. Here, we test five key predictions of the nutrient-load hypothesis using multispecies competition experiments. A marine phytoplankton community sampled from the North Sea was inoculated in laboratory chemostats provided with different nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loads to induce either single resource limitation or co-limitation of N, P, and light. Four of the five predictions were validated by the experiments. In particular, different resource limitations favored the dominance of different species. Increasing nutrient loads caused changes in phytoplankton species composition, even if the N: P ratio of the nutrient loads remained constant, by shifting the species interactions from competition for nutrients to competition for light. In all treatments, small species became dominant whereas larger species were competitively excluded, supporting the common view that small cell size provides a competitive advantage under resource-limited conditions. Contrary to expectation, all treatments led to coexistence of diatoms, cyanobacteria and green algae, resulting in a higher diversity of species than predicted by theory. Because the coexisting species comprised three phyla with different photosynthetic pigments, we speculate that niche differentiation in the light spectrum might play a role. Our results show that mechanistic resource competition models that integrate nutrient-based and light-based approaches provide an important step forward to understand and predict how changing nutrient loads affect community composition.

AB Marine spatial planning (MSP) seeks to reduce conflicts and environmental impacts, and promote sustainable use of marine ecosystems. Existing MSP approaches have successfully determined how to achieve target levels of ocean area for particular uses while minimizing costs and impacts, but they do not provide a framework that derives analytical solutions in order to co-ordinate siting of multiple uses while balancing the effects of planning on each sector in the system. We develop such a framework for guiding offshore aquaculture (bivalve, finfish, and kelp farming) development in relation to existing sectors and environmental concerns (wild-capture fisheries, viewshed quality, benthic pollution, and disease spread) in California, USA. We identify > 250,000 MSP solutions that generate significant seafood supply and billions of dollars in revenue with minimal impacts (often <1%) on existing sectors and the environment. We filter solutions to identify candidate locations for high-value, low-impact aquaculture development. Finally, we confirm the expectation of substantial value of our framework over conventional planning focused on maximizing individual objectives.

AB Satellite remote sensing provides unmatched spatiotemporal information on vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP). Yet understanding of the relationship between GPP and remote sensing observations and how it changes with factors such as scale, biophysical constraint, and vegetation type remains limited. This knowledge gap is especially apparent for dryland ecosystems, which have characteristic high spatiotemporal variability and are under-represented by long-term field measurements. Here we utilize an eddy covariance (EC) data synthesis for southwestern North America in an assessment of how accurately satellite-derived vegetation proxies capture seasonal to interannual GPP dynamics across dryland gradients. We evaluate the enhanced vegetation index, solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), and the photochemical reflectivity index. We find evidence that SIF is more accurately capturing seasonal GPP dynamics particularly for evergreen-dominated EC sites and more accurately estimating the full magnitude of interannual GPP dynamics for all dryland EC sites. These results suggest that incorporation of SIF could significantly improve satellite-based GPP estimates.

AB 1. Rapid landscape alteration associated with human activity is currently challenging the evolved dynamical stability of many predator-prey systems by forcing species to behaviourally respond to novel environmental stimuli.
   2. In many forested systems, linear features (LFs) such as roads, pipelines and resource exploration lines (i.e. seismic lines) are a ubiquitous form of landscape alteration that have been implicated in altering predator-prey dynamics. One hypothesized effect is that LFs facilitate predator movement into and within prey refugia, thereby increasing predator-prey spatial overlap.
   3. We evaluated this hypothesis in a large mammal system, focusing on the interactions between boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) and their two main predators, wolves (Canis lupus) and black bears (Ursus americanus), during the calving season of caribou. In this system, LFs extend into and occur within peatlands (i.e. bogs and nutrient-poor fens), a habitat type highly used by caribou due to its refugia effects.
   4. Using resource selection analyses, we found that LFs increased predator selection of peatlands. Female caribou appeared to respond by avoiding LFs and areas with high LF density. However, in our study area, most caribou cannot completely avoid exposure to LFs and variation in female response had demographic effects. In particular, increasing proportional use of LFs by females negatively impacted survival of their neonate calves.
   5. Collectively, these results demonstrate how LFs can reduce the efficacy of prey refugia. Mitigating such effects will require limiting or restoring LFs within prey refugia, although the effectiveness of mitigation efforts will depend upon spatial scale, which in turn will be influenced by the life-history traits of predator and prey.

AB Bayesian methods have become very popular in molecular phylogenetics due to the availability of user-friendly software for running sophisticated models of evolution. However, Bayesian phylogenetic models are complex, and analyses are often carried out using default settings, which may not be appropriate. Here we summarize the major features of Bayesian phylogenetic inference and discuss Bayesian computation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, the diagnosis of an MCMC run, and ways of summarizing the MCMC sample. We discuss the specification of the prior, the choice of the substitution model and partitioning of the data. Finally, we provide a list of common Bayesian phylogenetic software packages and recommend appropriate applications.

AB Soil bacteria are very important in biogeochemical cycles and play significant role in soil-borne disease suppression. Although continuous cropping is responsible for soil-borne disease enrichment, its effect on tobacco plant health and how soil bacterial communities change are yet to be elucidated. In this study, soil bacterial communities across tobacco continuous cropping time-series fields were investigated through high-throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA genes. The results showed that long-term continuous cropping could significantly alter soil microbial communities. Bacterial diversity indices and evenness indices decreased over the monoculture span and obvious variations for community structures across the three time-scale tobacco fields were detected. Compared with the first year, the abundances of Arthrobacter and Lysobacter showed a significant decrease. Besides, the abundance of the pathogen Ralstonia spp. accumulated over the monoculture span and was significantly correlated with tobacco bacterial wilt disease rate. Moreover, Pearson's correlation demonstrated that the abundance of Arthrobacter and Lysobacter, which are considered to be beneficial bacteria had significant negative correlation with tobacco bacterial wilt disease. Therefore, after long-term continuous cropping, tobacco bacterial wilt disease could be ascribed to the alteration of the composition as well as the structure of the soil microbial community.

AB The mechanisms of community assembly are a central focus in the field of microbial ecology. However, to what extent these mechanisms differ in importance by traits of groups is poorly understood. Here we quantified the importance of neutral and niche processes in community assembly for bacteria, habitat specialists and generalists in 21 plateau lakes of China. Results showed that both neutral and niche processes played a critical role in the assembly of entire bacterial communities, shaping a unique biogeographical pattern. A few habitat generalists and many specialists were identified. Interestingly, habitat specialists were only governed by niche process, with seven significant environmental variables-salinity, dissolved oxygen, water transparency, total phosphorus, ammonium-nitrogen, temperature and total nitrogen-independently explaining 40.3% of the biological variation. By contrast, habitat generalists were strongly driven by neutral process, with 50.9% of the variation of detection frequency explained in neutral community model. Only three environmental variables-salinity, total nitrogen and dissolved oxygen-significantly affected the distribution of habitat generalists, independently explaining 13.6% of the variation. Governed by different assembly mechanisms, habitat specialists and generalists presented disparate biogeographical patterns. Our result emphasizes the importance of investigating the bacterial community assembly at more refined levels than entire communities.This work shows the biogeography of the entire bacterial communities, specialists and generalists in 21 lakes on Yungui Plateau, China and differentiates the assembly mechanisms for specialists and generalists.This work shows the biogeography of the entire bacterial communities, specialists and generalists in 21 lakes on Yungui Plateau, China and differentiates the assembly mechanisms for specialists and generalists.

AB The simplest theories often have much merit and many limitations, and, in this vein, the value of neutral theory (NT) of biodiversity has been the subject of much debate over the past 15 years. NT was proposed at the turn of the century by Stephen Hubbell to explain several patterns observed in the organization of ecosystems. Among ecologists, it had a polarizing effect: There were a few ecologists who were enthusiastic, and there were a larger number who firmly opposed it. Physicists and mathematicians, instead, welcomed the theory with excitement. Indeed, NT spawned several theoretical studies that attempted to explain empirical data and predicted trends of quantities that had not yet been studied. While there are a few reviews of NT oriented toward ecologists, the goal here is to review the quantitative aspects of NT and its extensions for physicists who are interested in learning what NT is, what its successes are, and what important problems remain unresolved. Furthermore, this review could also be of interest to theoretical ecologists because many potentially interesting results are buried in the vast NT literature. It is proposed to make these more accessible by extracting them and presenting them in a logical fashion. The focus of this review is broader than NT: new, more recent approaches for studying ecological systems and how one might introduce realistic non-neutral models are also discussed.

AB Elevational gradients provide powerful natural systems for testing hypotheses regarding the role of environmental variation in the evolution of life-history strategies. Case studies have revealed shifts towards slower life histories in organisms living at high elevations yet no synthetic analyses exist of elevational variation in life-history traits for major vertebrate clades. We examined (i) how life-history traits change with elevation in paired populations of bird species worldwide, and (ii) which biotic and abiotic factors drive elevational shifts in life history. Using three analytical methods, we found that fecundity declined at higher elevations due to smaller clutches and fewer reproductive attempts per year. By contrast, elevational differences in traits associated with parental investment or survival varied among studies. High-elevation populations had shorter and later breeding seasons, but longer developmental periods implying that temporal constraints contribute to reduced fecundity. Analyses of clutch size data, the trait for which we had the largest number of population comparisons, indicated no evidence that phylogenetic history constrained species-level plasticity in trait variation associated with elevational gradients. The magnitude of elevational shifts in life-history traits were largely unrelated to geographic (altitude, latitude), intrinsic (body mass, migratory status), or habitat covariates. Meta-population structure, methodological issues associated with estimating survival, or processes shaping range boundaries could potentially explain the nature of elevational shifts in life-history traits evident in this data set. We identify a new risk factor for montane populations in changing climates: low fecundity will result in lower reproductive potential to recover from perturbations, especially as fewer than half of the species experienced higher survival at higher elevations.

AB PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) are used as proxies for the net carbon balance of trees and as indicators of carbon starvation resulting from environmental stress. Woody organs are the largest NSC-storing compartments in forest ecosystems; therefore, it is essential to understand the factors that affect the size of this important storage pool. In wood, NSC are predominantly deposited in ray and axial parenchyma (RAP); however, direct links between nutrient storage and RAP anatomy have not yet been established. Here, we tested whether the NSC storage capacity of wood is influenced by the amount of RAP.
   METHODS: We measured NSC concentrations and RAP fractions in root and stem sapwood of 12 temperate species sampled at the onset of winter dormancy and in stem sapwood of four tropical trees growing in an evergreen lowland rainforest. The patterns of starch distribution were visualized by staining with Lugol's solution.
   KEY RESULTS: The concentration of NSCs in sapwood of temperate trees scales tightly with the amount of RAP and living fibers (LFs), with almost all RAP and LFs being densely packed with starch grains. In contrast, the tropical species had lower NSC concentrations despite their higher RAP and LFs fraction and had considerable interspecific differences in starch distribution.
   CONCLUSIONS: The differences in RAP and LFs abundance affect the ability of sapwood to store NSC in temperate trees, whereas a more diverse set of functions of RAP might be pronounced in species growing in a tropical environment with little seasonality.

AB Background: Although hybridization is thought to be relatively rare in animals, the raw genetic material introduced via introgression may play an important role in fueling adaptation and adaptive radiation. The butterfly genus Heliconius is an excellent system to study hybridization and introgression but most studies have focused on closely related species such as H. cydno and H. melpomene. Here we characterize genome-wide patterns of introgression between H. besckei, the only species with a red and yellow banded 'postman' wing pattern in the tiger-striped silvaniform clade, and co-mimetic H. melpomene nanna.
   Results: We find a pronounced signature of putative introgression from H. melpomene into H. besckei in the genomic region upstream of the gene optix, known to control red wing patterning, suggesting adaptive introgression of wing pattern mimicry between these two distantly related species. At least 39 additional genomic regions show signals of introgression as strong or stronger than this mimicry locus. Gene flow has been on-going, with evidence of gene exchange at multiple time points, and bidirectional, moving from the melpomene to the silvaniform clade and vice versa. The history of gene exchange has also been complex, with contributions from multiple silvaniform species in addition to H. besckei. We also detect a signature of ancient introgression of the entire Z chromosome between the silvaniform and melpomene/cydno clades.
   Conclusions: Our study provides a genome-wide portrait of introgression between distantly related butterfly species. We further propose a comprehensive and efficient workflow for gene flow identification in genomic data sets.

AB Biological factors that influence the host range and spillover of Ebola virus (EBOV) and other filoviruses remain enigmatic. While filoviruses infect diverse mammalian cell lines, we report that cells from African straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) are refractory to EBOV infection. This could be explained by a single amino acid change in the filovirus receptor, NPC1, which greatly reduces the affinity of EBOV-NPC1 interaction. We found signatures of positive selection in bat NPC1 concentrated at the virus-receptor interface, with the strongest signal at the same residue that controls EBOV infection in Eidolon helvum cells. Our work identifies NPC1 as a genetic determinant of filovirus susceptibility in bats, and suggests that some NPC1 variations reflect host adaptations to reduce filovirus replication and virulence. A single viral mutation afforded escape from receptor control, revealing a pathway for compensatory viral evolution and a potential avenue for expansion of filovirus host range in nature.

AB Citizen science is a useful approach for conducting scientific research; however, an understanding of the motivations, satisfactions, and other aspects of volunteers' psychology is essential for conservation scientists wishing to mobilize this resource. We tested psychometric instruments for assessing the motivations, satisfactions, and advocacy role of volunteers with the Second Southern African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP2). Data were collected through stakeholder and volunteer surveys, and focus groups with the program's management. Qualitative and quantitative data analysis included content analysis, statistical tests of internal consistency, and factor analysis. An inventory, the Environmental Volunteer Functions Inventory (EVFI), was tested for assessing volunteer motivations along with scales for assessing volunteer satisfaction and level of advocacy. These scales revealed that volunteers in SABAP2 are satisfied with the program and exhibit behaviors suggesting they act as advocates for the program. Insights and a platform for adaptive management are provided for managers of the social dimensions of citizen science and other conservation programs.

AB Cities concentrate risks and the adverse effects of dense populations, such as outdoor air pollution, chronic disease and the impact of extreme weather events. Governments and planning bodies struggle to heed and apply the abundance of unintegrated research that links aspects of the urban environment with urban residents' wellbeing. In order to promote human wellbeing in cities, a number of key features of the urban environment should be promoted. The medical science, urban ecology and urban design research already recognises the importance of some aspects, including providing walkable spaces, community space and greenspace. We argue that in practice, the provision of these three features is insufficient for human wellbeing. Emerging research demonstrates the importance of biodiversity and ecosystem functions to wellbeing. This paper outlines the concept of wellbeing and provides a summary of the three established features of urban environments that enhance residents' lives: the provision of walkable, community and greenspace. We then outline the importance of two vital but often overlooked links in the discussion of how urban planning contributes to wellbeing: biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Until governments and policies recognise the importance of these two elements, urban design and management for wellbeing is at best simplistic. It is important for biodiversity and ecosystem function to be considered during the design decision process. Urban designers and ecologists should recognise that their work has the potential to contribute to human wellbeing by integrating biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in their research.

AB Aim To quantify spatio-temporal changes in species richness and assemblage composition of Danish butterflies over more than 100 years and to assess whether different functional groups of butterflies show different temporal trajectories.
   Location Denmark, Europe.
   Methods We applied species accumulation curves to estimate relative species richness changes from unequally sampled occurrence records, collected over more than a century (1900-2012), at local (i.e. 10 km x 10 km) and regional (country-wide) spatial scales. Furthermore, we calculated similarity in species composition between 10 km x 10 km grid cells to evaluate changes in assemblage composition (i.e. biotic homogenization) of butterflies through space and time. Trends were evaluated for all butterflies as well as for three functional groups, using hierarchical clustering and species-specific values of eight ecological traits.
   Results We document severe declines in butterfly diversity over the last century, with substantial regional-scale extinctions leading to a net loss of 10% of all Danish butterfly species. Segregating species into functional groups showed that the highest rate of regional extinction occurred among sedentary habitat specialists overwintering in the egg stage, while the most severe local-scale declines occurred among sedentary host plant specialists overwintering in the larval stage. In contrast, mobile generalist species with mature overwintering stages showed stable richness trends throughout the century. However, a pervasive spatio-temporal biotic homogenization of butterfly assemblages was revealed for all functional groups.
   Main conclusions Our results suggest that observed changes in species richness were driven by a gradual replacement of ecological specialists by broadly adapted ecological generalists. In addition to drawing attention to a severe long-term impoverishment of the Danish butterfly fauna, our results suggest that trajectories of butterfly species richness and assemblage composition over the last century are related to multiple functional traits, highlighting the need to consider different aspects of ecological specialization when assessing extinction risk.

AB The sustainable delivery of multiple ecosystem services requires the management of functionally diverse biological communities. In an agricultural context, an emphasis on food production has often led to a loss of biodiversity to the detriment of other ecosystem services such as the maintenance of soil health and pest regulation. In scenarios where multiple species can be grown together, it may be possible to better balance environmental and agronomic services through the targeted selection of companion species. We used the case study of legume-based cover crops to engineer a plant community that delivered the optimal balance of six ecosystem services: early productivity, regrowth following mowing, weed suppression, support of invertebrates, soil fertility building (measured as yield of following crop), and conservation of nutrients in the soil. An experimental species pool of 12 cultivated legume species was screened for a range of functional traits and ecosystem services at five sites across a geographical gradient in the United Kingdom. All possible species combinations were then analyzed, using a process-based model of plant competition, to identify the community that delivered the best balance of services at each site. In our system, low to intermediate levels of species richness (one to four species) that exploited functional contrasts in growth habit and phenology were identified as being optimal. The optimal solution was determined largely by the number of species and functional diversity represented by the starting species pool, emphasizing the importance of the initial selection of species for the screening experiments. The approach of using relationships between functional traits and ecosystem services to design multifunctional biological communities has the potential to inform the design of agricultural systems that better balance agronomic and environmental services and meet the current objective of European agricultural policy to maintain viable food production in the context of the sustainable management of natural resources.

TI Long-Lasting Effects of Early-Life Antibiotic Treatment and Routine

SO PLOS ONE

AB Background
   In intensive pig husbandry systems, antibiotics are frequently administrated during early life stages to prevent respiratory and gastro-intestinal tract infections, often in combination with stressful handlings. The immediate effects of these treatments on microbial colonization and immune development have been described recently. Here we studied whether the early life administration of antibiotics has long-lasting effects on the pig's intestinal microbial community and on gut functionality.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   To investigate the long-lasting effect of early-life treatment, piglets were divided into three different groups receiving the following treatments: 1) no antibiotics and no stress, 2) antibiotics and no stress, and 3) antibiotics and stress. All treatments were applied at day four after birth. Sampling of jejunal content for community scale microbiota analysis, and jejunal and ileal tissue for genome-wide transcription profiling, was performed at day 55 (similar to 8 weeks) and day 176 (similar to 25 weeks) after birth. Antibiotic treatment in combination with or without exposure to stress was found to have long-lasting effects on host intestinal gene expression involved in a multitude of processes, including immune related processes.
   Conclusions/Significance
   The results obtained in this study indicate that early life (day 4 after birth) perturbations have long-lasting effects on the gut system, both in gene expression (day 55) as well as on microbiota composition (day 176). At day 55 high variance was observed in the microbiota data, but no significant differences between treatment groups, which is most probably due to the newly acquired microbiota during and right after weaning (day 28). Based on the observed difference in gene expression at day 55, it is hypothesized that due to the difference in immune programming during early life, the systems respond differently to the post-weaning newly acquired microbiota. As a consequence, the gut systems of the treatment groups develop into different homeostasis.

AB In efforts to increase human well-being while maintaining the natural systems and processes upon which we depend, navigating the trade-offs that can arise between different ecosystem services is a profound challenge. We evaluated a recently developed simple analytic framework for assessing ecosystem service trade-offs, which characterizes such trade-offs in terms of their underlying biophysical constraints as well as divergences in stakeholders' values for the services in question. Through a workshop and subsequent discussions, we identified four different types of challenging situations under which the framework allows important insights to clarify the nature of stakeholder conflicts, obstacles to promoting more sustainable outcomes, and potential enabling factors to promote efficiency and sustainability of ecosystem service yields. We illustrated the framework's analytical steps by applying them to case studies representing three of the challenging situations. We explored the fourth challenging situation conceptually, using published literature for examples. We examined the potential utility and feasibility of using the framework as a participatory tool in resource management and conflict resolution. We concluded that the framework can be instrumental for promoting pluralism and insightful analysis of trade-offs. The insights offered here may be viewed as hypotheses to be tested and refined as additional unforeseen challenges and benefits are revealed as the framework is put into practice.

AB The geographic ranges of closely related species can vary dramatically, yet we do not fully grasp the mechanisms underlying such variation. The niche breadth hypothesis posits that species that have evolved broad environmental tolerances can achieve larger geographic ranges than species with narrow environmental tolerances. In turn, plasticity and genetic variation in ecologically important traits and adaptation to environmentally variable areas can facilitate the evolution of broad environmental tolerance. We used five pairs of western North American monkeyflowers to experimentally test these ideas by quantifying performance across eight temperature regimes. In four species pairs, species with broader thermal tolerances had larger geographic ranges, supporting the niche breadth hypothesis. As predicted, species with broader thermal tolerances also had more within-population genetic variation in thermal reaction norms and experienced greater thermal variation across their geographic ranges than species with narrow thermal tolerances. Species with narrow thermal tolerance may be particularly vulnerable to changing climatic conditions due to lack of plasticity and insufficient genetic variation to respond to novel selection pressures. Conversely, species experiencing high variation in temperature across their ranges may be buffered against extinction due to climatic changes because they have evolved tolerance to a broad range of temperatures.

AB Species distribution models are increasingly used to address conservation questions, so their predictive capacity requires careful evaluation. Previous studies have shown how individual factors used in model construction can affect prediction. Although some factors probably have negligible effects compared to others, their relative effects are largely unknown. We introduce a general 'virtual ecologist' framework to study the relative importance of factors involved in the construction of species distribution models. We illustrate the framework by examining the relative importance of five key factors - a missing covariate, spatial autocorrelation due to a dispersal process in presences/absences, sample size, sampling design and modelling technique - in a real study framework based on virtual plants in a mountain landscape at regional scale, and show that, for the parameter values considered here, most of the variation in prediction accuracy is due to sample size and modelling technique. Contrary to repeatedly reported concerns, spatial autocorrelation has only comparatively small effects. This study shows the importance of using a nested statistical framework to evaluate the relative effects of factors that may affect species distribution models.

AB The aim of the present work was to assess the conservation status of coastal dune systems in Tuscany (Italy). Emphasis was given to the presence and abundance of plant communities identified as habitat in accordance with the Directive 92/43/EEC. Twenty transects perpendicular to the shoreline were randomly positioned on the whole coastal area (30 km in length) in order to sample the full spectrum of plant communities. Vegetation zonation and relationships with the most frequent disturbance factors in the study area-beach cleaning, coastline erosion, presence of paths and roads, bathing settlements and trampling-were investigated through principal coordinate analysis and canonical correspondence analysis. Natural factors, such as distance from the sea and total length, were also considered. Differences in the conservation status of the sites were found, ranging from the total disappearance of the foredune habitats to the presence of the complete psammophilous (sand-loving) plant communities. Erosion, trampling, and paths were found to be closely correlated with degradation and habitat loss. Furthermore, the overall plant species diversity of dunes was measured with NHDune, a modified version of the Shannon index; while the incidence of invasive taxa was calculated using N, a naturalness index. However, these diversity indices proved to be a weaker bioindicator of ecosystem integrity than habitat composition along transects. A possible strategy for the conservation and management of these coastal areas could be to protect the foredunes from erosion and limit trampling through the installation of footbridges or the use of appropriate fences.

AB This paper illustrates a typology of 14 natural and anthropogenic hazards, the evidence for their causes and consequences for society and their role as vectors of change in estuaries, vulnerable coasts and marine areas. It uses hazard as the potential that there will be damage to the natural or human system and so is the product of an event which could occur and the probability of it occurring whereas the degree of risk then relates to the amount of assets, natural or societal, which may be affected. We give long- and short-term and large- and small-scale perspectives showing that the hazards leading to disasters for society will include flooding, erosion and tsunamis. Global examples include the effects of wetland loss and the exacerbation of problems by building on vulnerable coasts. Hence we emphasise the importance of considering hazard and risk on such coasts and consider the tools for assessing and managing the impacts of risk and hazard. These allow policy-makers to determine the consequences for natural and human systems. We separate locally-derived problems from large-scale effects (e.g. climate change, sea-level rise and isostatic rebound); we emphasise that the latter unmanaged exogenic pressures require a response to the consequences rather than the causes whereas within a management area there are endogenic managed pressures in which we address both to causes and consequences. The problems are put into context by assessing hazards and the conflicts between different uses and users and hence the management responses needed. We emphasise that integrated and sustainable management of the hazards and risk requires 10-tenets to be fulfilled. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Urban green spaces, such as forest fragments, vacant lots, and community gardens, are increasingly highlighted as biodiversity refuges and are of growing interest to conservation. At the same time, the burgeoning urban garden movement partially seeks to ameliorate problems of food security. Arthropods link these two issues (conservation and food security) given their abundance, diversity, and role as providers of ecosystem services like pollination and pest control. Many previous studies of urban arthropods focused on a single taxon (e.g. order or family), and examined either local habitat drivers or effects of landscape characteristics. In contrast, we examined both local and landscape drivers of community patterns, and examined differences in abundance, richness, and trophic structure of arthropod communities in urban forest fragments, vacant lots, and community gardens. We sampled ground-foraging arthropods, collected data on 24 local habitat features (e.g., vegetation, ground cover, concrete), and examined land-cover types within 2 km of 12 study sites in Toledo, Ohio. We found that abundance and richness of urban arthropods differed by habitat type and that richness of ants and spiders, in particular, varied among lots, gardens, and forests. Several local and landscape factors correlated with changes in abundance, richness, and trophic composition of arthropods, and different factors were important for specific arthropod groups. Overwhelmingly, local factors were the predominant (80 % of interactions) driver of arthropods in this urban environment. These results indicate that park managers and gardeners alike may be able to manage forests and gardens to promote biodiversity of desired organisms and potentially improve ecosystem services within the urban landscape.

AB What shapes variation in genetic structure within a community of codistributed species is a central but difficult question for the field of population genetics. With a focus on the isolated coral reef ecosystem of the Hawaiian Archipelago, we assessed how life history traits influence population genetic structure for 35 reef animals. Despite the archipelago's stepping stone configuration, isolation by distance was the least common type of genetic structure, detected in four species. Regional structuring (i.e. division of sites into genetically and spatially distinct regions) was most common, detected in 20 species and nearly in all endemics and habitat specialists. Seven species displayed chaotic (spatially unordered) structuring, and all were nonendemic generalist species. Chaotic structure also associated with relatively high global FST. Pelagic larval duration (PLD) was not a strong predictor of variation in population structure (R2=0.22), but accounting for higher FST values of chaotic and invertebrate species, compared to regionally structured and fish species, doubled the power of PLD to explain variation in global FST (adjusted R2=0.50). Multivariate correlation of eight species traits to six genetic traits highlighted dispersal ability, taxonomy (i.e. fish vs. invertebrate) and habitat specialization as strongest influences on genetics, but otherwise left much variation in genetic traits unexplained. Considering that the study design controlled for many sampling and geographical factors, the extreme interspecific variation in spatial genetic patterns observed for Hawaii marine species may be generated by demographic variability due to species-specific abundance and migration patterns and/or seascape and historical factors.

TI Effects of land use/land cover and climate changes on terrestrial net

AB Land use/land cover change (LULCC) and climate change are among the primary driving forces for terrestrial ecosystem productivity, but their impacts are confounded. The objective of this paper is to decouple the effects of LULCC and climate change on terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP) in China's Yangtze River Basin (YRB) during 2001-2010 using a light use efficiency model through different scenario designs. During the study period, the YRB witnessed tremendous LULCC and climate changes. A prominent LULCC was the conversion of shrub land to forests as a result of a series of forest restoration and protection programs implemented in the basin. At the same time, notable warming and drying trends were observed based on ground and satellite measurements. Prescribed model simulations indicated that LULCC alone had a significantly positive effect on total NPP (up to 6.1 Tg C yr(-1), p < 0.01) mainly due to reforestation and forest protection, while climate change alone showed an overall negative effect in the basin (as much as -2.7 Tg C yr(-1), p = 0.11). The ensemble effect of LULCC and climate change on total NPP is approximately 3.9 Tg C yr(-1) (p = 0.26) during 2001-2010. Our study provides an improved understanding of the effects of LULCC and climate change on terrestrial ecosystem productivity in the YRB. We found that reforestation and forest protection could significantly enhance terrestrial ecosystem productivity, a strategy that could mitigate global warming. It also suggests that NPP models with static land use/land cover could lead to increasingly large errors with time.

AB Disruption to species-interaction networks caused by irruptions of herbivores and mesopredators following extirpation of apex predators is a global driver of ecosystem reorganization and biodiversity loss. Most studies of apex predators' ecological roles focus on effects arising from their interactions with herbivores or mesopredators in isolation, but rarely consider how the effects of herbivores and mesopredators interact. Here, we provide evidence that multiple cascade pathways induced by lethal control of an apex predator, the dingo, drive unintended shifts in forest ecosystem structure. We compared mammal assemblages and understorey structure at seven sites in southern Australia. Each site comprised an areawhere dingoes were poisoned and an area without control. The effects of dingo control on mammals scaled with body size. Activity of herbivorous macropods, arboreal mammals and a mesopredator, the red fox, were greater, but understorey vegetation sparser and abundances of small mammals lower, where dingoes were controlled. Structural equation modelling suggested that both predation by foxes and depletion of understorey vegetation by macropods were related to small mammal decline at poisoned sites. Our study suggests that apex predators' suppressive effects on herbivores and mesopredators occur simultaneously and should be considered in tandem in order to appreciate the extent of apex predators' indirect effects.

AB The emphasis on participatory environmental management within international development has started to overcome critiques of traditional exclusionary environmental policy, aligning with shifts towards decentralisation and community empowerment. However, questions are raised regarding the extent to which participation in project design and implementation is meaningful and really engages communities in the process. Calls have been made for further local-level (project and community-scale) research to identify practices that can increase the likelihood of meaningful community engagement within externally initiated projects. This paper presents data from three community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) project case studies from southern Africa, which promote Joint Forest Management (JFM), tree planting for carbon and conservation agriculture. Data collection was carried out through semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, community-level meetings, focus groups and interviews. We find that an important first step for a meaningful community engagement process is to define 'community' in an open and participatory manner. Two-way communication at all stages of the community engagement process is shown to be critical, and charismatic leadership based on mutual respect and clarity of roles and responsibilities is vital to improve the likelihood of participants developing understanding of project aims and philosophy. This can lead to successful project outcomes through community ownership of the project goals and empowerment in project implementation. Specific engagement methods are found to be less important than the contextual and environmental factors associated with each project, but consideration should be given to identifying appropriate methods to ensure community representation. Our findings extend current thinking on the evaluation of participation by making explicit links between the community engagement process and project outcomes, and by identifying further criteria that can be considered in process and outcome-based evaluations. We highlight good practices for future CBNRM projects which can be used by project designers and initiators to further the likelihood of successful project outcomes.

AB Large carnivores adjust their daily movement patterns in response to environmental factors and/or human disturbance, and often respond differently across their distribution range. Whether such behavioral plasticity is due to environmental or anthropogenic factors has not yet been fully clarified. Beyond large carnivore conservation and management, understanding behavioral changes in the movement patterns of these elusive species may prove useful to evaluate anthropogenic influences on ecosystems. We used 696 318 GPS locations from 105 radio-collared brown bears in 3 study areas in Sweden to construct daily bear movement patterns, calculating the distance traveled by the bears every 30 min. We used a Bayesian approach to analyze whether human and/or road density around bear locations could explain observed differences in bear movement patterns among the areas. Proximity to settlements, a proxy of the generally low human density in Scandinavian bear range, did not influence circadian bear movements. However, bears moved most in the nocturnal and twilight hours and less during daytime in areas with higher road density, compared to roadless areas. Human-caused behavioral changes in large carnivores may have potential ecosystem-level consequences, given the key ecological role that these species can play in ecosystems. Limiting the creation and use of roads is necessary to maintain large carnivore distribution ranges and movement corridors, reduce human-caused mortality, and minimize human-induced disturbance that modifies carnivore behavior.

AB Given the budgetary restrictions on scientific research and the increasing need to better inform conservation actions, it is important to identify the patterns and causes of biases in research effort. We combine bibliometric information from a literature review of almost 16,500 peer-reviewed publications on a well-known group of 286 species, the Order Carnivora, with global datasets on species' life history and ecological traits to explore patterns in research effort. Our study explores how species' characteristics influenced the degree to which they were studied ( measured as the number of publications). We identified a wide variation in intensity of research effort at both Family and Species levels, with some of the least studied being those which may need protection in future. Our findings hint at the complex role of human perspectives in setting research agendas. We found that better-studied species tended to be large-bodied and have a large geographic range whilst omnivory had a negative relationship with research effort. IUCN threat status did not exhibit a strong relationship with research effort which suggests that the conservation needs of individual species are not major drivers of research interest. This work is the first to use a combination of bibliometric analysis and biological data to quantify and interpret gaps in research knowledge across an entire Order. Our results could be combined with other resources, such as Biodiversity Action Plans, to prioritise and co-ordinate future research effort, whilst our methods can be applied across many scientific disciplines to describe knowledge gaps.

AB The classification of plant species according to the CSR ecological strategy scheme has been proposed as a common language that allows comparison among species, communities, and floras. Although several studies on European continent have demonstrated a consistent association between CSR strategies and key ecosystem processes, studies of this type are still lacking in other ecoregions worldwide. For the first time, the CSR strategy scheme is applied in a tropical plant community. In a Brazilian mountain grassland ecosystem characterized by both high biodiversity and environmental stress, we sampled various functional traits of 48 herbaceous species in stony and sandy grasslands, and evaluated the relationship between CSR strategies and functional traits with several environmental parameters. The extremely infertile soils in the two studied habitats may have acted as a major environmental filter leading to a clear predominance of the stress-tolerant strategy in both communities. However, fine-scale environmental differences between the two communities resulted in the filtering of distinct functional trait values. The sites with coarser soil texture, lower percentage of plant cover and (paradoxically) higher mineral nutrient concentrations favored plants with narrower leaves, higher stress tolerance, lower competitiveness, and higher sclerophylly (i.e., lower specific leaf area and higher leaf dry matter content). The comparison between the functional character of stony and sandy communities evidenced the influence of soil texture and water availability in the environmental filtering. This study highlighted the validity of the CSR classification outside the temperate region where it was originally developed and corroborated.

AB The federally threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) is the focus of intensive conservation efforts that have led to much forested land being reserved as habitat for the owl and associated wildlife species throughout the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Recently, however, a relatively new threat to spotted owls has emerged in the form of an invasive competitor: the congeneric barred owl (S. varia). As barred owls have rapidly expanded their populations into the entire range of the northern spotted owl, mounting evidence indicates that they are displacing, hybridizing with, and even killing spotted owls. The range expansion by barred owls into western North America has made an already complex conservation issue even more contentious, and a lack of information on the ecological relationships between the 2 species has hampered recovery efforts for northern spotted owls. We investigated spatial relationships, habitat use, diets, survival, and reproduction of sympatric spotted owls and barred owls in western Oregon, USA, during 2007-2009. Our overall objective was to determine the potential for and possible consequences of competition for space, habitat, and food between these previously allopatric owl species. Our study included 29 spotted owls and 28 barred owls that were radio-marked in 36 neighboring territories and monitored over a 24-month period. Based on repeated surveys of both species, the number of territories occupied by pairs of barred owls in the 745-km(2) study area (82) greatly outnumbered those occupied by pairs of spotted owls (15). Estimates of mean size of home ranges and core-use areas of spotted owls (1,843ha and 305ha, respectively) were 2-4 times larger than those of barred owls (581ha and 188ha, respectively). Individual spotted and barred owls in adjacent territories often had overlapping home ranges, but interspecific space sharing was largely restricted to broader foraging areas in the home range with minimal spatial overlap among core-use areas. We used an information-theoretic approach to rank discrete-choice models representing alternative hypotheses about the influence of forest conditions, topography, and interspecific interactions on species-specific patterns of nighttime resource selection. Spotted owls spent a disproportionate amount of time foraging on steep slopes in ravines dominated by old (>120 yr) conifer trees. Barred owls used available forest types more evenly than spotted owls, and were most strongly associated with patches of large hardwood and conifer trees that occupied relatively flat areas along streams. Spotted and barred owls differed in the relative use of old conifer forest (greater for spotted owls) and slope conditions (steeper slopes for spotted owls), but we found no evidence that the 2 species differed in their use of young, mature, and riparian-hardwood forest types. Mean overlap in proportional use of different forest types between individual spotted owls and barred owls in adjacent territories was 81% (range=30-99%). The best model of habitat use for spotted owls indicated that the relative probability of a location being used was substantially reduced if the location was within or in close proximity to a core-use area of a barred owl. We used pellet analysis and measures of food-niche overlap to determine the potential for dietary competition between spatially associated pairs of spotted owls and barred owls.
   We identified 1,223 prey items from 15 territories occupied by spotted owls and 4,299 prey items from 24 territories occupied by barred owls. Diets of both species were dominated by nocturnal mammals, but diets of barred owls included many terrestrial, aquatic, and diurnal prey species that were rare or absent in diets of spotted owls. Northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus), woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes, N. cinerea), and lagomorphs (Lepus americanus, Sylvilagus bachmani) were primary prey for both owl species, accounting for 81% and 49% of total dietary biomass for spotted owls and barred owls, respectively. Mean dietary overlap between pairs of spotted and barred owls in adjacent territories was moderate (42%; range=28-70%). Barred owls displayed demographic superiority over spotted owls; annual survival probability of spotted owls from known-fate analyses (0.81, SE=0.05) was lower than that of barred owls (0.92, SE=0.04), and pairs of barred owls produced an average of 4.4 times more young than pairs of spotted owls over a 3-year period. We found a strong, positive relationship between seasonal (6-month) survival probabilities of both species and the proportion of old (>120 yr) conifer forest within individual home ranges, which suggested that availability of old forest was a potential limiting factor in the competitive relationship between these 2 species. The annual number of young produced by spotted owls increased linearly with increasing distance from a territory center of a pair of barred owls, and all spotted owls that attempted to nest within 1.5km of a nest used by barred owls failed to successfully produce young. We identified strong associations between the presence of barred owls and the behavior and fitness potential of spotted owls, as shown by changes in movements, habitat use, and reproductive output of spotted owls exposed to different levels of spatial overlap with territorial barred owls. When viewed collectively, our results support the hypothesis that interference competition with barred owls for territorial space can constrain the availability of critical resources required for successful recruitment and reproduction of spotted owls. Availability of old forests and associated prey species appeared to be the most strongly limiting factors in the competitive relationship between these species, indicating that further loss of these conditions can lead to increases in competitive pressure. Our findings have broad implications for the conservation of spotted owls, as they suggest that spatial heterogeneity in vital rates may not arise solely because of differences among territories in the quality or abundance of forest habitat, but also because of the spatial distribution of a newly established competitor. Experimental removal of barred owls could be used to test this hypothesis and determine whether localized control of barred owl numbers is an ecologically practical and socio-politically acceptable management tool to consider in conservation strategies for spotted owls.

AB Premise of the study: Plant species differ widely in the leaf biomass invested per unit area (LMA). LMA can be explained by variation in leaf thickness and/ or density, both of which are infl uenced by anatomical tissue composition. The aim of this study is to quantify the anatomical characteristics that underlie variation in LMA in a range of woody species.
   Methods: Twenty-six woody species, forming 13 species pairs with a deciduous and evergreen species from the same genus or family, were grown in a glasshouse. The youngest full-grown leaves were analyzed for LMA and morpho-anatomical characteristics at leaf, tissue, and cell level.
   Key Results: Considered over all species studied, leaf thickness and density were equally important to explain the variation in LMA, but the class difference between deciduous and evergreen species was mainly determined by thickness, whereas variation within each group was largely due to density. Evergreens had thicker leaves, predominantly caused by a larger volume of mesophyll and air spaces, whereas the higher leaf density within each group was due to a lower proportion of epidermis and air spaces, and overall smaller cells.
   Conclusions: The anatomical basis for variation in LMA in woody species depends on the contrast made. Higher LMA in evergreens is mainly due to a greater leaf thickness, caused by a larger volume of mesophyll and air spaces. Within deciduous species and evergreens, higher LMA is caused by a higher density, due to higher volumetric fractions of mesophyll and lower fractions of air spaces and epidermis.

AB Early in speciation, as populations undergo the transition from local adaptation to incipient species, is when a number of transient, but potentially important, processes appear to be most easily detected. These include signatures of selective sweeps that can point to asymmetry in selection between habitats, divergence hitchhiking, and associations of adaptive genes with environments. In a genomic comparison of ecotypes of the prairie sunflower, Helianthus petiolaris, occurring at Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve (Colorado), we found that selective sweeps were mainly restricted to the dune ecotype and that there was variation across the genome in whether proximity to the nondune population constrained or promoted divergence. The major regions of divergence were few and large between ecotypes, in contrast with an interspecific comparison between H. petiolaris and a sympatric congener, Helianthus annuus. In general, the large regions of divergence observed in the ecotypic comparison swamped locus-specific associations with environmental variables. In both comparisons, regions of high divergence occurred in portions of the genetic map with high marker density, probably reflecting regions of low recombination. The difference in genomic distributions of highly divergent regions between ecotypic and interspecific comparisons highlights the value of studies spanning the spectrum of speciation in related taxa.

AB Accurate estimation of gross primary production (GPP) of savanna woodlands is needed for evaluating the terrestrial carbon cycle at various spatial and temporal scales. The eddy covariance (EC) technique provides continuous measurements of net CO2 exchange (NEE) between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. Only a few flux tower sites were run in Africa and very limited observational data of savanna woodlands in Africa are available. Although several publications have reported on the seasonal dynamics and interannual variation of GPP of savanna vegetation through partitioning the measured NEE data, current knowledge about GPP and phenology of savanna ecosystems is still limited. This study focused on two savanna woodland flux tower sites in Botswana and Zambia, representing two dominant savanna woodlands (mopane and miombo) and climate patterns (semi-arid and semi-humid) in Southern Africa. Phenology of these savanna woodlands was delineated from three vegetation indices derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and GPP estimated from eddy covariance measurements at flux tower sites (GPP(EC)). The Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), which is driven by satellite images and meteorological data, was also evaluated, and the results showed that the VPM-based GPP estimates (GPP(VPM)) were able to track the seasonal dynamics of GPP(EC). The total GPP(VPM) and GPP(EC) within the plant growing season defined by a water-related vegetation index differed within the range of +/- 6%. This study suggejts that the VPM is a valuable tool for estimating GPP of semi-arid and semi-humid savanna woodland ecosystems in Southern Africa. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB There are two reasons why researchers are interested in the phenotypic relationship between the expression of male secondary sexual characters (SSCs) and ejaculate quality' (defined as sperm/ejaculate traits that are widely assumed to increase female fertility and/or sperm competitiveness). First, if the relationship is positive then females could gain a direct benefit by choosing more attractive males for fertility assurance reasons (the phenotype-linked fertility' hypothesis). Second, there is much interest in the direction of the correlation between traits favoured by pre-copulatory sexual selection (i.e. affecting mating success) and those favoured by post-copulatory sexual selection (i.e. increasing sperm competitiveness). If the relationship is negative this could lead to the two forms of selection counteracting each other. Theory predicts that the direction of the relationship could be either positive or negative depending on the underlying genetic variance and covariance in each trait, the extent of variation among males in condition (resources available to allocate to reproductive traits), and variation among males in the cost or rate of mating. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the average relationship between the expression of behavioural and morphological male secondary sexual characters and four assays of ejaculate quality (sperm number, viability, swimming speed and size). Regardless of how the data were partitioned the mean relationship was consistently positive, but always statistically non-significant. The only exception was that secondary sexual character expression was weakly but significantly positively correlated with sperm viability (r=0.07, P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the strength or direction of the relationship between behavioural and morphological SSCs, nor among relationships using the four ejaculate quality assays. The implications of our findings are discussed.

AB Aim Evolutionary radiations into novel areas or niches require innovative adaptations. However, rapid subsequent changes in these novel conditions might demand rapid re-adaptations to secure population persistence and prevent extinction. We propose that reptilian viviparity (live birth) is consistent with such a scenario. Using the Liolaemus lizard radiation, we investigate the hypotheses that historical invasions of cold climates have been permitted by transitions to viviparity, and that this parity mode is irreversible. Then, we investigate whether these combined factors restrict viviparous lizards to cold climates, and hence, whether viviparous species are particularly threatened by climate change. Location South America. Methods We employ phylogenetic analyses to investigate evolutionary transitions in reproductive modes and their consequences for environmental restrictions in viviparous lizards. We then employ climatic projections to predict the impact of climate change on the future persistence of these organisms. Results The oviparity-to-viviparity transition is consistently associated with colonization of cold climates, and appears to be irreversible. Since viviparity seems less viable (compared with oviparity) in warm climates, species that evolve viviparity in cold climates are likely to remain adaptively constrained to such environments. Therefore, upward-poleward advances of climate warming will cause severe shifts and contractions of viviparous species ranges, threatening major extinctions over the next half century. Main conclusions Viviparity has been largely responsible for the successful radiation of Liolaemus into cold climates, but since this adaptation is predominantly viable in these environments and is unlikely to re-evolve into oviparity, viviparity may prove to be an evolutionary dead-end for lizards facing rapid climate change.

AB Agricultural expansion has led to the widespread destruction of habitats and the creation of fragmented landscapes. Woodland has been severely affected by habitat loss; remaining woodland is often highly fragmented and degraded, immersed in an agricultural matrix. Woodland is one of the most important habitats for bats because it offers roosting and feeding opportunities for many species. A number of agri-environment schemes aim to increase the amount and quality of woodland on agricultural land; however, little is known about how woodland character relates to bat abundance/activity and recommendations for woodland creation and management for foraging bats are scarce. We studied temperate bat communities and examined bat foraging activity and relative abundance (and insect prey availability) in 34 woodland fragments in agricultural landscapes using two complementary methods (acoustic monitoring and trapping assisted by an acoustic lure). We evaluated the relative importance of woodland vegetation character, patch configuration and surrounding landscape in order to assess the importance of local- vs. landscape-scale woodland management to bat populations. Bat abundance and activity were influenced by both local and landscape-level attributes. At the local scale, woodland vegetation character appeared more important than patch configuration. High activity levels of aerial hawkers (e.g. Pipistrellus species) were related to low tree densities and an open understory, while gleaning species (e.g. Myotis bats) showed the opposite trend. Areas of cluttered vegetation were associated with high insect (mostly Diptera) abundance and could act as sources of prey for certain bat species. Bats' responses to the surrounding landscape depended on species mobility. For relatively low mobility species (e.g. Pipistrellus pygmaeus), local woodland character was more important than the landscape context, whereas the opposite was observed for higher mobility species (e.g. Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Myotis bats). Higher bat activity levels were observed in small and isolated woodland fragments, and in sparsely wooded landscapes. This may reflect a more intensive use of woodland in landscapes where this habitat is scarce, where woodland creation should be prioritised. Woodland management and creation schemes should encourage habitat heterogeneity to fulfil the requirements of different bat species. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Breast cancer accounts for the largest number of newly diagnosed cases in female cancer patients. Although mammography is a powerful screening tool, about 20% of breast cancer cases cannot be detected by this method. New diagnostic biomarkers for breast cancer are necessary. Here, we used a mass spectrometry-based quantitative metabolomics method to analyze plasma samples from 55 breast cancer patients and 25 healthy controls. A number of 30 patients and 20 age-matched healthy controls were used as a training dataset to establish a diagnostic model and to identify potential biomarkers. The remaining samples were used as a validation dataset to evaluate the predictive accuracy for the established model. Distinct separation was obtained from an orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model with good prediction accuracy. Based on this analysis, 39 differentiating metabolites were identified, including significantly lower levels of lysophosphatidylcholines and higher levels of sphingomyelins in the plasma samples obtained from breast cancer patients compared with healthy controls. Using logical regression, a diagnostic equation based on three metabolites (lysoPC a C16:0, PC ae C42:5 and PC aa C34:2) successfully differentiated breast cancer patients from healthy controls, with a sensitivity of 98.1% and a specificity of 96.0%.

AB We compiled information on the distribution of ticks in the western Palearctic (11A degrees W, 45A degrees E; 29A degrees N, 71A degrees N), published during 1970-2010. The literature search was filtered by the tick's species name and an unambiguous reference to the point of capture. Records from some curated collections were included. We focused on tick species of importance to human and animal health, in particular: Ixodes ricinus, Dermacentor marginatus, D. reticulatus, Haemaphysalis punctata, H. sulcata, Hyalomma marginatum, Hy. lusitanicum, Rhipicephalus annulatus, R. bursa, and the R. sanguineus group. A few records of other species (I. canisuga, I. hexagonus, Hy. impeltatum, Hy. anatolicum, Hy. excavatum, Hy. scupense) were also included. A total of 10,280 records was included in the data set. Almost 42 % of published references are not adequately referenced (and not included in the data set), host is reported for only 61 % of records and a reference to time of collection is missed for 84 % of published records. Ixodes ricinus accounted for 44.3 % of total records, with H. marginatum and D. marginatus accounting for 7.1 and 8.1 % of records, respectively. The lack of homogeneity of the references and potential pitfalls in the compilation were addressed to create a digital data set of the records of the ticks. We attached to every record a coherent set of quantitative descriptors for the site of reporting, namely gridded interpolated monthly climate and remotely sensed data on vegetation (NDVI). We also attached categorical descriptors of the habitat: a standard classification of land biomes and an ad hoc classification of the target territory from remotely sensed temperature and NDVI data. A descriptive analysis of the data revealed that a principal components reduction of the environmental (temperature and NDVI) variables described the distribution of the species in the target territory. However, categorical descriptors of the habitat were less effective. We stressed the importance of building reliable collections of ticks with specific references as to collection point, host and date of capture. The data set is freely downloadable.

AB Fruiting is typically considered to massively burden the seasonal carbon budget of trees. The cost of reproduction has therefore been suggested as a proximate factor explaining observed mast-fruiting patterns. Here, we used a large-scale, continuous C-13 labeling of mature, deciduous trees in a temperate Swiss forest to investigate to what extent fruit formation in three species with masting reproduction behavior (Carpinus betulus, Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea) relies on the import of stored carbon reserves. Using a free-air CO2 enrichment system, we exposed trees to C-13-depleted CO2 during 8 consecutive years. By the end of this experiment, carbon reserve pools had significantly lower delta C-13 values compared to control trees. delta C-13 analysis of new biomass during the first season after termination of the CO2 enrichment allowed us to distinguish the sources of built-in carbon (old carbon reserves vs. current assimilates). Flowers and expanding leaves carried a significant C-13 label from old carbon stores. In contrast, fruits and vegetative infructescence tissues were exclusively produced from current, unlabeled photoassimilates in all three species, including F. sylvatica, which had a strong masting season. Analyses of delta C-13 in purified starch from xylem of fruit-bearing shoots revealed a complete turn-over of starch during the season, likely due to its usage for bud break. This study is the first to directly demonstrate that fruiting is independent from old carbon reserves in masting trees, with significant implications for mechanistic models that explain mast seeding.

AB Uncertainty is a pervasive feature in natural resource management. Adaptive management, an approach that focuses on identifying critical uncertainties to be reduced via diagnostic management experiments, is one favored approach for tackling this reality. While adaptive management is identified as a key method in the environmental management toolbox, there remains a lack of clarity over when its use is appropriate or feasible. Its implementation is often viewed as suitable only in a limited set of circumstances. Here we restructure some of the ideas supporting this view, and show why much of the pessimism around AM may be unwarranted. We present a new framework for deciding when AM is appropriate, feasible, and subsequently successful. We thus present a new paradigm for adaptive management that shows that there are no categorical limitations to its appropriate use, the boundaries of application being defined by problem conception and the resources available to managers. In doing so we also separate adaptive management as a management tool, from the burden of failures that result from the complex policy, social, and institutional environment within which management occurs.

AB Discrepancies can arise among surface flux measurements collected using disparate techniques due to differences in both the instrumentation and theoretical underpinnings of the different measurement methods. Using data collected primarily within a pair of irrigated cotton fields as a part of the 2008 Bush-land Evapotranspiration and Remote Sensing Experiment (BEAREX08), flux measurements collected with two commonly-used methods, eddy covariance (EC) and lysimetry (LY), were compared and substantial differences were found. Daytime mean differences in the flux measurements from the two techniques could be in excess of 200 W m(-2) under strongly advective conditions. Three causes for this disparity were found: (i) the failure of the eddy covariance systems to fully balance the surface energy budget, (ii) flux divergence due to the local advection of warm, dry air over the irrigated cotton fields, and (iii) the failure of lysimeters to accurately represent the surface properties of the cotton fields as a whole. Regardless of the underlying cause, the discrepancy among the flux measurements underscores the difficulty in collecting these measurements under strongly advective conditions. It also raises awareness of the uncertainty associated with in situ micrometeorological measurements and the need for caution when using such data for model validation or as observational evidence to definitively support or refute scientific hypotheses.

AB Applying a broader landscape perspective to understand spatio-temporal changes in local populations and communities has been increasingly used in terrestrial systems to study effects of human impact and land use change. With today's major declines in fishery stocks and rapid degradation of natural coastal habitats, the understanding of habitat configuration and connectivity over relevant temporal and spatial scales is critical for conservation and fisheries management of the seascape. Coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangroves are key-components of the tropical seascape. The spatial distribution of these habitat types may have strong influences on cross-habitat migration and connectivity patterns among organisms. However, the consequences of seascape fragmentation and ecological connectivity are largely unknown. Here, we review the literature to provide an overview of current knowledge with regards to connectivity and food-web interactions within the tropical seascape. We show that information on fish acting as mobile links and being part of nutrient transfer and trophic interactions is scarce. We continue by making an in-depth analysis of the seascape around Zanzibar (Eastern Africa) to fill some of the knowledge gaps identified by the literature survey. Our analysis shows that (i) fifty percent of all fish species found within the Zanzibar seascape use two or multiple habitat types, (ii) eighteen percent of all coral reef-associated fish species use mangrove and seagrass beds as juvenile habitat, and (iii) macrocarnivores and herbivores are highly represented among those coral reef fish species that use mangrove and seagrass beds as juvenile habitat. We argue that understanding the inter-linkages within and between habitat types is essential for successful management of the tropical seascape. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,

AB Alleviating human-carnivore conflict is central to large carnivore conservation and is often of economic importance, where people co-exist with carnivores. However, effective conflict mitigation requires knowledge of underlying human and environmental drivers that is largely absent in South Africa. From 2006 to 2008, we interviewed land owners in the North West Province of South Africa to quantify; (1) human-carnivore conflict characteristics and (2) determinants of perceived predation levels and retaliatory persecution of carnivores. Carnivores reportedly killed 3755 animals, i.e. 2.77% of total game and livestock holdings. Reported financial losses were unevenly distributed among individuals, but generally not of sufficient magnitude to constitute a serious economic threat. Dense cover, increasing distance from protected areas and land use were the most influential determinants of perceived predation levels. Cultural group was by far the most influential determinant of carnivore persecution. Black-backed jackals and caracals were most often implicated in predation and most frequently killed by interviewees. Conflict in the North West Province appears to be driven more by social and environmental factors than by economic losses. Therefore, mitigation efforts that foster positive attitudes to carnivores may have greater impact than activities intended to reduce livestock predation losses. More generally, our combination of socio-economic interviews and information theoretic analysis demonstrates a simple and effective method for identifying the key determinants of complex human-wildlife conflicts.

Parallel research led to the formulation of integrated scenarios of future socio-economic development, which were used to create spatially explicit scenarios of European land-use change for the 21st century. Here we integrate these two research lines and produce the first spatially explicit projections of plant invasions in Europe for the years 2020, 2050 and 2080.

AB Forest fires are a recurrent management problem in the Western Ghats of India. Although most fires occur during the dry season, information on the spatial distribution of fires is needed to improve fire prevention. We used the MODIS Hotspots database and Maxent algorithm to provide a quantitative understanding of the environmental controls regulating the spatial distribution of forest fires over the period 2003-07 in the entire Western Ghats and in two nested subregions with contrasting characteristics. We used hierarchical partitioning to assess the independent contributions of climate, topography and vegetation to the goodness-of-fit of models and to build the most parsimonious fire susceptibility model in each study area. Results show that although areas predicted as highly prone to forest fires were mainly localised on the eastern slopes of the Ghats, spatial predictions and model accuracies differed significantly between study areas. We suggest accordingly a two-step approach to identify: first, large fire-prone areas by paying special attention to the climatic conditions of the monsoon season before the fire season, which determine the fuels moisture content during the fire season; second, the most vulnerable sites within the fire-prone areas using local models mainly based on the type of vegetation.

AB Background: Human-generated noise pollution now permeates natural habitats worldwide, presenting evolutionarily novel acoustic conditions unprecedented to most landscapes. These acoustics not only harm humans, but threaten wildlife, and especially birds, via changes to species densities, foraging behavior, reproductive success, and predator-prey interactions. Explanations for negative effects of noise on birds include disruption of acoustic communication through energetic masking, potentially forcing species that rely upon acoustic communication to abandon otherwise suitable areas. However, this hypothesis has not been adequately tested because confounding stimuli often co-vary with noise and are difficult to separate from noise exposure.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Using a natural experiment that controls for confounding stimuli, we evaluate whether species vocal features or urban-tolerance classifications explain their responses to noise measured through habitat use. Two data sets representing nesting and abundance responses reveal that noise filters bird communities nonrandomly. Signal duration and urban tolerance failed to explain species-specific responses, but birds with low-frequency signals that are more susceptible to masking from noise avoided noisy areas and birds with higher frequency vocalizations remained. Signal frequency was also negatively correlated with body mass, suggesting that larger birds may be more sensitive to noise due to the link between body size and vocal frequency.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our findings suggest that acoustic masking by noise may be a strong selective force shaping the ecology of birds worldwide. Larger birds with lower frequency signals may be excluded from noisy areas, whereas smaller species persist via transmission of higher frequency signals. We discuss our findings as they relate to interspecific relationships among body size, vocal amplitude and frequency and suggest that they are immediately relevant to the global problem of increases in noise by providing critical insight as to which species traits influence tolerance of these novel acoustics.

AB Size has profound consequences for the structure and function of biological systems, across levels of organization from cells to social groups. As tightly integrated units that vary greatly in size, eusocial insect colonies, in particular, are expected to exhibit social scaling relations. To address the question of how social organization scales with colony size, we quantified task performance in variably sized colonies of the harvester ant Pogonomyrmex californicus. We found a positive scaling relationship between colony size and division of labor in 2 different contexts. First, individual workers were more specialized in older, larger colonies. Second, division of labor increased with colony size, independently of colony age. Moreover, the proportional allocation of workers to tasks shifted during colony ontogeny-older, larger colonies performed relatively less brood care-but did not vary with colony size among same-aged colonies. There were no colony-size effects on per capita activity or the distribution of activity across workers. Size-related changes in task performance were correlated with changes in the rate of encounter between nest mates. These results highlight the importance of colony size for the organization of work in insect societies and raise broader questions about the role of size in sociobiology.

AB Background: The insect gut harbors a variety of microorganisms that probably exceed the number of cells in insects themselves. These microorganisms can live and multiply in the insect, contributing to digestion, nutrition, and development of their host.
   Recent studies have shown that midgut bacteria appear to strengthen the mosquito's immune system and indirectly enhance protection from invading pathogens. Nevertheless, the physiological significance of these bacteria for mosquitoes has not been established to date. In this study, oral administration of antibiotics was employed in order to examine the contribution of gut bacteria to blood digestion and fecundity in Aedes aegypti.
   Results: The antibiotics carbenicillin, tetracycline, spectinomycin, gentamycin and kanamycin, were individually offered to female mosquitoes. Treatment of female mosquitoes with antibiotics affected the lysis of red blood cells (RBCs), retarded the digestion of blood proteins and reduced egg production. In addition, antibiotics did not affect the survival of mosquitoes. Mosquito fertility was restored in the second gonotrophic cycle after suspension of the antibiotic treatment, showing that the negative effects of antibiotics in blood digestion and egg production in the first gonotrophic cycle were reversible.
   Conclusions: The reduction of bacteria affected RBC lysis, subsequently retarded protein digestion, deprived mosquito from essential nutrients and, finally, oocyte maturation was affected, resulting in the production of fewer viable eggs. These results indicate that Ae. aegypti and its midgut bacteria work in synergism to digest a blood meal. Our findings open new possibilities to investigate Ae. aegypti-associated bacteria as targets for mosquito control strategies.

AB Gene flow among hybridizing species with incomplete reproductive barriers blurs species boundaries, while selection under heterogeneous local ecological conditions or along strong gradients may counteract this tendency. Congeneric, externally-fertilizing fucoid brown algae occur as distinct morphotypes along intertidal exposure gradients despite gene flow. Combining analyses of genetic and phenotypic traits, we investigate the potential for physiological resilience to emersion stressors to act as an isolating mechanism in the face of gene flow. Along vertical exposure gradients in the intertidal zone of Northern Portugal and Northwest France, the mid-low shore species Fucus vesiculosus, the upper shore species Fucus spiralis, and an intermediate distinctive morphotype of F. spiralis var. platycarpus were morphologically characterized. Two diagnostic microsatellite loci recovered 3 genetic clusters consistent with prior morphological assignment. Phylogenetic analysis based on single nucleotide polymorphisms in 14 protein coding regions unambiguously resolved 3 clades; sympatric F. vesiculosus, F. spiralis, and the allopatric (in southern Iberia) population of F. spiralis var. platycarpus. In contrast, the sympatric F. spiralis var. platycarpus (from Northern Portugal) was distributed across the 3 clades, strongly suggesting hybridization/introgression with both other entities. Common garden experiments showed that physiological resilience following exposure to desiccation/heat stress differed significantly between the 3 sympatric genetic taxa; consistent with their respective vertical distribution on steep environmental clines in exposure time. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that F. spiralis var. platycarpus is a distinct entity in allopatry, but that extensive gene flow occurs with both higher and lower shore species in sympatry. Experimental results suggest that strong selection on physiological traits across steep intertidal exposure gradients acts to maintain the 3 distinct genetic and morphological taxa within their preferred vertical distribution ranges. On the strength of distributional, genetic, physiological and morphological differences, we propose elevation of F. spiralis var. platycarpus from variety to species level, as F. guiryi.

AB Aim Urbanization is associated with strong changes in biodiversity, but the diversity of plant and animal assemblages varies among urban habitats. We studied effects of urban habitats on the diversity of vascular plants and land snails in 32 large cities.
   Location Central Europe, Belgium and the Netherlands.
   Methods The species composition of all vascular plants that had not been planted by humans, and all land snails, was recorded in seven 1-ha plots within each city. Each plot contained one urban habitat type representing a different disturbance regime: historical city square, boulevard, residential area with compact building pattern, residential area with open building pattern, park, early successional and mid-successional site. For each plot, we obtained temperature and precipitation data. The effects of climate and habitat types on species composition were quantified using ordination methods with an adjusted variation partitioning algorithm. Differences in species composition among urban habitats were described using statistically determined diagnostic species, and differences in alpha, beta and gamma diversity were quantified.
   Results A total of 1196 plant and 87 snail species were recorded. Habitat type explained higher proportions of the total variation in both plant and snail species composition (11.2 and 8.2%, respectively) than did climate (4.6 and 6.3%). For both taxa, the main differences in species composition were observed between strongly urbanized sites in city centres and early successional and mid-successional sites. For vascular plants, the number of species was lowest in city squares and boulevards, and highest at successional sites and in residential areas with compact building patterns. Beta diversity of vascular plants calculated for the same habitat types among cities was highest for squares and successional sites. The number of snail species was lowest in city squares and at early successional sites, and highest at mid-successional sites. The highest beta diversity of snail assemblages among cities was observed within the city square and early successional habitat types, and the lowest within residential area habitat types.
   Main conclusions Urban habitats differ notably in the diversity of their vascular plant flora and land snail fauna. Understanding the habitat-related biodiversity patterns in urbanized landscapes will allow projections of future impacts of urban land-use changes on the biota.

AB Plant functional traits have been proposed as a linkage between the environmental control of vegetation and ecosystem function. Identification of traits that mediate the response of plant species to the environment is well established, but the identification of effect traits and the linkage between the two sets is less developed. This was attempted for a study of eight contrasting land uses in a marginal agricultural landscape where data on vegetation, management controls of the disturbance regime, and soil characteristics, including nitrogen release, were measured simultaneously with measures of ecosystem function such as litter decomposition rates and primary productivity on 30 sites. Trait data were assembled from databases, and an iterative multivariate approach using the three table (species, trait, environment) method RLQ was employed to identify a parsimonious set of traits that predict plant species responses to the environment and a parsimonious set of traits that link vegetation to ecosystem function. The lists of response and effect traits were similar, and where differences were observed, traits were usually highly correlated with at least one trait in the other list. This approach identified a small number of traits (canopy height, leaf dry matter content, leaf size, and specific leaf area) that provide a means of linking vegetation responses to environmental change with changes in ecosystem function. Other response traits included vegetative spread strategy, start of flowering, and seed terminal velocity, but within the system studied these traits were all significantly correlated to the traits shared between the response and effect lists.

Yet humanity's intense modification of the environment has resulted in dramatic worldwide declines in natural and cultural capital. Social-ecological systems are becoming more vulnerable through the disruption of livelihoods, governance, institutions, resources and cultural traditions. This paper reviews the environmental sub-disciplines that have emerged to seek solutions for conservation and maintenance of the resilience of social-ecological systems. It shows that a central component is engagement with the knowledges of people within their contexts. Local knowledges of nature (traditional, indigenous, local ecological knowledge and ecoliteracy) are used by place-based cultures to guide actions towards nature. The importance of new engagements between different knowledges is now becoming more widely recognized by scientific institutions. Yet there still exist many false dualisms (for example local knowledge versus science) which tend to emphasize a superiority of one over the other. Ecocultures retain or strive to regain their connections with the environment, and thus improve their own resilience. Revitalization projects offer ways to connect knowledge with action to produce optimal outcomes for both nature and culture, suggesting that systems can be redesigned by emphasis on incorporation of local and traditional knowledge systems.

AB The increase in biodiversity from high to low latitudes is a widely recognized biogeographical pattern. According to the latitudinal gradient hypothesis (LGH), this pattern was shaped by differential effects of Late Quaternary climatic changes across a latitudinal gradient. Here, we evaluate the effects of climatic changes across a tropical latitudinal gradient and its implications to diversification of an Atlantic Forest (AF) endemic passerine. We studied the intraspecific diversification and historical demography of Sclerurus scansor, based on mitochondrial (ND2, ND3 and cytb) and nuclear (FIB7) gene sequences. Phylogenetic analyses recovered three well-supported clades associated with distinct latitudinal zones. Coalescent-based methods were applied to estimate divergence times and changes in effective population sizes. Estimates of divergence times indicate that intraspecific diversification took place during Middle-Late Pleistocene. Distinct demographic scenarios were identified, with the southern lineage exhibiting a clear signature of demographic expansion, while the central one remained more stable. The northern lineage, contrasting with LGH predictions, exhibited a clear sign of a recent bottleneck. Our results suggest that different AF regions reacted distinctly, even in opposite ways, under the same climatic period, producing simultaneously favourable scenarios for isolation and contact among populations.

AB Uncertainty in parameter estimates from sampling variation or expert judgment can introduce substantial uncertainty into ecological predictions based on those estimates. However, in standard population viability analyses, one of the most widely used tools for managing plant, fish and wildlife populations, parametric uncertainty is often ignored in or discarded from model projections. We present a method for explicitly incorporating this source of uncertainty into population models to fully account for risk in management and decision contexts. Our method involves a two-step simulation process where parametric uncertainty is incorporated into the replication loop of the model and temporal variance is incorporated into the loop for time steps in the model. Using the piping plover, a federally threatened shorebird in the USA and Canada, as an example, we compare abundance projections and extinction probabilities from simulations that exclude and include parametric uncertainty. Although final abundance was very low for all sets of simulations, estimated extinction risk was much greater for the simulation that incorporated parametric uncertainty in the replication loop. Decisions about species conservation (e.g., listing, delisting, and jeopardy) might differ greatly depending on the treatment of parametric uncertainty in population models.

AB Global climate change projections suggest an increasing frequency of droughts and extreme rain events in the steppes of the Eurasian region. Using the eddy covariance method, we measured carbon and water balances of a meadow steppe ecosystem in Northeast China during 2 years which had contrasting precipitation patterns in spring seasons in 2007 and 2008. The meadow steppe sequestrated only 64.2 gC m(-2) year(-1) in 2007 compared to 160.5 gC m(-2) year(-1) in 2008, due to a severe spring drought in 2007. The 2007 spring drought resulted in a dramatic reduction of leaf area index (LAI) and aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP). However, the meadow steppe still acted as a carbon sink in 2007. The strength of the sink was much greater than that in the typical steppes in Central Mongolia and Inner Mongolia. Spring drought also caused a reduction of plant transpiration (Tr) and total ecosystem evapotranspiration (ET). However, the suppression of ET in 2007 was relatively small in comparison to gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) reduction. Thus, ecosystem water use efficiency (WEU) (GEP/ET) in 2007 was reduced to 5.0 gCO(2) kg(-1) H2O or 75% of that of 2008. We concluded that spring drought detrimentally impacted meadow steppe ecosystem by reducing leaf areas, biomass, GEP, WUE and associated increases in soil evaporation (Es) that might aggravate soil salinization of the Songnen Plain.

AB Understanding the responses of tropical trees to increasing [CO2] and climate change is important as tropical forests play an important role in carbon and hydrological cycles. We used stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) in tree rings to study the physiological responses of a tropical dry forest tree species in southern Mexico, Mimosa acantholoba to changes in atmospheric [CO2] and variation in climate. Based on annual records of tree ring delta C-13, we calculated intrinsic water use efficiency (W (i)) and intercellular [CO2] (c (i)). Our results showed that trees responded strongly to the increase in atmospheric [CO2] over the last four decades; W (i) increased dramatically by 40%, while c (i) remained largely constant. The maintenance of a constant c (i) indicates that photosynthetic rates are unlikely to have increased in response to higher [CO2], and that improvements in W (i) are probably due to a reduction in stomatal conductance. This may have large consequences for the hydrological cycle. Inter-annual variation in c (i) was strongly correlated with total annual rainfall (r = 0.70), and not influenced by temperature, solar radiation or cloud cover. Our results show that delta C-13 in tree rings of tropical dry forest trees may be a powerful tool to evaluate long-term responses of trees to increasing [CO2] and to variation in climate.

AB Phenotypic evolution may occur either through alterations to the structure of protein-coding genes or their expression. Evidence for which of these two mechanisms more commonly contribute to the evolution of a phenotype can be garnered from examples of parallel and convergent evolution. The visual system of East African cichlid fishes is an excellent system with which to address this question. Cichlid fishes from Lakes Malawi (LM) and Victoria together exhibit three diverse palettes of coexpressed opsins and several important protein-coding mutations that both shift spectral sensitivity. Here we assess both opsin expression and protein-coding diversity among cichlids from a third rift lake, Lake Tanganyika (LT). We found that Tanganyikan cichlids exhibit three palettes of coexpressed opsins that largely overlap the short-, middle-, and long-wavelength-sensitive palettes of LM cichlids. Bayesian phenotypic clustering and ancestral state reconstructions both support the parallel evolution of the short- and middle-wavelength palettes among cichlids from LT and LM. In each case, these transitions occurred from different ancestors that expressed the same long-wavelength palette. We also identified similar but distinct patterns of correlated evolution between opsin expression, diet, and lens transmittance among cichlids from LT and LM as well. In contrast to regulatory changes, we identified few functional or potentially functional mutations in the protein-coding sequences of three variable opsins, with the possible exception of the SWS1 (ultraviolet) opsin. These results underscore the important contribution that gene regulation can make to rapid phenotypic evolution and adaptation.

AB The genetic diversity of a comprehensive germplasm collection involving 192 Jatropha curcas L. accessions collected throughout Brazil, spanning a wide latitudinal range from the states of Maranhao (1 degrees 49' S, 44 degrees 52' W) to Rio Grande do Sul (29 degrees 33' S, 55 degrees 07' W), was studied with 96 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers and six selected microsatellite markers. Only 23 of the 381 replicated RAPD markers and one microsatellite were polymorphic. Surprisingly, all accessions were homozygous at all but one microsatellite, in contrast with the outcrossing mating system reported for the species, suggesting that J. curcas not only supports selfing but possibly breeds by geitonogamy. Similarity based clustering revealed only 43 unique multilocus profiles in the 192 accessions. The probabilities of accessions with indistinguishable multilocus profiles being true duplicates varied between 83 and 99%. No relationship between clustering of accessions and geographic origin was observed, suggesting that J. curcas has experienced a widespread dispersion across regions by seeds and possibly vegetative propagules. The narrow genetic base and extent of potentially duplicated accessions likely reflects a recent common ancestry, drift, and intensive selection of the currently cultivated materials since the time of introduction. This result highlights an urgent need for the introduction of new and diverse accessions to this germplasm collection if Brazil is to drive and sustain successful breeding programs.

TI Phylogeography, colonization and population history of the Midas cichlid

AB Background: Elucidation of the mechanisms driving speciation requires detailed knowledge about the phylogenetic relationships and phylogeography of the incipient species within their entire ranges as well as their colonization history. The Midas cichlid species complex Amphilophus spp. has been proven to be a powerful model system for the study of ecological specialization, sexual selection and the mechanisms of sympatric speciation. Here we present a comprehensive and integrative phylogeographic analysis of the complete Midas Cichlid species complex in Nicaragua (> 2000 individuals) covering the entire distributional range, using two types of molecular markers (the mitochondrial DNA control region and 15 microsatellites). We investigated the majority of known lake populations of this species complex and reconstructed their colonization history in order to distinguish between alternative speciation scenarios.
   Results: We found that the large lakes contain older and more diverse Midas Cichlid populations, while all crater lakes hold younger and genetically less variable species assemblages. The large lakes appear to have repeatedly acted as source populations for all crater lakes, and our data indicate that faunal exchange among crater lakes is extremely unlikely. Despite their very recent (often only a few thousand years old) and common origin from the two large Nicaraguan lakes, all crater lake Midas Cichlid radiations underwent independent, but parallel, evolution, and comprise distinct genetic units. Indeed several of these crater lakes contain multiple genetically distinct incipient species that most likely arose through sympatric speciation. Several crater lake radiations can be traced back to a single ancestral line, but some appear to have more than one founding lineage. The timing of the colonization(s) of each crater lake differs, although most of them occurred more (probably much more) recently than 20,000 years ago.
   Conclusion: The genetic differentiation of the crater lake populations is directly related to the number of founding lineages, but independent of the timing of colonization. Interestingly, levels of phenotypic differentiation, and speciation events, appeared independent of both factors.

AB The relative number of seeds produced by competing species can influence the community structure; yet, traits that influence seed production, such as pollinator attraction and floral colour, have received little attention in community ecology. Here, we analyse floral colour using reflectance spectra that include near-UV and examined the phylogenetic signal of floral colour. We found that coflowering species within communities tended to be more divergent in floral colour than expected by chance. However, coflowering species were not phylogenetically dispersed, in part due to our finding that floral colour is a labile trait with a weak phylogenetic signal. Furthermore, while we found that locally rare and common species exhibited equivalent floral colour distances from their coflowering neighbours, frequent species (those found in more communities) exhibited higher colour distances from their coflowering neighbours. Our findings support recent studies, which have found that (i) plant lineages exhibit frequent floral colour transitions; and (ii) traits that influence local population dynamics contribute to community structure.

AB A variety of processes are thought to be involved in the formation and dynamics of species assemblages. For example, various metacommunity theories are based on differences in the relative contributions of dispersal of species among local communities and interactions of species within local communities. Interestingly, metacommunity theories continue to be advanced without much empirical validation. Part of the problem is that statistical models used to analyze typical survey data either fail to specify ecological processes with sufficient complexity or they fail to account for errors in detection of species during sampling. In this paper, we describe a statistical modeling framework for the analysis of metacommunity dynamics that is based on the idea of adopting a unified approach, multispecies occupancy modeling, for computing inferences about individual species, local communities of species, or the entire metacommunity of species. This approach accounts for errors in detection of species during sampling and also allows different metacommunity paradigms to be specified in terms of species- and location-specific probabilities of occurrence, extinction, and colonization: all of which are estimable. In addition, this approach can be used to address inference problems that arise in conservation ecology, such as predicting temporal and spatial changes in biodiversity for use in making conservation decisions. To illustrate, we estimate changes in species composition associated with the species- specific phenologies of flight patterns of butterflies in Switzerland for the purpose of estimating regional differences in biodiversity.

AB Background: Evidence increasingly shows that stream ecosystems greatly contribute to global carbon fluxes. This involves a tight coupling between biofilms, the dominant form of microbial life in streams, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), a very significant pool of organic carbon on Earth. Yet, the interactions between microbial biodiversity and the molecular diversity of resource use are poorly understood.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Using six 40-m-long streamside flumes, we created a gradient of streambed landscapes with increasing spatial flow heterogeneity to assess how physical heterogeneity, inherent to streams, affects biofilm diversity and DOC use. We determined bacterial biodiversity in all six landscapes using 16S-rRNA fingerprinting and measured carbon uptake from glucose and DOC experimentally injected to all six flumes. The diversity of DOC molecules removed from the water was determined from ultrahigh-resolution Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). Bacterial beta diversity, glucose and DOC uptake, and the molecular diversity of DOC use all increased with increasing flow heterogeneity. Causal modeling and path analyses of the experimental data revealed that the uptake of glucose was largely driven by physical processes related to flow heterogeneity, whereas biodiversity effects, such as complementarity, most likely contributed to the enhanced uptake of putatively recalcitrant DOC compounds in the streambeds with higher flow heterogeneity.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest biophysical mechanisms, including hydrodynamics and microbial complementarity effects, through which physical heterogeneity induces changes of resource use and carbon fluxes in streams. These findings highlight the importance of fine-scale streambed heterogeneity for microbial biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in streams, where homogenization and loss of habitats increasingly reduce biodiversity.

AB We assessed the composition of understory vascular plant communities in relation to the mosaic of canopy patch types, and their associated structure and environment, within unmanaged, mature boreal mixedwood forests in western Canada. Within a 30 km(2) area, we sampled patches of four different canopy types: conifer-dominated, broadleaf-dominated, mixed conifer-broadleaf, and canopy gaps (total n = 98). There were significant differences in understory composition among the four patch types (based on multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP)) and these were mainly due to differences in relative abundances of understory species. The understory communities of conifer patches were characterized by low abundances of shade intolerant species while shade-tolerant and evergreen species were indicators (based on an indicator species analysis (ISA)). Understory, communities under gap and broadleaf patches were characterized by higher abundances of grasses and shade intolerant species. Gap, broadleaf, and mixed patches had higher abundances of certain shrub species than did conifer patches. The patch types also differed in terms of their environmental conditions. Conifer patches had drier, cooler soils and the lowest understory light. Broadleaf patches had the warmest soils while understory light during the leaf-off period was similar to that of canopy gaps. Gap patches had the lowest litter cover and PO4- availability and the highest light. Seven environmental variables (soil moisture, soil temperature, total light during the leaf-off period, cover of coarse and fine downed woody material, and availability of NH4+ and Ca2+) were significantly related to understory species composition (in a constrained ordination by means of a distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA): 16.5% of variation in understory community data explained). Even within a single patch type, there was substantial environmental variation that was related to understory species composition. Our study suggests that the mosaic of canopy patches within mixedwood forests supports coexistence of both early and late successional understory plant species in mixedwood stands. Maintaining the mixture of canopy patch types within mixedwood stands will be important for conserving the natural patterns of understory plant composition in boreal mixedwood forests.

AB Although the sexual transfer of genetic material between species (i.e. introgression) has been documented in many groups of plants and animals, genome-wide patterns of introgression are poorly understood. Is most of the genome permeable to interspecific gene flow, or is introgression typically restricted to a handful of genomic regions? Here, we assess the genomic extent and direction of introgression between three sunflowers from the south-central USA: the common sunflower, Helianthus annuus ssp. annuus; a near-endemic to Texas, Helianthus debilis ssp. cucumerifolius; and their putative hybrid derivative, thought to have recently colonized Texas, H. annuus ssp. texanus. Analyses of variation at 88 genetically mapped microsatellite loci revealed that long-term migration rates were high, genome-wide and asymmetric, with higher migration rates from H. annuus texanus into the two parental taxa than vice versa. These results imply a longer history of intermittent contact between H. debilis and H. annuus than previously believed, and that H. annuus texanus may serve as a bridge for the transfer of alleles between its parental taxa. They also contradict recent theory suggesting that introgression should predominantly be in the direction of the colonizing species. As in previous studies of hybridizing sunflower species, regions of genetic differentiation appear small, whether estimated in terms of FST or unidirectional migration rates. Estimates of recent immigration and admixture were inconsistent, depending on the type of analysis. At the individual locus level, one marker showed striking asymmetry in migration rates, a pattern consistent with tight linkage to a Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility.

AB Background: Asthma and rhinitis may represent two manifestations of the same airway disease. Genetic research can increase our understanding of their common or distinct pathogenesis. IL13 and IL4R polymorphisms are associated with asthma and show gene-gene interaction in asthma. Their role in rhinitis has not been extensively studied. Methods: Association of IL13 and IL4R polymorphisms in relation to rhinitis, asthma, serum IgE and skin test response was studied in: (1) 188 trios ascertained through a proband with rhinitis who were clinically not affected by asthma; (2) 407 trios with an asthmatic proband, and (3) 118 asthma cases and 102 unrelated healthy controls using family-based association testing, logistic regression, and analysis of variance as appropriate. Gene-gene interaction was evaluated using logistic regression analysis. Results: IL13 C-1111T (rs1800925) was significantly associated with rhinitis and atopic phenotypes in rhinitis trios that were not affected by clinical asthma. IL13 Arg130Gln (rs20541) and G870A (rs1295685) were consistently associated with asthma and serum IgE in both asthma populations. IL4R Glu375Ala (rs1805011) and Ser411Leu (rs1805013) were associated with asthma in the asthma case-control population. Combining risk genotypes of IL13 Arg130Gln with IL4R Glu375Ala, and IL13 C-1111T with IL4R Ser478Pro yielded increased risks for asthma compared to their separate effects. Conclusion: IL13 polymorphisms were associated with asthma and rhinitis without clinical asthma; thus, these polymorphisms may constitute a common etiologic pathway for their development. In addition, the study replicates a previously reported interaction of IL13 and IL4R polymorphisms in asthma. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Deleterious mutations can accumulate in the germline with age, decreasing the genetic quality of sperm and imposing a cost on female fitness. If these mutations also affect sperm competition ability or sperm production, then females will benefit from polyandry as it incites sperm competition and, consequently, minimizes the mutational load in the offspring. We tested this hypothesis in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a species characterized by polyandry and intense sperm competition, by investigating whether age affects post-copulatory male traits and sperm competition success. Females did not discriminate between old and young males in a mate choice experiment. While old males produced longer and slower sperm with larger reserves of strippable sperm, compared to young males, artificial insemination did not reveal any effect of age on sperm competition success. Altogether, these results do not support the hypothesis that polyandry evolved in response to costs associated with mating with old males in the guppy.

AB P>1. The carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of plants are known to be affected by environmental factors, especially water availability. While delta 13C of C-4 plants is generally assumed to be much less responsive to environmental variables than that of C-3 plants, it is unclear whether the response of delta 15N differs between the two photosynthetic pathways.
   2. Focussing on differences in the response of members of the C-3 and C-4 photosynthetic pathways to climate variables, we examined the foliar delta 13C and delta 15N of grasses collected from natural vegetation in a wide range of climatic zones throughout Australia.
   3. An index of water availability was clearly related to foliar delta 13C and delta 15N of both C-3 and C-4 grasses. There was a negative relationship between water availability and delta 13C of C-3 grasses (r2 = 0 center dot 21), similar to that documented extensively in other C-3 plants. An opposite, positive relationship was found between water availability and delta 13C in C-4 grasses (r2 = 0 center dot 17), an effect that has been reported only infrequently. Accounting for differences in delta 13C between the different C-4 types (NADP-ME, PCK, NAD-ME and Aristida) resulted in a substantial increase in the fit of the model relating delta 13C to water availability (R2 = 0 center dot 48).
   4. There was a negative relationship between water availability and delta 15N (r2 = 0 center dot 40), that was similar in both C-3 and C-4 grasses, but temperature had no effect on delta 15N. This provides strong support for the theory that water availability is the dominant factor determining soil and plant delta 15N via its effect on the 'openness' of the nitrogen cycle.
   5. We also found significant differences in delta 15N between the different C-4 types, with the highest values for PCK, followed by NADP-ME and NAD-ME, and the lowest values for Aristida. The difference in delta 15N between PCK and Aristida was large, at 5 center dot 1 parts per thousand.
   6. The importance of water availability as a predictor of delta 13C in both C-3 and C-4 grasses suggests that variation in water availability should be considered when estimating C-4 grass abundance based on delta 13C measurements (e.g. in herbivore diets or as a contributor to biospheric carbon sinks).

AB Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is an invasive weed in western North America found primarily growing at elevations less than 2200 m. We asked whether cheatgrass is capable of becoming adapted to a marginal habitat, by investigating a population at a high elevation invasion edge. We used a combination of methods, including reciprocal field transplants, controlled environment studies and molecular analysis. High levels of SSR gene diversity (0.50 vs. 0.43) and comparable variation in phenotypic traits were observed at both the invasion edge and a low elevation, high-density population. Three heterozygotes were observed in the edge population, which is unusual in this predominantly self-pollinating plant. Plants from high elevations germinated more slowly in a growth chamber and had slower seedling growth rates. Survivorship was low at the edge (13%), compared with the low elevation site (55%), but surviving plants were of similar size and had equivalent reproductive output. Seed size positively affected survival and plant performance in the field and this trait was inherited. Emergence timing affected survival at the low elevation site and germination timing was also inherited. Local adaptation was seen in the low, rather than in the high elevation site, because of differential survival. While there was no evidence for local adaptation to the high elevation site observed in the field, family level and genotype-level differences in traits that affected field performance, high genetic diversity at the invasion edge, and evidence of outcrossing in this highly selfing species indicates that the potential for adaptation to a marginal habitat exists within this population.

AB 1. Experiments that directly manipulate species diversity often report a positive diversity effect on productivity, whereas observations of natural communities reveal various productivity-diversity relationships and nutrient addition to natural plant communities generally results in negative productivity-diversity relationships.
   2. We hypothesize that this apparent paradox may be potentially explained by the reduced roles of complementarity and positive selection effects, and the increased importance of competitive exclusion in natural communities compared to diversity-manipulation experiments. This hypothesis arises from the difference in species distribution and abundance patterns between immature synthetically assembled communities in diversity-manipulation experiments and more mature natural communities.
   3. Our hypothesis applies best to small-scale studies within homogenous habitats and complements the environmental heterogeneity hypothesis that explains diversity-productivity patterns across heterogeneous habitats.
   4. Synthesis. Our analysis highlights important differences between synthetic communities in diversity-manipulation experiments and natural communities that may translate into different diversity-productivity patterns, and cautions against indiscriminate extrapolations of results of diversity-manipulation experiments to natural communities.

AB We simulate species-area curves (SACs) using a spatially explicit neutral model. These display three distinct phases with the central phase being well approximated by a "power law'' where species richness (S) is related to area (A) by S = cA(z). If seeds are normally distributed in space about their parent, the power law phase of the SAC is unrealistically narrow, and implausibly large speciation rates are required to fit empirical data. However, if dispersal follows a more realistic "fat-tailed'' distribution (where long-distance dispersal events are more likely) the SACs fit the empirical data better, have a power law that holds for a much broader range of areas, and require a dramatically smaller speciation rate than when dispersal is normally distributed. Neutral models with biologically plausible dispersal parameters and speciation rates lead to empirically realistic SACs.

SO BIOLOGY LETTERS

DE bird; migration; stopover; migratory restlessness; Zugunruhe
ID FAT; SAHARA; MELATONIN; MIGRANTS
AB During migration, a number of bird species rely on stopover sites for resting and feeding before and after crossing ecological barriers such as deserts or seas. The duration of a stopover depends on the combined effects of environmental factors, endogenous programmes and physiological conditions. Previous studies indicated that lean birds prolong their refuelling stopover compared with fat birds; however, the quantitative relationship between physiological conditions and stopover behaviour has not been studied yet. Here, we tested in a large sample of free-living birds of three European passerines (whinchats, Saxicola rubetra, garden warblers, Sylvia borin and whitethroats, Sylvia communis) whether the amount of migratory restlessness (Zugunruhe) shown at a stopover site depends on physiological conditions. An integrated measure of condition based on body mass, amount of subcutaneous fat and thickness of pectoral muscles strongly predicted the intensity of Zugunruhe shown in recording cages in the night following capture. These results provide novel and robust quantitative evidence in support of the hypothesis that the amount of energy reserves plays a major role in determining the stopover duration in migratory birds.

AB The intensification of irrigated agriculture in the semi-arid region of Brazilian North-east results in a change of natural vegetation by irrigated fruit crops. New applications of remote sensing technologies are presented in this paper to estimate the impact of this land use change on regional water consumption - and ultimately the water balance - in Low-Middle Sao Francisco River basin. Ten Landsat images for a period from 2001 to 2007 were used, together with the locally calibrated Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and agro-meteorological data to derive information on regional actual evapotranspiration (ET), biomass production (BIO), and crop water productivity (CWP). The Landsat-based results revealed that regional mean ET for irrigated crops was 3.6 mm d(-1) being higher than for natural vegetation (1.4 mm d(-1)). Similar incremental ET values between natural and irrigated ecosystems were found from micro-meteorological field experiments. The consequence of this land use change on Sao Francisco River's downstream stream flow was assessed by estimating volumetric incremental evapotranspiration at the regional scale. The bio-physical crop water productivity per unit of actual evapotranspiration (CWPET) varied between 0.4 and 1.71 of wine per m(3) of water for wine grapes; 1.7 and 4.0 kg of fruits per m(3) of water for table grapes; and 2.2 and 5.0 kg of fruits per m(3) of water for mangos. The accompanying paper (Part A) describes the calibration and validation of SEBAL steps witnessed under the actual field conditions in this study area. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The differential design, deployment and data post-processing of open-path (OP) and closed-path (CP) eddy covariance systems is a potential source of bias for ongoing global flux synthesis activities. Here we use a unique 6-year data set of concurrent CP and OP carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapour (H2O) eddy covariance flux measurements above a temperate mountain grassland in Austria to explore the consequences of these differences on a long-term basis. The theoretically based transfer function approach was able to account and correct for the differences in low-pass filtering between the two systems. Corrected CO2 and H2O fluxes exhibited excellent 1:1 correspondence, but the CP system tended to underestimate OP H2O fluxes during conditions of high air temperature, wind speed and global radiation, large sun angles and low relative humidity. Corrections for self-heating of the OP infra-red gas analyser had a very small effect on these relationships. Energy balance closure was slightly more favourable for the OP system. No significant differences were found for the random flux uncertainty of both systems. A larger fraction of OP data had to be excluded because of obstructions of the infra-red path by water and snow. This, however, did not translate into a correspondingly larger fraction of accepted CP flux values, because of a larger percentage of CP flux data failing on the stationarity test. Integrated over the annual cycle, the CP system yielded on average a more positive net ecosystem CO2 exchange (25 g Cm-2 year(-1) vs. 0 g Cm-2 year(-1)) and a lower evapotranspiration (465 mm year(-1) vs. 549 mm year(-1)) as compared to the OP system.

AB In North America, caribou (Rangifer tarandus) experienced diversification in separate refugia before the last glacial maximum. Geographical isolation produced the barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) with its distinctive migratory habits, and the woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), which has sedentary behaviour and is now in danger of extinction. Herein we report on the phylogenetics, population structure, and migratory habits of caribou in the Canadian Rockies, utilizing molecular and spatial data for 223 individuals. Mitochondrial DNA analyses show the occurrence of two highly diverged lineages; the Beringian-Eurasian and North American lineages, while microsatellite data reveal that present-day Rockies' caribou populations have resulted from interbreeding between these diverged lineages. An ice-free corridor at the end of the last glaciation likely allowed, for the first time, for barren-ground caribou to migrate from the North and overlap with woodland caribou expanding from the South. The lack of correlation between nuclear and mitochondrial data may indicate that different environmental forces, which might also include human-caused habitat loss and fragmentation, are currently reshaping the population structure of this postglacial hybrid swarm. Furthermore, spatial ecological data show evidence of pronounced migratory behaviour within the study area, and suggest that the probability of being migratory may be higher in individual caribou carrying a Beringian-Eurasian haplotype which is mainly associated with the barren-ground subspecies. Overall, our analyses reveal an intriguing example of postglacial mixing of diverged lineages. In a landscape that is changing due to climatic and human-mediated factors, an understanding of these dynamics, both past and present, is essential for management and conservation of these populations.

AB Predation by European red foxes is believed to be the major cause of the extinction and decline of a large number of native medium-sized terrestrial mammals in Australia. We examined the impact of poisoning of foxes on the relative abundance of a group of medium-sized mammals in an experiment conducted in three large forest blocks in south-eastern Australia. The blocks consisted of paired sites, as follows: one site where poison baiting was used to control foxes (treatment site) and one where foxes were not controlled (non-treatment site). At all six sites, the population responses of a range of mammals were measured, and compared between treatment and non-treatment sites. The relative fox abundance, as indexed by bait-take, declined during the course of the study at treatment sites and to a lesser extent at non-treatment sites. The decline in bait-take at non-treatment sites was most likely due to treatment sites acting as ecological traps, so that reduced intra-specific competition attracted foxes from non-treatment to treatment sites, where they were subsequently poisoned. There was a significant treatment effect for the abundances of total mammals, long-nosed potoroos, southern brown bandicoots and common brushtail possums, with higher abundances at treatment sites than at non-treatment sites. Common ringtail possums increased in abundance during the course of the study, with no significant difference between treatment and non-treatment sites. There was no significant effect of time or treatment on the abundance of long-nosed bandicoots. The increase in the abundance of native mammals at treatment sites was most likely due to a lower predation pressure by foxes brought about by fox control, and the smaller increase in abundance in non-treatment blocks was likely due to the ecological-trap effect because of fox baiting at treatment sites. The present study demonstrated that broad-scale fox control can lead to increases in the abundance of native mammals in forested habitats, without recourse to aerial baiting or fences. The study also demonstrated that the influence of fox control on the fox abundance can extend well beyond the perimeter of the area baited.

AB Background: A fundamental challenge in evolutionary biology is to resolve the mechanisms that maintain paternity a hypervariable fitness component. Because females are often sexually promiscuous, this challenge hinges on establishing the mechanisms through which the ejaculates of different males compete for fertilisation (sperm competition). The competitive quality of an ejaculate is mediated by the relative number of live sperm and their motile performance. The differential rate at which rival ejaculates lose their fertilising efficiency over time is therefore expected to influence the outcome of sperm competition.
   Results: Here, we artificially inseminated into sets of replicate domestic hens, Gallus gallus domesticus, experimentally engineered heterospermic ejaculates containing a large number of low-quality sperm from one male, and a lower number of high-quality sperm from another male. Large, low-quality ejaculates fertilised the first eggs produced after insemination, but small, high-quality ejaculates prevailed in the long run despite their numerical disadvantage.
   Conclusion: Together, these results provide the first experimental demonstration that the relative competitive value of an ejaculate changes drastically over the time during which competing ejaculates are stored within the reproductive tract of a female, resulting in a marked temporal pattern of variation in paternity. A high level of replication makes these results robust. However, our study was restricted to few males of a well characterised study population, and future work should explore the generality of these results.

AB The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) involving area-wide release of mass-reared and sterilized pest insects has proven successful to reduce, control and eradicate economically important pest species, such as the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly). For the efficient application, effective monitoring to assess the number and mating success of the released medflies is essential. Here, we report sperm-specific marking systems based on the spermatogenesis-specific Ceratitis capitata beta 2-tubulin (Cc beta 2t) promoter. Fluorescent sperm can be isolated from testes or spermathecae. The marking does not cause general disadvantages in preliminary laboratory competitiveness assays. Therefore, transgenic sperm marking could serve as a major improvement for monitoring medfly SIT programs. The use of such harmless transgenic markers will serve as an ideal initial condition to transfer insect transgenesis technology from the laboratory to field applications. Moreover, effective and easily recognizable sperm marking will make novel studies possible on medfly reproductive biology which will help to further improve SIT programs.

AB Restoration/fuel reduction treatments are being widely used in fire-prone forests to modify stand structure, reduce risks of severe wildfire, and increase ecosystem resilience to natural disturbances. These treatments are designed to manipulate stand structure and fuels, but may also affect understory vegetation and biodiversity. In this study, we describe prescribed fire and thinning treatment effects on understory vegetation species richness, cover, and species composition in dry coniferous forests of central Washington State, U.S.A. We applied thinning and prescribed fire treatments in factorial design to 12 large (10 ha) management units, and surveyed understory vegetation before treatment and during the second growing season after treatment completion. Many understory vegetation traits changed significantly during the treatment period, regardless of treatment applied, and changes were often proportional to pre-treatment condition. In general, cover declined and species richness increased during the treatment period. Thinning followed by prescribed fire increased species richness, particularly in areas where species richness was low initially. Thinning alone had a similar, but lesser effect. Forb richness was increased by thinning, and shrub richness was increased by the combined thin/burn treatment, but graminoid richness was unaffected. Exotic cover and richness also increased in the combined thin/burn treatment, although they constituted only a very small portion of the total understory. Understory plant cover was not affected by treatments, but did decline from pre- to post-treatment sampling, with cover losses highest in areas where cover was high prior to treatment. Forb cover increased with thinning followed by burning where forb cover was low initially. Burning reduced graminoid cover with or without thinning. Species composition varied within and among treatment units, but was not strongly or consistently affected by treatments. Our study shows that thinning and burning treatments had mostly neutral to beneficial effects on understory vegetation, with only minor increases in exotic species. However, the pre-treatment condition had strong effects on understory dynamics, and also modified some responses to treatments. The maximum benefit of restoration treatments appears to be where understory richness is low prior to treatment, suggesting restoration efforts might be focused on these areas.

AB 1. Invading species typically need to overcome multiple limiting factors simultaneously in order to become established, and understanding how such factors interact to regulate the invasion process remains a major challenge in ecology.
   2. We used the invasion of marine algal communities by the seaweed Sargassum muticum as a study system to experimentally investigate the independent and interactive effects of disturbance and propagule pressure in the short term. Based on our experimental results, we parameterized an integrodifference equation model, which we used to examine how disturbances created by different benthic herbivores influence the longer term invasion success of S. muticum.
   3. Our experimental results demonstrate that in this system neither disturbance nor propagule input alone was sufficient to maximize invasion success. Rather, the interaction between these processes was critical for understanding how the S. muticum invasion is regulated in the short term.
   4. The model showed that both the size and spatial arrangement of herbivore disturbances had a major impact on how disturbance facilitated the invasion, by jointly determining how much space-limitation was alleviated and how readily disturbed areas could be reached by dispersing propagules.
   5. Synthesis. Both the short-term experiment and the long-term model show that S. muticum invasion success is co-regulated by disturbance and propagule pressure. Our results underscore the importance of considering interactive effects when making predictions about invasion success.

AB Background: The forests of the upper Amazon basin harbour some of the world's highest anuran species richness, but to date we have only the sparsest understanding of the distribution of genetic diversity within and among species in this region. To quantify region-wide genealogical patterns and to test for the presence of deep intraspecific divergences that have been documented in some other neotropical anurans, we developed a molecular phylogeny of the wide-spread terrestrial leaflitter frog Eleutherodactylus ockendeni (Leptodactylidae) from 13 localities throughout its range in Ecuador using data from two mitochondrial genes (16S and cyt b; 1246 base pairs). We examined the relation between divergence of mtDNA and the nuclear genome, as sampled by five species-specific microsatellite loci, to evaluate indirectly whether lineages are reproductively isolated where they co-occur. Our extensive phylogeographic survey thus assesses the spatial distribution of E. ockendeni genetic diversity across eastern Ecuador.
   Results: We identified three distinct and well-supported clades within the Ecuadorean range of E. ockendeni: an uplands clade spanning north to south, a northeastern and central lowlands clade, and a central and southeastern clade, which is basal. Clades are separated by 12% to 15% net corrected p-distance for cytochrome b, with comparatively low sequence divergence within clades. Clades marginally overlap in some geographic areas (e. g., Napo River basin) but are reproductively isolated, evidenced by diagnostic differences in microsatellite PCR amplification profiles or DNA repeat number and coalescent analyses (in MDIV) best modelled without migration. Using Bayesian (BEAST) and net phylogenetic estimates, the Southeastern Clade diverged from the Upland/Lowland clades in the mid-Miocene or late Oligocene. Lowland and Upland clades speciated more recently, in the early or late Miocene.
   Conclusion: Our findings uncover previously unsuspected cryptic species diversity within the common leaflitter frog E. ockendeni, with at least three different species in Ecuador. While these clades are clearly geographically circumscribed, they do not coincide with any existing landscape barriers. Divergences are ancient, from the Miocene, before the most dramatic mountain building in the Ecuadorean Andes. Therefore, this diversity is not a product of Pleistocene refuges. Our research coupled with other studies suggests that species richness in the upper Amazon is drastically underestimated by current inventories based on morphospecies.

AB Recent work has shown that Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coeruloscens) living in suburban habitats, as well as birds that reside in a natural habitat (hereafter referred to as wildland birds) provided Supplemental food during the pre-breeding period, have lower baseline corticosterone (CORT) levels than nonsupplemented wildland birds, suggesting that predictable and abundant foods can lower stress levels. Here, we investigate whether the acute CORT response to capture stress reflects our earlier findings. During the pre-breeding seasons in 2004 and 2005 we captured over 200 Florida Scrub-Jays and collected four blood samples from each bird over a 30 min time period. We compared hormonal and morphometric data from birds in four treatment groups: wildland birds that were provided with supplemental food during the pre-breeding period, wildland birds that were provided with supplemental food during the winter and pre-breeding period, nonsupplemented wildland birds, and suburban birds that effectively have access to ad libitum human-source food year-round. Suburban birds had lower baseline levels, and a more acute initial CORT response (i.e., rate of increase) than wildland birds, but we did not observe any differences among the treatment groups of wildland birds. Baseline CORT concentrations were unusually low across treatments in 2005, a year that was characterized by increased adult body mass, superior body condition, and a high fledgling success rate. all of which suggest favorable environmental conditions. Thus, abundant or more reliable food sources in 2005 may have overwhelmed any potential benefits of supplemental feeding and explain the absence of any strong experimental effects on CORT for that year.

AB The codling moth, Cydia pomonella, is renowned for developing resistance to insecticides and causing significant economic damage to pome fruits worldwide. In spite of its economic importance, little is known about the patterns of movement of this pest and the effects of insecticide treatment on the population genetic structure. Here, we investigated the genetic structure of the pest in 27 orchards from France, Italy, Armenia and Chile at seven microsatellite loci and two resistance markers [biochemical activity of cytochrome P450 oxidases and proportion of knockdown resistance (kdr) alleles in the sodium channel gene]. According to the microsatellite loci, we detected isolation by distance at the supranational scale but found no evidence of geographical structure among the 24 French orchards, which were mainly structured by the intensity of the insecticide treatments. Similarly, the highest levels of metabolic resistance associated with activity of the cytochrome P450 oxidases were detected in the most treated orchards. The kdr alleles were observed in southern France and Armenia where the pyrethroid insecticides were or have been intensively sprayed. The intensity of the insecticide treatments marginally affected the allelic richness in each orchard, but not the level of inbreeding. These results suggest important and high-distance gene flow among the codling moth populations, which were mainly structured according to the history of insecticide applications. Differences in mutation-migration-drift equilibrium among treated and untreated orchards also suggest that insecticide applications are the main force regulating the local dynamics of codling moth populations.

AB Well-documented cases of natural hybridization among primates are not common. In New World primates, natural hybridization has been reported only for small-bodied species, but no genotypic data have ever been gathered that confirm these reports. Here we present genetic evidence of hybridization of two large-bodied species of neotropical primates that diverged similar to 3 MYA. We used species-diagnostic mitochondrial and microsatellite loci and the Y chromosome Sry gene to determine the hybrid status of 36 individuals collected from an area of sympatry in Tabasco, Mexico. Thirteen individuals were hybrids. We show that hybridization and subsequent backcrosses are directionally biased and that the only likely cross between parental species produces fertile hybrid females, but fails to produce viable or fertile males. This system can be used as a model to study gene interchange between primate species that have not achieved complete reproductive isolation.

AB Life history theory predicts that when resources are limited growing organisms are likely to trade an immune response for competing demands of growth. To test this we examined the effect of energy intake on body mass increments and an immune response in hand-reared sand martin (Riparia riparia) nestlings. We subjected the nestlings to three different feeding regimes, mimicking the range of food availability in the wild, and then evaluated nestlings' immune response to phytohaemagglutinin ( PHA). Direction of correlation between the magnitude of PHA-induced swelling response and body mass increments depended on food availability: it was negative when food was scarce and positive when resources were plentiful. There was no significant correlation between the two traits under intermediate feeding conditions. We conclude that the relative cost of immune function in young birds depends on food availability and, therefore, may be modified by external factors such as weather conditions or hatching asynchrony.

AB Edge effects arising from road construction and other development in protected areas can negatively affect the behaviour of wildlife, particularly large carnivores. The Asiatic leopard Panthera pardus is a large carnivore that may be sensitive to edge effects. Camera trapping was used to assess the influence of human disturbance along forest edges on leopard behaviour and habitat use in a 104 km(2) area of Kaeng Krachan National Park, Thailand. A minimum of four male and two female leopards was recorded in the study area. A Park access road bisecting the study area was not a barrier to leopard movement but movements and activity were affected by human traffic inside the Park. A regression model showed that leopard habitat use increased with distance from human settlements at the forest edge. As in other parts of its range, leopards at Kaeng Krachan National Park tended to show less diurnal activity in areas more heavily used by people compared to areas less used. As is the case with tigers, such responses may pose a threat to leopard population persistence but more research is needed to determine the demographic implications of edge effects for Asiatic leopards and other large tropical carnivores, and the appropriate mitigation strategies required.

AB In mammals, including humans, female fetuses that are exposed to testosterone from adjacent male fetuses in utero can have masculinized anatomy and behavior. However, the reproductive consequences of such prebirth sex-ratio effects for offspring and their implications for maternal fitness remain unexplored. Here we investigate the effects of being gestated with a male co-twin for daughter lifetime reproductive success, and the fitness consequences for mothers of producing mixed-sex twins in preindustrial (1734-1888) Finns. We show that daughters born with a male co-twin have reduced lifetime reproductive success compared to those born with a female co-twin. This reduction arises because such daughters have decreased probabilities of marrying as well as reduced fecundity. Mothers who produce opposite-sex twins consequently have fewer grandchildren (and hence lower fitness) than mothers who produce same-sex twins. Our results are unlikely to be a consequence of females born with male co-twins receiving less nutrition because such females do not have reduced survival and increases in food availability fail to improve their reproductive success. Nor are our results explained by after-birth social factors (females growing up with similarly aged brothers) because females born with a male co-twin have reduced success even when their co-twin dies shortly after birth and are raised as singletons after birth. Our findings suggest that hormonal interactions between opposite-sex fetuses known to influence female morphology and behavior can also have negative effects on daughter fecundity and, hence, maternal fitness, and bear significant implications for adaptive sex allocation in mammals.

AB The fire-bellied toads Bombina bombina and Bombina variegata, interbreed in a long, narrow zone maintained by a balance between selection and dispersal. Hybridization takes place between local, genetically differentiated groups. To quantify divergence between these groups and reconstruct their history and demography, we analysed nucleotide variation at the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (1096 bp) in 364 individuals from 156 sites representing the entire range of both species. Three distinct clades with high sequence divergence (K2P = 8-11%) were distinguished. One clade grouped B. bombina haplotypes; the two other clades grouped B. variegata haplotypes. One B. variegata clade included only Carpathian individuals; the other represented B. variegata from the southwestern parts of its distribution: Southern and Western Europe (Balkano-Western lineage), Apennines, and the Rhodope Mountains. Differentiation between the Carpathian and Balkano-Western lineages, K2P similar to 8%, approached interspecific divergence. Deep divergence among European Bombina lineages suggests their preglacial origin, and implies long and largely independent evolutionary histories of the species. Multiple glacial refugia were identified in the lowlands adjoining the Black Sea, in the Carpathians, in the Balkans, and in the Apennines. The results of the nested clade and demographic analyses suggest drastic reductions of population sizes during the last glacial period, and significant demographic growth related to postglacial colonization. Inferred history, supported by fossil evidence, demonstrates that Bombina ranges underwent repeated contractions and expansions. Geographical concordance between morphology, allozymes, and mtDNA shows that previous episodes of interspecific hybridization have left no detectable mtDNA introgression. Either the admixed populations went extinct, or selection against hybrids hindered mtDNA gene flow in ancient hybrid zones.

AB The temperature-size rule is a common pattern of phenotypic plasticity in which higher temperature during development results in a smaller adult body size (i.e. a thermal reaction norm with negative slope). Examples and exceptions to the rule are known in multiple groups of organisms, but rapid population differentiation in the temperature-size rule has not been explored. Here we examine the genetic and parental contributions to population differentiation in thermal reaction norms for size, development time and survival in the Cabbage White Butterfly Pieris rapae, for two geographical populations that have likely diverged within the past 150 years. We used split-sibship experiments with two temperature treatments (warm and cool) for P. rapae from Chapel Hill, NC, and from Seattle, WA. Mixed-effect model analyses demonstrate significant genetic differences between NC and WA populations for adult size and for thermal reaction norms for size. Mean adult mass was 12-24% greater in NC than in WA populations for both temperature treatments; mean size was unaffected or decreased with temperature (the temperature-size rule) for the WA population, but size increased with temperature for the NC population. Our study shows that the temperature-size rule and related thermal reaction norms can evolve rapidly within species in natural field conditions. Rapid evolutionary divergence argues against the existence of a simple, general mechanistic constraint as the underlying cause of the temperature-size rule.

AB 1. Variation in survival, a major determinant of fitness, may be caused by individual or environmental characteristics. Furthermore, interactions between individuals may influence survival through the negative feedback effects of density dependence. Compared to species in temperate regions, we have little knowledge about population processes and variation in fitness in tropical bird species.
   2. To investigate whether variation in survival could be explained by population size or climatic variables we used capture-recapture models in conjunction with a long-term data set from an island population of the territorial, cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis). The lack of migration out of the study population means that our results are not confounded by dispersal.
   3. Annual survival was high, both for adults (84%) and juveniles (61%), and did not differ between the sexes. Although there was significant variation in survival between years, this variation could not be explained by overall population size or weather variables.
   4. For territorial species, resource competition will work mainly on a local scale. The size of a territory and number of individuals living in it will therefore be a more appropriate measure of density than overall population density. Consequently, both an index of territory quality per individual (food availability) and local density, measured as group size, were included as individual covariates in our analyses.
   5. Local density had a negative effect on survival; birds living in larger groups had lower survival probabilities than those living in small groups. Food availability did not affect survival.
   6. Our study shows that, in a territorial species, although density-dependent effects might not be detectable at the population level they can be detected at the individual territory level - the scale at which individuals compete. These results will help to provide a better understanding of the small-scale processes involved in the dynamics of a population in general, but in particular in tropical species living in relatively stable environments.

AB 1. A general problem in population ecology is to predict under which conditions stochastic variation in the environment has the stronger effect on ecological processes. By analysing temporal variation in a fitness-related trait, body mass, in 21 Norwegian moose Alces alces (L.) populations, we examined whether the influence of temporal variation in different environmental variables were related to different parameters that were assumed to reflect important characteristics of the fundamental niche space of the moose.
   2. Body mass during autumn was positively related to early access to fresh vegetation in spring, and to variables reflecting slow phenological development (low June temperature, a long spring with a slow plant progression during spring). In contrast, variables related to food quantity and winter conditions had only a minor influence on temporal variation in body mass.
   3. The magnitude of the effects of environmental variation on body mass was larger in populations with small mean body mass or living at higher densities than in populations with large-sized individuals or living at lower densities.
   4. These results indicate that the strongest influence of environmental stochasticity on moose body mass occurs towards the borders of the fundamental niche space, and suggests that populations living under good environmental conditions are partly buffered against fluctuations in environmental conditions.

   POLYMORPHISM
AB Hybridization can be an evolutionary creative force by forming new polyploid species, creating novel genetic variation or acting as conduits of potentially advantageous traits between hybridizing forms. Evidence for the latter is often difficult to find because alleles under positive selection can spread rapidly across a hybrid zone and sweep to fixation. In Western Panama, an avian hybrid zone between two species of manakins in the genus Manacus exists where the unidirectional introgression of bright, yellow plumage into a white population provides evidence for the importance of hybrid zones as conduits of advantageous traits. Several lines of indirect evidence suggest that sexual selection favoring yellow plumage drives this asymmetrical spread, but more direct evidence is lacking. Along the edge of the hybrid zone, both yellow- and white-collared manakins are found in the same mating arenas or leks and compete for the same females ("mixed leks"), providing us with a unique opportunity to understand the dynamics of yellow plumage introgression. We studied these mixed leks to determine whether yellow males have a mating advantage over white males and, if so, whether the mating advantage is driven by male-male interactions, female choice, or both. We found that yellow males mated more than white males, suggesting that sexual selection favoring yellow males can, indeed, explain the spread of yellow plumage. However, we found that this advantage occurred only in mixed leks where the frequency of yellow males is greater than white males. This suggests that the advantage of yellow males may depend on the presence of other yellow males, which may slow the rate of introgression in leks where yellow frequency is low such as in areas where yellow males are beginning to colonize the white population. This, along with the geographic barrier posed by major rivers in the hybrid zone, may initially limit or slow the spread of yellow plumage. Finally, we found that yellow and white males were similar in aggression and body size, and held comparable positions within leks. Because these traits or factors are often important in or dictated by aggressive male-male interactions, these comparisons indicate that male-male interaction is not the primary mechanism for the spread of yellow plumage. However, white and yellow males received similar numbers of courtship visits from females but differed in the number of matings, suggesting that females actively rejected white in favor of yellow males. Our results indicate that sexual selection by female choice has driven the unidirectional introgression of yellow plumage into the white population, providing a mechanism for how hybrid zones act as conduits of novel and advantageous traits.

ID INVASIVENESS
AB Aim Recent works have found the presence of native congeners to have a small effect on the naturalization rates of introduced plants, some suggesting a negative interaction (as proposed by Charles Darwin in The Origin of Species), and others a positive association. We assessed this question for a new biogeographic region, and discuss some of the problems associated with data base analyses of this type.
   Location Islands of the Mediterranean basin.
   Methods Presence or absence of congeners was assessed for all naturalized alien plants species at regional, local and habitat scales. Using general linear models, we attempted to explain the abundance of the species (as measured by the number of islands where recorded) from their congeneric status, and assessed whether the patterns could be alternatively accounted for by a range of biological, geographical and anthropogenic factors. A simulation model was also used to investigate the impact of a simple bias on a comparable but hypothetical data set.
   Results Data base analyses addressing Darwin's hypothesis are prone to bias from a number of sources. Interaction between invaders and congenerics may be overestimated, as they often do not co-occur in the same habitats. Furthermore, intercorrelations between naturalization success and associated factors such as introduction frequency, which are also not independent from relatedness with the native flora, may generate an apparent influence of congenerics without implying a biological interaction. We detected no true influence from related natives on the successful establishment of alien species of the Mediterranean. Rarely-introduced species tended to fare better in the presence of congeners, but it appears that this effect was generated because species introduced accidentally into highly invasible agricultural and ruderal habitats have many relatives in the region, due to common evolutionary origins.
   Main conclusions Relatedness to the native flora has no more than a marginal influence on the invasion success of alien plants in the Mediterranean, although apparent trends can easily be generated through artefacts of the data base.

AB 1. Habitat loss and degradation of wetland ecosystems, principally through large-scale drainage and conversion to arable farmland, have been implicated in the widespread, dramatic declines of breeding waders across Europe. Managing the remaining wetlands to reverse these declines will require a detailed understanding of their habitat requirements.
   2. In the UK, grazing marshes are key components of the remaining wetlands in both coastal and inland sites, and the structure of grazing marsh habitat can differ between these locations. Redshank Tringa totanus is a declining wader species that breeds in both marsh types. We quantified the habitat features that influence redshank selection of breeding and nest site locations, across coastal and inland marshes, in eastern England.
   3. On both marsh types, breeding location and breeding densities within fields were positively related to the lengths of pool edge and all wet features, respectively. Nest site location was principally influenced by vegetation characteristics, with soil penetrability also important on inland sites but proximity to wet features and vegetation type at the nest important on coastal sites. Hatching probability was higher when the surrounding soils were more penetrable.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The wet features of critical importance for breeding redshank are common on coastal marshes and can be deliberately established on inland sites. Coastal marshes are often rare and frequently threatened by dynamic coastal processes, whereas inland marshes are more abundant but largely unsuitable for breeding waders at present. These analyses highlight the scope for improving the management of inland marshes for breeding redshank. As habitat suitable for breeding redshank frequently supports a range of other wader species, this information can also direct management efforts to improve breeding wader populations in the wider countryside.

AB Nitrogen (N) availability is a primary limiting factor in many temperate deciduous forests. However, increased atmospheric N deposition over recent decades has dramatically altered nutrient cycles in many eastern forests. Given the variability of ecosystem responses to N deposition and the sensitivity of herbaceous layer vegetation to edaphic and microenvironmental conditions, changes in nutrient dynamics could have important implications for forest diversity and productivity. To better understand variations in soil N relative to understory dynamics, we sampled herbaceous layer composition and diversity across topographic gradients in managed (10-year-old aggrading) and mature (> 125 years) mixed-oak stands in southeastern Ohio. Vegetation was sampled in spring and summer to capture variations in vernal and late season herb communities. Edaphic and microenvironmental conditions were characterized during these same periods, including analyses of upper mineral soil samples for total C, N, and C/N ratio. Aggrading stands showed significantly lower soil N than mature forest stands (spring = 0.145% versus 0.165%; summer = 0.146% versus 0.197%; P < 0.001). Topography influenced soil N, with greater availability on lower and north-facing slopes (P < 0.05). Across all stands, C/N was strongly correlated with herb layer composition (spring r = 0.606; summer r = 0.449) and, in mature stands, was a strong predictor of understory richness (linear regression; r(2) = 0.634; P < 0.001), particularly on poorer sites. These results emphasize that changes in soil and vegetation with increased N deposition are likely to be site-specific, even within relatively uniform systems. Understory diversity patterns on less fertile sites or in more mature forests, those systems exhibiting strongest correlations with soil C/N ratios, appear most likely to be affected, whereas edaphic limitations in vigorously growing, aggrading vegetation may be less impacted. Because herbaceous layer interactions are tightly linked to ecosystem-level nutrient dynamics and to woody seedling success, these influences have the potential to significantly alter overstory recruitment patterns and broader ecosystem responses to N deposition.

To distinguish between these hypotheses, amplified fragment length polymorphism markers were located on a molecular linkage map of Phaseolus vulgaris relative to genes for the domestication syndrome and other traits. Diversity for these same markers was then analyzed in two samples of wild and domesticated populations from Mesoamerica. Differentiation between wild and domesticated populations was significantly higher in parapatric and allopatric populations compared to sympatric populations. It was also significantly higher near genes for domestication compared to those away from these genes. Concurrently, the differences in genetic diversity between wild and domesticated populations were strongest around such genes. These data suggest that selection in the presence of introgression appears to be a major evolutionary factor maintaining the identity of wild and domesticated populations in sympatric situations. Furthermore, alleles from domesticated populations appear to have displaced alleles in sympatric wild populations, thus leading to a reduction in genetic diversity in such populations. These results also provide a possible experimental framework for assessing the long-term risk of transgene escape and the targeting of transgenes inside the genome to minimize the survival of these transgenes into wild populations following introduction by gene flow.

AB Aim Andean forests are known to be a major diversity hotspot for vascular plants and vertebrates, but virtually nothing is known about the diversity of arthropods. We examined whether montane rain forests in southern Ecuador are also a diversity hotspot for arthropods, and chose geometrid moths as a model group.
   Location The study area in southern Ecuador (Province Zamora-Chinchipe, 79 degrees W, 04 degrees S) covers c. 40 km(2), with 39 collecting sites within an elevational range of 1040-2677 m a.s.l. Thirty-five of the sites were situated in an area c. 2.5 km(2). Additional qualitative sampling was carried out in the same area and up to an elevation of 3100 m.
   Methods Nocturnal moths were collected quantitatively and qualitatively using portable light towers consisting of two 15 W fluorescent tubes, and diurnal moths were collected qualitatively using an insect net. Insects were sampled in six fieldwork periods in the years 1999-2003. As diversity measures, Fisher's alpha of the log-series distribution as well as eight estimators of total species richness were applied.
   Results A total of 1266 species were recorded, 63% of which were identified to named species, whereas the remainder are likely to include many undescribed species. Quantitative samples at light towers collected 35,238 specimens representing 1223 species. The extrapolated species number for these data is 1420 (incidence coverage estimator). Twenty-one additional nocturnal species and 22 exclusively diurnal species were sampled qualitatively at elevations between 1040 and 3100 m. The pooled value of Fisher's alpha for all quantitative samples is 246 +/- 3.
   Main conclusions The diversity of Geometridae documented here is much higher than anywhere else in the world, even without the inclusion of additional species from adjacent lowland rain forests. The number of recorded species in this small area corresponds to more than 6% of the known world fauna of geometrid moths. Our study emphasizes the importance of protecting the remaining montane Andean rain forests. For setting priorities in conservation, more studies on insect diversity are urgently required in other regions of the Andes, since montane forests are being destroyed at an alarming rate.

AB Picophytoplankton organisms were derived from larger ancestors in both cyanobacteria and (polyphyletically) in eukarya. There are a number of putative advantages in the acquisition of photosynthetically active,radiation and nutrient solutes from resource-limited habitats, and probably of maximum specific growth rate, for very small cells relative to the situation for larger phytoplankton cells. However, there are also putative disadvantages for such small cells with respect to bottom-up factors (i.e. those limiting biomass production), including an increased potential for solute leakage and an increased metabolic cost of screening out damaging UV-B. Among top-down factors (i.e. those removing biomass), picophytoplankton may be at an advantage relative to larger phytoplankton cells in avoiding damage from eukaryotic parasites, and losses from sedimentation. However, viruses and (small) grazers can attack picophytoplankton, just as viruses and (larger) grazers can attack larger phytoplankton. Picophytoplankton may be at a disadvantage relative to larger phytoplankton in environments with temporally variable resource supply.

AB Wooded rangelands are a vast grazing land resource globally, including shrublands, savannas and forested ranges. They generally provide forage year-round for small ruminants and they are vitally important for livestock production, especially goats. While the productivity of wooded rangelands is low to moderate, their importance to small ruminant production is considerable. In this paper, we begin by discussing some anti-quality characteristics (mechanical and chemical defences) of woody vegetation that reduce their forage value, deter foraging, and reduce performance and productivity of small ruminants. We then present examples of grazing studies that illustrate how small ruminants select their diets on wooded rangelands. We conclude by discussing why small ruminants select the diets they do within the evolutionary processes of plant-herbivore interactions. Finally, we discuss how this knowledge can be integrated into approaches for sustainable management of wooded rangelands for small ruminant production. Plant defences are abundant in wooded rangelands but they are not a complete barrier to small ruminants as they often use woody plants as part of their diets. Indeed plants with such defences may represent a significant forage resource enabling small ruminants to survive on wooded rangelands with a prolonged dry period when more preferred defenceless species are absent. Future research in plant-herbivore interactions should include investigating how plant biochemical diversity influences herbivore preference for various plant communities, and integrating this information to develop recommendations for managing wooded rangelands.

AB Understanding the ecological differences between native and invasive species is of considerable scientific and practical interest. We examined such differences between native and invasive inland fish species from the Iberian Peninsula in order to analyse the importance of phylogenetic correction and variability (in addition to central tendency). We collected 26 quantitative and qualitative variables on the ecology, life-history traits and human use of the 69 inland fish species of the Iberian Peninsula, including native, invasive and migratory species. The taxonomic distribution of invasive fish species deviated significantly from world freshwater richness and in contrast to native species, invasive fish belongs to only five taxonomic orders but to a wide spectrum of families not native to the Iberian Peninsula. Because the life-history traits were highly dependent on taxonomy, the results, with or without applying phylogenetic methods, differed and after accounting for phylogeny, invasive species displayed higher and wider latitude in general and a different reproductive season mainly among salmonids and cyprinids. Human use was also significantly different between native and invasive fish species and produced more variability in life-history traits of invasive species and uneven taxonomic distribution because of the high diversity of species introduced. We show that accounting for taxonomy and studying variability in addition to central tendency is important in the comparison of life-history traits between native and invasive species.

AB We studied the temporal variability and resistance to perturbation of the biomass production of grassland communities from an experimental diversity gradient (the Portuguese BIODEPTH project site). With increasing species richness relative temporal variability (CV) of plant populations increased but that of communities decreased, supporting the insurance hypothesis and related theory. Species-rich communities were more productive than species-poor communities in all three years although a natural climatic perturbation in the third year (frequent frost and low precipitation) caused an overall decrease in biomass production. Resistance to this perturbation was constant across the experimental species richness gradient in relative terms, supporting a similar response from the Swiss BIODEPTH experiment. The positive biomass response was generated by different combinations of the complementarity and selection effects in different years. Complementarity effects were positive across mixtures on average in all three years and positively related to diversity in one season. The complementarity effect declined following perturbation in line with total biomass but, counter to predictions, in relative terms overyielding was maintained in all years. Selection effects were positively related to diversity in one year and negative overall in the other two years. The response to perturbation varied among species and for the same species growing in monoculture and mixture, but following the frost communities were more strongly dominated by species with lower monoculture biomass and the selection effect was more negative. In total, our results support previous findings of a positive relationship between diversity and productivity and between diversity and the temporal stability of production, but of no effect of diversity on the resistance to perturbation. We demonstrate for the first time that the relative strength of overyielding remained constant during an exceptional natural environmental perturbation.

I briefly consider an example of each - Fisher's geometric model and Gillespie's mutational landscape model, respectively - reviewing recent results. Despite their fundamental differences, these models give rise to several strikingly similar results. I consider possible reasons for this congruence.

AB Although the Northwest currently has the least proportion of non-native invasive plant species relative to other regions of North America, invasions continue to increase into the mountainous areas of the region. Landscape structure, such as the variation found along the complex gradients of the Northwest mountain ecoregions, affects the expansion of invasive plant species and the invasibility of plant communities. Also, the history of land use and current use patterns affect the expansion of invasive plants, and many of the deteriorated environments in the region's mountains may invite and stabilize plant invasions. We examined the patterns of invasive plant diversity in Northwest mountain ecoregions, is derived from literature sources, to analyze which factors influence plant invasions. Our analysis found altered riparian systems and disturbed forests to be especially vulnerable to plant invasion. Conversely, alpine and wilderness areas are still relatively unaffected by invasive plants. Both riparian and alpine communities, while making up a relatively small area across Northwest mountain ecoregions, have significant ecological importance and deserve special protection from invasive plant introductions. Human settlement at low elevations and intense land use of upland forests will likely continue to enhance invasive plant introductions into Northwest mountain ecosystems. Knowledge of the relationships between biological and environmental factors, disturbance, and human land use will be critical for future management strategies that proactively locate, prevent, or contain plant invasions in the mountains of the Northwest.

AB This study explores the correlates of alien plant species richness in South Africa at the scale of quarter-degree squares (QDS; similar or equal to 25 x 27 km; 675 km(2)). We considered all alien plant species for which we had records and a subset of these - those that invade natural and semi-natural vegetation. The main source of data for species richness of indigenous and alien plant species was a national database based on herbarium specimens. For invasive alien species, data were from a national atlassing project. First, we explored the importance of energy availability and habitat heterogeneity as correlates of indigenous, alien, and invasive alien plant species richness. Linear regression models showed that species richness in the three groups of plants was explained by the same variables: a principal component of climatic factors and topographic roughness were the top-ranking variables for all groups. Next, we examined the role of indigenous species richness together with a range of environmental and human-activity variables in explaining species richness of alien and invasive alien plants. Results reveal an interplay of natural features and variables that quantify the dimension of human activities. If indigenous species richness is ignored, human-activity variables are more strongly correlated with alien species richness than with invasive alien species richness. Numbers of alien and invasive species in QDSs are significantly correlated with indigenous plant species richness in the 1,597 QDSs selected for analysis, a pattern consistent with findings from other parts of the world. Analysis of residuals between observed and predicted values showed that patterns differed between biomes. The results are useful for planning long-term intervention policy at the national scale; they suggest that areas with rich native biodiversity will face a sustained onslaught from invasive alien species and that ongoing management actions will be required to reduce and mitigate impacts from biological invasions in these areas.

AB After a major increase in incidence between the 1970s and the 1990s, the Brazilian Amazon region now accounts for the most cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in the Americas. Polymorphism of 10 microsatellite loci in the P. falciparum genome was studied in 196 isolates obtained from 5 populations in the region. There was significant multilocus linkage disequilibrium, particularly within populations with lower proportions of mixed-genotype infections. However, most multilocus genotypes in different isolates were distinct, and there was no evidence of any recent epidemic expansion of particular clones. Genetic divergence between populations was very substantial but did not fit a simple model of isolation by distance. Thus, different foci of P. falciparum in Brazil are quite independent, with distinct population structures and minimal gene flow, a finding that has implications for strategies to control infection and to contain the spread of drug resistance at a regional level.

AB Telomeres are short tandem repeated sequences of DNA found at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that function in stabilizing chromosomal end integrity. In vivo studies of somatic tissue of mammals and birds have shown a correlation between telomere length and organismal age within species, and correlations between telomere shortening rate and lifespan among species. This result presents the tantalizing possibility that telomere length could be used to provide much needed information on age, ageing and survival in natural populations where longitudinal studies are lacking. Here we review methods available for measuring telomere length and discuss the potential uses and limitations of telomeres as age and ageing estimators in the fields of vertebrate ecology, evolution and conservation.

AB Due to bush encroachment the grazing capacity of large areas of the southern African savanna has declined, often to such an extent that many previously economic livestock properties are now no longer economically viable. Attempts at restoring encroached areas by the removal of some or all of the woody plants will normally result in an increase of grass production and thus also the grazing capacity. However, the results of woody plant removal may differ between vegetation types, with the outcome determined by both negative and positive responses to tree removal. The rapid establishment of tree seedlings after the removal of some or all of the mature woody plants may reduce the effective time span of restoration measures. In many cases the resultant re-establishment of new woody seedlings may in time develop into a state that is worse than the original state. This paper is an attempt to summarize existing knowledge on the importance of woody plants in savanna and explore measures, based on ecosystem dynamics, which can be utilized to restore encroached areas more successfully. It is hypothesized that a more stable environment can be created by maintaining or restoring savanna structure (large trees). In a structured savanna, large trees are able to suppress the establishment of new seedlings, while maintaining the other benefits of woody plants like soil enrichment and the provision of food to browsing herbivore species. Effective restoration of encroached areas should not be considered a once-off event, but rather a long-term commitment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The function of fresh green nest material has long been debated. It has been suggested that it reduces the number of ectoparasites in nests and on nestlings (nest protection hypothesis), or is used by males to signal condition and paternal quality (male quality hypothesis) or is used as a sexually selected ornament to attract females (courtship hypothesis). We simultaneously tested these three hypotheses in the European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, in the field. Green material was carried by male starlings only, and mainly during nest building. It was not used to reduce ectoparasites. Males nesting in nestboxes that were experimentally contaminated with ectoparasites did not carry more green nest material than males nesting in control boxes, and experimental removal and addition of green material had no effect on the number of ectoparasites on the nestlings or on their body mass. Furthermore, the amount of green material carried into a nestbox was not associated with male body mass, paternal incubation attendance or nestling food provisioning. There is two-fold experimental evidence that males use green plant material to attract mates. First, removal of greenery resulted in a significantly lower percentage of nestboxes containing a clutch than the control or addition treatment. Second, unpaired male starlings sang more and carried more greenery into a nestbox when a caged female was positioned adjacent to the nestbox than when a caged male or an empty cage was present. Paired males, when subjected to the same experimental design, did not respond. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Within the framework of the 'dynamic equilibrium model', we tested the hypothesis that fishing causes major disturbance to benthic communities on deeper bottoms of the continental shelf. Benthic megafauna on the Bay of Biscay coast of France was sampled on fishing grounds subject to various conditions of exploitation. Samples were taken at around 100 m depth to avoid strong natural disturbances. Species diversity and the largest body mass class of invertebrates were smaller in strongly exploited areas than in moderately exploited ones. Biomass size spectra in strongly exploited areas were characterised by a comparatively large biomass of small invertebrates, hence the K-dominance curve of abundance was either above the biomass curve, or the curves intersected. In moderately exploited areas, the K-dominance biomass curves were above the abundance curves; the dominant species were a commercial species and a benthic species sensitive to the physical effects of the fishing gears. In the heavily exploited areas, the dominant species were opportunistic carnivorous species of minor or no commercial interest. There were no dominant fish species in the most strongly exploited areas, while 2 fish species were found in the moderately exploited areas. No fragile species were found in the most exploited areas, whereas 6 fragile species were found in the moderately exploited ones. It is concluded that the differences between the most strongly exploited and the moderately exploited areas were consistent with the hypothesis.

AB In variable environments, it is probable that environmental conditions in the past can influence demographic performance now. Cohort effects occur when these delayed life-history effects are synchronized among groups of individuals in a population. Here we show how plasticity in density-dependent demographic traits throughout the life cycle can lead to cohort effects and that there can be substantial population dynamic consequences of these effects. We show experimentally that density and food conditions early in development can influence subsequent juvenile life-history traits. We also show that conditions early in development can interact with conditions at maturity to shape future adult performance. In fact, conditions such as food availability and density at maturity, like conditions early in development, can generate cohort effects in mature stages. Based on these data, and on current theory about the effects of plasticity generated by historical environments, we make predictions about the consequences of such changes on density-dependent demography and on mite population dynamics. We use a stochastic cohort effects model to generate a range of population dynamics. In accordance with the theory, we find the predicted changes in the strength of density dependence and associated changes in population dynamics and population variability.

AB We used the introduction of a generalist nest predator, the red squirrel Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, and of a large herbivore, the Sitka black-tailed deer Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis, to the islands of Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia, Canada) to study how predator assemblage and habitat quality and structure influenced nest predation in forest birds. We compared losses of natural nests to predators on islands with and without squirrels. We selected nine islands with or without squirrel or deer and used 506 artificial nests put on the ground or in shrubs to further analyse variation of nest predation with predator assemblage and habitat quality for the predators. For both natural and artificial nests predation risk was higher in presence of squirrels. But predation risk varied within island categories. In presence of squirrels it was highest in stands with mature conifers where it fluctuated from year to year, in response to fluctuations in squirrel abundance. Vegetation cover around the nest had little effect on nest predation by squirrels. Where squirrels were absent, nest predation concentrated near predictable food sources for corvids, the main native predators, and increased with decreasing vegetation cover, suggesting that removal of the vegetation by deer increased the risk of predation by native avian nest predators that use visual cues. Predation risk in these forests therefore varies in space and time with predator composition and with quality of the habitat from the predators' perspective. This temporal and spatial variation in predation risk should promote trade-offs in the response of birds to nest predation, rather than fine-tuned adaptations to a given predation pattern.

AB Biomass measurements of totora and bofedal Andean wetland grasses in the Bolivian Northern Altiplano were correlated over a growing season to vegetation indices derived from 1-km visible and near-infrared bands of the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) instrument flown on the NOAA-14 polar-orbiting meteorological satellite. This article discusses the potential and limits of these indices for the assessment of the spatial and temporal variation of biomass and of the fraction of the photosynthetic active radiation absorbed by these herbaceous native forages growing in water-saturated environments. Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) normalization was also investigated based on simple kernel-driven models. BRDF normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) performed the best for both totorales and bofedales vegetation associations, followed by the uncorrected maximum-value composite NDVI. BRDF normalized NDVI was shown to be sensitive to the green leaf or photosynthetically active biomass.
   Estimation of biomass production after Kumar and Monteith (1982) was used to determine the efficiency of solar energy conversion into biomass (epsilon(b)) for the main phenological periods, corresponding to the rainy and dry seasons. Two approaches were investigated for the biomass production estimation: the first one is based on monthly field biomass measurements; the second one is based on estimates from the regression computed previously using Roujean's BRDF normalized NDVI. The values found for these efficiencies for the rainy season agree with those of the literature for grasslands of temperate regions. For the dry season, more accurate information on totora and bofedal senescence and on animal consumption is required to get a reasonable efficiency value. This is not surprising, as other workers have reported biomass estimation with remotely sensed data to be most relevant to the growing season. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the impacts of landuse history and forest age structure on regional carbon fluxes for the forests in the Pacific Northwest of the United States based on a two-stage modeling strategy. In the first stage, an individual-based forest ecosystem carbon flux model (IntCarb) at stand scale is developed. IntCarb combines components from,the ZELIG and CENTURY models to simulate forest development and heterotrophic respiration, respectively. Stand scale carbon fluxes simulated by IntCarb strongly depend on stand age. A forest stand can be a carbon sink for up to 200 years old with a peak at 30-40 years old. Old-growth stands are carbon neutral to the atmosphere in the long term. For any particular year, an old-growth stand can be either a carbon sink or source. The interannual variation of Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) for an old-growth stand is primarily determined by heterotrophic respiration. Due to the high spatial variability of stand ages, forest age structure needs to be taken into account to improve estimation of carbon budgets of forest ecosystems over large areas. In the stand stage, a regional carbon budget model (RegCarb) is developed to estimate regional carbon fluxes over large areas based on forest age structure, adjusting for the nonrespiratory carbon losses (timber harvesting). Our initial estimate with RegCarb for the Pacific Northwest of the United States indicates that this region was a tremendous carbon source to the atmosphere from 1890 to 1990 due to extensive logging of old-growth forest. Projection for the role of forests in this region in global carbon cycle in the future strongly depend on the amount of timber to be harvested, i.e. how the age structure of forests in this region is to be altered.

AB Two field studies were carried out with farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in sea cages to examine various effects of artificial light (AL) and the vertical distribution of salmon on lice infestation. The use of AL light caused an overall increase in lice infestation in both experiments. The first study showed that salmon held at 0-4 in depth in cages developed higher infestation than salmon held at greater depths (4-8 and 8-12 m) under both natural light (NL) and AL. In the second study, salmon maintained in 14-m deep sea cages that were exposed to AL with different light intensities. The AL treatments resulted directly in different diel and seasonal patterns of vertical distribution of the salmon and also different temporal patterns in lice infestations. So indirectly the infestation pattern appeared to be correlated with median day-time swimming depth of the salmon. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB One hundred surface sediment samples of the Arabian Sea (Indian Ocean) were investigated and relative abundances of coccoliths were compared to mean annual gradients of temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, PO(4) and mixed layer depth. Total coccolith concentrations ranged from 42x10(6)/g sediment in coastal areas to more than 19 000 x 10(6)/g sediment in oceanic regions. The general distribution does not seem to be dependent on coccolithophore productivity in surface waters,alone, but also on the diluting input of terrigenous material. A total of 27 taxa were identified. The main species dominating the assemblages were Gephyrocapsa oceanica, Emiliania huxleyi and Florisphaera profunda with a combined average abundance of more than 70%. Several species and species groups reflect with their distribution the environmental parameters of the overlying water masses and may be successfully used to improve palaeoclimatic reconstructions, e.g. (a) F profunda exhibits a high similarity or even positive correlation to the mean annual mixed layer depth, (b) calciosolenids can be described as coastal or shelf species. While temperature and salinity gradients do not seem to be crucial for coccolithophores in this region, the mean mixed layer depth as well as the PO(4) concentration (representative for total nutrient availability) may control in part the coccolithophore assemblages. According to the results of a cluster analysis and the distribution pattern of all species, it was possible to differentiate three main coccolithophore assemblages. A G. oceanica dominated assemblage mainly occurs in the northern part of the study area and can be described as 'high nutrient assemblage'. The second assemblage, dominated by F profunda, may be typical for oligotrophic and stable conditions in open ocean waters. A third assemblage, with high amounts of 'coastal species', characterises coastal conditions on the shelves. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB River otters (Lontra canadensis) were extirpated from much of their historic distribution because of exposure to pollution and urbanization, resulting in expansive reintroduction programmes that continue today for this and other species of otters worldwide. Bioaccumulation of toxins negatively affects fecundity among mustelids, but high vagility and different dispersal distances between genders may permit otter populations to recover from extirpation caused by localized environmental pollution. Without understanding the influence of factors such as social structure and sex-biased dispersal on genetic variation and gene flow among populations, effects of local extirpation and the potential for natural recolonization (i.e. the need for translocations) cannot be assessed. We studied gene flow among seven study areas for river otters (n = 110 otters) inhabiting marine environments in Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA. Using nine DNA microsatellite markers and assignment tests, we calculated immigration rates and dispersal distances and tested for isolation by distance. In addition, we radiotracked 55 individuals in three areas to determine characteristics of dispersal. Gender differences in sociality and spatial relationships resulted in different dispersal distances. Male river otters had greater gene flow among close populations (within 16-30 km) mostly via breeding dispersal, but both genders exhibited an equal, low probability of natal dispersal; and some females dispersed 6090 km. These data, obtained in a coastal environment without anthropogenic barriers to dispersal (e.g. habitat fragmentation or urbanization), may serve as baseline data for predicting dispersal under optimal conditions. Our data may indicate that natural recolonization of coastal river otters following local extirpation could be a slow process because of low dispersal among females, and recolonization may be substantially delayed unless viable populations occurred nearby. Because of significant isolation by distance for male otters and low gene flow for females, translocations should be undertaken with caution to help preserve genetic diversity in this species.

AB 1. Changes in water chemistry, benthic organic matter (BOM), and macroinvertebrates were examined in four different glacial streams over an annual cycle. The streams experienced strong seasonal changes in water chemistry that reflected temporal changes in the influence from the source glacier, especially in water turbidity, particulate phosphorus and conductivity.
   2. Nitrogen concentrations were high (nitrate-N values were 130-274 mug L(-1)), especially during spring snowmelt runoff. Benthic organic matter attained >600 g m(-2) dry mass at certain times, peaks being associated with seasonal blooms of the alga Hydrurus foetidus.
   3. Macroinvertebrate taxon richness was two to three times higher (also numbers and biomass) in winter than summer suggesting winter may be a more favourable period for these animals. Benthic densities averaged 1140-3820 ind. m(-2), although peaking as high as 9000 ind. m(-2). Average annual biomass ranged from 102 to 721 Mg m(-2), and reached >2000 mg m(-2) at one site in autumn.
   4. Taxa common to all sites included the dipterans Diamesa spp. and Rhypholophus sp., the plecopterans Leuctra spp. and Rhabdiopteryx alpina, and the ephemeropterans Baetis alpinus and Rhithrogena spp. Principal components analysis clearly separated winter assemblages from those found in summer.

AB We conducted a four-year study on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington to assess the relationship between corvid (Gray Jay [Perisoreus canadensis], Steller's Jay [Cyanocitta stelleri], American Crow [Corvus brachyrhynchos] and Common Raven [Corvus corax]) abundance and the risk of nest predation. We assessed risk of predation through the use of artificial mid-canopy nests and assessed corvid abundance using a variety of techniques including point-count surveys, transect surveys, and the broadcast of corvid territorial arid predator attraction calls. Point counts of corvid abundance had the strongest correlation with predation on artificial nests containing eggs. The relationship between nest predation rate and corvid abundance was strongest when study plots were used as replicated measures of landscape conditions rather than its independent samples. We Suggest using the maximum value for each corvid Species attained from several temporally replicated point-count surveys in each study plot. Corvid point-counts should be conducted on days with light winds (<20 kph) and no more than light precipitation. Use of attraction calls is important for gaining a meaningful measure of corvid abundance, Their use may overrepresent corvids at the local plot scale but is important in assessing the landscape scale presence of wide-ranging (American Crows) and often non-vocal (Gray Jays) corvids.

AB We compared taxonomic and ecological attributes of native and introduced planes (N = 1330 and 484 species. respectively) of southwestern Ontario, using two regional floras (Essex County and Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Municipality) for distributions, and published sources for ecological attributes. Most exotics (86.4%) originate from Europe and Asia. Exotic species tended to occur in families having just one-to-few species locally. Seven families (Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Boraginaceae, Brassicaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Fabaceae, and Malvaceae) were significantly over-represented by exotics compared to the distribution of native species in these families, while exotics were significantly under-represented in six families (Cyperaceae, Fagaceae, Juncaceae, Orchidaceae, Potamogotonaceae, and Ranunculaceae). In habitat comparisons, exotic species were significantly over-represented (compared to native species) in disturbed and degraded habitats and moist substrates, while being under-represented in woodland, thicket, and wetland. Introduced species of southwestern Ontario have life history traits that facilitate success in degraded, disturbed and highly fragmented environments. For example, exotics were significantly over-represented by the following life-history traits: short life span, flowering season of four or more months, hermaphrodite sex habit, and very small fruits (< 5 mm). They were significantly under-represented by the monoecious and dioecious sex habits, a flowering period of two months and less, animal-based seed dispersal. and relatively small fruits (5.1 - 10 mm). A separate analysis of exotic species found only in undisturbed communities, showed these species to be more likely to occur in open and moist habitats, to have a tree habit, and an extended flowering period, and to produce many seeds per fruit (> 7).

AB Macrofungal assemblages of Sitka spruce and Scots pine plantations in northern Britain were compared to those of semi-natural pine and oak woodlands, with a focus on threatened pinewood taxa. Fungal species-richness and species-composition were related to climate, soil, vegetation and stand variables across a range of crop stages. Altogether, 419 species were recorded (12 parasites, 76 wood saprotrophs, 174 mycorrhizal species, 157 litter saprotrophs). There were no differences in fungal species-richness between plantations and semi-natural woodlands nor any effects of crop species age or type. Significant positive correlations were recorded between fungal species-richness and ground vegetation diversity, and between wood saprotroph-richness and fallen deadwood volume. Each crop species type had a distinctive mycota related to differences in climate, tree and vegetation diversity. Over-mature stands had a higher proportion of "late-successional" mycorrhizal species than the other growth stages. Nineteen Red Data list fungi species were recorded; plots nearer to semi-natural pinewood areas had a higher number of species records. These results highlight the importance of planted forests as a habitat for native fungi. Habitat value could be further enhanced through increasing the area of "old-growth" non-intervention reserves, and locating these reserves near existing semi-natural woodland fragments.

AB Aim We used data from the annual Fourth of July Butterfly Count for the years 1989-97 to examine patterns of species richness and total butterfly abundance across North America and within topographically diverse and disturbed landscapes.
   Location We analysed counts from 514 different locations in North America. The counts represent all areas of the USA and southern Canada, with a few Mexican sites as well, although most counts were in the eastern USA.
   Methods First, we standardized published count data according to the effort expended per count (total party-hours). Using regression analysis and analysis of variance, we then examined the impact of latitude, longitude, topographical relief, habitat disturbance and different climatic measures on the species richness and total abundance of butterflies per count. We also examined the abundance of exotic species in disturbed landscapes.
   Results Our analyses suggest that: (1) species richness is highest at low latitudes and near Rocky Mountain longitudes; (2) the total abundance of individuals is highest in northern US latitudes and Great Plains longitudes; (3) species richness but not total abundance increases with greater topographical relief; (4) species richness and diversity indices are lower in more disturbed habitats; and (5) the abundance of the introduced Pieris rapae (L.) is greater in more disturbed habitats.
   Main conclusions Different factors control the abundance and species richness of North American butterflies. Along with geographical location, habitat disturbance and topographical variability affect species richness. Our analysis also shows the value of broad-based monitoring regimes, such as the North American Fourth of July Butterfly Count.

AB Measurements of global solar radiation (R-s) and global photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were made for a period of 12 months at Ilorin, Nigeria in order to find the relationship between them. The average ratio of PAR to R-s for the year was 2.08 E MJ(-1) with the dry and rainy season values of 2.02 and 2.12 E MJ(-1), respectively. The minimum monthly mean daily ratio of 1.92 E MJ(-1) was in January, a dry (Harmattan) season month while the maximum was 2.15 E MJ(-1) in May, a rainy season month. Generally, the ratio values in the rainy season months and even dry season months (except the Harmattan months) remain constant at about 2.1 E MJ(-1). On daily basis, the maximum and minimum ratios were 1.86 and 2.31 E MJ(-1) respectively. Hourly values of the ratio increased on average from 2.07 to 2.15 E MJ(-1) as the sky conditions changed from 'clear' to 'cloudy'. There was no daylength effect on the ratio.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate pollen-vegetation relationships on a local scale and to identify grazed and mown vegetation types by their pollen assemblages. Vegetation frequency analysis and pollen analysis of surface moss polsters from grazed and mown vegetation types in western Norway were carried out. Five one-square-metre plots within 10 x 10 m plots from 36 different sites were investigated using classification (TWINSPAN, DISCRIM) and ordination (correspondence analysis, canonical correspondence analysis) methods. The pollen assemblages reflected the local vegetation and there was good agreement between the classifications and ordinations of the two data sets. This agreement occurred despite both the inclusion of extralocal and regional pollen and the low representation of entomophilous species affecting the pollen assemblages. Gradients were found in the pollen assemblages relating to land-use practices as well as geographical regions. Pollen assemblages from heath were separated from the other investigated vegetation types and characterized by high percentages of Calluna. A pollen-analytical separation of mown meadows from grazed sites was identified, whereas a separation between mown meadows and grazed sites which had previously been mown was found to be unclear. Plantago lanceolata, Rumex acetosa type, Ranunculus acris type, and Asteraceae Cichorioideae were common in both mown and grazed vegetation types. Galium type, Cirsium type, and Succisa were more associated with grazing than mowing, whereas the opposite was true for e.g. Achillea type, Alchemilla, and Conopodium majus type and several pollen types were connected with the mown meadows. The modern pollen assemblages from mown and grazed vegetation types may aid in the identification of past hay meadows and pastures from local pollen diagrams. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The charcoal and pollen stratigraphy of an annually laminated sediment of a small lake in eastern Finland (63 degrees 10'N, 30 degrees 58'E) was examined, and found to cover a period of 1300 years. The region around the lake is remote and nowadays almost unpopulated. The fire interval around the study lake was 85 years, with a range of 60-134 years during the 900-year period before any major human influence, and the corresponding fire rotation time estimate was c. 130 years. About half of the fires were probably mild surficial fires, leaving most Scots pine alive. Only one extensive, catastrophic fire during the 900-year period was evident. The fires maintained the forest succession cycles before human influence. The abundance of smallest charcoal particles and trends in estimated palaeotemperatures showed congruence, suggesting increased burning in large regions during warmer climatic periods. The charcoal influx values increased markedly from c. AD 1600 onwards due to the commencement of slash-and-burn cultivation in the area. The pollen and charcoal evidence suggests a period of extensive slash-and-burn agriculture from c. Ao 1720 to the beginning of the twentieth century. The short fire interval during the slash-and-burning period caused major changes in forest structure: spruce decreased considerably, and pine became the dominant tree in the area. The charcoal influx into the lake has increased since the beginning of the present century despite fire suppression and the charcoal particle-size distribution suggests lone distance origin for these particles.

AB A 291 cm sediment core was taken from Lake Tsuolbmajavri in the Finnish tree-line area. The core was dated by means of 14 AMS C-14-dates. Pollen data indicate that during the early-Holocene the catchment was characterized by birch forest. Gradual expansion of pine started at 9200 cal BP. Pine reached its maximum occurrence at 7200-6000 cal BP and pine tree-line retreated from the area at 4600 cal BP. During the late Holocene, the cooler and moister climate led to increasing peatland development in the catchment. The influence of vegetation dynamics on the limnology of the lake was investigated by means of diatom-stratigraphical data. The increasing total organic carbon (TOC) concentration, water color, and decreasing pH from 8500 cal BP to 6000 cal BP reflect the gradual development of forest and more humic soil. The disappearance of pine caused a slight rise in pH and a decrease of TOC and water color values. At 3000 cal BP, TOC concentrations and water color started to increase again. This change is synchronous with the rise of Sphagnum spore influx values and may reflect the impact of peatland expansion on lake water quality. The results suggest that the catchment vegetation patterns, mainly tree-line dynamics and peatland distribution, have influenced the limnological features of Lake Tsuolbmajavri.

TI SHE analysis for biofacies identification
SO JOURNAL OF FORAMINIFERAL RESEARCH

ID NORTH-AMERICA; FORAMINIFERA; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS
AB Most quantitative methodologies for designating biofacies do so by ordering, in some way, all the possible similarities between stations along some gradient. The procedure is considered successful when the ordering produces mappable units (biofacies or biotopes), In contrast, SHE analysis for biofacies identification (SHEBI) serially accumulates contiguous stations and designates biofacies as groups of contiguous stations that exhibit the properties of known statistical distributions for biological communities, SHEBI identifies biological communities and always insures mappability.
   The number of species, S, the information function, H, and the measure of evenness, E, are related by the decomposition equation H = InS + InE. Each of these quantities is calculated as N, the number of individuals, is accumulated by adding successive samples (stations). In all cases, for a multispecies population (community) these variables form linear trends on a log scale. As N accumulates with each sample, S usually increases and the decomposition equation establishes constraints on H and InE. If H remains constant, then InE must decrease precisely as InS increases. If InE remains constant, then H must increase precisely as InS increases. If H increases and InE decreases as InS increases with accumulation, then the ratio InE/lnS may remain constant. Sometimes, InS and H increase while InE and InE/lnS decrease. Departures from linear trends indicate a mixture of communities and, hence, a new biofacies.
   The total population from 35 stations ranging in depth from 20m to 2696m in traverse 6 of Parker (1954) in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico was analyzed using the SHEBI technique. Seven biofacies were recognized. These biofacies compare favorably with the six recognized by Parker. However, the SHEBI procedure recognized three biofacies at depths shallower than 100m while Parker recognized one. At depths greater than 200m SHEBI recognized two biofacies while Parker recognized three.
   SHEBI establishes boundaries by examining departures from the linear trends expected for the statistical distribution describing a multispecies population or community. Thus, SHEBI provides us not only with a means of designating biofacies, but also with a quantitative definition of a community.

AB Diatom-salinity transfer functions for interpretation of palaeosalinity and palaeoclimate change have been developed successfully for parts of North America and North and East Africa, but there is a need for data-sets in other saline lake regions of the world. A data-set of 74 modem diatom samples and associated water chemistry data is described from Spain. The influence of conductivity and other environmental variables on diatom distribution is explored using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and partial CCAs. A transfer function is derived for conductivity (70 samples) whose apparent predictive ability is high (apparent r(2) = 0.91). Performance under jackknifing is poor due to the heterogeneous nature of the data-set and poor coverage of the freshwater end of the salinity gradient. There is a lack of suitable low-salinity sites in Spain, and the accuracy of estimated salinity optima and tolerance ranges may be improved by merging this data-set with those of other regions. The Spanish transfer function has strong affinities with the African data-set and contributes important ecological data for diatom taxa which are absent or poorly represented in the modern flora of African lakes, and for which, in fossil material, there were previously no good modern analogues.

AB A survey of chironomid remains preserved in the surficial sediments of 86 British Columbia lakes was conducted to assess the feasibility of reconstructing palaeosalinities from assemblages of fossil chironomid head capsules. Many taxa common in freshwater lakes were either rare or absent at higher salinities. Lakes having salinities greater than about 10.0 g . L(-1) were distinguished by the overwhelming relative abundance of Cricotopus/Orthocladius. In less saline waters, common taxa included Chironomus, Procladius, Psectrocladius, and the subtribe Tanytarsina. Heterotrissocladius, Lauterborniella/Zavreliella, Pagastiella, and Sergentia were: only collected in freshwater habitats. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that three environmental variables (late summer lakewater salinity and concentrations of Sr and total P) explained significant variation in the weighted averages of taxa. Tanytarsina and Dicrotendipes were common at low Sr concentrations in carbonate lakes. A weighted-averaging calibration function was developed to infer salinity on the basis of fossil fauna. This model will allow palaeolimnologists to detect transitions between freshwater and moderately saline states and can be used to assist palaeoclimatic reconstructions for athalassic lake sites.

AB Actinomycetes, bacteria and fungi were isolated from the rhizosphere of healthy tomato plants grown in soil samples from three organic and three conventional farms. Total numbers of actinomycetes and fluorescent pseudomonads, proportions of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic actinomycetes, starch hydrolysing bacteria, and chitinolytic fungi, and the diversity of actinomycetes (Shannon-Weaver index) were higher in organically than conventionally managed rhizosphere soil. However, starch hydrolysing actinomycetes and fungi were more numerous in soil from conventional than from organic farms. Functional groups of actinomycetes and bacteria but not of fungi were more similar among samples with the same soil management than between different soil management types. There were significant positive correlations of total numbers of actinomycetes and fluorescent pseudomonads, proportions of cellulolytic actinomycetes and chitinolytic fungi, and actinomycete diversity with suppression of corky root of tomato. Thus, the greatest differences between organically and conventionally managed soils were encountered in actinomycete populations.

AB Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to explore the relationship between measured environmental variables and surficial diatom (Bacillariophyceae) assemblages in alkaline lakes from southeastern Ontario. Total nitrogen (TN), watershed area, alkalinity, and maximum depth each explain significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) directions of variance in the distribution of diatom taxa.
   TN was highly correlated to total phosphorus (TP) (r = 0.92), chlorophyll a (r = 0.86), and Secchi depth (r = 0.77). Where a series of CCAs were run with the first axis constrained to each of these variables in turn, the ratio of the eigenvalue of the first axis to that of the second axis (lambda(1)/lambda(2)) was highest for TN, indicating that TN best explained the distribution of the diatom assemblages in this set of lakes. Furthermore, results of Monte Carlo permutation tests indicated that these four variables did not act independently on the diatom assemblages. Therefore, TN was selected to represent these four closely related variables to infer lake trophic status.
   Weighted-averaging regression and calibration (with classical deshrinking) were used to develop transfer functions to infer TN from the relative abundances of 83 diatom taxa recovered from the surficial sediments of 51 lakes. There was a good correlation between diatom-inferred TN concentrations and measured TN concentrations (r(2) = 0.75, n = 51).
   The weighted-averaging regression and calibration model was used to infer lake trophic status (represented by TN) from diatom assemblages preserved in the sediments from Little Round Lake, Ontario. These data were used in conjunction with historical land-use data in order to quantify the sequence and extent of nutrient enrichment related to human activity in the watershed area.

AB Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) can be used to define composite environmental variables that correspond as closely as possible to the major patterns of species occurrence. CCA is illustrated by a joint analysis of the distributions of twenty bird and twenty plant species in 10 km squares of the British National Grid. In separate analyses, species distributions were related first to purely spatial variables (easting and northing) and then to twenty topographic, climatic and geological variables that exclude spatial position. A strong major axis of variation from northwest to southeast was displayed by both analyses. In the non-spatial analysis, the two next most significant variables correspond to the dichotomy between coastal and non-coastal squares and to a trend from southwest to northeast. Distributions of individual species were predicted by logit regression on the four major canonical axes. Predictions were good for species such as Dipper (Cinclus cinclus), which has a classic upland distribution, but were poor for those with strong local habitat preferences, exemplified by Common Rockrose (Helianthemum nummularium). The possible adaptation of this method (CCA followed by logit regression) to predict species distributions in changed climates is considered.

AB The comparative method as recently developed can be used to identify statistically independent instances of life-history evolution. When life-history traits show evidence for correlated evolutionary change with each other or with ecological differences, it is often possible to single out the trade-offs and selective forces responsible for the evolution of life-history diversity. Suites of life-history characters often evolve in concert, and recent optimality models incorporating few variables show promise for interpreting that evolution in terms of few selective forces. Because hosts provide well-defined environments for their parasites, when host-parasite phylogenies are congruent it is possible to test ideas about the evolution of particular life-history and size-related traits.

AB Background: Freshwater salinization may result in significant changes of microbial community composition and diversity, with implications for ecosystem processes and function. Earlier research has revealed the importance of large shifts in salinity on microbial physiology and ecology, whereas studies on the effects of smaller or narrower shifts in salinity on the microeukaryotic community in inland waters are scarce. Our aim was to unveil community assembly mechanisms and the stability of microeukaryotic plankton networks at low shifts in salinity.
   Results: Here, we analyzed a high-resolution time series of plankton data from an urban reservoir in subtropical China over 13 consecutive months following one periodic salinity change ranging from 0 to 6.1 parts per thousand. We found that (1) salinity increase altered the community composition and led to a significant decrease of plankton diversity, (2) salinity change influenced microeukaryotic plankton community assembly primarily by regulating the deterministic-stochastic balance, with deterministic processes becoming more important with increased salinity, and (3) core plankton subnetwork robustness was higher at low-salinity levels, while the satellite subnetworks had greater robustness at the medium-/high-salinity levels. Our results suggest that the influence of salinity, rather than successional time, is an important driving force for shaping microeukaryotic plankton community dynamics.
   Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that at low salinities, even small increases in salinity are sufficient to exert a selective pressure to reduce the microeukaryotic plankton diversity and alter community assembly mechanism and network stability. Our results provide new insights into plankton ecology of inland urban waters and the impacts of salinity change in the assembly of microbiotas and network architecture.

AB We propose a practical concept that distinguishes the particular kind of weaponry that has evolved to be used in combat between individuals of the same species and sex, which we term intrasexually selected weapons (ISWs). We present a treatise of ISWs in nature, aiming to understand their distinction and evolution from other secondary sex traits, including from 'sexually selected weapons', and from sexually dimorphic and monomorphic weaponry. We focus on the subset of secondary sex traits that are the result of same-sex combat, defined here as ISWs, provide not previously reported evolutionary patterns, and offer hypotheses to answer questions such as: why have only some species evolved weapons to fight for the opposite sex or breeding resources? We examined traits that seem to have evolved as ISWs in the entire animal phylogeny, restricting the classification of ISW to traits that are only present or enlarged in adults of one of the sexes, and are used as weapons during intrasexual fights. Because of the absence of behavioural data and, in many cases, lack of sexually discriminated series from juveniles to adults, we exclude the fossil record from this review. We merge morphological, ontogenetic, and behavioural information, and for the first time thoroughly review the tree of life to identify separate evolution of ISWs. We found that ISWs are only found in bilateral animals, appearing independently in nematodes, various groups of arthropods, and vertebrates. Our review sets a reference point to explore other taxa that we identify with potential ISWs for which behavioural or morphological studies are warranted. We establish that most ISWs come in pairs, are located in or near the head, are endo- or exoskeletal modifications, are overdeveloped structures compared with those found in females, are modified feeding structures and/or locomotor appendages, are most common in terrestrial taxa, are frequently used to guard females, territories, or both, and are also used in signalling displays to deter rivals and/or attract females. We also found that most taxa lack ISWs, that females of only a few species possess better-developed weapons than males, that the cases of independent evolution of ISWs are not evenly distributed across the phylogeny, and that animals possessing the most developed ISWs have non-hunting habits (e.g. herbivores) or are faunivores that prey on very small prey relative to their body size (e.g. insectivores). Bringing together perspectives from studies on a variety of taxa, we conceptualize that there are five ways in which a sexually dimorphic trait, apart from the primary sex traits, can be fixed: sexual selection, fecundity selection, parental role division, differential niche occupation between the sexes, and interference competition. We discuss these trends and the factors involved in the evolution of intrasexually selected weaponry in nature.

AB Farmers in Africa have long adapted to climatic and other risks by diversifying their farming activities. Using a multi-scale approach, we explore the relationship between farming diversity and food security and the diversification potential of African agriculture and its limits on the household and continental scale. On the household scale, we use agricultural surveys from more than 28,000 households located in 18 African countries. In a next step, we use the relationship between rainfall, rainfall variability, and farming diversity to determine the available diversification options for farmers on the continental scale. On the household scale, we show that households with greater farming diversity are more successful in meeting their consumption needs, but only up to a certain level of diversity per ha cropland and more often if food can be purchased from off-farm income or income from farm sales. More diverse farming systems can contribute to household food security; however, the relationship is influenced by other factors, for example, the market orientation of a household, livestock ownership, nonagricultural employment opportunities, and available land resources. On the continental scale, the greatest opportunities for diversification of food crops, cash crops, and livestock are located in areas with 500-1,000 mm annual rainfall and 17%-22% rainfall variability. Forty-three percent of the African cropland lacks these opportunities at present which may hamper the ability of agricultural systems to respond to climate change. While sustainable intensification practices that increase yields have received most attention to date, our study suggests that a shift in the research and policy paradigm toward agricultural diversification options may be necessary.

AB The release of toxic organic pollutants and heavy metals by primitive electronic waste (e-waste) processing to waterways has raised significant concerns, but little is known about their potential ecological effects on aquatic biota especially microorganisms. We characterized the microbial community composition and diversity in sediments sampled along two rivers consistently polluted by e-waste, and explored how community functions may respond to the complex combined pollution. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that Proteobacteria (particularly Deltaproteobacteria) dominated the sediment microbial assemblages followed by Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Chloraflexi and Firmicutes. PICRUSt metagenome inference provided an initial insight into the metabolic potentials of these e-waste affected communities, speculating that organic pollutants degradation in the sediment might be mainly performed by some of the dominant genera (such as Sulfuricurvum, Thiobacillus and Burkholderia) detected in situ. Statistical analyses revealed that toxic organic compounds contributed more to the observed variations in sediment microbial community structure and predicted functions (24.68% and 8.89%, respectively) than heavy metals (12.18% and 4.68%), and Benzo(a)pyrene, bioavailable lead and electrical conductivity were the key contributors. These results have shed light on the microbial assemblages in e-waste contaminated river sediments, indicating a potential influence of e-waste pollution on the microbial community structure and function in aquatic ecosystems.

AB Contaminated soils pose a risk to human and ecological health, and thermal remediation is an efficient and reliable way to reduce soil contaminant concentration in a range of situations. A primary benefit of thermal treatment is the speed at which remediation can occur, allowing the return of treated soils to a desired land use as quickly as possible. However, this treatment also alters many soil properties that affect the capacity of the soil to function. While extensive research addresses contaminant reduction, the range and magnitude of effects to soil properties have not been explored. Understanding the effects of thermal remediation on soil properties is vital to successful reclamation, as drastic effects may preclude certain post-treatment land uses. This review highlights thermal remediation studies that have quantified alterations to soil properties, and it supplements that information with laboratory heating studies to further elucidate the effects of thermal treatment of soil. Notably, both heating temperature and heating time affect i) soil organic matter; ii) soil texture and mineralogy; iii) soil pH; iv) plant available nutrients and heavy metals; v) soil biological communities; and iv) the ability of the soil to sustain vegetation. Broadly, increasing either temperature or time results in greater contaminant reduction efficiency, but it also causes more severe impacts to soil characteristics. Thus, project managers must balance the need for contaminant reduction with the deterioration of soil function for each specific remediation project. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bacteria are one of the most abundant and diverse groups of micro-organisms and mediate many critical terrestrial ecosystem processes. Despite the crucial ecological role of bacteria, our understanding of their large-scale biogeography patterns across forests, and the processes that determine these patterns lags significantly behind that of macroorganisms. Here, we evaluated the geographic distributions of bacterial diversity and their driving factors across nine latitudinal forests along a 3,700-km north-south transect in eastern China, using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Four of 32 phyla detected were dominant: Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Chloroflexi (relative abundance>5%). Significant increases in bacterial richness and phylogenetic diversity were observed for temperate forests compared with subtropical or tropical forests. The soil organic matter (SOM) mineralisation rate (SOMmin, an index of SOM availability) explained the largest significant variations in bacterial richness. Variation partition analysis revealed that the bacterial community structure was closely correlated with environmental variables and geographic distance, which together explained 80.5% of community variation. Among all environmental factors, climatic features (MAT and MAP) were the best predictors of the bacterial community structure, whereas soil pH and SOMmin emerged as the most important edaphic drivers of the bacterial community structure. Plant functional traits (community weighted means of litter N content) and diversity resulted in weak but significant correlations with the bacterial community structure. Our findings provide new evidence of bacterial biogeography patterns from tropical to cold temperate forests. Additionally, the results indicated a close linkage among soil bacterial diversity, climate and SOM decomposition, which is critical for predicting continental-scale responses under future climate change scenarios and promoting sustainable forest ecosystem services.

AB Understanding how species diversity is maintained is a foundational problem in ecology and an essential requirement for the discipline to be effective as an applied science. Ecologists' understanding of this problem has rapidly matured, but this has exposed profound uncertainty about the spatial scales required to maintain species diversity. Here we define and develop this frontier by proposing the coexistence-area relationship-a real relationship in nature that can be used to understand the determinants of the scale-dependence of diversity maintenance. The coexistence-area relationship motivates new empirical techniques for addressing important, unresolved problems about the influence of demographic stochasticity, environmental heterogeneity and dispersal on scale-dependent patterns of diversity. In so doing, this framework substantially reframes current approaches to spatial community ecology. Quantifying the spatial scales of species coexistence will permit the next important advance in our understanding of the maintenance of diversity in nature, and should improve the contribution of community ecology to biodiversity conservation.

AB Parallel divergence across replicated species pairs occurring in similar environmental contrasts may arise through distinct evolutionary scenarios. Deciphering whether such parallelism actually reflects repeated parallel divergence driven by divergent selection or a single divergence event with subsequent gene flow needs to be ascertained. Reconstructing historical gene flow is therefore of fundamental interest to understand how demography and selection jointly shaped genomic divergence during speciation. Here, we use an extended modeling framework to explore the multiple facets of speciation-with-gene-flow with demo-genetic divergence models that capture both temporal and genomic variation in effective population size and migration rate. We investigate the divergence history of replicate sympatric species pairs of Lake Whitefish (normal benthic and dwarf limnetic) characterized by variable degrees of ecological divergence and reproductive isolation. Genome-wide SNPs were used to document the extent of genetic differentiation in each species pair, and 26 divergence models were fitted and compared with the unfolded joint allele frequency spectrum of each pair. We found evidence that a recent (circa 3,000-4,000 generations) asymmetrical secondary contact between expanding postglacial populations has accompanied Whitefish diversification. Our results suggest that heterogeneous genomic differentiation has emerged through the combined effects of linked selection generating variable rates of lineage sorting across the genome during geographical isolation, and heterogeneous introgression eroding divergence at different rates across the genome upon secondary contact. This study thus provides a new retrospective insight into the historical demographic and selective processes that shaped a continuum of divergence associated with ecological speciation.

AB Adaptive radiation is thought to be responsible for the evolution of a great portion of the past and present diversity of life. Instances of adaptive radiation, characterized by the rapid emergence of an array of species as a consequence to their adaptation to distinct ecological niches, are important study systems in evolutionary biology. However, because of the rapid lineage formation in these groups, and occasional gene flow between the participating species, it is often difficult to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of species that underwent an adaptive radiation. In this study, we present a novel approach for speciesc-tree estimation in rapidly diversifying lineages, where introgression is known to occur, and apply it to a multimarker data set containing up to 16 specimens per species for a set of 45 species of East African cichlid fishes (522 individuals in total), with a main focus on the cichlid species flock of Lake Tanganyika. We first identified, using age distributions of most recent common ancestors in individual gene trees, those lineages in our data set that show strong signatures of past introgression. This led us to formulate three hypotheses of introgression between different lineages of Tanganyika cichlids: the ancestor of Boulengerochromini (or of Boulengerochromini and Bathybatini) received genomic material from the derived Hc-lineage; the common ancestor of Cyprichromini and Perissodini experienced, in turn, introgression from Boulengerochromini and/or Bathybatini; and the Lake Tanganyika Haplochromini and closely related riverine lineages received genetic material from Cyphotilapiini. We then applied the multispecies coalescent model to estimate the species tree of Lake Tanganyika cichlids, but excluded the lineages involved in these introgression events, as the multispecies coalescent model does not incorporate introgression. This resulted in a robust species tree, in which the Lamprologini were placed as sister lineage to the Hc-lineage (including the Eretmodini), and we identify a series of rapid splitting events at the base of the Hc-lineage. Divergence ages estimated with the multispecies coalescent model were substantially younger than age estimates based on concatenation, and agree with the geological history of the Great Lakes of East Africa. Finally, we formally tested the three hypotheses of introgression using a likelihood framework, and find strong support for introgression between some of the cichlid tribes of Lake Tanganyika.

AB Using surveys of experts associated with 186 sites across 24 countries, we assessed the effectiveness of African protected areas (PM) at conserving lions and their prey, identified factors that influence conservation effectiveness, and identified patterns in the severity of various threats. Less than one third of sampled PM conserve lions at >= 50% of their estimated carrying capacity (K), and less than half conserve lion prey species at 50% of K. Given adequate management, PAs could theoretically support up to 4x the total extant population of wild African lions (similar to 83,000), providing a measurable benchmark for future conservation efforts. The performance of PAs shows marked geographic variation, and in several countries there is a need for a significant elevation in conservation effort. Bushmeat poaching was identified as the most serious threat to both lions and to wildlife in general. The severity of threats to wildlife in PM and the performance of prey populations were best predicted by geographic-socioeconomic variables related to the size of PAs, whether people were settled within PM, human/live-stock densities in neighbouring areas and national economic indicators. However, conservation outcomes for lions were best explained by management variables. PM tended to be more effective for conserving lions and/or their prey where management budgets were higher, where photographic tourism was the primary land use, and, for prey, where fencing was present. Lions and prey fared less well relative to their estimated potential carrying capacities in poorer countries, where people were settled within PAs and where PM were used for neither photographic tourism nor trophy hunting.

AB 1. Invasive species management aims to prevent or mitigate the impacts of introduced species but management interventions can themselves generate social impacts that must be understood and addressed.
   2. Established approaches for addressing the social implications of invasive species management can be limited in effectiveness and democratic legitimacy. More deliberative, participatory approaches are emerging that allow integration of a broader range of socio-political considerations. Nevertheless, there is a need to ensure that these are rigorous applications of social science.
   3. Social impact assessment offers a structured process of identifying, evaluating and addressing social costs and benefits. We highlight its potential value for enabling meaningful public participation in planning and as a key component of integrated assessments of management options.
   4. Policy implications. As invasive species management grows in scope and scale, social impact assessment provides a rigorous process for recognising and responding to social concerns. It could therefore produce more democratic, less conflict-prone and more effective interventions.

AB The fate of peripheral forest tree populations is of particular interest in the context of climate change. These populations may concurrently be those where the most significant evolutionary changes will occur; those most facing increasing extinction risk; the source of migrants for the colonization of new areas at leading edges; or the source of genetic novelty for reinforcing standing genetic variation in various parts of the range. Deciding which strategy to implement for conserving and sustainably using the genetic resources of peripheral forest tree populations is a challenge.
   Here, we review the genetic and ecological processes acting on different types of peripheral populations and indicate why these processes may be of general interest for adapting forests and forest management to climate change. We particularly focus on peripheral populations at the rear edge of species distributions where environmental challenges are or will become most acute. We argue that peripheral forest tree populations are "natural laboratories" for resolving priority research questions such as how the complex interaction between demographic processes and natural selection shape local adaptation; and whether genetic adaptation will be sufficient to allow the long-term persistence of species within their current distribution.
   Peripheral populations are key assets for adaptive forestry which need specific measures for their preservation. The traditionally opposing views which may exist between conservation planning and sustainable forestry need to be reconciled and harmonized for managing peripheral populations. Based on existing knowledge, we suggest approaches and principles which may be used for the management and conservation of these distinctive and valuable populations, to maintain active genetic and ecological processes that have sustained them over time.

AB A field experiment was carried out to implement a remote sensing energy balance (RSEB) algorithm for estimating the incoming solar radiation (Rsi), net radiation (Rn), sensible heat flux (H), soil heat flux (G) and latent heat flux (LE) over a drip-irrigated olive (cv. Arbequina) orchard located in the Pencahue Valley, Maule Region, Chile (35 degrees 25'S; 71 degrees 44'W; 90 m above sea level). For this study, a helicopter-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was equipped with multispectral and infrared thermal cameras to obtain simultaneously the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface temperature (T-surface) at very high resolution (6 cm x 6 cm). Meteorological variables and surface energy balance components were measured at the time of the UAV overpass (near solar noon). The performance of the RSEB algorithm was evaluated using measurements of H and LE obtained from an eddy correlation system. In addition, estimated values of Rsi and Rn were compared with ground-truth measurements from a four-way net radiometer while those of G were compared with soil heat flux based on flux plates. Results indicated that RSEB algorithm estimated LE and H with errors of 7% and 5%, respectively. Values of the root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) for LE were 50 and 43 W m(-2) while those for H were 56 and 46 W m(-2), respectively. Finally, the RSEB algorithm computed Rsi, Rn and G with error less than 5% and with values of RMSE and MAE less than 38 W m(-2). Results demonstrated that multispectral and thermal cameras placed on an UAV could provide an excellent tool to evaluate the intra-orchard spatial variability of Rn, G, H, LE, NDVI and Tsurface over the tree canopy and soil surface between rows.

AB The evolutionary origin of innovativeness remains puzzling because innovating means responding to novel or unusual problems and hence is unlikely to be selected by itself. A plausible alternative is considering innovativeness as a co-opted product of traits that have evolved for other functions yet together predispose individuals to solve problems by adopting novel behaviours. However, this raises the question of why these adaptations should evolve together in an animal. Here, we develop the argument that the adaptations enabling animals to innovate evolve together because they are jointly part of a life-history, strategy for coping with environmental changes. In support of this claim, we present comparative evidence showing that in birds, (i) innovative propensity is linked to life histories that prioritize future over current reproduction, (ii) the link is in part explained by differences in brain size, and (iii) innovative propensity and life-history traits may evolve together in generalist species that frequently expose themselves to novel or unusual conditions. Combined with previous evidence, these findings suggest that innovativeness is not a specialized adaptation but more likely part of a broader general adaptive system to cope with changes in the environment.

AB Biochar is the name given to charcoal produced from pyrolyzed biomass with the purpose to add into soils to enhance soil properties and sequestrate carbon. Biochar has been a very popular research topic and a large amount of scientific literature has been produced in the last decade. Papers show biochar production from almost any type of biomass available using diverse types of thermochemical processes which have variations in technology, design, and conditions. All this variability in biomass feedstock and production has made biochar a very heterogeneous product, making it difficult to understand the biochar characteristics and qualities and what are the benefits and risks of its application in soils. This review presents a comprehensive vision of biochar properties, and their impact when biochar is applied to soils. To better understand this impact, biochar-collected data were classified in six types according to the main biomass used in its production, and divided into two thermochemical treatments: convectional pyrolysis methods and Hydrothermal Carbonization (HTC). Four biochar properties were studied: (i) physical and structural characteristics, (ii) chemical properties, (iii) agronomical properties, and (iv) contaminants. Outcomes of this review suggest that biochar can be a good soil amendment with capacity to enhance physical, chemical, and agronomic soil qualities. Nevertheless, results show the current lack of appropriate methodological analytical determination of some of the biochar characteristics. This can mislead to erroneous biochar characterization which could lead to future environmental issues. The review of the data suggested that some types of biomass could be not suitable for biochar soil application due to high levels of contaminants, although the information about solubility and availability of these contaminants in many cases is not clear. A consistent methodology, protocol, or index to measure biochar carbon stability in soils was not found; data suggest that a small proportion of biochars would not be suitable for carbon sequestration in soils but they could have good agronomical propertiesthis finding suggested that biochar production can be customized based on its final use. However, before proceeding to recommend massive use of biochar in soil, more research is necessary to have enough knowledge and understanding of biochar properties to develop models to predict biochar transport, fate, and impact.

AB This study examined sex-specific differences in home range size of adult Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins off Bunbury, Western Australia. We applied a new kernel density estimation approach that accounted for physical barriers to movements. A Bayesian mixture model was developed to estimate a sex effect in home range size with latent group partitioning constrained by association data. A post hoc analysis investigated group partitioning relating to the proportion of time spent in open vs. sheltered waters. From 2007 to 2013, photographic-identification data were collected along boat-based systematic transect lines (n = 586). Analyses focused on adult dolphins of known sex (sighted >= 30 times; n = 22 males and 34 females). The 95% utilization distributions of males varied between 27 and 187 km(2) ((x) over bar +/- SD; 94.8 +/- 48.15) and for females between 20 and 133 km(2) (65.6 +/- 30.9). The mixture model indicated a 99% probability that males had larger home ranges than females. Dolphins mostly sighted in open waters had larger home ranges than those in sheltered waters. Home ranges of dolphins sighted in sheltered waters overlapped with areas of highest human activity. We suggest that sex differences in home ranges are driven by male mating strategies, and home range size differences between habitats may be influenced by prey availability and predation risk.

AB The amplitude of the N400an event-related potential (ERP) component linked to meaning processing and initial access to semantic memoryis inversely related to the incremental buildup of semantic context over the course of a sentence. We revisited the nature and scope of this incremental context effect, adopting a word-level linear mixed-effects modeling approach, with the goal of probing the continuous and incremental effects of semantic and syntactic context on multiple aspects of lexical processing during sentence comprehension (i.e., effects of word frequency and orthographic neighborhood). First, we replicated the classic word-position effect at the single-word level: Open-class words showed reductions in N400 amplitude with increasing word position in semantically congruent sentences only. Importantly, we found that accruing sentence context had separable influences on the effects of frequency and neighborhood on the N400. Word frequency effects were reduced with accumulating semantic context. However, orthographic neighborhood was unaffected by accumulating context, showing robust effects on the N400 across all words, even within congruent sentences. Additionally, we found that N400 amplitudes to closed-class words were reduced with incrementally constraining syntactic context in sentences that provided only syntactic constraints. Taken together, our findings indicate that modeling word-level variability in ERPs reveals mechanisms by which different sources of information simultaneously contribute to the unfolding neural dynamics of comprehension.

AB The random encounter model (REM) is a novel method for estimating animal density from camera trap data without the need for individual recognition. It has never been used to estimate the density of large carnivore species, despite these being the focus of most camera trap studies worldwide. In this context, we applied the REM to estimate the density of female lions (Panthera leo) from camera traps implemented in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, comparing estimates to reference values derived from pride census data. More specifically, we attempted to account for bias resulting from non-random camera placement at lion resting sites under isolated trees by comparing estimates derived from night versus day photographs, between dry and wet seasons, and between habitats that differ in their amount of tree cover. Overall, we recorded 169 and 163 independent photographic events of female lions from 7,608 and 12,137 camera trap days carried out in the dry season of 2010 and the wet season of 2011, respectively. Although all REM models considered over-estimated female lion density, models that considered only night-time events resulted in estimates that were much less biased relative to those based on all photographic events. We conclude that restricting REM estimation to periods and habitats in which animal movement is more likely to be random with respect to cameras can help reduce bias in estimates of density for female Serengeti lions. We highlight that accurate REM estimates will nonetheless be dependent on reliable measures of average speed of animal movement and camera detection zone dimensions. (c) 2015 The Wildlife Society.

AB The bright colors of birds are often attributed to sexual selection on males, but in many species both sexes are colorful and it has been long debated whether sexual selection can also explain this variation. We show that most evolutionary transitions in color have been toward similar plumage in both sexes, and the color of both sexes (for example, bright or dull) was associated with indices of natural selection (for example, habitat type), whereas sexual differences in color were primarily associated with indices of sexual selection on males (for example, polygyny and large testes size). Debate about the evolution of bird coloration can be resolved by recognizing that both natural and sexual selection have been influential, but they have generally acted on two different axes: sexual selection on an axis of sexual differences and natural selection on both sexes for the type of color (for example, bright or dull).

AB Shifts in species' ranges are one of the most frequently reported and globally ubiquitous impacts of climate change, with rates of movement being particularly high in the sea. The arrival of multiple range extending species can cause serious issues for natural resource managers; some species threaten ecosystem function while others present social and/or economic opportunities. An early indication of which species are potentially extending their ranges can provide useful guidance for managers regarding future investments in impact assessment, monitoring or potential management intervention. Given that scientific monitoring data on potential range shifting species are often sparse in the marine environment a rapid assessment that utilises and assimilates disparate data sources that vary in quality, quantity and collection methods is needed. Off the east coast of Tasmania surface waters have been warming at almost four times the global average and dozens of species range shifts have already been documented. Building on existing methods used in the early detection of invasive species, we developed a cost-effective and rapid screening assessment tool that uses monitoring data from a variety of sources, particularly from the citizen science program Redmap, to classify levels of confidence in potential range extensions over a three year time period (2009-2012) for a variety of marine species. From our assessment of 47 species, eight were classified with "high" confidence as potentially extending their ranges. The "high" confidence classification of these species suggests they should be a priority when investigating potential ecosystem and socio-economic impacts. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB The flow regime of a river is fundamental in determining its ecological characteristics. Impoundment of rivers has been documented to severely impact the natural flow regime, resulting in abiotic and biotic changes in downstream ecosystems. Contemporary water legislation is driving increasing concern among environmentalists and water resource managers with respect to how these impacts can be mitigated. This has stimulated research aimed at assessing the relationship between reservoir outflow modification (i.e. managed environmental flows) and downstream ecosystem responses. We carried out a critical review and synthesis of the global literature concerning post-impoundment reservoir outflow modification and associated downstream biotic and abiotic responses. Seventy-six studies published between 1981 and 2012 were analysed. In contrast to previous studies of this subject, we systematically assessed the methodological quality of research to identify strengths and weaknesses of the approaches. We also undertook a novel quantification of ecosystem responses to flow modification, thus enabling identification of priorities for future research. We identified that: (i) there was a research bias towards North American and Western European studies; (ii) the majority of studies reported changes in flow magnitude (e.g. artificial floods) and primarily focused on traditionally monitored ecological groups (e.g. fish); (iii) relationships between flow, biota (e.g. macroinvertebrates) and water quality (e.g. electrical conductivity and suspended solids concentration) were evident, demonstrating the potential for managed environmental flows to manipulate river ecosystems; (iv) site-specific factors (e.g. location, climate) are likely to be important as some ecosystem responses were inconsistent between studies (e.g. fish movement in response to increases in flow magnitude); and (v) quality of study design, methodological and analytical techniques varied, and these factors may have contributed to the reported variability of ecosystem response. To advance scientific understanding and guide future management of regulated flow regimes, we highlight a pressing need for: (i) diversification of study locations as well as flow modification and ecosystem response types assessed; (ii) a focus on understanding flow-ecosystem response relationships at regional scales; (iii) further quantitative studies to enable robust statistical analyses in future meta-analyses; and (iv) robust monitoring of flow experiments and the use of contemporary statistical techniques to extract maximum knowledge from ecological response data.

AB Sexual segregation, common in many species, is usually attributed to intra-specific competition or habitat choice. However, few studies have simultaneously quantified sex-specific foraging behaviour and habitat use. We combined movement, diving, stable isotope and oceanographic data to test whether sexual segregation in northern gannets Morus bassanus results from sex-specific habitat use. Breeding birds foraging in a seasonally stratified shelf sea were tracked over 3 consecutive breeding seasons (2010-2012). Females made longer trips, foraged farther offshore and had lower delta C-13 values than males. Male and female foraging areas overlapped only slightly. Males foraged more in mixed coastal waters, where net primary production (NPP) was relatively high (>3 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) and sea-surface temperature (SST) was relatively low (<10 degrees C). Males also tended to use areas with higher SSTs (>15 degrees C) more than females, possibly as a consequence of foraging in productive mixed waters over offshore banks. Females foraged most frequently in stratified offshore waters, of intermediate SST (12-15 degrees C), but exhibited no consistent response to NPP. Sex-specific differences in diving behaviour corresponded with differences in habitat use: males made more long and deep U-shaped dives. Such dives were characteristic of inshore foraging, whereas shorter and shallower V-shaped dives occurred more often in offshore waters. Heavier birds attained greater depths during V-shaped dives, but even when controlling for body mass, females made deeper V-shaped dives than males. Together, these results indicate that sexual segregation in gannets is driven largely by habitat segregation between mixed and stratified waters, which in turn results in sex-specific foraging behaviour and dive depths.

AB Even with global support for tiger (Panthera tigris) conservation their survival is threatened by poaching, habitat loss and isolation. Currently about 3,000 wild tigers persist in small fragmented populations within seven percent of their historic range. Identifying and securing habitat linkages that connect source populations for maintaining landscape-level gene flow is an important long-term conservation strategy for endangered carnivores. However, habitat corridors that link regional tiger populations are often lost to development projects due to lack of objective evidence on their importance. Here, we use individual based genetic analysis in combination with landscape permeability models to identify and prioritize movement corridors across seven tiger populations within the Central Indian Landscape. By using a panel of 11 microsatellites we identified 169 individual tigers from 587 scat and 17 tissue samples. We detected four genetic clusters within Central India with limited gene flow among three of them. Bayesian and likelihood analyses identified 17 tigers as having recent immigrant ancestry. Spatially explicit tiger occupancy obtained from extensive landscape-scale surveys across 76,913 km(2) of forest habitat was found to be only 21,290 km(2). After accounting for detection bias, the covariates that best explained tiger occupancy were large, remote, dense forest patches; large ungulate abundance, and low human footprint. We used tiger occupancy probability to parameterize habitat permeability for modeling habitat linkages using least-cost and circuit theory pathway analyses. Pairwise genetic differences (F-ST) between populations were better explained by modeled linkage costs (r>0.5, p<0.05) compared to Euclidean distances, which was in consonance with observed habitat fragmentation. The results of our study highlight that many corridors may still be functional as there is evidence of contemporary migration. Conservation efforts should provide legal status to corridors, use smart green infrastructure to mitigate development impacts, and restore habitats where connectivity has been lost.

AB Natural populations of widely distributed organisms often exhibit genetic clinal variation over their geographical ranges. The European anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus, illustrates this by displaying a two-clade mitochondrial structure clinally arranged along the eastern Atlantic. One clade has low frequencies at higher latitudes, whereas the other has an anti-tropical distribution, with frequencies decreasing towards the tropics. The distribution pattern of these clades has been explained as a consequence of secondary contact after an ancient geographical isolation. However, it is not unlikely that selection acts on mitochondria whose genes are involved in relevant oxidative phosphorylation processes. In this study, we performed selection tests on a fragment of 1044 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene using 455 individuals from 18 locations. We also tested correlations of six environmental features: temperature, salinity, apparent oxygen utilization and nutrient concentrations of phosphate, nitrate and silicate, on a compilation of mitochondrial clade frequencies from 66 sampling sites comprising 2776 specimens from previously published studies. Positive selection in a single codon was detected predominantly (99%) in the anti-tropical clade and temperature was the most relevant environmental predictor, contributing with 59% of the variance in the geographical distribution of clade frequencies. These findings strongly suggest that temperature is shaping the contemporary distribution of mitochondrial DNA clade frequencies in the European anchovy.

AB Since 1995, neonicotinoid insecticides have been a critical component of arthropod management in potato, Solanum tuberosum L. Recent detections of neonicotinoids in groundwater have generated questions about the sources of these contaminants and the relative contribution from commodities in U. S. agriculture. Delivery of neonicotinoids to crops typically occurs as a seed or in-furrow treatment to manage early season insect herbivores. Applied in this way, these insecticides become systemically mobile in the plant and provide control of key pest species. An outcome of this project links these soil insecticide application strategies in crop plants with neonicotinoid contamination of water leaching from the application zone. In 2011 and 2012, our objectives were to document the temporal patterns of neonicotinoid leachate below the planting furrow following common insecticide delivery methods in potato. Leaching loss of thiamethoxam from potato was measured using pan lysimeters from three at-plant treatments and one foliar application treatment. Insecticide concentration in leachate was assessed for six consecutive months using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Findings from this study suggest leaching of neonicotinoids from potato may be greater following crop harvest in comparison to other times during the growing season. Furthermore, this study documented recycling of neonicotinoid insecticides from contaminated groundwater back onto the crop via high capacity irrigation wells. These results document interactions between cultivated potato, different neonicotinoid delivery methods, and the potential for subsurface water contamination via leaching.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) decomposes both inside and outside of cells. Cellular metabolism and extracellular depolymerization normally operate simultaneously in soil but are difficult to separate in practice. To learn more about the extracellular component of SOM decomposition, we sterilized a semiarid annual grassland soil to inhibit cellular metabolism, and then assayed cell viability, exoenzyme activities, and pathways of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. Chloroform (CHCl3) fumigation was intended to disrupt cellular activities while leaving biochemical processes intact. Gamma (gamma) irradiation and autoclaving were intended to disrupt both cellular and extracellular biochemical processes while leaving abiotic processes intact. We measured the potential activities of eight enzymes (six hydrolytic, two oxidative) and CO2 emission induced by seven substrates (glucose, three amino acids, three tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle intermediates). We found that all three sterilization techniques clearly disrupted cellular metabolism. Chloroform and irradiation decreased cultivable cell counts by 2-3 orders of magnitude, inhibited CO2 emission pathways associated with glucose and amino acids, and decreased the hydrolytic activities of alpha-glucosidase and xylosidase by 72-82%. The other hydrolytic enzymes (beta-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, NAGase, phosphatase) were less sensitive to both CHCl3 and irradiation. All hydrolytic activities that we assayed were inhibited by autoclaving, indicating that biochemical reactions and other extracellular processes drive hydrolytic SUM decomposition. Oxidative activities, on the other hand, did not stop after autoclaving or even combusting at 500 degrees C. This supports other studies which have found that mineral catalysts partly drive oxidative SOM decomposition. Unexpectedly, CO2 emission from TCA intermediates decreased by only 26-47% after sterilization suggesting that the required dehydrogenase enzymes for decarboxylation are still active when cells are dead but relatively intact. Because CHCl3 had slightly smaller effects on exoenzyme activities compared to irradiation, and because it may be continuously applied, limiting the potential for recolonization and regrowth (unlike irradiation), we suggest it is an adequate and more accessible method for separating the activity of exoenzymes from cellular metabolism under realistic soil conditions.

AB The degree of dispersion of trait values among species in a community has frequently been used to infer processes of community assembly. However, multiple assembly processes can lead to the same pattern of trait dispersion or the same process can lead to different patterns of dispersion. In particular, competitive processes can lead both to trait overdispersion (if the trait controls niche differentiation and only substantial differences allow coexistence) or to trait underdispersion (if the trait controls position in a competitive hierarchy and only similar values enhance coexistence). Because different traits are likely to contribute to stabilizing (niche differentiation) and equalizing (competitive hierarchies) mechanisms of coexistence, we compare the role of dispersion of a number of individual traits for species diversity by conducting in silico experiments using field-parameterized spatially explicit models of communities of clonally growing plants. We manipulate both dispersion and means of different traits and examine consequent changes of species diversity in the whole community. We hypothesize that growth traits, which are directly linked to resource acquisition, are likely related to position in competitive hierarchies and thus diversity and trait dispersion will be negatively associated. In contrast, we hypothesize that architectural traits, which control spatial deployment of new plants and are thus less directly linked to resource acquisition, are more likely to be linked to niche differentiation and thus diversity and trait dispersion will be positively associated. Individual traits differed considerably in effects of trait dispersion on community diversity. Specifically, increasing dispersion in growth traits often decreased diversity, presumably reflecting widening competitive differences and exclusion of weaker competitors, which is consistent with the action of equalizing mechanisms of species coexistence. In contrast, increasing dispersion in architectural traits either increased diversity or had no effect, which possibly indicates niche-based mechanisms of diversity maintenance. Changes of community-wide trait means can have large effects on diversity for a given degree of dispersion, although not usually changing the sign of the relationship.Synthesis. These results suggest inference of community assembly processes from patterns of trait dispersion without understanding how particular traits function in community assembly may often be misleading. Effects of dispersion of traits that are likely associated with position in a competitive hierarchy are very different from those of traits associated with niche differences.

TI Identifying Biologically Meaningful Hot-Weather Events Using Threshold
   Temperatures That Affect Life-History
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; MORTALITY; EXTREMES; FITNESS; RANGE; BIRDS
AB Increases in the frequency, duration and intensity of heat waves are frequently evoked in climate change predictions. However, there is no universal definition of a heat wave. Recent, intense hot weather events have caused mass mortalities of birds, bats and even humans, making the definition and prediction of heat wave events that have the potential to impact populations of different species an urgent priority. One possible technique for defining biologically meaningful heat waves is to use threshold temperatures (T-thresh) above which known fitness costs are incurred by species of interest. We set out to test the utility of this technique using T-thresh values that, when exceeded, affect aspects of the fitness of two focal southern African bird species: the southern pied babbler Turdiodes bicolor (T-thresh = 35.5 degrees C) and the common fiscal Lanius collaris (T-thresh = 33 degrees C). We used these T-thresh values to analyse trends in the frequency, duration and intensity of heat waves of magnitude relevant to the focal species, as well as the annual number of hot days (maximum air temperature > T-thresh), in north-western South Africa between 1961 and 2010. Using this technique, we were able to show that, while all heat wave indices increased during the study period, most rapid increases for both species were in the annual number of hot days and in the maximum intensity (and therefore intensity variance) of biologically meaningful heat waves. Importantly, we also showed that warming trends were not uniform across the study area and that geographical patterns in warming allowed both areas of high risk and potential climate refugia to be identified. We discuss the implications of the trends we found for our focal species, and the utility of the T-thresh technique as a conservation tool.

AB Rapid temperature and precipitation changes in High Arctic tundra ecosystems are altering the biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), but in ways that are difficult to predict. The challenge grows from the uncertainty of N cycle responses and the extent to which shifts in soil N are coupled with the C cycle and productivity of tundra systems. We used a long-term (since 2003) experiment of summer warming and supplemental summer water additions to a High Arctic ecosystem in NW Greenland, and applied a combination of discrete sampling and in situ soil core incubations to measure C and N pools and seasonal microbial processes that might control plant-available N. We hypothesized that elevated temperature and increased precipitation would stimulate microbial activity and net inorganic N mineralization, thereby increasing plant N-availability through the growing season. While we did find increased N mineralization rates under both global change scenarios, water addition also significantly increased net nitrification rates, loss of NO3--N via leaching, and lowered rates of labile organic N production. We also expected the chronic warming and watering would lead to long-term changes in soil N-cycling that would be reflected in soil N-15 values. We found that soil N-15 decreased under the different climate change scenarios. Our results suggest that temperature accelerates biological processes and existing C and N transformations, but moisture increases soil hydraulic connectivity and so alters the pathways, and changes the fate of the products of C and N transformations. In addition, our findings indicate that warmer, wetter High Arctic tundra will be cycling N and C in ways that may transform these landscapes in part leading to greater C sequestration, but simultaneously, N losses from the upper soil profile that may be transported to depth dissolved in water and or transported off site in lateral flow.

AB Stored non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) have been proposed as a key determinant of drought resistance in plants. However, the evidence for this role is controversial, as it comes mostly from observational, short-term studies. Here, we take advantage of a long-term experimental throughfall reduction to elucidate the response of NSC to increased drought 14 years after the beginning of the treatment in three Mediterranean resprouter trees (Quercus ilex L., Arbutus unedo L. and Phillyrea latifolia L.). In addition, we selected 20 Q. ilex individuals outside the experimental plots to directly assess the relationship between defoliation and NSC at the individual level. We measured the seasonal course of NSC concentrations in leaves, branches and lignotuber in late winter, late spring, summer, and autumn 2012. Total concentrations of NSC were highest in the lignotuber for all species. In the long-term drought experiment we found significant depletion in concentrations of total NSC in treatment plots only in the lignotuber of A. unedo. At the same time, A. unedo was the only species showing a significant reduction in BAI under the drought treatment during the 14 years of the experiment. By contrast, Q. ilex just reduced stem growth only during the first 4 years of treatment and P latifolia remained unaffected over the whole study period. However, we found a clear association between the concentrations of NSC and defoliation in Q. ilex individuals sampled outside the experimental plots, with lower total concentrations of NSC and lower proportion of starch in defoliated individuals. Taken together, our results suggest that stabilizing processes, probably at the stand level, may have been operating in the long-term to mitigate any impact of drought on NSC levels, and highlight the necessity to incorporate long-term experimental studies of plant responses to drought.

AB Taxonomic sufficiency (TS) has been proposed for assessing community composition and environmental impacts as a way to balance the need to indicate the biology of the organisms present with time and effort needed for species identification. TS has been applied most often to marine and freshwater macroinvertebrates, but tests of its usefulness are lacking for other freshwater groups. We analyzed the effects of taxonomic resolution, functional groupings, and data transformation on multivariate community patterns in periphyton, macrophytes, macroinvertebrates, and fishes, and on the quantification of biodiversity and environmental gradients. The applicability of TS differed strongly among taxonomic groups, depending on the average taxonomic breadth of the species sets. Numerical data resolution had more pronounced effects on community patterns than taxonomic resolution. Richness was strongly affected by data aggregation, but diversity indices were statistically reliable up to order level. Taxonomic aggregation had no significant influence on ability to detect environmental gradients. Functional surrogates based on biological traits, such as feeding type, reproductive strategy, and trophic state, were strongly correlated (r = 0.64-0.85) with taxonomic community composition. However, environmental correlations were generally lower with data aggregated to functional traits rather than to species. TS was universally applicable within taxonomic groups for different habitats in one biogeographic region. Aggregation to family or order was suitable for quantifying biodiversity and environmental gradients, but multivariate community analyses required finer resolution in fishes and macrophytes than in periphyton and macroinvertebrates. Sampling effort in environmental-impact studies and monitoring programs would be better invested in quantitative data and number of spatial and temporal replicates than in taxonomic detail.

AB Understanding controls over the distribution of soil bacteria is a fundamental step toward describing soil ecosystems, understanding their functional capabilities, and predicting their responses to environmental change. This study investigated the controls on the biomass, species richness, and community structure and composition of soil bacterial communities in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, at local and regional scales. The goals of the study were to describe the relationships between abiotic characteristics and soil bacteria in this unique, microbially dominated environment, and to test the scale dependence of these relationships in a low complexity ecosystem. Samples were collected from dry mineral soils associated with snow patches, which are a significant source of water in this desert environment, at six sites located in the major basins of the Taylor and Wright Valleys. Samples were analyzed for a suite of characteristics including soil moisture, pH, electrical conductivity, soil organic matter, major nutrients and ions, microbial biomass, 16 S rRNA gene richness, and bacterial community structure and composition. Snow patches created local biogeochemical gradients while inter-basin comparisons encompassed landscape scale gradients enabling comparisons of microbial controls at two distinct spatial scales. At the organic carbon rich, mesic, low elevation sites Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria were prevalent, while Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were dominant at the high elevation, low moisture and biomass sites. Microbial parameters were significantly related with soil water content and edaphic characteristics including soil pH, organic matter, and sulfate. However, the magnitude and even the direction of these relationships varied across basins and the application of mixed effects models revealed evidence of significant contextual effects at local and regional scales. The results highlight the importance of the geographic scale of sampling when determining the controls on soil microbial community characteristics.

AB Cichlid fishes have evolved tremendous morphological and behavioral diversity in the waters of East Africa. Within each of the Great Lakes Tanganyika, Malawi, and Victoria, the phenomena of hybridization and retention of ancestral polymorphism explain allele sharing across species. Here, we explore the sharing of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the major East African cichlid assemblages. A set of approximately 200 genic and nongenic SNPs was ascertained in five Lake Malawi species and genotyped in a diverse collection of similar to 160 species from across Africa. We observed segregating polymorphism outside of the Malawi lineage for more than 50% of these loci; this holds similarly for genic versus nongenic SNPs, as well as for SNPs at putative CpG versus non-CpG sites. Bayesian and principal component analyses of genetic structure in the data demonstrate that the Lake Malawi endemic flock is not monophyletic and that river species have likely contributed significantly to Malawi genomes. Coalescent simulations support the hypothesis that river cichlids have transported polymorphism between lake assemblages. We observed strong genetic differentiation between Malawi lineages for approximately 8% of loci, with contributions from both genic and nongenic SNPs. Notably, more than half of these outlier loci between Malawi groups are polymorphic outside of the lake. Cichlid fishes have evolved diversity in Lake Malawi as new mutations combined with standing genetic variation shared across East Africa.

AB Bumblebee communities and their foraging resources were surveyed in south Swedish agricultural landscapes of contrasting complexity, defined by the size of arable fields and the amount of permanent grazed pastures. After the flowering of oilseed rape (OSR), simplified landscapes contained substantially less herbaceous flower resources and a lower proportion of perennials, compared to complex ones. The seasonal pattern of bumblebee abundance differed between landscape types. Initial bumblebee abundances were equal in both landscape types. However, by late July there was a sharp decline of bumblebees in simple landscapes, while the abundance continued to increase in complex landscapes. This suggests that a larger proportion of bumblebee colonies may fail to reproduce in simple landscapes despite a beneficial early season. Overall, bumblebee abundance in late July was positively related to three inter-related variables: area of permanent pasture, area of ley fields and total amount of herbaceous flowers, while early abundances (June to early July) did not relate to these variables. We suggest that in simplified landscapes of this region, bumblebee abundance is limited by floral resources mainly from midsummer and onward. Spring and early summer resources may indeed be sufficient for colony establishment and initial growth even in simplified landscapes, possibly as a result of large scale farming of OSR. The initially equal abundances of workers in simple and complex landscapes, as well as the fact that also many of the regionally rare species seem to persist in simple landscapes, suggest that rare species can survive in pockets of beneficial habitat and/or there may be an inflow of queens from nearby complex landscapes. If the latter is true, further simplification or abandonment of complex landscapes may threaten bumblebee populations also in neighbouring simple landscapes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, a simple model was developed to estimate crop gross prirnary productivity (GPP) using a product of chlorophyll-related vegetation index, retrieved from MODIS 250 m data, and potential photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Potential PAR is incident photosynthetically active radiation under a condition of minimal atmospheric aerosol loading. This model was proposed for GPP estimation based entirely on satellite data, and it was tested in maize and soybean, which are contrasting crop types different in leaf structures and canopy architectures, under different crop managements and climatic conditions. The model using MODIS 250 m data, which brings high temporal resolution and moderate spatial resolution, was capable of estimating GPP accurately in both irrigated and rainfed croplands in three Nebraska AmeriFlux sites during growing seasons 2001 through 2008. Among the MODIS-250 m retrieved indices tested, enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI) were the most accurate for GPP estimation with coefficients of variation below 20% in maize and 25% in soybean. It was shown that the developed model was able to accurately detect GPP variation in crops where total chlorophyll content is closely tied to seasonal dynamic of GPP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB The relationship between facilitation and evolutionary ecology is poorly understood. We review five issues elucidating how the phylogenetic relatedness of species provides insight into the role of facilitation in community assembly: (a) Are the facilitative interactions more common between species that differ in a regeneration niche? (b) Are facilitative interactions more common between distantly related species? (c) Do communities governed by facilitation (rather than competition) have higher phylogenetic diversity? (d) As facilitated juvenile plants mature, do they compete with their nurses more often if they are closely related to them? (e) How does the phylogenetic signature in a community reveal ecological processes, such as succession, regeneration dynamics, indirect interactions, and coextinction cascades? The evolutionary history of lineages explains the regeneration niche of species, which ultimately determines the facilitation-competition balance and therefore community assembly and dynamics. We apply this framework to the conservation of biodiversity and propose future research avenues.

AB Eddy covariance measurements of the turbulent sensible heat, latent heat and carbon dioxide fluxes for 12 months (2011-2012) are reported for the first time for a suburban area in the UK. The results from Swindon are comparable to suburban studies of similar surface cover elsewhere but reveal large seasonal variability. Energy partitioning favours turbulent sensible heat during summer (midday Bowen ratio 1.4-1.6) and latent heat in winter (0.05-0.7). A significant proportion of energy is stored (and released) by the urban fabric and the estimated anthropogenic heat flux is small but non-negligible (0.5-0.9 MJ m(-2) day(-1)). The sensible heat flux is negative at night and for much of winter daytimes, reflecting the suburban nature of the site (44% vegetation) and relatively low built fraction (16%). Latent heat fluxes appear to be water limited during a dry spring in both 2011 and 2012, when the response of the surface to moisture availability can be seen on a daily timescale. Energy and other factors are more relevant controls at other times; at night the wind speed is important. On average, surface conductance follows a smooth, asymmetrical diurnal course peaking at around 6-9 mm s(-1), but values are larger and highly variable in wet conditions. The combination of natural (vegetative) and anthropogenic (emission) processes is most evident in the temporal variation of the carbon flux: significant photosynthetic uptake is seen during summer, whilst traffic and building emissions explain peak release in winter (9.5 g C m(-2) day(-1)). The area is a net source of CO2 annually. Analysis by wind direction highlights the role of urban vegetation in promoting evapotranspiration and offsetting CO2 emissions, especially when contrasted against peak traffic emissions from sectors with more roads. Given the extent of suburban land use, these results have important implications for understanding urban energy, water and carbon dynamics.

AB We determined the relationship between acoustic diversity and metrics of vertical forest structure derived from light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data in a neotropical rainforest in Costa Rica. We then used the LIDAR-derived metrics to predict acoustic diversity across the forest landscape. Sound recordings were obtained from 14 sites for six consecutive days during dusk chorus (6 pm). Acoustic diversity was calculated for each day as the total intensity across acoustic frequency bands using the Shannon index and then averaged over the 6 days at each site. A 10 m radius around each site was used to obtain several LIDAR-derived metrics describing the vertical structural attributes of the forest canopy. Multiple linear regression (MLR) with Akaike information criterion was used to determine a top-ranked model with acoustic diversity as the dependent variable and the LIDAR metrics as independent variables. Acoustic diversity was modeled for forested areas (where canopy height was > 20 m) at 20 m resolution using coefficients obtained from the MLR, and a hotspot analysis was conducted on the resulting layer. Acoustic diversity was strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.75) with the LIDAR metrics suggesting that LIDAR-derived metrics can be used to determine canopy structural attributes important to vocal fauna species. The hotspot analysis revealed that the spatial distribution of these canopy structural attributes across the La Selva forest is not random. Our approach can be used to identify forest patches of potentially high acoustic diversity for conservation or management purposes.

AB Studies on hybridization have proved critical for understanding key evolutionary processes such as speciation and adaptation. However, from the perspective of conservation, hybridization poses a concern, as it can threaten the integrity and fitness of many wild species, including canids. As a result of habitat fragmentation and extensive hunting pressure, gray wolf (Canis lupus) populations have declined dramatically in Europe and elsewhere during recent centuries. Small and fragmented populations have persisted, but often only in the presence of large numbers of dogs, which increase the potential for hybridization and introgression to deleteriously affect wolf populations. Here, we demonstrate hybridization between wolf and dog populations in Estonia and Latvia, and the role of both genders in the hybridization process, using combined analysis of maternal, paternal and biparental genetic markers. Eight animals exhibiting unusual external characteristics for wolves - six from Estonia and two from Latvia - proved to be wolf-dog hybrids. However, one of the hybridization events was extraordinary. Previous field observations and genetic studies have indicated that mating between wolves and dogs is sexually asymmetrical, occurring predominantly between female wolves and male dogs. While this was also the case among the Estonian hybrids, our data revealed the existence of dog mitochondrial genomes in the Latvian hybrids and, together with Y chromosome and autosomal microsatellite data, thus provided the first evidence from Europe of mating between male wolves and female dogs. We discuss patterns of sexual asymmetry in wolf-dog hybridization.

AB Aim To measure the effects of including biotic interactions on climate-based species distribution models (SDMs) used to predict distribution shifts under climate change. We evaluated the performance of distribution models for an endangered marsupial, the northern bettong (Bettongia tropica), comparing models that used only climate variables with models that also took into account biotic interactions. Location North-east Queensland, Australia. Methods We developed separate climate-based distribution models for the northern bettong, its two main resources and a competitor species. We then constructed models for the northern bettong by including climate suitability estimates for the resources and competitor as additional predictor variables to make climate similar to+similar to resource and climate similar to+similar to resource similar to+similar to competition models. We projected these models onto seven future climate scenarios and compared predictions of northern bettong distribution made by these differently structured models, using a global metric, the I similarity statistic, to measure overlap in distribution and a local metric to identify where predictions differed significantly. Results Inclusion of food resource biotic interactions improved model performance. Over moderate climate changes, up to 3.0 similar to degrees C of warming, the climate-only model for the northern bettong gave similar predictions of distribution to the more complex models including interactions, with differences only at the margins of predicted distributions. For climate changes beyond 3.0 similar to degrees C, model predictions diverged significantly. The interactive model predicted less contraction of distribution than the simpler climate-only model. Main conclusions Distribution models that account for interactions with other species, in particular direct resources, improve model predictions in the present-day climate. For larger climate changes, shifts in distribution of interacting species cause predictions of interactive models to diverge from climate-only models. Incorporating interactions with other species in SDMs may be needed for long-term prediction of changes in distribution of species under climate change, particularly for specialized species strongly dependent on a small number of biotic interactions.

AB 1. Longevity is a major determinant of individual differences in Darwinian fitness. Several studies have analyzed the stochastic, time-dependent causes of variation in longevity, but little information exists from free-ranging animal populations on the effects that environmental conditions and phenotype early in ontogeny have on duration of life. 2. In this long-term (19932011) study of a migratory, colonial, passerine bird, the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), we analyzed longevity and, in a subsample of individuals, lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of the offspring that reached sexual maturity in relation to hatching date, which can affect the rearing environment through a seasonal deterioration in ecological conditions. Moreover, we analyzed the consequences of variation in body size and, for the first time in any species, of a major component of immunity on longevity, both by looking at absolute phenotypic values and at deviations from the brood mean. 3. Accelerated failure time models showed that individuals of both sexes that hatched early in any breeding season enjoyed larger longevity and larger LRS, indicating directional selection for early breeding. Both male and female offspring with large T cell-mediated immune response relative to their siblings and female nestlings that dominated the brood size/age hierarchy had larger longevity than their siblings of inferior phenotypic quality/age. Conversely, absolute phenotypic values did not predict longevity. 4. Frailty modelling disclosed marked spatial heterogeneity in longevity among colonies of origin, again stressing the impact of rearing conditions on longevity. 5. This study therefore reinforces the notion that perinatal environment and maternal decisions over timing and site of breeding, and position in the brood hierarchy can have marked effects on progeny life history that extend well into adulthood. In addition, it provides the first evidence from any bird population in the wild that immune response when nestlings predicts individuals longevity after sexual maturation.

AB A challenge to ecologists and evolutionary biologists is predicting organismal responses to the anticipated changes to global ecosystems through climate change. Most evidence suggests that short-term global change may involve increasing occurrences of extreme events, therefore the immediate response of individuals will be determined by physiological capacities and life-history adaptations to cope with extreme environmental conditions. Here, we consider the role of hormones and maternal effects in determining the persistence of species in altered environments. Hormones, specifically steroids, are critical for patterning the behaviour and morphology of parents and their offspring. Hence, steroids have a pervasive influence on multiple aspects of the offspring phenotype over its lifespan. Stress hormones, e. g. glucocorticoids, modulate and perturb phenotypes both early in development and later into adulthood. Females exposed to abiotic stressors during reproduction may alter the phenotypes by manipulation of hormones to the embryos. Thus, hormone-mediated maternal effects, which generate phenotypic plasticity, may be one avenue for coping with global change. Variation in exposure to hormones during development influences both the propensity to disperse, which alters meta-population dynamics, and population dynamics, by affecting either recruitment to the population or subsequent life-history characteristics of the offspring. We suggest that hormones may be an informative index to the potential for populations to adapt to changing environments.

AB Despite the importance of dispersal for population connectivity, dispersal is often costly to the individual. A major impediment to understanding connectivity has been a lack of data combining the movement of individuals and their survival to reproduction in the new habitat (realized connectivity). Although mortality often occurs during dispersal (an immediate cost), in many organisms costs are paid after dispersal (deferred costs). It is unclear how such deferred costs influence the mismatch between dispersal and realized connectivity. Through a series of experiments in the field and laboratory, we estimated both direct and indirect deferred costs in a marine bryozoan (Bugula neritina). We then used the empirical data to parameterize a theoretical model in order to formalize predictions about how dispersal costs influence realized connectivity. Individuals were more likely to colonize poor-quality habitat after prolonged dispersal durations. Individuals that colonized poor-quality habitat performed poorly after colonization because of some property of the habitat (an indirect deferred cost) rather than from prolonged dispersal per se (a direct deferred cost). Our theoretical model predicted that indirect deferred costs could result in nonlinear mismatches between spatial patterns of potential and realized connectivity. The deferred costs of dispersal are likely to be crucial for determining how well patterns of dispersal reflect realized connectivity. Ignoring these deferred costs could lead to inaccurate predictions of spatial population dynamics.

AB The dual crop coefficient approach accounts separately for plant transpiration and soil evaporation by using the basal crop coefficient and the evaporation coefficient, respectively. The SIMDualKc model, which performs the soil water balance simulation with estimation of the actual crop evapotranspiration (ET) with the dual crop coefficient approach, was applied to a drip-irrigated peach orchard under Mediterranean conditions. Orchard ET was obtained with the eddy covariance technique, which was subsequently correlated with tree transpiration estimated from sap flow measurements and soil evaporation determined with microlysimeters, thus providing ET for the whole irrigation season. Two years of field observations were used for model calibration and validation using those ET measurements and taking into account the fraction of ground covered by trees through a density factor which adjusts the basal crop coefficient. Model fitting relative to ET observations during calibration and validation provided indices of agreement averaging 0.90, coefficients of regression close to 1.0, root mean square errors around 0.41 mm and average absolute errors of 0.32 mm. Model fitting relative to transpiration and to soil evaporation produced similar results, so showing the adequateness of modelling.

AB Spread of alien species may result in biotic homogenization, i.e. increasing similarity between biotas of different areas. We examined whether the flora of Central European cities is becoming homogenized because of the spread of alien species, whether the contribution of aliens to homogenization depends on residence time, and whether habitats under more intense human pressure are more homogenized. Using floristic composition data from a standardized sample of 1-ha plots located in seven habitat types in 32 cities in Central Europe, Belgium and the Netherlands, we compared homogenization effects of archaeophytes (pre-AD 1500 aliens) and neophytes (post-AD 1500 aliens) using rarefaction curves, Jaccard dissimilarity index, Mantel tests and homogenization index. We found that archaeophytes contributed to homogenization and neophytes to differentiation of floras among cities, but generally the spread of alien species caused differentiation. Differentiation was low in the most disturbed urban habitats, such as city squares, boulevards or early successional sites, but was strongest in moderately disturbed habitats, such as city parks and residential areas with an open building pattern. We conclude that biotic homogenization depends on alien plants' residence time. Aliens introduced within the past five centuries are often rare, not yet having achieved their potential range; they therefore increase floristic differentiation. Conversely, species introduced more than five centuries ago have had sufficient time to disperse into most suitable habitats, and consequently contribute to homogenization. Although invasions may therefore initially increase biodiversity, they could ultimately lead to homogenization. These processes are faster and stronger in more disturbed habitats.

AB Hybrid speciation, or the formation of a daughter species due to interbreeding between two parental species, is a potentially important means of diversification, because it generates new forms from existing variation. However, factors responsible for the origin and maintenance of hybrid species are largely unknown. Here we show that the North American butterfly Papilio appalachiensis is a hybrid species, with genomic admixture from Papilio glaucus and Papilio canadensis. Papilio appalachiensis has a mosaic phenotype, which is hypothesized to be the result of combining sex-linked traits from P. glaucus and P. canadensis. We show that P. appalachiensis' Z-linked genes associated with a cooler thermal habitat were inherited from P. canadensis, whereas its W-linked mimicry and mitochondrial DNA were inherited from P. glaucus. Furthermore, genome-wide AFLP markers showed nearly equal contributions from each parental species in the origin of P. appalachiensis, indicating that it formed from a burst of hybridization between the parental species, with little subsequent backcrossing. However, analyses of genetic differentiation, clustering, and polymorphism based on molecular data also showed that P. appalachiensis is genetically distinct from both parental species. Population genetic simulations revealed P. appalachiensis to be much younger than the parental species, with unidirectional gene flow from P. glaucus and P. canadensis into P. appalachiensis. Finally, phylogenetic analyses, combined with ancestral state reconstruction, showed that the two traits that define P. appalachiensis' mosaic phenotype, obligatory pupal diapause and mimicry, evolved uniquely in P. canadensis and P. glaucus, respectively, and were then recombined through hybridization to form P. appalachiensis. These results suggest that natural selection and sex-linked traits may have played an important role in the origin and maintenance of P. appalachiensis as a hybrid species. In particular, ecological barriers associated with a steep thermal cline appear to maintain the distinct, mosaic genome of P. appalachiensis despite contact and occasional hybridization with both parental species.

AB Despite the key functions of the genitalia in sexual interactions and fertilization, the role of sexual selection and conflict in shaping genital traits remains poorly understood. Seed beetle (Callosobruchus maculatus) males possess spines on the intromittent organ, and females possess a thickened reproductive tract wall that also bears spines. We investigated the role of sexual selection and conflict by imposing monogamous mating on eight replicate populations of this naturally polygamous insect, while maintaining eight other populations under polygamy. To establish whether responses to mating system manipulation were robust to ecological context, we simultaneously manipulated life-history selection (early/late reproduction). Over 18-21 generations, male genital spines evolved relatively reduced length in large males (i.e., shallower static allometry) in monogamous populations. Two nonintromittent male genital appendages also evolved in response to the interaction of mating system and ecology. In contrast, no detectable evolution occurred in female genitalia, consistent with the expectation of a delayed response in defensive traits. Our results support a sexually antagonistic role for the male genital spines, and demonstrate the evolution of static allometry in response to variation in sexual selection opportunity. We argue that further advances in the study of genital coevolution will require a much more detailed understanding of the functions of male and female genital traits.

AB In tropical forests, hunting nearly always accompanies logging. The entangled nature of these disturbances complicates our ability to resolve applied questions, such as whether secondary and degraded forest can sustain populations of tropical animals. With the expansion of logging in central Africa, conservation depends on knowledge of the individual and combined impacts of logging and hunting on animal populations. Our goals were (1) to decouple the effects of selective logging and hunting on densities of animal guilds, including apes, duikers, monkeys, elephant, pigs, squirrels, and large frugivorous and insectivorous birds and (2) to compare the relative importance of these disturbances to the effects of local-scale variation in forest structure and fruit abundance. In northern Republic of Congo, we surveyed animals along 30 transects positioned in forest disturbed by logging and hunting, logging alone, and neither logging nor hunting. While sampling transects twice per month for two years, we observed 47 179 animals of 19 species and eight guilds in 1154 passages (2861 km). Species densities varied by as much as 480% among forest areas perturbed by logging and/or hunting, demonstrating the strong effects of these disturbances on populations of some species. Densities of animal guilds varied more strongly with disturbance type than with variation in forest structure, canopy cover, and fruit abundance. Independently, logging and hunting decreased density of some guilds and increased density of others: densities varied from 44% lower (pigs) to 90% higher (insectivorous birds) between logged and unlogged forest and from 61% lower (apes) to 77% higher (frugivorous birds) between hunted and unhunted forest. Their combined impacts exacerbated decreases in populations of some guilds (ape, duiker, monkey, and pig), but counteracted one another for others (squirrels, insectivorous and frugivorous birds). Together, logging and hunting shifted the relative abundance of the animal community away from large mammals toward squirrels and birds. Logged forest, even in the absence of hunting, does not maintain similar densities as unlogged forest for most animal guilds. To balance conservation with the need for economic development and wild meat in tropical countries, landscapes should be spatially managed to include protected areas, community hunting zones, and production forest.

AB Bundle sheath extensions (BSEs) are key features of leaf structure with currently little-understood functions. To test the hypothesis that BSEs reduce the hydraulic resistance from the bundle sheath to the epidermis (r(be)) and thereby accelerate hydropassive stomatal movements, we compared stomatal responses with reduced humidity and leaf excision among 20 species with heterobaric or homobaric leaves and herbaceous or woody life forms. We hypothesized that low r(be) due to the presence of BSEs would increase the rate of stomatal opening (V) during transient wrong-way responses, but more so during wrong-way responses to excision (V-e) than humidity (V-h), thus increasing the ratio of V-e to V-h. We predicted the same trends for herbaceous relative to woody species given greater hydraulic resistance in woody species. We found that V-e, V-h, and their ratio were 2.3 to 4.4 times greater in heterobaric than homobaric leaves and 2.0 to 3.1 times greater in herbaceous than woody species. To assess possible causes for these differences, we simulated these experiments in a dynamic compartment/resistance model, which predicted larger V-e and V-e/V-h in leaves with smaller r(be). These results support the hypothesis that BSEs reduce r(be). Comparison of our data and simulations suggested that r(be) is approximately 4 to 16 times larger in homobaric than heterobaric leaves. Our study provides new evidence that variations in the distribution of hydraulic resistance within the leaf and plant are central to understanding dynamic stomatal responses to water status and their ecological correlates and that BSEs play several key roles in the functional ecology of heterobaric leaves.

AB Road-induced habitat fragmentation is one of the greatest threats to large carnivores. Wildlife passes have been used to reduce fragmentation by mitigating the effects of roads as barriers to animal movement. However, direct observations of animals crossing roads are extremely rare and thus indirect methods are necessary to locate crossings. Yet, current methods fail to incorporate the animals' movement behavior and thus have little predictive power. Based on the principles of resource selection functions and state-space modeling, we developed a Bayesian movement model applied to radio-telemetry and GPS data to infer the movement behavior of jaguars Panthera onca as a response to vegetation, roads and human population density in the Mayan Forests of Mexico and Guatemala. We used the results of the model to simulate jaguars moving along a road that bisects the major reserve system in the area. The aim of the simulations was to identify suitable locations for wildlife passes. We found that jaguars move preferentially to undisturbed forests and that females avoid moving close to roads and to areas with even low levels of human occupation. Males also avoid roads, but to a lesser degree, and appear undisturbed by human population density. Simulations reflected these differences: potential crossing sites for females are limited to a strip of a few kilometers, whereas males are able to cross at many different sites. Still, we identified a 1 km strip along the road where the likelihood of crossing for both sexes is highest, ideal for the construction of a wildlife pass. Our study contributes to the ecology of one of the world's least-studied large carnivores and provides a modeling framework that greatly improves the location of wildlife passes. Moreover, our approach can greatly advance region-wide conservation plans for the location of corridors and conservation units.

AB The area of semi-natural grasslands in Bulgaria has decreased tremendously in the past century due to agricultural intensification or abandonment. As these grasslands host valuable biodiversity, conservation measures are needed for their sustainable maintenance. We studied the effect of pastureland abandonment on plant communities at the Ponor Mt., a part of the Balkan Mts., Bulgaria. Data on floristic composition, vegetation structure and several abiotic parameters were collected in 137 randomly located 16-m(2) plots in 2008. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to analyse how species composition is related to abiotic and land use factors. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were used to test for the effects of sheep grazing vs. abandonment on vegetation structure and composition. The main environmental factors explaining the compositional variation were related to the altitude, sheep grazing and soil depth. Pastureland abandonment led to an increase in vegetation height and of the richness of mesophytes and leafy plants, and red-list species. Grazed plots had higher total species richness, more xerophytes, rosette forming and spring-flowering species. To ensure the persistence of the species of both the open grasslands and mid-successional grassland communities, the management should be carried out in an extensive way and with a zonation regime.

AB Agricultural intensification has led to dramatic losses in biodiversity over the past several decades. Many studies have shown the effects of intensification on vegetation or soil communities at field or local scales. However, the functional significance of biodiversity may only appear at larger spatial and temporal scales, due to exchanges among local ecosystems throughout a landscape. To examine how patterns of biodiversity loss are reflected at larger spatial scales, plant and soil biodiversity and associated indicators of ecosystem functions were assessed in riparian areas over a 150 km(2) agricultural landscape in the Sacramento Valley of California. Publicly-available GIS data were first used to classify and select sites over the range of soils, topography and plant community types. Representative sites from the landscape were sampled for soil physiochemical properties, as well as microbial, nematode, and plant communities. Higher agricultural intensification, based on field and landscape indices, was negatively correlated with richness and diversity of plant and soil taxa, and was related to indicators of ecosystem functions, such as increased soil nitrate and phosphorus loading, decreased riparian health ratings, and lower soil carbon, soil microbial biomass and soil food web structure. Both field- and landscape-scale factors played important roles in the measured losses. The study area was composed of a wide array of soils, vegetation, and land management, indicating that the observed trends transcended site-specific conditions.

AB Determining relative strengths of trophic links is critical for ranking predators for conservation biological control. Molecular gut-content analysis enables ranking by incidence of prey remains in the gut, but differential digestive rates bias such rankings toward predators with slower rates. This bias can be reduced by indexing each predator's half-life to that of the middle-most half-life in a predator complex. We demonstrate this with data from key species in the predator complex of Colorado potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), comprising adults and immatures of four taxonomically diverse species. These animals display order-of-magnitude variation in detectability half-life for the cytochrome oxidase I DNA sequence of a single CPB egg: from 7.0 h in larval Coleomegilla maculata (DeGeer) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) to 84.4 h in nymphal Perillus bioculatus (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). The raw species-specific incidence of L. decemlineata DNA in the guts of 351 field-collected predators ranged from 11 to 95%, ranking them as follows: C. maculata adults < Lebia grandis Hentz (Coleoptera: Carabidae) adults < Podisus maculiventris (Say) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) adults < P. maculiventris nymphs < P. bioculatus adults < P. bioculatus nymphs. Half-life adjustment reorders the rankings: C. maculata adults < P. bioculatus adults < P. bioculatus nymphs < P. maculiventris nymphs < L. grandis adults < P. maculiventris adults. These changes in status demonstrate the value of half-life-adjusted molecular gut-content data for ranking predators. This is the first study to measure prey detectability half-lives for the key arthropod predators of a major insect pest, and to use them to evaluate the relative impact of all adults and immatures in this predator complex.

AB Increasing evidence shows that anthropogenic climate change is affecting biodiversity. Reducing or stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions may slow global warming, but past emissions will continue to contribute to further unavoidable warming for more than a century. With obvious signs of difficulties in achieving effective mitigation worldwide in the short term at least, sound scientific predictions of future impacts on biodiversity will be required to guide conservation planning and adaptation. This is especially true in Mediterranean type ecosystems that are projected to be among the most significantly affected by anthropogenic climate change, and show the highest levels of confidence in rainfall projections. Multiple methods are available for projecting the consequences of climate change on the main unit of interest - the species - with each method having strengths and weaknesses. Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly applied for forecasting climate change impacts on species geographic ranges. Aggregation of models for different species allows inferences of impacts on biodiversity, though excluding the effects of species interactions. The modelling approach is based on several further assumptions and projections and should be treated cautiously. In the absence of comparable approaches that address large numbers of species, SDMs remain valuable in estimating the vulnerability of species. In this review we discuss the application of SDMs in predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity with special reference to the species-rich South West Australian Floristic Region and South African Cape Floristic Region. We discuss the advantages and challenges in applying SDMs in biodiverse regions with high levels of endemicity, and how a similar biogeographical history in both regions may assist us in understanding their vulnerability to climate change. We suggest how the process of predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity with SDMs can be improved and emphasize the role of field monitoring and experiments in validating the predictions of SDMs.

AB Specific leaf area (SLA; m(leaf)(2) kg(leaf)(-1)) is a key ecophysiological parameter influencing leaf physiology, photosynthesis, and whole plant carbon gain. Both individual tree-based models and other forest process-based models are generally highly sensitive to this parameter, but information on its temporal or within-stand variability is still scarce. In a 2-4-year-old Eucalyptus plantation in Congo, prone to seasonal drought, the within-stand and seasonal variability in SLA were investigated by means of destructive sampling carried out at 2-month intervals, over a 2-year period. Within-crown vertical gradients of SLA were small. Highly significant relationships were found between tree-average SLA (SLA(t)) and tree size (tree height, H-t, or diameter at breast height, DBH): SLA(t) ranged from about 9 m(2) kg(-1) for dominant trees to about 14-15 m(2) kg(-1) for the smallest trees. The decrease in SLA(t) with increasing tree size was accurately predicted from DBH using power functions. Stand-average SLA varied by about 20% during the year, with lowest values at the end of the 5-month dry season, and highest values about 2-3 months after the onset of the wet season. Variability in leaf water status according to tree size and season is discussed as a possible determinant of both the within-stand and seasonal variations in SM. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB The carabid beetle Pterostichus melanarius is a major natural enemy of pests, such as aphids and slugs in agricultural systems. Earthworms are a dominant non-pest component of the diet of P. melanarius which help sustain the beetles during periods when the pest population is low or absent. In this study we wanted to test whether this predator exercises prey choice among different earthworm species or ecological groups. High levels of genetic diversity within morphological species of earthworm necessitated the development of primers that were specific not just to species but lineages and sub-lineages within species as well. Gut samples from beetles were analysed using multiplex-PCR and fluorescent-labelled primers. Calibratory feeding trials were undertaken to calculate median detection times for prey DNA following ingestion. Extensive testing demonstrated that the primers were species-specific, that detection periods were negatively related to amplicon size and that meal size had a highly significant effect on detection periods. Monte Carlo simulations showed that, in general, worms were being predated in proportion to their densities in the field with little evidence of prey choice, other than probable avoidance of the larger, deep-living species. There was no evidence that epigeic species were being taken preferentially in comparison with endogeic species. There was also no evidence that defensive secretions by Allolobophora chlorotica reduced predation pressure on this species by P. melanarius. We concluded that any management system that increases earthworm densities generally, regardless of component species, is likely to be optimal for increasing numbers of this beneficial beetle predator.

AB Although the ecological consequences of species invasions are well studied, the ecological impacts of genetic introgression through hybridization are less understood. This is particularly true of the impacts of hybridization on "third party'' community members not genetically involved in hybridization. We also know little about how direct interactions between hybrid and parental individuals influence fitness. Here, we examined the ecological effects of hybridization between the native, threatened California Tiger Salamander (Ambystoma californiense) and the introduced Barred Tiger Salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum mavortium). Native x introduced hybrids are widespread in California, where they are top predators in seasonal ponds. We examined the impacts of early generation hybrids (first 2 generations of parental crosses) and contemporary hybrids derived from ponds where hybrids have been under selection in the wild for 20 generations. We found that most classes of hybrid tiger salamander larvae dramatically reduced survival of 2 native community members, the Pacific Chorus Frog (Pseudacris regilla) and the California Newt (Taricha torosa). We also found that native A. californiense larvae were negatively impacted by the presence of hybrid larvae: Native survival and size at metamorphosis were reduced and time to metamorphosis was extended. We also observed a large influence of Mendelian dominance on size, metamorphic timing and predation rate of hybrid tiger salamanders. These results suggest that both genetic and ecological factors are likely to influence the dynamics of admixture, and that tiger salamander hybridization might constitute a threat to additional pond-breeding species of concern in the region.

AB We investigated fine root biomass and distribution patterns in a species-rich temperate Carpinus-Quercus-Fagus-Tilia forest and searched for experimental evidence of symmetry or asymmetry in belowground competition. We conducted extensive root coring and applied the recently introduced in situ-root growth chamber technique for quantifying fine root growth under experimentally altered intra- and interspecific root neighbourhoods in the intact stand. In 75% of all soil cores, fine roots of more than two tree species were present indicating a broad overlap of the root systems of neighbouring trees. Quercus trees had more than ten times less fine root biomass in relation to aboveground biomass or productivity (stem growth) and a much higher leaf area index/root area index ratio than Carpinus, Fagus and Tilia trees. The root growth chamber experiments indicated a high belowground competitive ability of Fagus in interspecific interactions, but a low one of Quercus. We conclude that (1) interspecific root competition is ubiquitous in this mixed stand, (2) root competition between trees can be clearly asymmetric, and (3) tree species may be ranked according to their belowground competitive ability. Fagus was found to be the most successful species in belowground competition which matches with its superiority in aboveground competition in this forest community.

AB 1. Norway spruce (Picea abies), one of the dominant tree species in Eurasia, has spread slowly westward in northern Europe, invading eastern Finland about 6500 calibrated years ago (cal. years BP), eastern central Sweden about 2700 cal. years BP and southern Norway about 1000 cal. years BP. Its spread is the most recent and best constrained invasion of a main tree species in northern Europe and allows an assessment of colonization patterns and associated competitive replacement processes.
   2. We analysed five selected high-resolution pollen accumulation rate (PAR)-records along a 700-km long transect in the direction of P. abies invasion from eastern Finland to central Sweden across the present P. abies- and Pinus sylvestris-dominated southern boreal zone.
   3. Our results show that the P. abies population increased in size from the time of the initial expansion to levels comparable with the modern in 100-550 years. At each site P. abies invaded a dense, intact Pinus-Betula-Alnus forest, mixed with temperate deciduous taxa, particularly Tilia cordata and Corylus avellana. The resident mixed forest provided no or weak resistance to the colonization of P. abies, and the variable population growth rate was therefore not caused by compositional differences in the resident forest but by other, possibly local edaphic factors.
   4. Of the taxa that formed the resident forest, T. cordata responded most strongly to the invasion of P. abies. This suggests that the mid-Holocene T. cordata population decline was not directly climate-induced but resulted from competitive replacement due to overlapping ecological niches with P. abies, a stronger competitor.
   5. Synthesis. The rise to dominance of P. abies was caused not only by its rapid population growth but by associated competitive suppression of other taxa, leading to a major ecosystem change from a mixed conifer-deciduous forest to the modern P. abies- and P. sylvestris-dominated boreal conifer forest in central Fennoscandia. This competitive suppression by P. abies is still reflected in the scattered occurrence and generally weak performance of T. cordata in the boreal zone of Europe and may influence its distribution and abundance patterns under predicted future climate scenarios.

AB Understanding the process of divergence requires the quantitative characterization of patterns of gene flow between diverging taxa. New and powerful coalescent-based methods give insight into these processes in unprecedented details by enabling the reconstruction of the temporal distribution of past gene flow. Here, we use sequence variation at eight nuclear markers and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in multiple populations to study diversity, divergence, and gene flow between two subspecies of a salamander, the smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris kosswigi and Lissotriton vulgaris vulgaris) in Turkey. The ranges of both subspecies encompass mainly the areas of this important glacial refugial area. Populations in refugia where species have been present for a long time and differentiated in situ should better preserve the record of past gene flow than young populations in postglacial expansion areas. Sequence diversity in both subspecies was substantial (nuclear pi(sil) = 0.69% and 1.31%). We detected long-term demographic stability in these refugial populations with large effective population sizes (N-e) of the order of 1.5-3 x 10(5) individuals. Gene trees and the isolation with migration (IM) analysis complemented by tests of nested IM models showed that despite deep, pre-Pleistocene divergence of the studied newts, asymmetric introgression from vulgaris to kosswigi has occurred, with signatures of recent gene flow in mtDNA and an anonymous nuclear marker, and evidence for more ancient introgression in nuclear introns. The distribution of migration times raises the intriguing possibility that even the initial divergence may have occurred in the face of gene flow.

AB To be effective, management programmes geared towards halting or reversing the spread of invasive species must focus on defined and defensible areas. This requires knowledge of the dispersal of non-native species targeted for control to better understand invasion and recolonisation scenarios. We investigated the genetic structure of invasive American mink (Neovison vison) in Scotland, and incorporated landscape genetic approaches to examine resultant patterns in relation to geographical features that may influence dispersal. Populations of mink sampled from 10 sites in two regions (Argyll and Northeast Scotland) show a distinct genetic structure. First, the majority of pairwise population comparisons yielded F-ST values that were significantly greater than zero. Second, amova revealed that most of the genetic variance was attributable to differences among regions. Assignment tests placed 89 or more of individuals into their sampled region. Bayesian clustering methods grouped samples into two clusters according to their region of origin. Wombling approach identified the Cairngorms Mountains as a major impediment to gene flow between the regions. Mantel pairwise correlations between genetic and geographical distances estimated as least-cost distance assuming a linear increase in the cost of movement with increasing elevation were higher than Euclidean distances or distance along waterways. Spatial autocorrelation analyses revealed stronger spatial structuring for females than for males. These results suggest that gene flow by American mink is restricted by landscape features (mountain ranges) and that eradication attempt should in the first instance break down the connectivity between management units separated by mountains.

AB Alpine snowbeds are characterized by a long-lasting snow cover and low soil temperature during the growing season. Both these key abiotic factors controlling plant life in snowbeds are sensitive to anthropogenic climate change and will alter the environmental conditions in snowbeds to a considerable extent until the end of this century. In order to name winners and losers of climate change among the plant species inhabiting snowbeds, we analyzed the small-scale species distribution along the snowmelt and soil temperature gradients within alpine snowbeds in the Swiss Alps. The results show that the date of snowmelt and soil temperature were relevant abiotic factors for small-scale vegetation patterns within alpine snowbed communities. Species richness in snowbeds was reduced to about 50% along the environmental gradients towards later snowmelt date or lower daily maximum temperature. Furthermore, the occurrence pattern of the species along the snowmelt gradient allowed the establishment of five species categories with different predictions of their distribution in a warmer world. The dominants increased their relative cover with later snowmelt date and will, therefore, lose abundance due to climate change, but resist complete disappearance from the snowbeds. The indifferents and the transients increased in species number and relative cover with higher temperature and will profit from climate warming. The snowbed specialists will be the most suffering species due to the loss of their habitats as a consequence of earlier snowmelt dates in the future and will be replaced by the avoiders of late-snowmelt sites. These forthcoming profiteers will take advantage from an increasing number of suitable habitats due to an earlier start of the growing season and increased temperature. Therefore, the characteristic snowbed vegetation will change to a vegetation unit dominated by alpine grassland species. The study highlights the vulnerability of the established snowbed vegetation to climate change and requires further studies particularly about the role of biotic interactions in the predicted invasion and replacement process.

AB Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea) in southern Africa are nodulated by a genetically diverse group of Bradyrhizobium strains. To determine the identity of these bacteria, a collection of 22 isolates originating from the root nodules of both hosts in Botswana and South Africa was investigated using the combined sequences for the core genome genes rrs, recA, and glnll. These data separated the majority of the isolates into one of three unique lineages that most likely represent novel Bradyrhizobium species. Some isolates were also conspecific with B. yuanmingense and with B. elkanii, although none grouped with B. japonicum, B. canariense or B. liaoningense. To study the evolution of nodulation genes in these bacteria, the common nodulation gene, nodA, and host-specific nodulation genes, nodZ, noeE, and noel, were analyzed. The nodA phylogeny showed that the cowpea and peanut Bradyrhizobium isolates represent various locally adapted groups or ecotypes that form part of Clade III of the seven known Bradyrhizobium nodA clades. This large and highly diverse clade comprises all strains from sub-Saharan Africa, as well as some originating from the Americas, Australia, Indonesia, China and Japan. Some similar groupings were supported by the other nodulation genes, although the overall phylogenies for the nodulation genes were incongruent with that inferred from the core genome genes, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer significantly influences the evolution of cowpea and peanut root-nodule bacteria. Furthermore, identification of the nodZ, noel, and noeE genes in the isolates tested indicates that African Bradyrhizobium species may produce highly decorated nodulation factors, which potentially represent an important adaptation enabling nodulation of a great variety of legumes inhabiting the African continent.

AB The distribution of the mountain coniferous forest biome in Europe throughout time is not sufficiently understood. One character species of this habitat type is the large ringlet, Erebia euryale well reflecting the extension of this biome today, and the genetic differentiation of this species among and within mountain systems may unravel the late Pleistocene history of this habitat type. We therefore analysed the allozyme pattern of 381 E. euryale individuals from 11 populations in four different European mountain systems (Pyrenees, Alps, Carpathians, Rila). All loci analysed were polymorphic. The mean F-ST over all samples was high (20%). Furthermore, the mean genetic distance among samples was quite high (0.049). We found four different groups well supported by cluster analyses, bootstraps and hierarchical variance analyses: Pyrenees, western Alps, eastern Alps and southeastern Europe (Carpathians and Rila). The genetic diversity of the populations was highest in the southeastern European group and stepwise decreased westwards. Interestingly, the populations from Bulgaria and Romania were almost identical; therefore, we assume that they were not separated by the Danube Valley, at least during the last ice age. On the contrary, the differentiation among the three western Alps populations was considerable. For all these reasons, we assume that (i) the most important refugial area for the coniferous mountain forest biome in Europe has been located in southeastern Europe including at least parts of the Carpathians and the Bulgarian mountains; (ii) important refugial areas for this biome existed at the southeastern edge of the Alps; (iii) fragments of this habitat types survived along the southwestern Alps, but in a more scattered distribution; and (iv) relatively small relicts have persisted somewhere at the foothills of the Pyrenees.

AB This paper provides values for nitrogen isotopic abundances of southern African soils and plants along land use gradients of varying aridity. The delta N-15 values of soils and plants were generally higher in sites with greater land use intensity, except in the most and site where delta N-15 decreased with land use intensity. The enrichment in N-15 with land use intensity agrees with the expected effects of grazing and cultivation on N cycling processes, including increased volatilization of ammonium, exports of plant material, and decreased N-2 fixation by the destruction of cyanobacterial soil crusts. Gross mineralization and nitrification rates were more affected by local heterogeneity in the soils than by aridity or land use. In general, C-3 plants had significantly higher delta N-15 than C-4 plants from the same location, suggesting different N use by the two plant types. This study suggests that land use intensity affects N cycling processes that may result in different and opposite changes of ecosystem delta N-15, as those observed between the most arid, and the other semi and sites analyzed. In addition to the N-15 enrichment caused by the loss of gaseous and plant N-14, changes in tree and grass cover may affect soil delta N-15 by the differential uptake of soil N with different isotopic abundances.

AB To assess the similarity, not only in community structure, but also in the factors that shape cladoceran assemblages, we analysed the contemporary zooplankton populations and their sub-fossil remains in 39 shallow UK and Danish lakes. Contemporary zooplankton populations sampled from both the lake edge and the open water in August were compared with surficial sediment assemblages. The sedimentary assemblage data combined counts of both ephippial and chitinous remains in order to provide some representation of Daphnia and Ceriodaphnia. A relatively large volume of sediment (> 5 cm(3)) was analysed for ephippial remains so as to include those species best represented by the larger ephippia. Ephippia were identified to species level in the case of Daphnia magna, and to species aggregates for other groups such as Daphnia hyalina agg., Daphnia pulex agg. and Ceriodaphnia spp. In accordance with previous work several species found in contemporary samples (copepods and the cladocerans Polyphemus pediculus, Scapholeberis mucronata and Diaphanosoma brachyurum) were absent from the surface sediments. There were extensive supporting environmental data sets for the 39 sites. It was therefore possible to determine the factors which influenced assemblage composition for the two datasets by a combination of constrained ordination, in this case redundancy analysis (RDA), partial RDA and Procrustes rotation. The same two factors, zooplanktivorous fish density and submerged macrophyte abundance, were not only the main structuring forces for both data sets, but also explained very similar amounts of the variation in the different assemblages. Thus, we conclude that the living communities and their sedimentary remains reflect the environment they are shaped by in broadly similar ways. Calibration of sub-fossil cladoceran assemblages against modern environmental data to reconstruct environmental change can, therefore, validly employ principles elucidated by contemporary studies to determine the most appropriate modelling technique.

AB Longline fisheries, oil spills, and offshore wind farms are some of the major threats increasing seabird mortality at sea, but the impact of these threats on specific populations has been difficult to determine so far. We tested the use of molecular markers, morphometric measures, and stable isotope (delta N-15 and delta C-13) and trace element concentrations in the first primary feather (grown at the end of the breeding period) to assign the geographic origin of Calonectris shearwaters. Overall, we sampled birds from three taxa: 13 Mediterranean Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea diomedea) breeding sites, 10 Atlantic Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea borealis) breeding sites, and one Cape Verde Shearwater (C. edwardsii) breeding site. Assignment rates were investigated at three spatial scales: breeding colony, breeding archipelago, and taxa levels. Genetic analyses based on the mitochondrial control region (198 birds from 21 breeding colonies) correctly assigned 100% of birds to the three main taxa but failed in detecting geographic structuring at lower scales. Discriminant analyses based on trace elements composition achieved the best rate of correct assignment to colony (77.5%). Body measurements or stable isotopes mainly succeeded in assigning individuals among taxa (87.9% and 89.9%, respectively) but failed at the colony level (27.1% and 38.0%, respectively). Combining all three approaches (morphometrics, isotopes, and trace elements on 186 birds from 15 breeding colonies) substantially improved correct classifications (86.0%, 90.7%, and 100% among colonies, archipelagos, and taxa, respectively). Validations using two independent data sets and jackknife cross-validation confirmed the robustness of the combined approach in the colony assignment (62.5%, 58.8%, and 69.8% for each validation test, respectively). A preliminary application of the discriminant model based on stable isotope delta N-15 and delta C-13 values and trace elements (219 birds from 17 breeding sites) showed that 41 Cory's Shearwaters caught by western Mediterranean long-liners came mainly from breeding colonies in Menorca (48.8%), Ibiza (14.6%), and Crete (31.7%). Our findings show that combining analyses of trace elements and stable isotopes on feathers can achieve high rates of correct geographic assignment of birds in the marine environment, opening new prospects for the study of seabird mortality at sea.

AB The nominal subspecies of rock partridge (Alectoris graeca graeca) is widely distributed in Greece, where populations are declining due to over-hunting and habitat changes. Captive-reared chukars (A. chukar) have been massively released throughout the country, raising fear that introgressive hybridisation might have disrupted local adaptations leading to further population declines. In this study we used mtDNA control-region sequences and Bayesian admixture analyses of multilocus genotypes determined at eight microsatellite loci, to assess the extent of introgressive hybridisation in 319 wild rock partridges collected in Greece. A neighbour-joining tree split the mtDNA haplotypes into three strongly supported clades, corresponding to rock, red-legged (A. rufa) and chukar partridges. We did not detect any case of maternal introgression. In contrast, admixture analyses of microsatellite genotypes identified from four to 28 putative hybrids (according to different assignment criteria), corresponding to 1.2-8.8% of the samples, which were widespread throughout all the country. Power and limits of admixture analyses were assessed using simulated hybrid genotypes, which revealed that a small number of markers can detect all first and second generation hybrids (F-1 and F-2), and up to 90% of the first generation backrossess. Thus, the true proportion of recently introgressed rock partridges in Greece might be ca. 20%. These findings indicate that introgressive hybridisation is widespread, suggesting that released captive-bred partridges have reproduced and hybridised in nature polluting the gene pool of wild rock partridge populations in Greece.

AB The factors that influence the invasion of natural habitats by normative plants remain poorly understood. We investigated abiotic, biotic, and human influences on the distribution and abundance of normative species in coastal upland habitats of southern New England and adjacent New York, US. We censused vegetation and sampled soils in 776, 20 x 20 In plots in natural areas and constructed a spatially referenced GIS database of the region that included land-use history, distance from roads, and surficial geology. Our results indicate that the modern distribution of normative plants is influenced by multiple, interdependent current and historical factors. Glaciolacustrine landforms had greater nonnative species richness and cover than beach-dune, moraine, and glacial outwash sand plain landforms. Extant open-canopied areas (i.e., grasslands, dunes, heather barrens, and old fields) harbored significantly greater normative species richness and cover than closed-canopy forests, heathlands, and shrublands. Additionally, soil calcium levels and native species richness were positively associated with normative species richness. Sites that were cultivated historically or experienced other soil disturbance had higher normative species richness than areas without soil disturbance. Overall, abiotic, biotic and historical land use affected levels of normative species richness whereas normative cover was largely associated with abiotic conditions, particularly soil characteristics. Because many rare coastal sandplain plants reach their greatest abundance on extant open-canopied habitats, efforts to restore native plants will involve tradeoffs between the benefits of expanded habitat for these species and increased risk of invasion by normative species.

AB The residential vegetation features in urban landscapes play an important role as indicators regarding urban biodiversity potential and cultural changing. They also include ornamental resources in the context to landscape appreciation for human environment. Therefore, this paper provides quantitative information on the distribution of plant species in urban residential landscape areas of Trabzon city (Turkey). In a total of 218 sampled areas, 274 plants species belonging to 70 families were surveyed with respect to residential use types of the city. The study results showed that among the species recorded in five residential type (traditional housing, detached housing, villa, apartment blocks and sites, mass housing for employees), non-native taxa frequency of a total species are much and dominantly represent residential landscape structure. Additionally, the species richness and diversity is positively related to new urban development areas. But, it was clearly determined that the vegetation structure has tended to ornamental purposes different from traditional residential gardens including fruit and other benefiting species. Consequently, it can be evidence that the residential vegetation is ornamental plant resources to urban biodiversity and that the distribution of the species in urban landscapes follows necessities of city and human quality.

AB 1 We investigated the role of non-native species (neophytes) in common British plant communities using botanical data from two stratified random surveys carried out in 1990 and 1998.
   2 We found that from 16 851 plots surveyed in 1998 there were 123 non-native species found mostly in arable, tall grass/herb and fertile grassland habitats. Invasive non-native species, e.g. Fallopia japonica, Impatiens glandulifera and Rhododendron ponticum, were uncommon in this survey.
   3 Between 1990 and 1998 the total number of non-native species increased but the mean number of species per sample plot decreased. The mean cover of non-natives increased from 1.2% to 1.9%.
   4 There were positive spatial and temporal relationships between non-native and native species diversity. However, there was a weak negative relationship between changes in non-native cover and native diversity.
   5 The species composition and ecological traits of communities containing non-natives were very different from those that did not contain them.
   6 In the British countryside non-native species were mainly found in habitats with anthropogenic associations, high fertility, high number of ruderal species and high diversity. There is also an indication that successional shifts where competitive invasive species dominate involve non-native species.
   7 National-scale changes in plant community composition are likely to be closely correlated with external land-use impacts. Changes such as eutrophication, nitrogen deposition and increased fertility in infertile habitats are likely to benefit both native and non-native invasive species; however, currently these trends benefit native species much more often than non-natives.
   8 Non-native species are known to have significant effects on native species at local scales in many countries; however, at the landscape scale in Great Britain they are best considered as symptoms of disturbance and land-use change rather than a direct threat to biodiversity.

AB Energy, climate, habitat heterogeneity, and human activity are important correlates of spatial variation in species richness. We examined the correlation between species richness and these variables using the birds that breed in northern Taiwan. We conducted general linear models (GLMs) and spatial correlation models to examine the relationship between bird species richness (BSR) and environmental variables. We found that normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was the most important predictor of BSR. We suggest productivity is the primary process of BSR. Additionally, we hypothesized that scale dependency might exist in the relationship between BSR and NDVI in Taiwan. Human population density, the second most important factor, was inversely correlated with BSR. The factor and BSR did not have similar response to NDVI, which contradicted observations in most of the previous studies on human population vs. species richness. We proposed that the human population density had an effect on NDVI, which in turn had an effect on BSR. Moreover, we hypothesized that the contradiction between our study and the previous studies might arise from a higher level of human disturbance in Taiwan than in other areas. The necessity of conserving native species in intensively developed lowlands of Taiwan cannot be overemphasized. Number of land cover type was another significant predictor of BSR. Habitat heterogeneity may have an effect on BSR in Taiwan.

AB 1. In many animals immunity is not fully developed until adulthood but the young still need protection against various sets of pathogens. Thus, bird nestlings are highly dependent on antibodies received from their mother (in the eggs) during their rapid early growth period. The relationship between maternal immunity and the development of neonates own immunity has been poorly studied.
   2. It has been suggested that immune function plays an important part in mediating resource competition between different life-history traits, e.g. growth and reproduction. Maternal investment of antibodies has potentially permanent effects on offspring phenotype. Thus, the trade-offs between the immune function and other important life-history traits in the offspring will also affect the fitness of the mother.
   3. Our supplemental feeding experiment in the magpie Pica pica indicates that the immunoglobulin levels of offspring at hatching are dependent on a mother's nutritional condition. In addition, the amount of maternal immunoglobulins transferred to offspring increases along the laying order within a nest.
   4. We also found that at the age of 8-10 days the immunoglobulin production of the offspring has already begun. Furthermore, the maternal immunoglobulin levels of the offspring at hatching were positively related to their immunoglobulin levels on day 10.
   5. Maternal immunoglobulins did not significantly affect offspring growth, but there was a negative relationship between self-produced immunoglobulins and growth over the first 10 days, indicating a trade-off between these traits. Nestlings' weight, however, had a positive relationship with immunoglobulin production suggesting that the observed trade-off between growth and immunoglobulin production is due to catch-up growth of nestlings with a low hatching weight. We found that within nests nestlings with higher maternal antibody levels had higher survival rate until day 20, but between nests there was an opposite relationship.
   6. Evidently, there is a trade-off, in magpies, between maternal resources, immune function and growth, shaping the evolution of maternal investment in offspring immunity.

AB Neutral community models embody the idea that individuals are ecologically equivalent, having equal fitness over all environmental conditions, and describe how the spatial dynamics and speciation of such individuals can produce a wide range of patterns of distribution, diversity, and abundance. Neutral models have been controversial, provoking a rush of tests and comments. The debate has been spurred by the suggestion that we should test mechanisms. However, the mechanisms and the spatial scales of interest have never clearly been described, and consequently, the tests have often been only peripherally relevant. At least two mechanisms are present in spatially structured neutral models. Dispersal limitation causes clumping of a species, which increases the strength of intraspecific competition and reduces the strength of interspecific competition. This may prolong coexistence and enhance local and regional diversity. Speciation is present in some neutral models and gives a donor-controlled input of new species, many of which remain rare or are short lived, but which directly add to species diversity. Spatial scale is an important consideration in neutral models. Ecological equivalence and equal fitness have implicit spatial scales because dispersal limitation and its emergent effects operate at population levels, and populations and communities are defined at a chosen spatial scale in recent neutral models; equality is measured relative to a metacommunity, and this necessitates de. ning the spatial scale of that metacommunity. Furthermore, dispersal has its own scales. Thorough empirical tests of neutral models will require both tests of mechanisms and pattern-producing ability, and will involve coupling theoretical models and experiments.

AB 1. The codling moth Cydia poinonella, one of the most important pest insects of apple fruit orchards worldwide, is regarded as a 'sedentary' insect, but the natural populations consist of both mobile and sedentary genotypes that display different dispersal capacity in the field. The current study investigated whether there is a fitness consequence of being mobile in this species by comparing two strains with contrasting levels of mobility obtained through bi-directional selection.
   2. Female moths of the sedentary strain were significantly larger, laid more eggs during their lifespan, and both male and female moths of this strain lived longer, when compared with the mobile strain.
   3. The age-specific fecundity of female moths from the sedentary strain was significantly greater, in particular between 3 and 5 days after emergence when the peaks of both oviposition and flight capacity occur, relative to the mobile moths, thereby leading to a greater reproductive function. 4. These differences resulted in different demographic parameters between the two strains. The sedentary strain had a significantly greater net reproductive rate (R-o) and a higher intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)), although the generation time (7) was similar, hence requiring a shorter time to double the population size, in comparison to the mobile strain.
   5. This study provides empirical evidence for the cost of being mobile in C. poinonella. Trade-offs between mobility and Fitness might have contributed to the existence of genetic variance for dispersal behaviour in the natural populations and the maintenance of relative sedentariness in the species.

AB Trees have a common high elevation distribution limit at similar soil temperatures across the globe. Here we tested whether low temperature in the root zone alone can induce the well known dwarfing at the low temperature growth limit of trees by using a "natural experiment" with trees growing oil low elevation permafrost ground. At the natural high elevation treeline, both air (shoot) and soil (root) temperature are low, while at the montane permafrost site in the Swiss Jura Mountains, roots are cold, but not shoots. Soil temperature records confirmed that the low elevation study site resembles thermal conditions typical for the high elevation treeline. The warm air conditions have no ameliorating effect on tree growth. Irrespective of shoot temperatures, the root zone temperature and the associated metabolism appear to determine tree growth at this site. The test revealed a critical role of soil temperature, which by itself is sufficient to explain it growth limit of trees associated with a seasonal mean soil temperature at 10 cm depth of around 6 degrees C.

AB Eutrophication of the Baltic Sea has become a serious concern in recent decades. To provide a potential means for quality assessments of coastal waters in this area, we collected a data set of 49 embayments in the Gulf of Finland, and explored the relationship between surface sediment diatom assemblages and 15 environmental variables, with special emphasis on nutrients. Total dissolved nitrogen, total phosphorus, depth, and salinity all accounted for significant and independent fractions of variation in the diatom data and explained 34% of the total variation. There were clear changes in diatom assemblage structures along the nutrient gradients. Although these changes were gradual, we could identify a number of taxa that were more abundant in a particular nutrient environment. These taxa could be used as potential indicators of the quality of coastal waters in the Baltic Sea. Diatom assemblages that were least affected by nutrient enrichment included a variety of benthic species and a relatively high species richness. Small planktonic taxa such as Cyclotella atomus Hustedt, Cyclotella meneghiniana Kutzing and Thalassiosira pseudonana Hasle and Heimdal were good indicators of highly elevated nutrient concentrations (> 600 mu g center dot L-1 total dissolved nitrogen and 60 mu g center dot L-1 total phosphorus) together with low species richness. The first appearance of these small planktonic taxa in regular monitoring could be used as an early warning sign for deteriorating water quality. Diatoms could be applied to water quality classification and monitoring purposes in the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea area using techniques such as weighted-averaging regression and calibration.

AB We explore the extent to which inner-city fauna can be enhanced by source areas in periurban zones as a response to a decreasing quality and size of green habitats within cities. The objectives were to get a better understanding of the interaction between animal populations of urban and peri-urban areas, and the role of urban green structures within this relationship, and to find out the extent to which peri-urban areas can contribute to urban animal populations. We illustrate the idea of peri-urban support by using a simulation model for individual animal movement, applied in a particular case-study with butterflies as model species. Results show differences in accessibility of inner-city areas between model butterfly species that differ in mobility. The impact of peri-urban individuals on populations of inner-city habitats differed among several peri-urban source-scenarios: the enlargement of the inner-city butterfly population by peri-urban individuals was determined as 7-36% for 'moderate dispersers' and 19-56% for 'good dispersers'. Results also show that well-connected habitat patches within existing urban green structures were more likely to be visited by peri-urban individuals than isolated habitat patches. We conclude that peri-urban nature areas, if large enough, can have a potentially positive influence on the presence of fauna in inner-city neighborhoods. In addition, results suggest that connectivity between inner-city and peri-urban habitat patches enhances contribution of peri-urban migrants to inner-city populations. By providing a range of different habitats, from inner-city up to peri-urban area, moderately mobile habitat specialists could better compete against the small set of successful habitat generalists that are increasing in urban environments all over the world.

AB From 1976 to 1997 passerines were mist-netted and ringed on the island of Christianso, in the Baltic Sea. Here we present analyses of phenological changes (i.e. time of arrival) for 25 species based on the entire populations of mist-netted songbirds during spring migration. We used two approaches (least square and quantile regression) to test for changes in arrival time of first individuals and three different parts of the songbird populations (i.e. first 5%, 50% and 95% of the total number of trapped individuals corrected for trapping effort). Our results generally confirm earlier spring arrival of migratory passerines with an overall earlier arrival of 0.26 days per year. Changes in the arrival time of first individuals are often the only data available. They are typically analysed on the assumption that they are representative of their respective population. We found a unidirectional, significant change towards earlier arrival for all four measures of arrival timing which seem to support this. However, the four measures of arrival are changing at different rates. First individuals changed arrival time more rapidly than the first 5%, 50% and 95% of the spring total. Such differences are likely to be important for our understanding of population-dynamic changes in relation to climate change. These differences may also have long-term evolutionary consequences. Migration distance seems to affect the degree of change in arrival time, but we found no difference between species wintering in different regions of Africa.

AB This study compares the succession of understorey vegetation at semi-natural and managed mesic sites dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). The area concerned is situated in the middle boreal forest zone on both sides of the border between Finland and Russia. The data were collected at 39 sites representing open/burned, sapling, young, mature and over-mature/old-growth forests. The coverage and number of species representing ground lichens, mosses, liverworts, grasses, herbs, dwarf shrubs and tree seedlings were recorded and analysed separately. The vegetation represented different stages of the succession and management history (managed versus semi-natural).
   The vegetation was ordered along two multivariate (DCA) axes, the first related to successional stage and the second to human influence. The total number of plant species was dependent on the successional stage and the diversity pattern was similar both after semi-natural and man-made disturbance. The plant life-form groups exhibited specific patterns in their occurrence and in their responses to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. The coverage of grasses and dwarf shrubs, in particular, followed quite different patterns after man-made and natural disturbances. Grasses were abundant in managed forests after clear-cutting, but almost absent from young natural forests, while dwarf shrubs occurred more commonly in the old managed forests than in the younger ones. The coverage of seedlings in semi-natural forests peaked in the sapling stage, decreased towards the mature stage and increased again in the old-growth stage, while tree recruitment was relatively low in the older managed successional stages. The results highlight especially the characteristic vegetation features of young natural forests, which differ considerably from the corresponding managed forests. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB 1. In this study we relate variation in lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of male and female house sparrows Passer domesticus to morphological characteristics.
   2. Our analyses demonstrated no sex-specific difference in the distribution of LRS. The variance in LRS was influenced mainly by variation in individual annual reproductive success, and to a lesser extent by variation in individual lifespan.
   3. Phenotypic traits explained a significant proportion of the variation in LRS in males, but not in females. The effect of male morphology on LRS operated mainly through an effect on the number of recruiting daughters.
   4. The size of the patch of black feathers on the chest of males (badge size) and male bill length were both positively associated with LRS. Lifespan and bill length were positively related and reproductive success increased with badge size. In females, number of recruiting daughters was positively related to bill length, body mass and body condition index due to the positive effect of these traits on annual production of daughters.
   5. These results indicate that identifying factors causing the large individual variation in LRS, which is likely to be closely related to fitness, will be important to understand microevolutionary processes in this metapopulation, and hence their demographic feedbacks.

AB Based on data collected during the National Wolf Census in 2000-01, we analysed the main habitat factors influencing the distribution and abundance of the wolf, Canis lupus, in northern Poland. The study region forms the western border of the continuous Eastern European range of wolves, although attempts at westward dispersal have been observed. Using Geographic Information System techniques, we measured nine habitat variables and three parameters related to wolf occurrence in 134 circular sample plots (radius 7 km, area 154 km(2) each). We compared 72 plots where wolves were recorded and 62 plots with no signs of wolf presence. Wolf plots were characterized by significantly higher forest cover, less fragmentation of forests, lower density of villages, towns, motorways, and railways than wolf-free plots. We found a positive correlation between the sum of wolf observations in plots and forest cover. The number of domestic animals killed by wolves was higher in areas with higher indices of wolf abundance and lower forest area. In multiple regression analysis, four independent variables explained 59% of the variation in wolf distribution and abundance in northern Poland: straight-line distance to continuous range of wolves in Eastern Europe; forest cover; forest fragmentation; and length of major motorways. We conclude that protection of wolves in Poland (since 1998) may not be an adequate conservation measure, especially because of the increasing density of highways and express motorways. Existing forest corridors should be protected and new ones should be restored to ensure long-term conservation of wolves and allow range expansion into Western Europe.

AB Surface sediments from 23 lakes on Svalbard were analysed for diatoms. About 182 taxa were found but samples generally have a low richness, with the majority of sites dominated by benthic genera such as Fragilaria, Navicula, and Achnanthes. Centric Cyclotella species occur at only three sites. Modern relationships between diatom abundance and water chemistry and other environmental variables were explored numerically and a preliminary transfer function for pH was developed. Lakes fell into three groups on the basis of their diatom assemblages: (1) high pH, high cation, high conductivity sites characterised by Amphora libyca, (2) shallow sites with relatively high nutrient values characterised by Fragilaria species, and ( 3) more acid and dilute sites with high amounts of snow cover in the catchments characterised by small Achnanthes species and Navicula digitulus. Five sediment cores representing the recent past were also analysed for diatoms. Three shallow sites were dominated by Fragilaria species throughout the period represented by the cores and no shifts in inferred pH were found. At two deeper sites (Arresjoen, Birgervatnet) major assemblage shifts are found which are unrelated to independent evidence for atmospheric contamination. Early (ca. 1200 AD) changes found at both sites are possibly related to the onset of the 'Little Ice Age'. Later changes are neither synchronous nor similar in nature and might be best explained as individual responses to the recovery from the 'Little Ice Age' and subsequent climatic warming.

AB The historical and contemporary population genetic structure of the chickpea Ascochyta blight pathogen, Ascochyta rabiei (teleomorph: Didymella rabiei), was determined in the US Pacific Northwest (PNW) using 17 putative AFLP loci, four genetically characterized, sequence-tagged microsatellite loci (STMS) and the mating type locus (MAT). A single multilocus genotype of A. rabiei (MAT1-1) was detected in 1983, which represented the first recorded appearance of Ascochyta blight of chickpea in the PNW. During the following year many additional alleles, including the other mating type allele (MAT1-2), were detected. By 1987, all alleles currently found in the PNW had been introduced. Highly significant genetic differentiation was detected among contemporary subpopulations from different hosts and geographical locations indicating restricted gene flow and/or genetic drift occurring within and among subpopulations and possible selection by host cultivar. Two distinct populations were inferred with high posterior probability which correlated to host of origin and date of sample using Bayesian model-based population structure analyses of multilocus genotypes. Allele frequencies, genotype distributions and population assignment probabilities were significantly different between the historical and contemporary samples of isolates and between isolates sampled from a resistance screening nursery and those sampled from commercial chickpea fields. A random mating model could not be rejected in any subpopulation, indicating the importance of the sexual stage of the fungus both as a source of primary inoculum for Ascochyta blight epidemics and potentially adaptive genotypic diversity.

AB High diversity in macrobenthos in the deep sea still lacks satisfactory explanation, even if this richness may not be exceptional compared to that in coastal soft sediments. Explanations have assumed a highly ecologically interactive, saturated local community with co-existence controlled by either niche heterogeneity, or spatio-temporal heterogeneity embodying disturbance. All have failed to provide convincing support. Local/regional scale biodiversity relationships support the idea of local richness in macrobenthos being predominantly dependent on the larger, rather local scale. Local-scale ecological interactions seem unlikely to have overriding importance in co-existence of species in the deep sea, even for relatively abundant, 'core' species with wide distributions.
   Variety in observed larger-scale pattern and the strong inter-regional pattern, particularly in the poorly known southern hemisphere, seem to have a pluralistic causation. These include regional-scale barriers and extinctions (e.g., Arctic), and ongoing adaptive zone re-colonisation (e.g., Mediterranean), along with other historical constraints on speciation and migration of species caused by changes in ocean and ocean-basin geometry. At the global scale lack of knowledge of the Antarctic deep sea, for example, blocks coherent understanding of latitudinal species diversity gradients. We need to reconcile emerging understanding of large-scale historical variability in the deep-sea environment-with massive extinctions among microfossil indicators as recently as the Pliocene-to results from cladistic studies indicating ancient lineages, such as asellote isopods, that have evolved entirely within the deep sea.
   The degree to which the great age, diversity, and high degree of endemism in Antarctic shelf benthos, might have enriched biodiversity in the adjacent deep seas basins remains unclear. Basin confluence with the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans may have encouraged northwards dispersion of species from and into the deep Antarctic basins so that any regional identity is superficial. Interpretation of the Antarctic deep sea as a diversity pump for global deep-sea biodiversity may simply reflect re-colonisation, via basin confluence, of northern hemisphere areas impoverished by the consequences of rapid environmental change during the Quaternary.

AB The handicap principle suggests that ornamental traits that function as honest signals in mate selection must be costly to be effective. We evaluated in the sexually monochromatic yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) whether the carotenoid-derived plumage and eye coloration predicts parental quality and whether males and females within pairs mate assortatively in relation to these carotenoid-derived ornaments. In addition, we investigated whether age or body condition was related to the coloration of the ornamental traits. In yellow-eyed penguins, parental quality of males and females was predicted by eye and head plumage coloration. Even when we controlled for gender- and age-specific differences, eye and head plumage coloration reflected honestly parental quality. Males and females mated assortatively in relation to these ornamental traits. While age influenced coloration of both the eye and head plumage, body condition was related only to the saturation of plumage coloration. These results provide evidence that the carotenoid-derived ornaments in yellow-eyed penguins reflect the parental abilities of birds and, therefore, may be costly signals. Potentially, female and male yellow-eyed penguins could use eye and plumage coloration as an indirect cue in assessing age and quality of individual birds during mate choice. This is only the second study to examine plumage coloration in relation to sexual selection in penguins, while conspicuous ornamental traits in other species of penguin beg the question whether they also play a role in sexual selection.

AB At present, coastal disposal of maintenance dredged material constitutes one of the most important problems in coastal zone management and in some coastal areas represents the major anthropogenic disturbance to the benthos. In this review we first propose, based on the classic literature, that macrofaunal communities typical of environmentally stressed habitats are more resilient than those of more environmentally stable habitats, and we outline the macrofaunal successional changes following a disturbance. Second, from a review and analysis of the published and unpublished literature on macrofaunal recovery following maintenance dredged material deposition in the coastal environment, we compare the successional sequences and recovery rates in euhaline and polyhaline systems. The review reveals that invertebrate recovery following dredged material disposal in relatively unstressed marine environments generally takes between 1 and 4 years, while in more naturally stressed areas, recovery is generally achieved within 9 months, although deeper polyhaline habitats can take up to 2 years to recover. Differences in recovery times are attributed to the number of successional stages required to regain the original community composition and that species typical of naturally unstressed assemblages do not possess life-history traits to allow rapid recolonization of disturbances. In the last section of this review, the management implications of these findings are discussed in terms of minimizing dredged material disposal impacts on fisheries resources. Since the natural disturbance regime appears to be very important in determining the response of a benthic community following dredged material disposal, it is recommended that when predicting the potential environmental impact of an operation, the nature of the physical environment in combination with the status (and role) of associated marine benthic communities should be considered.

AB We tested the novel hypothesis that arrival date in migratory birds represents a reliable indicator of male quality that can be used by females as a cue in extrapair mating decisions. Secondary sexual characters are often condition-dependent, and competition for early arrival leads to condition-dependent migration. Hence, both secondary sexual characters and arrival date are predicted to be condition-dependent indicators of male phenotypic quality. We studied the relationship between expression of a secondary sexual character, arrival date, and condition, respectively, and extrapair paternity in a Spanish population of barn swallows, Hirundo rustica. By using microsatellite markers to determine paternity, we showed that 17.8% of all offspring (N = 674) and 32.4% of all broods (N = 170) were due to extrapair paternity. Quasi-parasitism (in which the male nest owner fathered the offspring, but the eggs were laid by another female) occurred in 2.6% of all nestlings and 2.9% of all broods. Individuals were consistent in the frequency of extrapair paternity among first, second, and third broods. Males with long outermost tail feathers, arriving early and in prime body condition, had little extrapair paternity in their nests. This was also the case when controlling for the confounding effects of male age. Partial correlation analysis was used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of tail length, arrival date, and body condition on extrapair paternity. Body condition accounted for most of the variance in extrapair paternity, whereas tail length and arrival date accounted for a smaller proportion of the variance. Body condition was strongly correlated with tail length and arrival date. However, because females cannot directly assess condition or arrival date (males arrive before females), females may obtain an indirect measure of condition and migration ability from tail length and other phenotypic traits of males. This suggests that extrapair paternity depends on the effects of condition, through its indirect effects on arrival date, tail length, and other variables.

AB In a dragonfly survey, carried out in a lowland wetland area in eastern Austria, a total of 19 resident species was recorded. Multivariate statistical procedures were used to analyse the relationship between dragonfly assemblage patterns and environmental variables. Besides widespread and euryoecious species with unspecific habitat requirements two dragonfly associations were identified: on the one hand species mainly occurring at temporary natural and near-natural ponds characterised by rush and reed vegetation, on the other hand species preferring permanent waters such as the artificial waterbodies in the investigation area characterised by floating macrophytes. Water persistence and the existence of floating macrophytes determined the formation of species assemblages.

ID LEAF-AREA INDEX; BOREAL FORESTS; REFLECTANCE; MODEL; RADIATION
AB Current methods for estimating photosynthesis and hence net primary productivity (NPP) of forest ecosystems from remote sensing are based on the relationship between (i) the fraction of incident photosynthetically-active radiation absorbed by the canopy (fPAR) and (ii) spectral indices (e.g. NDVI). However, ground-based estimates of fPAR used to quantify this relationship for a specific vegetation type are derived from measurements of canopy structure only (e.g. using light interception methods such as hemispherical photography). Using a coupled leaf-canopy model of radiative transfer, we demonstrated that NDVI is highly sensitive to both canopy foliar and understorey chlorophyll content, which could account for significant errors in remotely sensed estimates of fPAR and hence NPP.

TI Molecular detection of algal prey in copepod guts and fecal pellets
SO LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS
LA English
DT Article
AB The ability to obtain information about feeding selectivity and rates in situ for key organisms such as copepods and other zooplankton is vital for understanding the mechanisms structuring marine ecosystems. Copepods feed on a wide range of prey, and there are presently no methods available to directly quantify zooplankton feeding on all different prey types in situ. Therefore, the development of a new nonintrusive direct method is necessary to gain a better understanding of the trophic interactions in aquatic ecosystems. Molecular methods based on the polymerase chain reaction have recently become an important tool to study predation by arthropods, particularly insects. Here we present the first results of successful molecular detection of a specific prey consumed by calanoid copepods from gut and fecal material. Using the calanoid copepod species Calanus finmarchicus consuming the haptophyte alga Emiliania huxleyi as a model system, 18S ribosomal DNA originating from E. huxleyi was unambiguously detected in whole DNA extracts from copepods and from their fecal pellets. The results also suggest that prey DNA may be quantified for determination of prey-specific zooplankton feeding rates. However, significantly more research under controlled laboratory and field conditions will be required to achieve these objectives. We hypothesize that molecular methods will become an important tool with the potential to quantify undisturbed trophic interactions between individual predators and all their prey in the complex natural plankton.

AB Aim To determine the empirical relationships between species richness and spatial turnover in species composition across spatial scales. These have remained little explored despite the fact that such relationships are fundamental to understanding spatial diversity patterns.
   Location South-east Scotland.
   Methods Defining local species richness simply as the total number of species at a finer resolution than regional species richness and spatial turnover as turnover in species identity between any two or more areas, we determined the empirical relationships between all three, and the influence of spatial scale upon them, using data on breeding bird distributions. We estimated spatial turnover using a measure independent of species richness gradients, a fundamental feature which has been neglected in theoretical studies.
   Results Local species richness and spatial turnover exhibited a negative relationship, which became stronger as larger neighbourhood sizes were considered in estimating the latter. Spatial turnover and regional species richness did not show any significant relationship, suggesting that spatial species replacement occurs independently of the size of the regional species pool. Local and regional species richness only showed the expected positive relationship when the size of the local scale was relatively large in relation to the regional scale.
   Conclusions Explanations for the relationships between spatial turnover and local and regional species richness can be found in the spatial patterns of species commonality, gain and loss between areas.

AB We challenge the paradigm of natural tree line formation in the equatorial Andes with an alternate view that incorporates the human dimension. We present both direct and indirect evidence of anthropogenic influences on cloud forest tree line location; these human influences should be incorporated in definitions of Andean tree lines as (1) the extensification of grassland for grazing and potato cultivation for the upper limit, and (2) the intensification of the agricultural frontier, fuelwood gathering, and timber extraction for the lower limit. Although we do not claim to fully debunk the prevalent paradigm of tree line dynamics (which is descriptive, depends on the natural sciences, and sees tree lines as physically controlled), we hope to achieve increased recognition for a challenging alternate view of tropical tree lines as functional, resource-use dependent, and human-driven. Management plans and overall tropical montane cloud forest conservation strategies need to consider this new perspective and incorporate a proactive and assertive approach toward restoration of Andean forests in a way that will encourage landscape diversity in tropical mountain ecoregions.

AB The Grebenka flora, from the main exposure of the Albian-Cenomanian Krivorechenskaya Formation in northeastern Russia, represents a range of plant communities from pioneer to mature forest that grew close to the mid-Cretaceous North Pole (> 72degreesN). The diversity of this flora is dominated by angiosperms followed by conifers, ferns and other plant groups. The age is constrained by Ar-40/Ar-39 analyses of associated volcaniclastics (similar to 96.5 Ma), coupled with biostratigraphic correlation of the plant-bearing non-marine beds with marine units of the Krivorechenskaya Formation and the overlying Dugovskaya Formation. Limited palaeosol development and pronounced episodic floodplain aggradation indicate that the 100-m-thick plant-bearing volcaniclastic floodplain succession was deposited rapidly, resulting in excellent trapping and preservation of the plant communities, but dilution of the palynoflora. Analysis of the megaflora (> 100 foliage taxa, plus woods and fructifications) provides a 'snapshot' of the mid-Cretaceous climate, and offers reliable quantitative climatic signals of conditions near the mid-Cretaceous North Pole. Multivariate analysis of leaf physiognomy (Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program) on the whole flora suggests that the plants experienced a mean annual temperature of 13.0 +/- 1.8degreesC and a cold month mean temperature of 5.5 +/- 3.3degreesC. However, analyses of individual florules yield slightly different results that help constrain the uncertainties inherent in such an approach. These and other foliar physiognomic data are compared across the Arctic. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB 1. Overgrazing by exotic herbivores has a widespread impact on plant communities. We used the removal of exotic European rabbits, goats and donkeys from the San Benito Islands, Mexico, as an experimental manipulation to examine the importance of top-down and bottom-up processes in the impact and recovery of an island plant community.
   2. Using a paired approach, we removed herbivores from one island, while they remained temporarily on an adjacent, similar island. We combined this large-scale manipulation with smaller-scale mechanistic experiments: herbivore food-preference trials and herbivore exclosures on the control island.
   3. El Nino-related precipitation dominated vegetation dynamics early in the study. Differences in plant community structure due to selective herbivory between the experimental and control islands were detectable in the second year. Results from food-preference trials accurately predicted changes in the perennial plant community. When herbivores were removed from the experimental island, the abundance of their preferred plants increased while unpalatable species decreased. On the control island (herbivores present), we observed the opposite trend. However, we saw no recovery of vegetation inside the exclosures on the control island, constructed after the El Nino rains, probably due to the absence of rainfall.
   4. While the relationship between herbivore food preference and changes in plant cover is strong evidence of a top-down effect by exotic species, the influence of El Nino precipitation highlights the importance of bottom-up factors, such as water availability, in the recovery of and plant communities from long-term disturbance.

AB There have been few investigations of the number of founding Sources and amount of genetic variability that lead to a successful nonindigenous species invasion, although genetic diversity is believed to play a central role. In the present study, population genetic structure, diversity arid divergence patterns were analysed for the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha [n = 280 samples and 63 putative randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDs) gene loci] and the quagga mussel D. bugensis (n = 136 arid 52 loci) from 10 nonindigenous North American and six Eurasian sampling sites, representing their present-day ranges. Results showed that exotic populations of zebra and quagga mussels had surprisingly high genetic variability, similar to those in the Eurasian Populations, suggesting large numbers of founding individuals and consistent with the hypothesis of multiple colonizations. Patterns of genetic relationships indicate that the North American populations of D. polymorpha likely were founded by multiple source populations from north-western arid northcentral Europe, but not from southcentral or eastern Europe. Sampling areas within North America also were significantly divergent, having levels of gene flow and migration about twice those separating long-established Eurasian populations. Samples of D. bugensis in Lakes Eric and Ontario were significantly different, with the former being more closely related to a native population from the Dnieper River, Ukraine. No evidence for a founder effect was discerned for either species.

AB In order to assess changes in the community structure of ectomycorrhizal fungi across the tree line, data on distributions of fungi and their host plants, as well as on edaphic factors and stand age, were collected at two montane sites in the Front Range of the Canadian Rockies. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to explore relationships between fungal species composition and environmental factors. Richness and diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi decreased with elevation, in spite of the fact that host plant diversity was highest at the ecotone between the subalpine forest and the alpine zone. Both host plant distribution and edaphic factors were important in explaining the observed changes in fungal species diversity and composition. The majority of ectomycorrhizal fungi found in the subalpine forest and at the ecotone were conifer associates, while a large proportion of those in the alpine zone were non-host specific and able to form mycorrhizae with both angiosperms and gymnosperms. The abundance of non-host specific fungi in the alpine zone is expected to provide a favorable environment for the establishment of conifer seedlings above the present tree line.

AB Aim Relationships between diatom distribution, composition, species richness and environmental variables in lakes in Arctic Lapland were explored with particular attention to temperature.
   Location Transect in northern Fennoscandia (66 degrees 92-69 degrees 27) spanning boreal coniferous forest to treeless tundra along an altitudinal gradient of 108-1024 m a.s.l.
   Methods Surface-sediment diatom assemblages and 22 physical and chemical limnological variables from 64 lakes were determined. Ordination techniques (PCA, DCA, CCA) and associated Monte Carlo permutation tests were used to identify the main environmental parameters controlling the distribution of the diatom taxa. Temperature optima and tolerances were estimated by weighted averaging (WA) regression. Diversity indices and cluster analysis were used to discover patterns in biodiversity and composition of diatom assemblages along the vegetational and altitudinal gradients.
   Results A total of 370 diatom taxa representing 40 genera were recorded, most of which were periphytic species. Lake-water pH, calcium, sediment organic content, mean July temperature, and total organic carbon (TOC) were identified as the most important environmental variables in explaining the diatom distributions. Lakes located in the middle of the temperature gradient (i.e. mountain birch woodland in the 'forest-tundra' transition zone) was found to have the highest species diversity. The temperatures at around 13 degreesC (approximate to 300 m a.s.l) and at around 9.5 degreesC (approximate to 750 m a.s.l.) were identified as the major biotic boundaries.
   Main conclusions Our results indicate that distribution, composition and species diversity of diatoms are markedly regulated by temperature and other climate-related factors in ecotonal waters. Ecological boundary areas are highlighted as important areas for maintaining biodiversity. The overall results lend support to the concept of 'aquatic ecotone'.

AB A management strategy developed for field margins to reduce pesticide drift to non-target areas and to promote biodiversity on arable land was investigated. It involved not spraying herbicides and pesticides in a strip 3 or 6 m wide on the edges of winter wheat, sugar beet and potato crops. This strategy was compared with spraying the edges. The effects on pesticide drift, arable flora, invertebrates, vertebrates, costs and acceptance by the farmer were studied. This article reviews the most important results.
   Interviews with farmers showed that field margins were sprayed intensively. Drift measurements demonstrated that creating unsprayed buffer zones of 3 m width is a very effective way of reducing pesticide drift to the ditches demarcating the field (drift is reduced by about 95%) and risks to aquatic organisms. The presence and abundance of plants associated with arable farming increased substantially in the unsprayed edges, as did the floristic value of the vegetation. The impact on epigeic soil invertebrates was relatively minor. However, there was a pronounced effect on phytophage insects. The number of visits to the unsprayed edges by Motacilla flava flava, an insectivorous bird, also increased. A cost-benefit analysis based on the yield losses showed that it is very feasible to incorporate unsprayed crop edges in the cultivation of winter wheat and potatoes. In sugar beet, however, the cost is too high, However, for reasons to do with agronomy, farming equipment and socio-psychology, farmers will accept unsprayed cereal edges or grass strips but not unsprayed potato edges. From their perspective the most important aspect for acceptance in farming practice is a flexible width of the unsprayed crop edges. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new procedure to investigate the relationship between bacterial cell size and activity at the cellular level has been developed; it is based on the coupling of radioactive labeling of bacterial cells and cell sorting by flow cytometry after SYTO 13 staining. Before sorting, bacterial cells were incubated in the presence of tritiated leucine using a procedure similar to that used for measuring bacterial production by leucine incorporation and then stained with SYTO 13. Subpopulations of bacterial cells were sorted according to their average right-angle light scatter (RALS) and fluorescence. Average RALS was shown to be significantly related to the average biovolume. Experiments were performed on samples collected at different times in a Mediterranean seawater mesocosm enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus. At four sampling times, bacteria were sorted in two subpopulations (cells smaller and larger than 0.25 mu m(3)). The results indicate that, at each sampling time, the growth rate of larger cells was higher than that of smaller cells. In order to confirm this tendency, cell sorting was performed on six subpopulations differing in average biovolume during the mesocosm follow-up. A clear increase of the bacterial growth rates was observed with increasing cell size for the conditions mel in this enriched mesocosm.

AB The meiobenthos along a depth transect of oligotrophic sediments in the Arctic Laptev Sea was studied. The meiobenthos followed the general trends reported from other studies: densities decreased with depth in relation to the more limited supply of degradable organic matter at greater depths. Although the sediments along the transect were poor in organic matter in comparison with the NE Atlantic, the densities fitted well with the meiobenthic densities reported from the latter area. It is suggested that the meiobenthos in the cold polar waters is adapted to this extreme environment by a rapid response to short food pulses to the sediments. Nematodes were identified up to genus level and assigned to trophic groups. A total of 32 families comprising 95 genera were found along the transect. The communities were dominated by deposit feeders whose importance increased with depth. Both TWINSPAN and CCA analyses revealed a community shift along the depth transect: a shelf community dominated by Microlaimus and Chromadora could be distinguished from a slope community dominated by Monhystera and Leptolaimus. Generic diversity decreased with depth.

AB Macrophyte recolonization after two major flood disturbances (winter 1990 and autumn 1991) was studied for 3 years in 11 contiguous permanent quadrats located along a transect from one bank to the other across a former channel of the Rhone River. Floods induced changes in substrate grain-size from fine to coarser sediment and swept away all the plants present before disturbance. Re-establishment of species started on or near the banks in fine sediment areas that can act as refuges for propagules during disturbance or as regeneration niches for propagules brought in by floods. From the banks, the species expanded towards the center of the channel in coarse sediment. The transect was fully colonized by macrophytes the second year after a major flood. All these species, as well as those observed before the 1990 flood, can be considered as pioneer species adapted to frequent disturbances. Information identified from personal previous observations and collected in literature concerning selected species traits was analysed statistically using a fuzzy-coding technique and confronted with date of re-establishment of each species after disturbance. Species composition before disturbance and selected species traits allow us to predict species composition in disturbed areas. The first species to re-establish were able to produce turions or other non-subterranean vegetative organs. Species that disseminate both by lateral spread and regeneration by stem fragments re-establish later, before helophytes that also disseminate by lateral spread but flower each year.

AB Feeding habits of pine marten Martes martes (Linnaeus, 1758) were studied in 1985 - 1992 in the pristine forests of Bialowieza National Park, eastern Poland, The study covered 5 years of moderate numbers of forest rodents and 2 years of outbreak and crash. In 1735 analysed seats, rodents (Clethrionomys glareolus, Apodemus flavicollis, and Microtus sp.) were staple food for martens, constituting from 50% of biomass consumed in June to over 90% in October - November, Birds (mainly thrushes and woodpeckers) were captured by martens mainly in spring and summer (up to 37% biomass in June). Vegetable matter (Rubus berries, Sorus aucuparia fruit, mushrooms) was frequently eaten in July - October (up to 17% biomass in September). Ungulate carcasses were scavenged in winter. Marten preferred the remains of wolf and lynx kills and avoided ungulates that had died from undernutrition and/or disease. Between-year variation in marten diet was shaped by variation in rodent (especially bank vole) numbers. Percent of bank vole biomass in marten diet in autumn-winter was determined by the summer-autumn numbers of these rodents. Martens' consumption of mice in the cold season did not reflect the changes in mouse numbers, but it was positively correlated with their preying on bank voles. Spring numbers of mice determined the percentage of biomass of mice in marten diet in spring-summer. Snow cover significantly decreased martens' preying on C. glareolus, but not A. flavicollis and Microtus sp. In the cold season, insectivores and ungulate carcasses were crucial alternative food for the pine marten and they compensated for the decreased availability of rodents. In spring and summer, birds and fruit were alternative food, the consumption of which negatively correlated with the consumption of rodents. Snowtracking showed that in their search for prey, martens utilized both fallen and standing trees, and moved on the ground as well as in the forest canopy. Over 90% of all recorded attacks were on rodents. Marten attacked rodents 4.1 times/km of trail but 35% of attacks failed.

AB (1) Field surveys of mosquito larval sites on the Pacific coastal plain and foothill regions of southern Chiapas, Mexico were carried out in the dry and wet seasons of 1988.  The sites were a priori classified into nine habitat categories.  At each site, samples for the two principal malaria vectors, Anopheles albimanus Wiedemann and A. pseudopunctipennis Theobald, were taken and seventeen environmental factors were measured or estimated.
   (2) Canonical correspondence analysis combined with a Monte Carlo permutation test revealed significant dependence of mosquito larval occurrence on environmental factors and habitat categories in the dry season and on environmental factors only in the wet season.
   (3) G-test of independence and association index Q indicated a positive association between the habitat category 'flooded or irrigated pastures' and A. albimanus occurrence in both seasons, and positive association between 'estuaries' and A. albimanus occurrence in the dry season.  The occurrence of A. albimanus was negatively associated with the habitat category 'foothills' in both seasons, and negatively associated with the category 'estuaries' in the wet season.
   (4) In the dry season, the abundance of phytoplankton and cover of floating macrophytes were significantly greater for sampling sites where A. albimanus was present.  Concentrations of K+, Ca2+ and PO4-P and amount of phytoplankton were significantly higher and the amount of filamentous algae significantly lower for A. albimanus positive sites in the wet season.  Altitude and the amount of filamentous algae were significantly higher, and Na+ concentration was significantly lower for sampling sites positive for A. pseudopunctipennis in the dry season.  In the wet season, the mean abundance of filamentous algae in sites with A. pseudopunctipennis was significantly higher than in sites where this species was absent.
   (5) In general, the habitat classification used seems to have higher predictive power in the dry season than in the wet season, and several quantified environmental factors appear promising as predictors of anopheline larval occurrence in both seasons.

TI ELUCIDATION OF SOIL LANDFORM INTERRELATIONSHIPS BY CANONICAL ORDINATION
   ANALYSIS
SO GEODERMA
LA English
DT Article
ID GRADIENT ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; TOPOGRAPHY; MODELS
AB This paper examines the robustness of various multivariate ordination methods applied to elucidate the relationship between soil developed on hillslope and the environment in a South Australian subcatchment. Canonical correspondence analyses were found to be less attractive than the linear methods (i.e., principal component analysis and redundancy analysis) because interrelations among soil variables and/or between soil and the landform attributes are more linear than unimodal. Among the linear methods, standard redundancy analysis following transformation of soil data gave a clearer insight into pedogenetic implications of soil-landform interactions.
   Gradient angle, plan convexity, profile convexity and to a lesser extent, upslope distance and area, account for much of the soil variation in the study area. Gradient influences the distribution of surficial soil particles which is suggestive of selective removal and deposition of fine materials on the mid-to lower-slopes. Higher subsoil clay percentage associated with concave slopes may be ascribed to either increased weathering rate and/or flux of fine material due to convergence of water flows. Solum depth and depth to bedrock also appeared to have controlled some of the contemporary pedo-geomorphological processes. Eluvio-illuvial processes are more pronounced in the relatively deep lower-slope pedons evidenced by cutans in their subsoil layers. Soil colours are related to the soil depth attributes, slope and upslope distance and area, probably through the influence of these attributes on soil drainage condition. The extent to which landform and parent-material related attributes (e.g., depth to bedrock) affect soil development and distribution patterns in the study area is shown quantitatively. These findings have considerably improved our understanding of soil genesis in the study area and also point to the importance of land unit delineation to design sampling patterns. The enhanced sampling design would be beneficial in terms of reduced extrapolation error and thus misclassification of soil.

AB Climate warming may lower environmental resource levels, growth, and fitness of many ectotherms. In a classic experiment, Brett and colleagues documented that growth rates of salmon depended strikingly on both temperature and food levels. Here we develop a simple bioenergetic model that explores how fixed temperatures and food jointly alter the thermal sensitivity of net energy gain. The model incorporates differing thermal sensitivities of energy intake and metabolism. In qualitative agreement with Brett's results, it predicts that decreased food intake reduces growth rates, lowers optimal temperatures for growth, and lowers the highest temperatures sustaining growth (upper thermal limit). Consequently, ectotherms facing reduced food intake in warm environments should restrict activity to times when low body temperatures are biophysically feasible, but-in a warming world-that will force ectotherms to shorten activity times and thus further reduce food intake. This "metabolic meltdown" is a consequence of declining energy intake coupled with accelerating metabolic costs at high temperatures and with warming-imposed restrictions on activity. Next, we extend the model to explore how increasing mean environmental temperatures alter the thermal sensitivity of growth: when food intake is reduced, optimal temperatures and upper thermal limits for growth are lowered. We discuss our model's key assumptions and caveats as well as its relationship to a recent model for phytoplankton. Both models illustrate that the deleterious impacts of climate warming on ectotherms will be amplified if food intake is also reduced, either because warming reduces standing food resources or because it restricts foraging time.

AB Community assembly process (determinism vs stochasticity) determines the composition and diversity of a microbial community, and then shapes its functions. Understanding this complex process and its relationship to the community functions becomes a very important task for the applications of microbial biotechnology. In this study, we applied microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) with moderate species numbers and easily tractable functions as a model ecosystem, and constructed a series of biofilm communities with gradient biodiversity to examine the roles of community assembly in determining microbial community structure and functions. After stable biofilms formed, the best MEC reactor performances (e.g., gas productivity, total energy efficiency) were achieved in the group in which biofilms had the second highest a-diversity, and biofilms with even lower diversity showed declining performance. Null model analyses indicated that both deterministic and stochastic assembly played roles in the formation of biofilm communities. When deterministic assembly dominates this formation, the higher diversity of the biofilm community would generally show better reactor performance. However, when the stochasticity dominates the assembly process, the bioreactor performance would decline. This study provides novel evidence that the assembly mechanism could be one of the key processes to shift the functions, and proposes an important guidance for selecting the most efficient microorganisms for environmental biotechnologies.

AB The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is key to plant nutrition, and hence is potentially key in sustainable agriculture. Fertilization and other agricultural practices reduce soil AM fungi and root colonization. Such conditions might promote the evolution of low mycorrhizal responsive crops. Therefore, we ask if and how evolution under domestication has altered AM symbioses of crops. We measured the effect of domestication on mycorrhizal responsiveness across 27 crop species and their wild progenitors. Additionally, in a subset of 14 crops, we tested if domestication effects differed under contrasting phosphorus (P) availabilities. The response of AM symbiosis to domestication varied with P availability. On average, wild progenitors benefited from the AM symbiosis irrespective of P availability, while domesticated crops only profited under P-limited conditions. Magnitudes and directions of response were diverse among the 27 crops, and were unrelated to phylogenetic affinities or to the coordinated evolution with fine root traits. Our results indicate disruptions in the efficiency of the AM symbiosis linked to domestication. Under high fertilization, domestication could have altered the regulation of resource trafficking between AM fungi and associated plant hosts. Provided that crops are commonly raised under high fertilization, this result has important implications for sustainable agriculture.

AB Agriculture, during its millenarian history, had contributed to shape impressive cultural landscapes; however, in recent decades, many of these have been lost or degraded because of widespread intensification or abandonment. Low-intensive agricultural landscapes are of utmost importance for biodiversity conservation and the delivery of cultural ecosystem services.
   We worked in a cultural landscape shaped by viticulture (in Trentino, Italy), which recently underwent a widespread intensification. We explicitly quantified two cultural services (aesthetic and cultural heritage values), and the biodiversity (bird species richness) associated with this landscape at 24 sampling sites. We then related these variables with the territory density of an indicator/flagship bird species, the common redstart. Finally, we assessed redstart ecological requirements at the territory scale. We aimed to define an appealing strategy combining biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service delivery in the cultural landscapes.
   Redstart density was positively related with avian species richness and landscape aesthetic value, the latter being related with the cultural heritage value. Redstart occurrence was positively associated with hedge and tree rows, dry-stone walls, marginal habitats, and the compositional diversity of the land-cover.
   We concluded that managing the agricultural landscape to maintain aesthetic and heritage values, which primarily means conserving and enhancing its key 'traditional' traits, would favour an indicator/flagship species and likely the wider bird diversity. It will also promote the heritage and recreational value of the landscape itself, underlining the importance of the synergistic integration of multiple conservation targets into a combined strategy.

AB Robust tools are needed to prioritise the management of invasive non-native species (INNS). Risk assessment is commonly used to prioritise INNS, but fails to take into account the feasibility of management. Risk management provides a structured evaluation of management options, but has received little attention to date. We present a risk management scheme to assess the feasibility of eradicating INNS that can be used, in conjunction with existing risk assessment schemes, to support prioritisation. The Non-Native Risk Management scheme (NNRM) can be applied to any predefined area and any taxa. It uses semi-quantitative response and confidence scores to assess seven key criteria: Effectiveness, Practicality, Cost, Impact, Acceptability, Window of opportunity and Likelihood of re-invasion. Scores are elicited using expert judgement, supported by available evidence, and consensus-building methods. We applied the NNRM to forty-one INNS that threaten Great Britain (GB). Thirty-three experts provided scores, with overall feasibility of eradication assessed as 'very high' (8 species), 'high' (6), 'medium' (8), 'low' (10) and 'very low' (9). The feasibility of eradicating terrestrial species was higher than aquatic species. Lotic freshwater and marine species scored particularly low. Combining risk management and existing risk assessment scores identified six established species as priorities for eradication. A further six species that are not yet established were identified as priorities for eradication on arrival as part of contingency planning. The NNRM is one of the first INNS risk management schemes that can be used with existing risk assessments to prioritise INNS eradication in any area.

AB Gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) in tropical forests varies both with the environment and with biotic changes in photosynthetic infrastructure, but our understanding of the relative effects of these factors across timescales is limited. Here, we used a statistical model to partition the variability of seven years of eddy covariance-derived GEP in a central Amazon evergreen forest into two main causes: variation in environmental drivers (solar radiation, diffuse light fraction, and vapor pressure deficit) that interact with model parameters that govern photosynthesis and biotic variation in canopy photosynthetic light-use efficiency associated with changes in the parameters themselves. Our fitted model was able to explain most of the variability in GEP at hourly (R-2 = 0.77) to interannual (R-2 = 0.80) timescales. At hourly timescales, we found that 75% of observed GEP variability could be attributed to environmental variability. When aggregating GEP to the longer timescales (daily, monthly, and yearly), however, environmental variation explained progressively less GEP variability: At monthly timescales, it explained only 3%, much less than biotic variation in canopy photosynthetic light-use efficiency, which accounted for 63%. These results challenge modeling approaches that assume GEP is primarily controlled by the environment at both short and long timescales. Our approach distinguishing biotic from environmental variability can help to resolve debates about environmental limitations to tropical forest photosynthesis. For example, we found that biotically regulated canopy photosynthetic lightuse efficiency (associated with leaf phenology) increased with sunlight during dry seasons (consistent with light but not water limitation of canopy development) but that realized GEP was nonetheless lower relative to its potential efficiency during dry than wet seasons (consistent with water limitation of photosynthesis in given assemblages of leaves). This work highlights the importance of accounting for differential regulation of GEP at different timescales and of identifying the underlying feedbacks and adaptive mechanisms.

AB 1. Model scenarios of climate change predict that warming and drought will occur simultaneously in the future in many regions. The capacity of woody species to modify their physiology and morphology in response to environmental conditions is widely recognized, but little is known about the responses of trees to reduced precipitation and increased temperature acting simultaneously.
   2. In a semi-arid woodland, we assessed the responses in physiological (needle emergence, maximum photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency (WUE) and shoot elongation) and morphological (needle length and thickness, and leaf mass per area (LMA)) foliar traits of pinon pine (Pinus edulis) in response to three years of a 45% reduction in precipitation, a 4.8 degrees C increase in air temperature and their simultaneous effects.
   3. A strong change in physiological and morphological traits in response to reduced precipitation was observed. Precipitation reduction delayed needle emergence, decreased photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, increased WUE, decreased shoot elongation and induced shorter needles with a higher LMA. Trees subjected to simultaneous reductions in precipitation and warming demonstrated a similar response. However, atmospheric warming did not induce a response in any of the measured traits.
   4. Physiological and morphological traits of trees in this semi-arid climate were more responsive to changes in soil moisture than air temperature. Long-term exposure to seasonal drought stress in arid sites may have resulted in strong plastic responses to this first stressor. However, atmospheric warming probably was not experienced as a stress for trees in this warm and dry climate. Overall, our results indicate that in semi-arid ecosystems where tree functioning is already highly limited by soil water availability, atmospheric warming as anticipated with climate change may have less impact on foliar trait responses than previously thought.

TI Participation for effective environmental governance? Evidence from

AB Effectiveness of participation in environmental governance is a proliferating assertion in literature that is also reflected in European legislation, such as the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). The Directive mandates participatory river basin management planning across the EU aiming at the delivery of better policy outputs and enhanced implementation. Yet, the impact of this planning mode in WFD implementation remains unclear, though the first planning phase was completed in 2009 and the first implementation cycle by the end of 2015. Notwithstanding the expanding body of literature on WFD implementation, a rather scattered single case study approach seems to predominate. This paper reports on implementation of the WFD in three case studies from Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, reflecting three substantially different approaches to participatory river basin management planning, on the basis of a comparative case study design. We ask if and how participation improved the environ-mental standard of outputs and the quality of implementation. We found an increasing quality of outputs with increasing intensity of local participation. Further, social outcomes such as learning occurred within dialogical settings, whereas empowerment and network building emerged also in the case characterized mainly by one-way information. Finally, one important finding deviant from the literature is that stakeholder acceptance seems to be more related to processes than to outputs. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Assessing ecosystem health is an ongoing priority for governments, scientists and managers worldwide. There are several decades of scientific literature discussing ecosystem health and approaches to assess it, with applications to aquatic and terrestrial environments incorporating economic, environmental and social processes. We conducted a systematic review of studies that assess ecosystem health to update our current understanding of how ecosystem health is being defined, and provide new ideas and directions on how it can be measured. We focused the review on studies that used the term 'ecosystem health' or the equivalent terms 'ecosystem integrity', 'ecosystem quality' and 'ecosystem protection', in lotic freshwater and estuarine environments, and examined how many of these included explicit definitions of what ecosystem health means for their study system. We collected information about the temporal and geographical distribution of studies, and the types of indicators (biological, physical or chemical) used in the assessments. We found few studies clearly defined ecosystem health and justified the choice of indicators. Given the broad use of the term it seems impractical to have an overarching definition of ecosystem health, but rather an approach that is able to define and measure health on a case by case basis. A combination of biological, physical and chemical indicators was commonly used to assess ecosystem health in both estuarine and freshwater studies, with a strong bias towards fish and macroinvertebrate community metrics (e.g. diversity, abundance and composition). We found only two studies that simultaneously considered both freshwater and estuarine sections of the ecosystem, highlighting the significant knowledge gap in our understanding of the transfer of flow, nutrients and biota between the different systems all key factors that influence ecosystem health. This review is the first to combine knowledge from both freshwater and estuarine ecosystem assessments and critically review how aquatic ecosystem health is defined and measured since the late-1990s, providing the basis for setting achievable management goals relating to ecosystem health into the future.

AB Birds have arguably been the most intensely studied animal group for their phylogenetic relationships. However, the recent advent of genome-scale phylogenomics has made the forest of bird phylogenies even more complex and confusing. Here, in this perspective piece, I show that most parts of the avian Tree of Life are now firmly established as reproducible phylogenetic hypotheses. This is to the exception of the deepest relationships among Neoaves. Using phylogenetic networks and simulations, I argue that the very onset of the super-rapid neoavian radiation is irresolvable because of eight near-simultaneous speciation events. Such a hard polytomy of nine taxa translates into 2 027 025 possible rooted bifurcating trees. Accordingly, recent genome-scale phylogenies show extremely complex conflicts in this (and only this) part of the avian Tree of Life. I predict that the upcoming years of avian phylogenomics will witness many more, highly conflicting tree topologies regarding the early neoavian polytomy. I further caution against bootstrapping in the era of genomics and suggest to instead use reproducibility (e.g. independent methods or data types) as support for phylogenetic hypotheses. The early neoavian polytomy coincides with the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction and is, to my knowledge, the first empirical example of a hard polytomy.

AB In river systems, aquatic invertebrate communities are surprisingly persistent over time and generally recover quickly from disturbances. Drift has long been viewed as the primary process promoting this resilience, and it plays a important role in predictive models of community composition and concepts in lotic ecology. More recently, other processes such as vertical migration from the hyporheic zone, aerial oviposition from distant refuges and the use of resistance forms (e.g. diapause) have received greater recognition and support for their importance. In this study, the view that drift is the primary process promoting invertebrate community resilience was challenged in an intermittent alluvial river using reach-scale flow manipulations. First, six treatment channels were completely dried for 1week, while three others were left flowing to be used as controls. Second, flow was re-established in channels and drift was either allowed or blocked for a 4-week period. Third, during this period the resilience of community structure, composition and function was compared between treatments, and the potential for colonisation from the drift, hyporheic zone, aerial oviposition and resistance forms was measured. Communities recovered after only 2weeks in all of the previously dried channels, and contrary to our hypotheses, invertebrate community structure, composition and functional trait composition were not altered by blocking drift, indicating it was not the primary process promoting resilience in this river. Three lines of evidence suggested colonisation from the hyporheic zone and not aerial oviposition nor resistance forms promoted resilience following rewetting including the following: (i) finding all common benthic taxa in the hyporheic zone during the drying event, (ii) a distinct decrease in invertebrate size upon rewetting in all treatment channels and (iii) a negative correlation between resilience and water table depth. This experiment highlighted the potential importance of the hyporheic zone as a key source of colonisation in alluvial rivers and emphasises the need for a three-dimensional perspective when considering community resilience in rivers. Adaptive management approaches are needed to direct attention to sources (e.g. hyporheic zone) that are essential to promoting community resilience in rivers facing increased pressures due to climate change, water abstraction and flow regime alteration.

AB The complex inner mechanisms that create typical conifer tree-ring structure (i.e. the transition from large, thin-walled earlywood cells to narrow, thick-walled latewood cells) were recently unraveled. However, what physiological or environmental factors drive xylogenesis key processes remain unclear. Here, we aim to quantify the influence of seasonal variations in climatic factors on the spectacular changes in the kinetics of wood cell differentiation and in the resulting treering structure. Wood formation was monitored in three sites over 3 years for three coniferous species (Norway spruce [Picea abies], Scots pine [Pinus sylvestris], and silver fir [Abies alba]). Cell differentiation rates and durations were calculated and related to tracheid final dimensions and corresponding climatic conditions. On the one hand, we found that the kinetics of cell enlargement and the final size of the tracheids were not explained by the seasonal changes in climatic factors. On the other hand, decreasing temperatures strongly constrained cell wall deposition rates during latewood formation. However, the influence of temperature was permanently written into tree-ring structure only for the very last latewood cells, when the collapse of the rate of wall deposition was no longer counterbalanced by the increase of its duration. Our results show that the formation of the typical conifer tree-ring structure, in normal climatic conditions, is only marginally driven by climate, suggesting strong developmental control of xylogenesis. The late breakage of the compensatory mechanism at work in the wall deposition process appears as a clue to understand the capacity of the maximum latewood density to record past temperature conditions.

AB To assess the biogeophysical impacts of land cover/land use change (LCLUC) on surface temperature, two observation-based metrics and their applicability in climate modeling were explored in this study. Both metrics were developed based on the surface energy balance, and provided insight into the contribution of different aspects of land surface change (such as albedo, surface roughness, net radiation and surface heat fluxes) to changing climate. A revision of the first metric, the intrinsic biophysical mechanism, can be used to distinguish the direct and indirect effects of LCLUC on surface temperature. The other, a decomposed temperature metric, gives a straightforward depiction of separate contributions of all components of the surface energy balance. These two metrics well capture observed and model simulated surface temperature changes in response to LCLUC. Results from paired FLUXNET sites and land surface model sensitivity experiments indicate that surface roughness effects usually dominate the direct biogeophysical feedback of LCLUC, while other effects play a secondary role. However, coupled climate model experiments show that these direct effects can be attenuated by large scale atmospheric changes (indirect feedbacks). When applied to real-time transient LCLUC experiments, the metrics also demonstrate usefulness for assessing the performance of climate models and quantifying land-atmosphere interactions in response to LCLUC.

AB Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands in certain areas of Central Europe have experienced substantial dieback since the 1970s. Understanding the reasons for this decline and reexamining the response of forests to acid deposition reduction remains challenging because of a lack of long and well-replicated tree-ring width chronologies. Here, spruce from a subalpine area heavily affected by acid deposition (from both sulfur and nitrogen compounds) is evaluated. Tree-ring width measurements from 98 trees between 1000 and 1350 m above sea level (a.s.l.) reflected significant May-July temperature signals. Since the 1970s, acid deposition has reduced the growth-climate relationship. Efficient pollution control together with a warmer but not drier climate most likely caused the increased growth of spruce stands in this region, the so-called "Black Triangle," in the 1990s.

AB One of the few rules in ecology is that communities are composed of many rare and few common species. Trait-based investigations of abundance distributions have generally focused on species-mean trait values with mixed success. Here, using large tropical tree seedling datasets in China and Puerto Rico, we take an alternative approach that considers the magnitude of intraspecific variation in traits and growth as it relates to species abundance. We find that common species are less variable in their traits and growth. Common species also occupy core positions within community trait space indicating that they are finely tuned for the available conditions. Rare species are functionally peripheral and are likely transients struggling for success in the given environment. The work highlights the importance of considering intraspecific variation in trait-based ecology and demonstrates asymmetry in the magnitude of intraspecific variation among species is critical for understanding of how traits are related to abundance.

AB Both environmental filtering and dispersal filtering are known to influence plant species distribution patterns and biodiversity. Particularly in dynamic habitats, however, it remains unclear whether environmental filtering (stimulated by stressful conditions) or dispersal filtering (during recolonization events) dominates in community assembly, or how they interact. Such a fundamental understanding of community assembly is critical to the design of biodiversity conservation and restoration strategies.
   Stream riparian zones are species-rich dynamic habitats. They are characterized by steep hydrological gradients likely to promote environmental filtering, and by spatiotemporal variation in the arrival of propagules likely to promote dispersal filtering. We quantified the contributions of both filters by monitoring natural seed arrival (dispersal filter) and experimentally assessing germination, seedling survival and growth of 17 riparian plant species (environmental filter) along riparian gradients of three lowland streams that were excavated to bare substrate for restoration. Subsequently, we related spatial patterns in each process to species distribution and diversity patterns after 1 and 2years of succession.
   Patterns in initial seed arrival were very clearly reflected in species distribution patterns in the developing vegetation and were more significant than environmental filtering. However, environmental filtering intensified towards the wet end of the riparian gradient, particularly through effects of flooding on survival and growth, which strongly affected community diversity and generated a gradient in the vegetation. Strikingly, patterns in seed arrival foreshadowed the gradient that developed in the vegetation; seeds of species with adult optima at wetter conditions dominated seed arrival at low elevations along the riparian gradient, while seeds of species with drier optima arrived higher up. Despite previous assertions suggesting a dominance of environmental filtering, our results demonstrate that non-random dispersal may be an important driver of early successional riparian vegetation zonation and biodiversity patterns as well.
   Synthesis. Our results demonstrate (and quantify) the strong roles of both environmental and dispersal filtering in determining plant community assemblies in early successional dynamic habitats. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dispersal filtering can already initiate vegetation gradients, a mechanism that may have been overlooked along many environmental gradients where interspecific interactions are (temporarily) reduced.

AB Horizontal gene transfer is central to microbial evolution, because it enables genetic regions to spread horizontally through diverse communities. However, how gene transfer exerts such a strong effect is not understood. Here we develop an eco-evolutionary model and show how genetic transfer, even when rare, can transform the evolution and ecology of microbes. We recapitulate existing models, which suggest that asexual reproduction will overpower horizontal transfer and greatly limit its effects. We then show that allowing immigration completely changes these predictions. With migration, the rates and impacts of horizontal transfer are greatly increased, and transfer is most frequent for loci under positive natural selection. Our analysis explains how ecologically important loci can sweep through competing strains and species. In this way, microbial genomes can evolve to become ecologically diverse where different genomic regions encode for partially overlapping, but distinct, ecologies. Under these conditions ecological species do not exist, because genes, not species, inhabit niches.

AB Modern microbial mats can provide key insights into early Earth ecosystems, and Shark Bay, Australia, holds one of the best examples of these systems. Identifying the spatial distribution of microorganisms with mat depth facilitates a greater understanding of specific niches and potentially novel microbial interactions. High throughput sequencing coupled with elemental analyses and biogeochemical measurements of two distinct mat types (smooth and pustular) at a millimeter scale were undertaken in the present study. A total of 8,263,982 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained, which were affiliated to 58 bacterial and candidate phyla. The surface of both mats were dominated by Cyanobacteria, accompanied with known or putative members of Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The deeper anoxic layers of smooth mats were dominated by Chloroflexi, while Alphaproteobacteria dominated the lower layers of pustular mats. In situ microelectrode measurements revealed smooth mats have a steeper profile of O-2 and H2S concentrations, as well as higher oxygen production, consumption, and sulfate reduction rates. Specific elements (Mo, Mg, Mn, Fe, V, P) could be correlated with specific mat types and putative phylogenetic groups. Models are proposed for these systems suggesting putative surface anoxic niches, differential nitrogen fixing niches, and those coupled with methane metabolism.

AB Species distribution models (SDMs) are an important tool in biogeography and phylogeography studies, that most often require explicit absence information to adequately model the environmental space on which species can potentially inhabit. In the so-called background pseudo-absences approach, absence locations are simulated in order to obtain a complete sample of the environment. Whilst the commonest approach is random sampling of the entire study region, in its multiple variants, its performance may not be optimal, and the method of generation of pseudo-absences is known to have a significant influence on the results obtained. Here, we compare a suite of classic (random sampling) and novel methods for pseudo-absence data generation and propose a generalizable three-step method combining environmental profiling with a new technique for background extent restriction. To this aim, we consider 11 phylogenetic groups of Oak (Quercus sp.) described in Europe. We evaluate the influence of different pseudo-absence types on model performance (area under the ROC curve), calibration (reliability diagrams) and the resulting suitability maps, using a cross-validation approach. Regardless of the modelling algorithm used, random-sampling models were outperformed by the methods that incorporate environmental profiling of the background, stressing the importance of the pseudo-absence generation techniques for the development of accurate and reliable SDMs. We also provide an integrated modelling framework implementing the methods tested in a software package for the open source R environment.

AB Changes in species richness and distributions of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal communities along altitudinal gradients have been attributed to changes in both host distributions and abiotic variables. However, few studies have considered altitudinal relationships of ECM fungi associated with a single host to identify the role of abiotic drivers. To address this, ECM fungal communities associated with one host were assessed along five altitudinal transects in Scotland. Roots of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) were collected from sites between 300 and 550-600m altitude, and ECM fungal communities were identified by 454 pyrosequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Soil moisture, temperature, pH, carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio and organic matter content were measured as potential predictors of fungal species richness and community composition. Altitude did not affect species richness of ECM fungal communities, but strongly influenced fungal community composition. Shifts in community composition along the altitudinal gradient were most clearly related to changes in soil moisture and temperature. Our results show that a 300m altitudinal gradient produced distinct shifts in ECM fungal communities associated with a single host, and that this pattern was strongly related to climatic variables. This finding suggests significant climatic niche partitioning among ECM fungal species.

AB Adaptive management is broadly recognized as critical for managing natural resources, yet in practice it often fails to achieve intended results for two main reasons: insufficient monitoring and inadequate stakeholder buy-in. Citizen science is gaining momentum as an approach that can inform natural resource management and has some promise for solving the problems faced by adaptive management. Based on adaptive management literature, we developed a set of criteria for successfully addressing monitoring and stakeholder related failures in adaptive management and then used these criteria to evaluate 83 citizen science case studies from peer-reviewed literature. The results suggest that citizen science can be a cost-effective method to collect essential monitoring information and can also produce the high levels of citizen engagement that are vital to the adaptive management learning process. The analysis also provides a set of recommendations for citizen science program design that addresses spatial and temporal scale, data quality, costs, and effective incentives to facilitate participation and integration of findings into adaptive management.

AB We review the phylogeny, sperm competition, morphology, physiology, and fertilization environments of the sperm of externally fertilizing fish and amphibians. Increased sperm competition in both fish and anurans generally increases sperm numbers, sperm length, and energy reserves. The difference between the internal osmolarity and iconicity of sperm cells and those of the aquatic medium control the activation, longevity, and velocity of sperm motility. Hypo-osmolarity of the aquatic medium activates the motility of freshwater fish and amphibian sperm and hyperosmolarity activates the motility of marine fish sperm. The average longevity of the motility of marine fish sperm (similar to 550 seconds) was significantly (P < 0.05) greater than that of freshwater fish sperm (similar to 150 seconds), with the longevities of both marine and freshwater fish being significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that of anuran sperm (similar to 4100 seconds). The average velocity of anuran sperm (25 mu m/s) was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that of marine fish (140 mu m/s) or freshwater fish (135 mu m/s) sperm. The longevity of the sperm of giant salamanders (Cryptobranchoidea) of approximately 600 seconds was greater than that of freshwater fish sperm but much lower than anuran sperm. Our research and information from the literature showed that higher osmolarities promote greater longevity in anuran sperm, and some freshwater fish sperm, and that anuran and cryptobranchid sperm maintained membrane integrity long after the cessation of motility, demonstrating a preferential sharing of energy reserves toward the maintenance of membrane integrity. The maintenance of the membrane integrity of anuran sperm in fresh water for up to 6 hours showed an extremely high osmotic tolerance relative to fish sperm. The very high longevity and osmotic tolerance of anuran sperm and high longevity of cryptobranchid sperm, relative to those of freshwater fish, may reflect the complex fertilization history of amphibian sperm in general and anurans reversion from internal to external fertilization. Our findings provide a greater understanding of the reproductive biology of externally fertilizing fish and amphibians, and a biological foundation for the further development of reproduction technologies for their sustainable management.

TI Carnivores, culture and 'contagious conflict': Multiple factors

ID HUMAN-WILDLIFE CONFLICT; LIONS PANTHERA-LEO; CONSERVATION; DEPREDATION;
   IMPACT
AB Resolving human-wildlife conflict is a conservation priority, but effective mitigation requires in-depth understanding of the complexity and relative importance of conflict drivers. We conducted 262 semi-structured interviews with villagers around Tanzania's Ruaha National Park. The surveys provided data on respondents' perceived problems with wildlife, knowledge, reported killing of carnivores, and their socio-economic characteristics. 98.5% of people perceived a problem with wildlife, and respondents viewed large carnivores as significantly more problematic than other species, due to the threats they posed to livestock and humans. Despite this, only 7.3% of people admitted to having killed any large carnivores. Depredation was widespread, having affected 61.1% of households, but was less important than other forms of stock loss - monthly recall data revealed 1.2% of stock were predated, compared to 9.1% lost to disease and 2.8% to theft. Although experience of depredation significantly predicted negative attitudes towards carnivores, it was not the most important factor. The study raises the possibility of 'contagious conflict', where perceived problems with one group of species were strongly associated with perceived problems with others. Furthermore, factors such as ethnic group and religious beliefs were significant predictors of perceived problems. This study suggests that effective conflict mitigation should involve measures to improve attitudes towards a broad range of species, rather than a single taxon, and that action should be taken to also address the social and cultural drivers of conflict, rather than merely focusing upon reducing wildlife damage.

AB Historically, Florida soils stored the largest amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) among the conterminous U.S. states (2.26 Pg). This region experienced rapid land use/land cover (LULC) shifts and climate change in the past decades. The effects of these changes on SOC sequestration are unknown. The objectives of this study were to 1) investigate the change in SOC stocks in Florida to determine if soils have acted as a net sink or net source for carbon (C) over the past four decades and 2) identify the concomitant effects of LULC, LULC change, and climate on the SOC change. A total of 1080 sites were sampled in the topsoil (0-20 cm) between 2008 and 2009 representing the current SOC stocks, 194 of which were selected to collocate with historical sites (n = 1251) from the Florida Soil Characterization Database (1965-1996) for direct comparison. Results show that SOC stocks significantly differed among LULC classes - sugarcane and wetland contained the highest SOC, followed by improved pasture, urban, mesic upland forest, rangeland, and pineland while crop, citrus and xeric upland forest remained the lowest. The surface 20 cm soils acted as a net sink for C with the median SOC significantly increasing from 2.69 to 3.40 kg m(-2) over the past decades. The SOC sequestration rate was LULC dependent and controlled by climate factors interacting with LULC. Higher temperature tended to accelerate SOC accumulation, while higher precipitation reduced the SOC sequestration rate. Land use/land cover change observed over the past four decades also favored the C sequestration in soils due to the increase in the C-rich wetland area by similar to 140% and decrease in the C-poor agricultural area by similar to 20%. Soils are likely to provide a substantial soil C sink considering the climate and LULC projections for this region. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increased biodiversity may improve ecosystem services, including herbage yield. A mixture experiment was carried out at five sites in Northern Europe and one in Canada to investigate whether mixtures of grasses and legumes would give higher herbage yield than monocultures. Resistance of the mixtures to weed invasion and nutritive value of the herbage were also investigated. The experimental layout followed a simplex design, where four species differing in specific functional traits, timothy (Phleum pratense L.), smooth meadow grass (Poa pratensis L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.), were grown in monocultures and eleven different mixtures with systematically varying proportions of the four species. Positive diversity effects (DE) were observed, leading to greater herbage dry-matter (DM) yield in mixtures than expected from species sown in monocultures. For centroid mixtures, the DE generated on average an additional 32, 25 and 21% of the DM yield than would be expected from the monocultures in the first, second and third year respectively. On average, the mixtures were 9, 15 and 7% more productive than the most productive monoculture (transgressive overyielding) in the first, second and third year respectively. These benefits persisted over the three harvest years of the experiment and were consistent among most sites. This positive effect was not accompanied by a reduction in herbage digestibility and crude protein concentration that is usually observed with increased DM yield. Mixtures also reduced the invasion of weeds to <5% of herbage yield compared to monocultures (10-60% of herbage yield).

AB AimNortherly shifts, related to recent climate warming, have been observed in the distributions of taxa in many ecosystems and ecological roles. However, significant variation occurs among species in the magnitude of these shifts. Few studies have investigated the effects of climate warming on the distributions of freshwater species.
   LocationA total of 1527 lakes across Ontario, Canada.
   MethodsWe used contemporary and historical survey data to examine the relationships between species occurrences and climate and to measure the magnitude and direction of northern range-boundary shifts in 13 warm and coolwater freshwater fishes. We also tested whether range-boundary shifts differed between baitfishes and sportfishes. We then related differences in species range-boundary shifts to species traits including those related to dispersal, reproduction and ecological niche breadth.
   ResultsMany fishes are now more likely to occur in lakes where climate was historically limiting. Sportfish northern range boundaries shifted northward significantly over nearly 30years at a rate of approximately 12.9-17.5km per decade depending on the measure used; in contrast, baitfish northern range boundaries often shifted southward. Also, species traits explained much of the variation in species range boundaries.
   Main conclusionsThe northern range boundaries of warm and coolwater sportfishes in Ontario lakes appear to be shifting northward as expected based on observed climate warming. These species are shifting at rates comparable with taxa in marine and terrestrial ecosystems around the globe. In contrast to expectations, the northern range boundaries of small-bodied baitfishes appear to often contract southward. Differences in range shifts by sportfishes and baitfishes may be related to dispersal, particularly by anglers and/or their ecological roles. Understanding the range-boundary shifts underway in Ontario lake communities will help predict future shifts by freshwater fishes.

AB Peatlands are important sinks for atmospheric carbon (C), yet the role of plant functional types (PFTs) for C sequestration under climatic perturbations is still unclear. A plant-removal experiment was used to study the importance of vascular PFTs for the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) during (i.e., resistance) and after (i.e., recovery) an experimental drought. The removal of PFTs caused a decrease of NEE, but the rate differed between microhabitats (i.e., hummocks and lawns) and the type of PFTs. Ericoid removal had a large effect on NEE in hummocks, while the graminoids played a major role in the lawns. The removal of PFTs did not affect the resistance or the recovery after the experimental drought. We argue that the response of Sphagnum mosses (the only PFT present in all treatments) to drought is dominant over that of coexisting PFTs. However, we observed that the moment in time when the system switched from C sink to C source during the drought was controlled by the vascular PFTs. In the light of climate change, the shifts in species composition or even the loss of certain PFTs are expected to strongly affect the future C dynamics in response to environmental stress.

AB Tree species are predicted to track future climate by shifting their geographic distributions, but climate-mediated migrations are not apparent in a recent continental-scale analysis. To better understand the mechanisms of a possible migration lag, we analyzed relative recruitment patterns by comparing juvenile and adult tree abundances in climate space. One would expect relative recruitment to be higher in cold and dry climates as a result of tree migration with juveniles located further poleward than adults. Alternatively, relative recruitment could be higher in warm and wet climates as a result of higher tree population turnover with increased temperature and precipitation. Using the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis data at regional scales, we jointly modeled juvenile and adult abundance distributions for 65 tree species in climate space of the eastern United States. We directly compared the optimal climate conditions for juveniles and adults, identified the climates where each species has high relative recruitment, and synthesized relative recruitment patterns across species. Results suggest that for 77% and 83% of the tree species, juveniles have higher optimal temperature and optimal precipitation, respectively, than adults. Across species, the relative recruitment pattern is dominated by relatively more abundant juveniles than adults in warm and wet climates. These different abundance-climate responses through life history are consistent with faster population turnover and inconsistent with the geographic trend of large-scale tree migration. Taken together, this juvenile-adult analysis suggests that tree species might respond to climate change by having faster turnover as dynamics accelerate with longer growing seasons and higher temperatures, before there is evidence of poleward migration at biogeographic scales.

AB Resource exploitation of patches is influenced not simply by the rate of root production in the patches but also by the lifespan of the roots inhabiting the patches. We examined the effect of sustained localized nitrogen (N) fertilization on root lifespan in four tree species that varied widely in root morphology and presumed foraging strategy. The study was conducted in a 12-year-old common garden in central Pennsylvania using a combination of data from minirhizotron and root in-growth cores. The two fine-root tree species, Acer negundo L. and Populus tremuloides Michx., exhibited significant increases in root lifespan with local N fertilization; no significant responses were observed in the two coarse-root tree species, Sassafras albidum Nutt. and Liriodendron tulipifera L. Across species, coarse-root tree species had longer median root lifespan than fine-root tree species. Localized N fertilization did not significantly increase the N concentration or the respiration of the roots growing in the N-rich patch. Our results suggest that some plant species appear to regulate the lifespan of different portions of their root system to improve resource acquisition while other species do not. Our results are discussed in the context of different strategies of foraging of nutrient patches in species of different root morphology.

AB Organisms living in urban environments are exposed to different environmental conditions compared to their rural conspecifics. Especially anthropogenic noise and artificial night light are closely linked to urbanization and pose new challenges to urban species. Songbirds are particularly affected by these factors, because they rely on the spread of acoustic information and adjust their behaviour to the rhythm of night and day, e. g. time their dawn song according to changing light intensities. Our aim was to clarify the specific contributions of artificial night light and traffic noise on the timing of dawn song of urban European Blackbirds (Turdus merula). We investigated the onset of blackbird dawn song along a steep urban gradient ranging from an urban forest to the city centre of Leipzig, Germany. This gradient of anthropogenic noise and artificial night light was reflected in the timing of dawn song. In the city centre, blackbirds started their dawn song up to 5 hours earlier compared to those in semi-natural habitats. We found traffic noise to be the driving factor of the shift of dawn song into true night, although it was not completely separable from the effects of ambient night light. We additionally included meteorological conditions into the analysis and found an effect on the song onset. Cloudy and cold weather delayed the onset, but cloud cover was assumed to reflect night light emissions, thus, amplified sky luminance and increased the effect of artificial night light. Beside these temporal effects, we also found differences in the spatial autocorrelation of dawn song onset showing a much higher variability in noisy city areas than in rural parks and forests. These findings indicate that urban hazards such as ambient noise and light pollution show a manifold interference with naturally evolved cycles and have significant effects on the activity patterns of urban blackbirds.

AB Tropical forests are intimately linked to atmospheric CO2 levels through their significant capacity for uptake and storage of carbon (C) in biomass and soils. Increasing pressure of deforestation and forest degradation is begging the question as to what extent land use changes will affect C storage and release in tropical areas. Hitherto, many research efforts focused on aboveground C stocks in lowland tropical forests, but a considerable amount of C is stored in tropical soils as well. Some previous studies suggested that soil C storage increases with increasing altitude, while others found no relation with altitude. In this study, we addressed this controversy by quantifying soil organic C (SOC) stocks along an altitudinal gradient spanning a 3000 m altitude difference. In addition, we sampled soils in anthropogenic grasslands in proximity to forests at different altitudes to provide information on effects of land use change. Soil was sampled on 92 forest locations down to 100 cm depth in forest plots, and down to 30 cm in 13 grassland plots. We found that forest SOC stocks varied predictably with altitude in our study area, ranging between 4.8 and 19.4 kgC m(-2) and increasing by 5.1 kgC m(-2) per 1000 m increase in altitude. Soil properties (pH, bulk density, depth) and soil forming processes played an important role in this relationship with altitude. SOC stocks were not significantly different between forests and grasslands along the gradient in our study, due to a higher soil density in grasslands. When grassland SOC stocks were corrected for this difference in soil density, forest soils contained a significantly greater amount of C. In addition, while this difference was negligible at low altitudes, it tended to increase with increasing altitude. This study suggests that montane tropical forest soils consistently contain larger amounts of C compared to lowland tropical forests, and that conversion of forest to grasslands at higher altitudes might lead to larger soil C losses than previously expected.

AB Aim It is hypothesized that the ecological niches of polyploids should be both distinct and broader than those of diploids - characteristics that might have allowed the successful colonization of open habitats by polyploids during the Pleistocene glacial cycles. Here, we test these hypotheses by quantifying and comparing the ecological niches and niche breadths of a group of European primroses. Location Europe. Methods We gathered georeferenced data of four related species in Primula sect. Aleuritia at different ploidy levels (diploid, tetraploid, hexaploid and octoploid) and used seven bioclimatic variables to quantify niche overlap between species by applying a series of univariate and multivariate analyses combined with modelling techniques. We also employed permutation-based tests to evaluate niche similarity between the four species. Niche breadth for each species was evaluated both in the multivariate environmental space and in geographical space. Results The four species differed significantly from each other in mono-dimensional comparisons of climatological variables and occupied distinct habitats in the multi-dimensional environmental space. The majority of the permutation-based tests either indicated that the four species differed significantly in their habitat preferences and ecological niches or did not support significant niche similarity. Furthermore, our results revealed narrower niche breadths and geographical ranges in species of P. sect. Aleuritia at higher ploidy levels. Main conclusions The detected ecological differentiation between the four species of P. sect. Aleuritia at different ploidy levels is consistent with the hypothesis that polyploids occupy distinct ecological niches that differ from those of their diploid relative. Contrary to expectations, we find that polyploid species of P. sect. Aleuritia occupy narrower environmental and geographical spaces than their diploid relative. These results on the ecological niches of closely related polyploid and diploid species highlight factors that potentially contribute to the evolution and distribution of polyploid species.

AB The utility of species distribution models for applications in invasion and global change biology is critically dependent on their transferability between regions or points in time, respectively. We introduce two methods that aim to improve the transferability of presence-only models: density-based occurrence thinning and performance-based predictor selection. We evaluate the effect of these methods along with the impact of the choice of model complexity and geographic background on the transferability of a species distribution model between geographic regions. Our multifactorial experiment focuses on the notorious invasive seaweed Caulerpa cylindracea (previously Caulerpa racemosa var. cylindracea) and uses Maxent, a commonly used presence-only modeling technique. We show that model transferability is markedly improved by appropriate predictor selection, with occurrence thinning, model complexity and background choice having relatively minor effects. The data shows that, if available, occurrence records from the native and invaded regions should be combined as this leads to models with high predictive power while reducing the sensitivity to choices made in the modeling process. The inferred distribution model of Caulerpa cylindracea shows the potential for this species to further spread along the coasts of Western Europe, western Africa and the south coast of Australia.

AB Large-scale cattle and crop production are the primary drivers of deforestation in the Amazon today. Such land-use changes can degrade stream ecosystems by reducing connectivity, changing light and nutrient inputs, and altering the quantity and quality of streamwater. This study integrates field data from 12 catchments with satellite-derived information for the 176 000 km(2) upper Xingu watershed (Mato Grosso, Brazil). We quantify recent land-use transitions and evaluate the influence of land management on streamwater temperature, an important determinant of habitat quality in small streams. By 2010, over 40 per cent of catchments outside protected areas were dominated (greater than 60% of area) by agriculture, with an estimated 10 000 impoundments in the upper Xingu. Streams in pasture and soya bean watersheds were significantly warmer than those in forested watersheds, with average daily maxima over 4 degrees C higher in pasture and 3 degrees C higher in soya bean. The upstream density of impoundments and riparian forest cover accounted for 43 per cent of the variation in temperature. Scaling up, our model suggests that management practices associated with recent agricultural expansion may have already increased headwater stream temperatures across the Xingu. Although increased temperatures could negatively impact stream biota, conserving or restoring riparian buffers could reduce predicted warming by as much as fivefold.

AB Roads have been associated with behavioral and physiological changes in wildlife. In birds, roads decrease reproductive success and biodiversity and increase physiological stress. Although the consequences of roads on individuals and communities have been well described, the mechanisms through which roads affect birds remain largely unexplored. Here, we examine one mechanism through which roads could affect birds: traffic noise. We exposed nestling mountain white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys oriantha) to experimentally elevated traffic noise for 5. days during the nestling period. Following exposure to traffic noise we measured nestling stress physiology, immune function, body size, condition and survival. Based on prior studies, we expected the traffic noise treatment to result in elevated stress hormones (glucocorticoids), and declines in immune function, body size, condition and survival. Surprisingly, nestlings exposed to traffic noise had lower glucocorticoid levels and improved condition relative to control nests. These results indicate that traffic noise does affect physiology and development in white-crowned sparrows, but not at all as predicted. Therefore, when evaluating the mechanisms through which roads affect avian populations, other factors (e.g. edge effects, pollution and mechanical vibration) may be more important than traffic noise in explaining elevated nestling stress responses in this species.

AB While data like HJ-1 CCD images have advantageous spatial characteristics for describing crop properties, the temporal resolution of the data is rather low, which can be easily made worse by cloud contamination. In contrast, although Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) can only achieve a spatial resolution of 250 m in its normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) product, it has a high temporal resolution, covering the Earth up to multiple times per day. To combine the high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution of different data sources, a new method (Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Vegetation index Fusion Model [STAVFM]) for blending NDVI of different spatial and temporal resolutions to produce high spatialtemporal resolution NDVI datasets was developed based on Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM). STAVFM defines a time window according to the temporal variation of crops, takes crop phenophase into consideration and improves the temporal weighting algorithm. The result showed that the new method can combine the temporal information of MODIS NDVI and spatial difference information of HJ-1 CCD NDVI to generate an NDVI dataset with both high spatial and high temporal resolution. An application of the generated NDVI dataset in crop biomass estimation was provided. An average absolute error of 17.2% was achieved. The estimated winter wheat biomass correlated well with observed biomass (R-2 of 0.876). We conclude that the new dataset will improve the application of crop biomass estimation by describing the crop biomass accumulation in detail. There is potential to apply the approach in many other studies, including crop production estimation, crop growth monitoring and agricultural ecosystem carbon cycle research, which will contribute to the implementation of Digital Earth by describing land surface processes in detail.

AB Aim To forecast the potential effects of climate change in the Mediterranean Sea on the species richness and mean body size of coastal fish assemblages. Location The Mediterranean Sea. Methods Using an ensemble forecasting approach, we used species distribution modelling to project the potential distribution of 288 coastal fish species by the middle and end of the 21st century based on the IPCC A2 scenario implemented with the Mediterranean climatic model NEMOMED8. Results A mean rise of 1.4 degrees C was projected for the Mediterranean Sea by the middle of the 21st century and 2.8 degrees C by the end of the 21st century. Projections for the end of the century suggest that: (1) 54 species are expected to lose their climatically suitable habitat, (2) species richness was predicted to decrease across 70.4% of the continental shelf area, especially in the western Mediterranean Sea and several parts of the Aegean Sea, and (3) mean fish body size would increase over 74.8% of the continental shelf area. Small-bodied species that are not targeted by either commercial or recreational fleets presented, on average, the highest predicted decrease in geographic range size. Main conclusions Projected climate change in the Mediterranean Sea may have deleterious effects on coastal fish diversity, including a significant loss of climatically suitable habitat for endemic fish species. In addition, climate change may contribute to the loss of small and low trophic-level fishes, which may have ecosystem-wide impacts by reducing food supply to larger and higher trophic-level species. Fishing pressure is already selectively removing large-bodied species from marine ecosystems, and so fishing and climatic change might act in tandem to drive both direct and secondary extinctions.

AB Genome rearrangements are associated with eukaryotic evolutionary processes ranging from tumorigenesis to speciation. Rearrangements are especially common following interspecific hybridization, and some of these could be expected to have strong selective value. To test this expectation we created de novo interspecific yeast hybrids between two diverged but largely syntenic Saccharomyces species, S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum, then experimentally evolved them under continuous ammonium limitation. We discovered that a characteristic interspecific genome rearrangement arose multiple times in independently evolved populations. We uncovered nine different breakpoints, all occurring in a narrow similar to 1-kb region of chromosome 14, and all producing an "interspecific fusion junction" within the MEP2 gene coding sequence, such that the 59 portion derives from S. cerevisiae and the 39 portion derives from S. uvarum. In most cases the rearrangements altered both chromosomes, resulting in what can be considered to be an introgression of a several-kb region of S. uvarum into an otherwise intact S. cerevisiae chromosome 14, while the homeologous S. uvarum chromosome 14 experienced an interspecific reciprocal translocation at the same breakpoint within MEP2, yielding a chimaeric chromosome; these events result in the presence in the cell of two MEP2 fusion genes having identical breakpoints. Given that MEP2 encodes for a high-affinity ammonium permease, that MEP2 fusion genes arise repeatedly under ammonium-limitation, and that three independent evolved isolates carrying MEP2 fusion genes are each more fit than their common ancestor, the novel MEP2 fusion genes are very likely adaptive under ammonium limitation. Our results suggest that, when homoploid hybrids form, the admixture of two genomes enables swift and otherwise unavailable evolutionary innovations. Furthermore, the architecture of the MEP2 rearrangement suggests a model for rapid introgression, a phenomenon seen in numerous eukaryotic phyla, that does not require repeated backcrossing to one of the parental species.

AB Tree ring based temperature reconstructions form the scientific backbone of the current global change debate. Although some European records extend into medieval times, high-resolution, long-term, regional-scale paleoclimatic evidence is missing for the eastern part of the continent. Here we compile 545 samples of living trees and historical timbers from the greater Tatra region to reconstruct interannual to centennial-long variations in Eastern European May June temperature back to 1040 AD. Recent anthropogenic warming exceeds the range of past natural climate variability. Increased plague outbreaks and political conflicts, as well as decreased settlement activities, coincided with temperature depressions. The Black Death in the mid-14th century, the Thirty Years War in the early 17th century, and the French Invasion of Russia in the early 19th century all occurred during the coldest episodes of the last millennium. A comparison with summer temperature reconstructions from Scandinavia, the Alps, and the Pyrenees emphasizes the seasonal and spatial specificity of our results, questioning those large-scale reconstructions that simply average individual sites.

AB Managing multiple parks, reserves, and conservation areas collectively as conservation networks is a recent, yet growing trend. But in order for these networks to be ecologically viable, the functional connectivity of the landscape must be ensured. We assessed the connectivity between six African savanna elephant populations in southern Africa to test whether existing conservation networks were functioning and to identify other areas that could benefit from being managed as conservation networks. We used resource selection function models to create an index of habitat selection by males and female elephants. We employed this habitat use index as a resistance surface, and applied circuit theory to assess connectivity between adjacent elephant populations within six clusters of protected areas across southern Africa. Circuit theory current flow maps predicted a high likelihood of connectivity in the central portion of our study area (i.e. between the Chobe, Kafue, Luangwa, and Zambezi cluster). Main factors limiting connectivity across the study area were high human density in the east and a lack of surface water in the west. These factors effectively isolate elephants in the Etosha cluster in Namibia and Niassa clusters in Mozambique from the central region. Our models further identified two clusters where elephants might benefit from being managed as part of a conservation network, (1) northern Zambia and Malawi and (2) northern Mozambique. We conclude that using habitat selection and circuit theory models to identify conservation networks is a data-based method that can be applied to other focal species to identify and conserve functional connectivity.

ID BETA-DIVERSITY; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; SUBSET PATTERNS; ARCHITECTURE;
   COMPONENTS; FRAMEWORK; TURNOVER; ALPHA
AB The ecological concepts of nestedness and beta-diversity first appeared more than five decades ago, but there is still controversy over their precise meaning and application. Here, we focus on the concept of nestedness, the ordered loss of species along environmental or ecological gradients. Because there is no species replacement if the distribution of species among a number of sites is perfectly nested, some studies have defined nestedness as the inverse of species turnover. We argue that such a redefinition relies on a misinterpretation of the original concept of nestedness as the inverse of species replacement. Such a narrow interpretation might result in misleading conclusions about the mechanisms regulating species distribution patterns. We argue, in particular, that any quantification of nestedness must be as explicit as possible about the gradient to be analyzed.

AB Wildfires subject soil microbes to extreme temperatures and modify their physical and chemical habitat. This might immediately alter their community structure and ecosystem functions. We burned a fire-prone shrubland under controlled conditions to investigate (1) the fire-induced changes in the community structure of soil archaea, bacteria and fungi by analysing 16S or 18S rRNA gene amplicons separated through denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; (2) the physical and chemical variables determining the immediate shifts in the microbial community structure; and (3) the microbial drivers of the change in ecosystem functions related to biogeochemical cycling. Prokaryotes and eukaryotes were structured by the local environment in pre-fire soils. Fire caused a significant shift in the microbial community structure, biomass C, respiration and soil hydrolases. One-day changes in bacterial and fungal community structure correlated to the rise in total organic C and NO (3) (-) -N caused by the combustion of plant residues. In the following week, bacterial communities shifted further forced by desiccation and increasing concentrations of macronutrients. Shifts in archaeal community structure were unrelated to any of the 18 environmental variables measured. Fire-induced changes in the community structure of bacteria, rather than archaea or fungi, were correlated to the enhanced microbial biomass, CO2 production and hydrolysis of C and P organics. This is the first report on the combined effects of fire on the three biological domains in soils. We concluded that immediately after fire the biogeochemical cycling in Mediterranean shrublands becomes less conservative through the increased microbial biomass, activity and changes in the bacterial community structure.

AB A hatchling reptile's sex, body size and shape, and locomotor performance can be influenced not only by its genes, but also by the temperature that it experiences during incubation. Can incubation temperature also affect a hatchling's cognitive skills? In the scincid lizard Bassiana duperreyi, higher incubation temperatures enhanced the resultant hatchling's learning performance. Hence, factors such as maternal nest-site selection and climate change affect not only the size, shape and athletic abilities of hatchling reptiles, but also their ability to learn novel tasks.

AB Suture zones represent natural forums in which to examine the role of geography and ecology in the speciation process. Here, we conduct a comparative analysis designed to investigate the location of avian phylogeographic breaks and contact zones in the Guiana Shield, northern Amazonia. We use distributional and genetic data from 78 pairs of avian taxa to address whether phylogeographic breaks and contact zones are associated with contemporary landscape features. Using spatially explicit statistical models, we found that phylogeographic breaks and contact zones are not randomly distributed throughout the landscape. In general, geographic breaks cluster along physical barriers (rivers, nonforested habitats, and small mountain ranges), whereas contact zones aggregate where these barriers either break down or are easier to overcome, such as around rivers' headwaters. Our results indicate that although major Amazonian rivers are often key determinants of taxon boundaries, the "riverine barrier effect" is a synergistic consequence of the wide lower reaches of some rivers, coupled with nonriverine landscape features at the headwaters. Our data suggest that ancestral refugia are not necessary to explain current distribution patterns and that pairs of codistributed taxa do not seem to be the result of simultaneous diversification processes.

AB Quantitative July temperature reconstructions using fossil chironomid and pollen data have been carried out with a high temporal resolution for the Termination la and the late-glacial Interstadial (ca 15 000-13 000 cal years BP) on a sediment core from Gerzensee (Switzerland). The biota-based July temperature reconstructions show a rapid warming of 4-5 degrees C (pollen) and 2-3 degrees C (chironomids) at Termination la (i.e. the onset of the late-glacial Interstadial, ca 14 650 cal. BP). These temperature changes go parallel with a shift of more than 3% in a high-resolution stable oxygen isotope record measured on bulk carbonates from the same core, also indicating a substantial and rapid warming.
   Pollen-inferred July temperatures follow the shape of the oxygen-isotope record with a generally decreasing trend of ca 2 degrees C throughout the Interstadial, showing even minor cold oscillations of 0.5-1 degrees C in July temperature recorded in many central European sites (e.g. Aegelsee and Gerzensee Oscillations) and the Greenland ice cores (e.g. Gl-ld and GI-1 b). Chironomid-inferred summer temperatures, however, show a gradual increase of ca 2-3 degrees C throughout the Interstadial, interrupted by some cold oscillations (e.g. GI-lb) of 0.5-1 degrees C.
   The reconstructions based on both proxies are in agreement with comparable studies in the Jura Mountains and the Alps. Given the close correlation between the oxygen isotope record and the polleninferred temperatures, the discrepancies between the two biota-specific July temperature inferences could be explained by the higher sensitivity of vegetation to changes in seasonality and precipitation, whereas aquatic organisms such as chironomids are more responsive to summer season conditions.

AB 1. Global wildfire activity and biomass burning have varied substantially during the Holocene in both lime and space. At the regional to continental scale, macroclimate is considered to be the predominant control regulating wildfire activity. By contrast, the role of forest tree composition is often considered as a subsidiary factor in studies addressing temporal variation in regional wildfire activity.
   2. Here, we assemble a spatially comprehensive data set of 75 macroscopic charcoal records that reflect local burning and forest landscapes that are spread over a substantial part of the European boreal forest:, spanning both oceanic and continental climates.
   3. We show that the late-Holocene invasion of Norway spruce Picea abies, a new forest dominant in northern Europe, significantly reduced wildfire activity, thus altering forest disturbance dynamics at a subcontinental scale.
   4. Synthesis. Our findings show that a biotic change in the local forest ecosystem altered the fire regime largely independent of regional climate change, illustrating that forest composition is an important parameter that must be considered when modelling future fire risk and carbon dynamics in boreal forests.

AB 1. Many factors shape plant reproductive patterns including climate, competition or attraction of pollinators and seed dispersers, flower and fruit morphologies and phylogenetic relationships. South American Myrtaceae (Myrteae) were chosen to evaluate hypotheses on how abiotic and biotic factors, morphology and phylogeny influence plant reproductive phenology.
   2. We examined whether Myrteae reproductive patterns are seasonal and related to climate; whether aggregated or segregated flowering and fruiting occur among species sharing pollinators or seed dispersers; the relationship between phenological and morphological traits, time of reproduction and Myrteae phylogenetic history; and the shared influence of ecological (environmental) and phylogenetic factors on Myrteae reproductive patterns.
   3. We observed flowering and fruiting of 34 Myrteae species during 30 months in an Atlantic rain forest (south-eastern Brazil). We employed circular statistics to test for seasonality and multiple regressions to relate climate and phenology. Competition and facilitation hypotheses were tested using null models. We quantified the phylogenetic signal on phenology and morphology of Myrteae species using phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR) analyses, and used PVR and partial regressions to quantify the influences of ecology and phylogeny on phenology.
   4. Myrteae flowered seasonally, whereas fruiting was not seasonal. Environmental factors (day-length and temperature) and associations with biotic vectors through facilitation hypothesis explained the aggregated blossom. Fruit maturation time affected the species' flowering sequence. Plants with longer fruit maturation times flowered at the end of the appropriate season, explaining the continuous fruit availability despite the seasonal flowering. The random fruiting pattern explained the regular presence of seed dispersers. Myrteae phenology was phylogenetically structured, even when phenophases were not seasonal, i.e., closer related species fruited under more similar environmental conditions, suggesting that the reproductive phenological niche was inherited along the course of evolution. We detected a shared influence of ecology and phylogeny on Myrteae phenological responses, and the ecological component explained better phenological variation than phylogeny.
   5. Synthesis. We provided a new perspective on plant phenology based on phylogeny and ecology and demonstrated the importance of considering their shared influence in phenological studies. Our analyses can be employed for the most representative families of highly diverse ecosystems to improve our understanding of evolutionary patterns and general trends in phenology.

AB This study describes a GIS-based software tool for the qualitative assessment of desertification risk. The tool integrates results from several land degradation models into ArcGIS using the object-oriented programming language Visual Basic. The integration of GIS and models is based on different coupling approaches.
   The proposed methodology was developed and tested on Sardinia Island (Italy). Six driving factors of desertification (overgrazing, vegetation productivity, soil fertility, water erosion, wind erosion and seawater intrusion) were model-simulated over two time periods to investigate the spatio-temporal evolution pattern of desertification-prone areas. Model results were normalized, weighted and combined into an Integrated Desertification Index (IDI) ranging from 0 to 1 (representing the best and the worst conditions, respectively), and classified into five desertification risk levels.
   The implementation, performance of the methodology and benefits provided by the modelling approach to land management authorities for monitoring processes of land degradation are fully described in the paper. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A high-resolution, continuous 10,500 cal. yrs-long macroscopic charcoal record from a peat and lake sediment deposit at Storasjo, in the hemiboreal vegetation zone of southern Sweden, is presented. This record was compared with the microscopic charcoal record from the same core, and tentatively correlated with the macroscopic and microscopic charcoal records from another site (Stavsakra), situated 30 km West of Storasjo. The charcoal records are also compared with regional climate proxy records with the aim to separate climate from human-induced fire activity. The results suggest that the major signal of both microscopic and macroscopic charcoal records represents local fire history. The best record of local fire history was obtained from the continuous macroscopic charcoal analysis. A tentative correlation of the charcoal records between the sites indicates that most fire episodes of the early and middle Holocene are probably of regional character. Both sites exhibit three major phases of high fire activity 1) 8700-8300 BC, 2) 7250 BC to ca. 4000 BC, and 3) 750 BC to the 19th century. These three phases are separated by periods with lower or very low fire activity. This general trend is in good agreement with the pattern emerging for Europe from the analysis of the recently developed global charcoal database. Fire appears to have been controlled by climate during the early and middle Holocene and by humans during the late Holocene. Warmer and drier climate during the early and middle Holocene caused frequent and intensive fires, which suggests that natural fire activity might increase under predicted future climate scenarios. The results also suggest that fire was an important disturbance factor in the hemiboreal vegetation zone of Sweden and played an important role in the forest dynamics and characteristics of the flora and fauna of the region.

AB A number of floristic and vegetation studies apply the terms campo rupestre, campo de altitude (or Brazilian paramo), and Tepui to neotropical azonal outcrop and montane vegetation. All of these are known to harbor considerable numbers of endemic plant species and to share several genera. In order to determine whether currently known combinations of vascular plant genera could help circumscribe and distinguish these vegetation types, we selected 25 floras which did not exclude herbs and compiled them into a single database. We then compared the Sorensen similarities of the genus-assemblages using the numbers of native species in the resulting 1945 genera by multivariate analysis. We found that the circumscription of campo rupestre and other Neotropical outcrop vegetation types may not rely exclusively on a combination of genera.

AB High-dispersal rates in heterogeneous environments and historical rapid range expansion can hamper local adaptation; however, we often see clinal variation in high-dispersal tree species. To understand the mechanisms of the species' distribution, we investigated local adaptation and adaptive plasticity in a range-wide context in Sitka spruce, a wind-pollinated tree species that has recently expanded its range after glaciations. Phenotypic traits were observed using growth chamber experiments that mimicked temperature and photoperiodic regimes from the limits of the species realized niche. Bud phenology exhibited parallel reaction norms among populations; however, putatively adaptive plasticity and strong divergent selection were seen in bud burst and bud set timing respectively. Natural selection appears to have favoured genotypes that maximize growth rate during available frost-free periods in each environment. We conclude that Sitka spruce has developed local adaptation and adaptive plasticity throughout its range in response to current climatic conditions despite generally high pollen flow and recent range expansion.

AB We used nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from specimens collected throughout Lake Tanganyika to clarify the evolutionary relationship between Lamprologus callipterus and Neolamprologus fasciatus. The nuclear data support the reciprocal monophyly of these two shell-breeding lamprologine cichlids. However, mtDNA sequences show that (i) L. callipterus includes two divergent and geographically disjunct (North-South) mtDNA lineages; and that (ii) N. fasciatus individuals cluster in a lineage sister group to the northern lineage of L. callipterus. The two mtDNA lineages of L. callipterus diverged c. 684 kya to 1.2 Ma, coinciding with a major water level low stand in Lake Tanganyika, which divided the lake into isolated sub-lakes. This suggests that the two mtDNA lineages originated as the result of the separation of L. callipterus populations in different sub-basins. The incongruent phylogenetic position of N. fasciatus can best be explained by an ancient unidirectional introgression from L. callipterus into N. fasciatus. Remarkably, our data indicate that this event resulted in the complete mtDNA replacement in N. fasciatus. Our data suggest that hybridization occurred soon after the divergence of the two L. callipterus mtDNA lineages, probably still during the water level low stand, and that subsequently the invading mtDNA lineage spread throughout the lake.

AB We have yet to understand fully how conditions during different periods of development interact to influence life-history structure. Can the negative effects of poor juvenile nutrition be overcome by a good adult diet, or are life-history strategies set by early experience? Here, we tested the influence and interaction of different nutritional quality during juvenile and sexual development on female resource allocation physiology, life history and courtship behaviour in the cockroach, Nauphoeta cinerea. Nymphs were raised on either a good-quality or poor-quality diet. After adult eclosion, females were either switched to the opposite diet or remained on their original diet. We assessed mating behaviour and lifetime reproductive success for half of the females from each treatment. We evaluated reproductive investment, somatic investment and resource reallocation from reproduction to the soma via oocyte apoptosis in the remaining females. We found that poor juvenile conditions resulted in a fat phenotype with slow juvenile growth and short reproductive lifespan that could not be retrieved with a change in diet. Good juvenile conditions resulted in the converse, but again fixed, phenotype in adulthood. Thus, juvenile nutrition sets adult patterns of resource allocation.

AB We conducted 28 dilution experiments during August-September 2007 to investigate the coupling of growth and microzooplankton grazing rates among ultraphytoplankton populations and the phytoplankton community and their responses to habitat variability (open-ocean oligotrophy, eddy-induced upwelling, and the Mekong River plume) in the western South China Sea. At the community level, standing stocks, growth, and grazing rates were strongly and positively correlated, and were related to the higher abundance of larger phytoplankton cells (diatoms) at stations with elevated chlorophyll concentration. Phytoplankton growth rates were highest (> 2 d(-1)) within an eastward offshore jet at 13 degrees N and at a station influenced by the river plume. Among ultraphytoplankton populations, Prochlorococcus dominated the more oceanic and oligotrophic stations characterized by generally lower biomass and phytoplankton community growth, whereas Synechococcus became more important in mesotrophic areas (eddies, offshore jet, and river plume). The shift to Synechococcus dominance reflected, in part, its higher growth rates (0.87 +/- 0.45 d(-1)) compared to Prochlorococcus (0.65 +/- 0.29 d(-1)) or picophytoeukaryotes (0.54 +/- 0.50 d(-1)). However, close coupling of microbial mortality rates via common predators is seen to play a major role in driving the dominance transition as a replacement of Prochlorococcus, rather than an overprinting of its steady-state standing stock.

AB Using quantitative PCR that amplified a prey-specific mtDNA 214 bp amplicon from the COI mitochondrial gene of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), prey eggs of known age and number were fed to larvae of the generalist predator lady beetle Coleomegilla maculata (De Geer) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), to elucidate the effects of time and diet since consumption, number of prey eggs, and methods for sample fixation and preservation, on the quantity of target DNA detected. Signal was strongly attenuated directly after cessation of feeding, even when predators were immediately frozen at -20 degrees C. However, the quantity of target detected was significantly related to the number of eggs consumed and the time elapsed since eating. Decrease in detected prey DNA was consistent with a negative exponential model. The target DNA sequence disappeared from starved predators (quantitative half-life estimate of 59 min) more slowly than those fed potato aphids after consuming the target prey eggs (half-life estimate 16 min), whereas those fed C. maculata eggs as a chaser were intermediate in the rate at which they degraded the target prey DNA sequence. Fixative protocols are of critical importance in proper use of the qPCR technique. Among seven methods tested, storing the predator immediately in 70% ethanol prechilled to -20 degrees C yielded the highest amount of target sequence, 22.8% of that recovered directly from a single intact prey egg. Samples frozen without solvent at -80 degrees C and -20 degrees C yielded only 6.0% and 2.3% of the target DNA respectively, and room temperature ethanol and ethylene glycol-based antifreeze averaged below 1% recovery of target DNA. Nevertheless, target prey was detected in more than 80% of antifreeze-stored predators. Predators killed and held at room temperature for 4 h or 5 days yielded no target prey DNA in 18 of 20 cases. These results emphasize both the value and the complexities of application of the qPCR technique to field predation studies.

AB Many studies have been conducted to quantify the possible ecosystem/landscape response to the anticipated global warming. However, there is a large amount of uncertainty in the future climate predictions used for these studies. Specifically, the climate predictions can be very different based on a variety of global climate models and alternative greenhouse emission scenarios. In this study, we coupled a forest landscape model, LANDIS-II, and a forest process model, PnET-II, to examine the uncertainty (that results from the uncertainty in the future climate predictions) in the forest-type composition prediction for a transitional forest landscape [the Boundary Water Canoe Area]. Using an improved global-sensitivity analysis technique [Fourier amplitude sensitivity test], we also quantified the amount of uncertainty in the forest-type composition prediction contributed by different climate variables including temperature, CO2, precipitation and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). The forest landscape response was simulated for the period 2000-2400 ad based on the differential responses of 13 tree species under an ensemble of 27 possible climate prediction profiles (monthly time series of climate variables). Our simulations indicate that the uncertainty in the forest-type composition becomes very high after 2200 ad, which is close to the time when the current forests are largely removed by windthrow disturbances and natural mortality. The most important source of uncertainty in the forest-type composition prediction is from the uncertainty in temperature predictions. The second most important source is PAR, the third is CO2 and the least important is precipitation. Our results also show that if the optimum photosynthetic temperature rises due to CO2 enrichment, the forest landscape response to climatic change measured by forest-type composition may be substantially reduced.

AB In Thailand, mangrove forests are claimed for state management, although it is widely recognized that coastal communities access and manage those forests. Skepticism persists within Thai government circles about whether coastal villages can sustainably manage and protect mangroves. This research presents evidence of successful mangrove conservation and management by two coastal villages in Trang province, southern Thailand. Using interdisciplinary methods including interviews, discussions, quantitative forest surveys, and institutional analysis, we describe the history of how these two communities gained rights to manage the mangrove forests, and the subsequent positive biological outcomes associated with their management. Local villages have crafted and maintained well-defined governance management institutions over the forest, and as a result, stand structure was superior in community-managed mangrove forests than in the open-access state forest. We argue that the basis for the communities' success in managing these forests was that the resource was necessary to local livelihoods and was becoming scarce; the communities enjoyed autonomous decision making and had a high degree of social capital; the forest and user groups were well defined and monitored; effective leadership was present in the villages to apply sanctions and resolve conflicts; and there was substantial assistance from an external non-governmental organization, which served as a bridge between the villages and the government. For conservation, simply knowing whether communities can conserve mangroves is not sufficient. We must know why the communities are or are not successful. Conservation research must, therefore, consider not only the biological outcomes of community management, but the underlying reasons for those outcomes. This paper can serve as a guideline for future studies on the community-mangrove interface.

AB Background: Individual differences in social behaviour may have consequences for mate choice and sexual signalling, because partners should develop preferences for personalities that maximize reproductive output. Here we propose that behavioural traits involved in sexual advertisement may serve as good indicators of personality, which is fundamental for sexual selection to operate on temperament. Bird song has a prominent and well-established role in sexual selection, and it displays considerable variation among individuals with a potentially strong personality component. Therefore, we predicted that features of song would correlate with estimates of personality.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In a field study of free-living male collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis, we characterised personality based on the exploration of an altered breeding environment, and based on the risk taken when a potential predator was approaching during a simulated territorial interaction. We found that explorative and risk-taker individuals consistently sang at lower song posts than shy individuals in the presence of a human observer. Moreover, males from lower posts established pair-bonds relatively faster than males from higher posts.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results may demonstrate that risk taking during singing correlates with risk taking during aggression and with exploration, thus personality may be manifested in different contexts involving sexual advertisement. These findings are in accordance with the hypothesis that the male's balance between investment in reproduction and risk taking is reflected in sexual displays, and it may be important information for choosy females that seek partners with personality traits enhancing breeding success.

AB 1. Species distribution models (SDM) are increasingly applied as predictive tools for purposes of conservation planning and management. Such models rely on the concept of the ecological niche and assume that distribution patterns of the modelled species are at some sort of equilibrium with the environment. This assumption contrasts with empirical evidence indicating that distribution patterns of many species are constrained by dispersal limitation.
   2. We demonstrate that the performance of SDM based on presence-only data can be significantly enhanced by incorporating distance constraints (functions relating the likelihood of species' occurrences at a site to the distance of the site from known presence locations) to the modelling procedure. This result is highly consistent for a variety of niche-based models (ENFA, DOMAIN and Mahalanobis distance), distance functions (nearest neighbour distance, cumulative distance and Gaussian filter) and taxonomic groups (plants, snails and birds, a total of 226 species).
   3. Distance constraints are expected to enhance the accuracy of niche-based models even in the absence of strong dispersal limitation by accounting for mass effects and spatial autocorrelation in environmental factors for which data are not available.
   4. While distance-based methods outperformed niche-based models when all data were used, their accuracy deteriorated sharply with smaller sample sizes. Niche-based methods are shown to cope better with small sample sizes than distance-based methods, demonstrating the potential advantage of niche-based models when calibration data are limited.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Incorporating distance constraints in SDM provides a simple yet powerful method to account for spatial autocorrelation in patterns of species distribution, and is shown empirically to improve significantly the performance of such models. We therefore recommend incorporating distance constraints in future applications of SDM.

AB Biological invasions are a fixture in our landscapes, with consequent losses in endemic biota and shifts in ecosystem function. Despite the historical recognition of exotic species success in novel environs, this phenomenon lacks a holistic-descriptive framework. Recent attempts to explain biological invasions are based largely on identifying the inherent invasive qualities of successful exotic species (i.e., invasiveness), or characterizing the susceptibility of a habitat to an introduced species (i.e., invasibility), with few studies examining their interaction or additional contributing factors (e.g., time since introduction). We propose unifying the 'points of entry' into biological invasions with a state factor model that incorporates all contributing variables-not just species or habitats-into a quantifiable, factorial model amenable to hypothesis testing. State factors are phenomenological variables describing the state of a system-historically used in soil and vegetation science. Our state factor equation relates any quantifiable property of an invasion (i) as a function of propagule pressure (p), introduced habitat (h), invader autecology (a), source environment (s), and time since introduction (t). By manipulating state factors singly, or in interaction, targeted variation can be related to quantifiable properties of exotic species while controlling, or at minimum accounting for, remaining factors contributing variation to the system. This holistic factor-function paradigm extends research on invasions from beyond the limits imposed by current theory, fosters novel empirical approaches, elucidates knowledge gaps in our understanding of resident invasions, and allows for variable accounting via a factor matrix. Here we briefly outline the ontogeny of state factors in soil and vegetation science, detail our proposed 'phast' framework for biological invasions, including notation, and examine a case study in state factor utility.

AB S. P. Hubbell's unified neutral theory of biodiversity has stimulated much new thinking about biodiversity. However, empirical support for the neutral theory is limited., and several observations are inconsistent with the predictions of the theory, including positive correlations between traits associated with competitive ability and species abundance and correlations between species diversity and ecosystem functioning. The neutral theory can be extended to explain these observations by allowing species to differ slightly in their competitive ability (fitness). Here, we show that even slight differences in fecundity can greatly reduce the time to extinction of competitors even when the community size is large and dispersal is spatially limited. In this case, species richness is dramatically reduced, and a markedly different species abundance distribution is predicted than under pure neutrality. In the nearly neutral model, species co-occur in the same community not because of, but in spite of, ecological differences. The more competitive species with higher fecundity tend to have higher abundance both in the metacommunity and in local communities. The nearly neutral perspective provides a theoretical framework that unites the sampling model of the neutral theory with theory of biodiversity affecting ecosystem function.

AB High-severity wildfires can increase hillslope-scale sediment yields by several orders of magnitude. Accurate predictions of postfire sediment yields are needed to guide management decisions and assess the potential impact of soil loss on site productivity and downstream aquatic resources. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and Disturbed WEPP are the most commonly used models to predict postfire sediment yields at the hillslope scale, but neither model has been extensively tested against field data. The objectives of this paper are to ( 1) compare predicted sediment yields from RUSLE and Disturbed WEPP against 252 plot years of data from nine fires in the Colorado Front Range; and ( 2) suggest how each model might be improved. Predicted and measured sediment yields were poorly correlated for RUSLE (R-2 = 0.16) and only slightly better correlated for Disturbed WEPP (R-2 = 0.25). Both models tended to over-predict sediment yields when the measured values were less than 1 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) and to under-predict higher sediment yields. Model accuracy was not improved by increasing the soil erodibility ( K) factor in RUSLE and was only slightly improved by slowing the vegetative recovery sequence in Disturbed WEPP. Both models much more accurately predicted the mean sediment yields for hillslopes grouped by fire and severity (R-2 = 0.54 to 0.66) than for individual plots. The performance of RUSLE could be improved by incorporating an erosivity threshold and a nonlinear relationship between rainfall erosivity and sediment yields. The performance of WEPP could be improved by reducing the effective hydraulic conductivity in sites that have recently burned at high severity. The results suggest that neither model can fully capture the complexity of the different controlling factors and the resultant plot-scale variability in sediment yields.

AB The importance of neutral dynamics is contentiously debated in the ecological literature. This debate focuses onneutral theory's assumption offitness equivalency among individuals, which conflicts with stabilizing fitness that promotes coexistence through niche differentiation. I take advantage of competition - colonization trade-offs between species of aquatic micro-organisms ( protozoans and rotifers) to show that equalizing and stabilizing mechanisms can operate simultaneously. Competition trials between species with similar colonization abilities were less likely to result in competitive exclusion than for species further apart. While the stabilizing mechanism( colonization differences) facilitates coexistence at large spatial scales, species with similar colonization abilities also exhibited local coexistence probably due to fitness similarities allowing weak stabilizing mechanisms to operate. These results suggest that neutral-and niche-based mechanisms of coexistence can simultaneously operate at differing temporal and spatial scales, and such a spatially explicit view of coexistence may be one way to reconcile niche and neutral dynamics.

AB Evolutionary and environmental economics have a potentially close relationship. This paper reviews past and identifies potential applications of evolutionary concepts and methods to environmental economics. This covers a number of themes: resource use and ecosystem management; growth and environmental resources; economic and evolutionary progress; and individual behavior and environmental policy. The treatment will address both biological and economic-including institutional, organizational and technological-evolutionary phenomena. Attention will be drawn to the fact that evolutionary economics shows a surprising neglect of environmental and natural resource factors.

AB The relationship between form and function has been a central organizing principle in biology throughout its history as a formal science. This concept has been relevant from molecules to organisms but loses meaning at population and community levels where study targets are abstract collectives and assemblages. Ecosystems include organisms and abiotic factors but ecosystem ecology too has developed until recently without a strong spatially explicit reference. Landscape ecology provides an opportunity to once again anneal form and function and to consider reciprocal causation between them. This ecomorphologic view can be applied at a variety of ecologically relevant scales and consists of an investigation of how geomorphology provides a structural template that shapes, and is shaped by ecological processes. Running water ecosystems illustrate several principles governing the interaction of landscape form and ecological function subsumed by the concept of "Functional Ecomorphology". Particularly lucrative are ecosystem-level interactions between geologic form and biogeochemical processes integrated by hydrologic flowpaths. While the utility of a flowpath-based approach is most apparent in streams, spatially explicit biogeochemical processing pervades all landscapes and may be of general ecological application.

AB 1. A recent experiment varied the genetic diversity of model grassland communities under standardized soil and management conditions and at constant initial species diversity. After 5 years' growth, genetically diverse communities retained more species diversity and became more similar in species composition than genetically impoverished communities.
   2. Here we present the results of further investigation within this experimental system. We proposed that two mechanisms - the first invoking genetically determined and constant differences in plant phenotypes and the second invoking genotype-environment interactions - could each underpin these results. This mechanistic framework was used as a tool to interpret our findings.
   3. We used inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) DNA markers to confirm which of the individuals of six study species initially included in the model communities were unique genotypes. We then used the molecular markers to assess the survival and abundance of each genotype at the end of the 5-year experimental period.
   4. The DNA marker data were used to create, for the first time, a genotype abundance hierarchy describing the structure of a community at the level of genotypes. This abundance hierarchy revealed wide variation in the abundance of genotypes within species, and large overlaps in the performance of the genotypes of different species.
   5. Each genotype achieved a consistent level of abundance within genetically diverse communities, which differed from that attained by other genotypes of the same species. The abundance hierarchy of genotypes within species also showed consistency across communities differing in their initial level of genetic diversity, such that species abundance in genetically impoverished communities could be predicted, in part, by genotypic identity.
   6. Three species (including two canopy-dominants) experienced shifts in their community-level genotype abundance hierarchies that were consistent with an increased influence of genotype-environment interactions in genetically impoverished communities.
   7. Our results indicate that under relatively constant environmental conditions the species abundance structure of plant communities can in part be predicted from the genotypic composition of their component populations. Genotype-environment interactions also appear to shape the structure of communities under such conditions, although further experiments are needed to clarify the magnitude and mechanism of these effects.

AB The effects of the invasive exotic Prosopis juliflora shrubs on the natural plant communities and soil chemical characters were assessed in two regions of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Five sites were selected subjectively: three in Sharja with 73 stands and two in Ras Al-Khima with 37 stands. Stands were located randomly within each site to cover density variation in Sharja and size variation in Ras Al-Khima. Density, frequency, richness and evenness of the associated annual and perennial species were studied in nine quadrats distributed under, at the margin and outside the canopy of a P. juliflora shrub located in the center of each stand. The results indicated that the effect of P. juliflora on the associated flora depends significantly on the density and size of the canopy. Larger individuals and greater densities have significantly greater negative impacts on the associated plants. All the studied community attributes were significantly lower under P. juliflora canopies than outside. Annuals were inhibited more than perennials. The number of annuals with significant reductions in density and/or frequency under P. juliflora canopies was significantly greater than the number of perennials. Density of more than 50% of the associated annuals was significantly inhibited under P. juliflora canopies. Density of P. juliflora seedlings was greater underneath the canopy of the same species than away from them, indicating little or no self allelopathic effect (auto-inhibition) under field conditions. P. juliflora ameliorated some soil characters, through significant pH reduction and increase in K, N and P and organic matters. Hence, plant diversity might be enhanced following eradication of P. juliflora.

AB Instream flows are essential determinants of channel morphology, riparian and aquatic flora and fauna, water quality estuarine inflow and stream load transport. The ecological and environmental instream flow requirements (EEIFR) should be estimated to make the exploitation and utilization of water resources in a highly efficient and sustainable way and maintain the river ecosystem good health. As the largest tributary of the Yellow River, the Wei River is the 'Mother River' of Guanzhong region in Shaanxi province. It plays a great role in the development of West China and the health of the ecosystem of the Yellow River. The objective of this study is to estimate the EEIFR for improving the Wei River's ecological and environmental condition and develop the river healthily. Concerning the main ecological and environmental functions of the Wei River in Shaanxi Province, the EEIFR for each section of the Wei River including minimum instream flow requirements (IFR) for aquicolous biotopes maintenance, IFR for channel seepage, channel evaporation, stream self-purification and sediment transportation were estimated in this paper. The methods to estimate the instream flow requirements for stream self-purification and instream flow requirements for sediment transportation were proposed. The temporal scale of typical years include the year with the probability 25% of occurrence (high-flow year), the year with the probability 50% (normal-flow year) and the year with the probability 75% (low-flow year). The results show that the EEIFR for the Wei River mainly include instream flow requirements for self-purification and sediment transportation in each typical year. From high-flow year to low-flow year, the annual EEIFR for each reach decrease, except those for the reach from Linjiacun to Weijiabao, and from Linjiacun at the upper reaches to Huaxian at the lower reaches, and the annual reach EEIFR decrease in a sequence.

AB Females often base their mating preferences on male sexual secondary traits that are used to settle contests among males. Such traits are likely to be honest indicators of male quality if they are constantly used during costly male-male agonistic interactions. Carotenoid signals have been shown to work as a handicap because they are costly to produce. However, the role of carotenoids as "honest" signals during male contests is less clear, and it is not known whether a carotenoid-based trait can serve in both male-male competition and female choice. In this study, we studied the dual function of a carotenoid feather ornament in the rock sparrow (Petronia petronia), a bird species in which both sexes have a yellow throat patch whose size positively correlates with phenotypic measures. First, we investigated, in a field study, whether the size of a male's yellow patch correlates with his ability to acquire a territory. Second, we tested the signal function of the yellow patch in two male-male interaction in captivity experiments. Finally, we measured female preference for males differing in throat patch size in a mate choice experiment. Our experiments revealed that the size of a male's throat patch positively correlated with the number of nest boxes he was able to defend. Moreover, in controlled conditions, males with relatively large yellow patches had earlier access to food than those with small patches. Also, in an experiment in which a dummy rock sparrow with an experimentally manipulated yellow patch was positioned near a feeder, latency to feed by focal birds positively correlated with dummy patch size. Lastly, in a dichotomous mate choice experiment, females showed a proximity preference for males whose patch was experimentally enlarged. Taken together, these results suggest that the same carotenoid feather signal may be used in both male-male competition and female choice in this passerine bird.

AB The high incidence of asexuality in oribatid mites presents an unusual opportunity for examining hypotheses for the maintenance of sex. There is a presumed range in age of asexual species: many oribatid species are phylogenetically clustered, occurring in speciose early-derivative families or genera without sexual species, while others are phylogenetically isolated from other asexual species, occurring in later derivative taxa with sexual congeners. We examined the distribution of oribatid mite reproductive mode in soil of corn fields, grassy and shrub fields, and forests in central New York State (three replicate plots of each type, with 25 samples per plot), to test three ecological predictions from current theory. (1) If overall biotic uncertainty, as generated by competitors and predators, mediates the ecological distribution of oribatid mites, then the proportion of asexual oribatid mites should be negatively correlated with biological diversity; we examine this prediction using literature data as well. (2) If Muller's Ratchet (the stochastic loss of best genotypes, which is independent of environment), mediates the success of asexuality, then no ecological pattern should exist. (3) If general purpose genotypes are characteristic of asexual oribatid mites, their habitat distribution should be broader than that of sexual species. For each plot the level of asexuality was compared to indices of overall biotic diversity, as calculated from the pooled oribatid mite (competitors) and mesostigmatid mite (predator) communities. We found no negative correlation in this relationship in our own data or in the literature analysis of 290 faunal surveys from 50 literature sources, so we reject biotic uncertainty as an important determinant of reproductive mode distribution. When only data on phylogenetically clustered asexuals are considered, there is instead a positive correlation between asexuality and diversity that is not explained. Because of the latter pattern we tentatively reject Muller's Ratchet as the primary factor maintaining reproductive mode in these mites, but cannot reject it for isolated asexual species. Niche breadth in sexual and asexual oribatid mites provides no support for widespread general purpose genotypes but broad patterns in the literature suggest that the idea needs further investigation. Possible complicating or unknown factors that are discussed include historical disturbance in the study area, the relationship between parasitism and general biotic diversity, and the level and source of genetic diversity in asexual oribatid mites.

AB Hybrids in coral reef fishes have traditionally been described based on external features using meristic characters and colouration to identify putative parental contributors. This study utilised molecular genetic techniques to verify hybrid status and identify putative parental species for five hybrid specimens (Labridae: Thalassoma) collected from Holmes Reef in the Coral Sea. Phylogenetic analyses support hybrid origins of the specimens. Mitochondrial COI gene, nuclear S7 (intron 1) and nuclear copy of mitochondrial (NUMT)D-loop region corroborate the identity of T. quinquevittatum as the maternal and T. jansenii as the paternal contributor. Backcrossing to parental species by hybrids and bi-directional gene exchange between the Holmes Reef populations of T. jansenii and T. quinquevittatum was detected, suggesting that hybrids are fertile and able to reproduce successfully. F-1 hybrids display a mixture of the colouration attributes of the two parental species, but subsequent backcrossed individuals were unrecognisable as hybrids and displayed colouration of either parental species. A large numerical imbalance exists between the putative parental species at Holmes Reef, with T. quinquevittatum outnumbering T. jansenii by approximately 25:1. In this case study, hybridization appears to be driven by ecological rather than evolutionary factors. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Assessing the long-term dynamics of mountain landscapes that are influenced by large-scale natural and anthropogenic disturbances and a changing climate is a complex subject. In this study, a landscape-level ecological model was modified to this end. We describe the structure and evaluation of the fire sub-model of the new landscape model LANDCLIM, which was designed to simulate climate-fire-vegetation dynamics. We applied the model to an extended elevational gradient in the Colorado Front Range to test its ability to simulate vegetation composition and the strongly varying fire regime along the gradient. The simulated sequence of forest types along the gradient corresponded to the one observed, and the location of ecotones lay within the range of observed values. The model captured the range of observed fire rotations and reproduced realistic fire size distributions. Although the results are subject to considerable uncertainty, we conclude that LANDCLIM can be used to explore the relative differences of fire regimes between strongly different climatic conditions.

AB Although invasive plants are recognized as a major ecological problem, little is known of the relative importance of plant community characteristics versus landscape context in determining invasibility of communities. We determined the relative importance of community and landscape features of 30 woodlots in influencing the invasion of Lonicera maackii. We sampled woodlots using the point-quarter method and calculated canopy openness and basal areas and densities of shrub, sapling and tree species, as well as woody species richness. We used aerial photos and ArcView GIS to calculate landscape parameters from the same woodlots using a buffer distance of 1500 m. We used logistic and linear regression analyses to determine the community and landscape factors that best explain L. maackii presence and density. We also tested whether woodlot invasion by L. maackii begins at woodlot edges.
   Presence of L. maackii was significantly explained only by distance from the nearest town (logistic regression, p=0.017); woodlots nearer town were more likely to be invaded. Among invaded woodlots, density of L. maackii was positively related to the amount of edge in the landscape (partial R-2=0.592) and negatively related to total tree basal area (partial R-2=0.134), number of native woody species (partial R-2=0.054), and sapling shade tolerance index (partial R-2=0.054). Lonicera maackii in woodlot interiors were not younger than those on the perimeters, leading us to reject the edge-first colonization model of invasion.
   Our findings reveal that landscape structure is of primary importance and community features of secondary importance in the invasion of L. maackii. This shrub is invading from multiple foci (towns) rather than an advancing front. Connectivity in the landscape (i.e. the number of corridors) did not promote invasion. However, edge habitat was important for invasion, probably due to increased propagule pressure. The community features associated with L. maackii invasion may be indicators of past disturbance.

AB Standardization of commercial catch and effort data is important in fisheries where standardized abundance indices based on fishery-dependent data are a fundamental input to stock assessments. The goal of the standardization is then to minimize bias due to the confounding of apparent abundance patterns with fishing power. There is a high risk of confounding between fishing power and abundance in fisheries where the fleet has altered their fishing technology over the years. Also, the spatial aspects and the fishing history can be so heterogeneous that any standardization really involves an extrapolation, for example to a hypothetical standard vessel. When the standardization involves an extrapolation, then the appropriate modeling strategy is to build a so-called estimation model, rather than a predictive model. Strategies to build such an estimation model from fishery-dependent data include: pay careful attention to subject matter, and collect information about potential confounding effects to include in the model (putting a high value on the acquisition of data on covariates); model variable catchability at a highly disaggregated scale; aim for realistic coefficients when fitting the model and pay relatively less attention to achieving precision or maximizing explained variance; adopt modern statistical methods to combine data from different sources; and if data are deficient, then apply precautionary allowances. These strategies offer some protection against bias due to confounding, in the absence of formal criteria for identifying the best model.

AB In songbirds, the individual features of a male's song play a role in female choice and male-male interactions. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the song characteristics of an individual should be correlated with its quality and this has been shown for some species. The species studied so far have only small or medium-sized song repertoires, leaving open the question of whether, in species with large repertoires, song characteristics such as repertoire size are related to male quality. We investigated the correlations between body measures, song characteristics and arrival dates of common nightingales, a songbird species in which males have extraordinarily large song type repertoires. We found that birds with large repertoires had longer wings and were heavier, and arrived earlier, than those with small repertoires. Other song characteristics, such as song diversity and proportion of whistle songs, were not significantly correlated with body measures. When we correlated body measures with arrival date, we found that birds that arrived earlier were heavier and tended to be in better condition. These findings provide supporting evidence that repertoire size is an indicator of a male's quality. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB 1. To minimize study-area artefacts in a study of natal dispersal distances in tree swallows, we intensively banded nestlings and adults in nest-boxes in upstate New York and recruited and trained 70 volunteer banders within a 400 km radius of Ithaca. We banded 26 567 nestlings in the years 1985 through 1998, and captured 4774 adults at the nest, 630 of which had been banded as nestlings and were recaptured the year after fledging.
   2. To correct for spatial variation in capture intensity, we resampled the distribution of all boxes where an adult capture was made under uniform, exponential and Cauchy null hypotheses. Compared to the null distributions, the frequency of observed dispersal events was significantly higher at 0-10 km and lower for all larger dispersal distances. The Cauchy distribution came closest to approximating the observed dispersal distance distribution.
   3. Dispersal distances were sensitive to the distribution of nesting sites, and all measurements of dispersal distance distributions must be seen as being habitat-specific. We could detect no effect of dispersal distance on the subsequent timing of breeding and no effect of the timing of fledging on dispersal distance. The sexual differences in raw mean dispersal distances (8.38 km for females, 2.44 km for males) are similar to those reported for other species.
   4. While it is tempting to conclude that studies in smaller areas have not missed a great deal, even a study area of 10 km extent (substantially larger than most) would have missed 11% of the dispersing birds detected and 95% of the range of distances recorded. Despite this sizeable component that would have been missed with a smaller study area, the relatively low frequencies of long-distance dispersal overall reinforce the conclusion that tree swallows, and probably most other migratory passerines, generally disperse much less far from their natal sites than the distances of their annual migrations might lead one to expect.

AB The development of ecological stoichiometry has centered on organisms and their interactions, with less emphasis on the meaning or value of a comprehensive ecosystem stoichiometry at larger scales. Here we develop a conceptual framework that relates internal processes and exogenous factors in spatially- and temporally-linked ecosystems. This framework emerges from a functional view of ecosystem stoichiometry rooted in understanding the causes and consequences of relative stoichiometric balance, defined as the balance between ratios of resource supply and demand. We begin by modifying a graphical model based on resource ratio competition theory that relates resource supply and demand to ecosystem processes. This approach identified mechanisms, or stoichiometric schemes, through which ecosystems respond to variable resource supply. We expand this view by considering the effects of exogenous factors other then resource supply that comprise a stoichiometric template that influences stoichiometric balance within ecosystems. We then describe a number of examples of patterns in organismal stoichiometry in several types of ecosystems that illustrate stoichiometric schemes and factors that impinge directly on stoichiometric patterns. Next, we conduct an initial analysis of the stoichiometric effects of spatial linkages between ecosystems, and how those relate to boundary dynamics and hot spot development. We conclude by outlining research directions that will significantly advance our understanding of stoichiometric constraints on ecosystem structure and function.

AB Dynamic approaches to forest ecosystems are surprisingly rare. Here we report about successional changes in collembolan community structure and microbial performances during forest rotation. The study was carried out in a chronosequence of four spruce forest stands (5-, 25-, 45-, and 95 years old; Tharandter forest, Germany). CO2 release significantly increased after clear-cutting and the amount of C stored in the organic layer subsequently declined. The early phase of forest rotation was characterized by a very active decomposer microflora, stimulation of both fungi and bacteria as well as by a high abundance of surface-oriented Collembola. In addition, collembolan species turnover was accelerated. While the biomass of fungi further increased at intermediate stages of forest rotation, the metabolic activity of the microflora was low, the functional diversity of bacteria declined and the collembolan community became impoverished. Euedaphic species dominated during this stage of forest development. These changes can be explained by both reduction in microhabitat diversity and depletion of food sources associated with an accumulation of recalcitrant soil organic matter. Results of the General Regression Model procedure indicate a shift from specific associations between collembolan functional groups and microbiota at the early stage of forest rotation to a more diffuse pattern at intermediate stages. Though the hypothesis that Collembola are relatively responsive to changes in environmental conditions is confirmed, consistently high community similarity suggests a remarkable persistence of some components of microarthropod assemblages. Our study provides evidence for substantial ecosystem-level implications of changes in the soil food web during forest rotation. Moreover, correlations between bacterial parameters and Collembola point to the overarching impact of differences in the composition of the microbial community on microarthropods.

AB Turnover in species composition of the extremely species-rich family Geometridae (Lepidoptera) was investigated along an elevational gradient ranging from 1040 m to 2677 m above sea level. Moths were sampled using weak light traps (30 W) in three field periods in 1999 and 2000 in an Andean montane rainforest in the province of Zamora-Chinchipe in southern Ecuador. A total of 13 938 specimens representing 1010 species were analysed. Similarities of ensembles of all geometrid moths and of the subfamilies Ennominae and Larentiinae were calculated using the NESS index (with m(max)). Ordinations performed using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and correspondence analysis depicted a gradual change of the ensembles along the altitudinal gradient. Extracted ordination scores significantly correlate with altitude (-0.97 less than or equal to r less than or equal to -0.95, P < 0.001) and with ambient air temperature (0.93 <= r <= 0.97, P < 0.001). Temperature is therefore assumed to be the most important abiotic determinant responsible for the species turnover among the moths. Matrix correlation tests were performed in order to compare faunal matrices with matrices derived from available environmental factors. Both tree diversity and vegetation structure significantly correlate with faunal data, but tree diversity explains considerably more of the data variability (range: Mantel r = 0.81-0.83, P < 0.001) than vegetation structure (range: Mantel r = 0.35, P < 0.005 to r = 0.43, P < 0.001). Tree diversity also changes gradually and scores of the first NMDS dimension are highly significantly correlated with altitude (r = 0.98, P < 0.001). A common underlying factor such as ambient temperature might also be responsible for such vegetation changes. Additionally, simulated model data was developed that assumed a constant turnover of moth species and equal elevational ranges of all species involved. Despite the simplicity of the models, they fit empirical data very well (Mantel r > 0.80 and P < 0.001 in all models).

AB Landscape connectivity is critical to the maintenance of spatially-structured populations and consists of both a structural component, which describes the shape, size and location of landscape features; and a biological component, which consists of both the response of individuals to landscape features, and the patterns of gene How that result from those individual responses. Traditional studies of landscape connectivity have attempted to discern individual behavioral responses to landscape features, but this methodology is intractable for many species. This paper is an attempt to relate the components of landscape connectivity through the explicit treatment of their spatial and temporal scales. Traditional measures of structural and biological components of connectivity are reviewed and more recently developed methods for the analysis of scale for each are introduced. I then present a framework for the comparison of scalar phenomena based on Watt's unit pattern, describe the potential outcomes of the comparison and discuss the implications of each. Several testable hypotheses emerge from the analysis that may serve as a useful framework for the investigation of landscape connectivity in the future.

AB Introgressive hybridization has an important evolutionary significance in terms of gene diversity and speciation. Among the major groups of vertebrates, fish show a strong propensity to hybridize. In order to highlight the possible occurrence of gene flow between two tilapia species, Oreochromis niloticus and O. aureus , a comparison of allozyme and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphism was performed on sympatric and allopatric populations of these two species. Nuclear data were congruent with the morphological identification of O. niloticus and O. aureus populations. In opposition, the mtDNA analysis resulted in two strictly differentiated groups which did not follow the morphological and nuclear DNA classification. The first group consisted of East African O. niloticus populations and the second included all the O. aureus populations and the West African O. niloticus populations. Moreover, in some cases, the same sequences were detected in both species. These data strongly support a differential introgression of mtDNA from O. aureus to O. niloticus involving all the West African area. This work points out the risk of misinterpretation of mtDNA or nuclear DNA data when only one single class of marker is used.

AB From 1996 to 2001 we studied the spatial organization and demography of Eurasian badgers, Meles nieles, in Bialowieia Primeval Forest in eastern Poland, one of the best preserved woodlands in temperate Europe. Badger density estimated on the basis of main sett distribution (0.54 sett/10 km(2)) and group size (3.9 individuals per sett, on average) was 2.11 badgers/10 km(2). Average annual productivity of the population was 64% and the mortality rate of badgers >1 year old was 22-38% per annum. The size of territories of badger groups (n = 7), estimated by radiotelemetry, varied from 8.4 to 25.5 km(2) (mean 12.8 km(2)). Individual home ranges of badgers (n = 13) covered, on average, 9.3 km(2), and varied seasonally and among animals of different age and sex classes (from 4.0 to 24.4 km(2)). Home ranges of adult badgers were significantly larger than those of subadults. Badgers occupied larger home ranges in summer, when earthworm availability was low. The size of both group territories and individual home ranges was influenced by the distribution of oak-lime-hornbeam (OLH) forests, habitats rich in earthworms. Based on our findings and a review of literature, we propose that the standing crop of biomass of earthworms (Lumbricus spp.), the main food of badgers in a large part of their geographic range, and mean annual temperature are crucial factors shaping the densities of badgers in the European temperate and boreal zones. We also suggest that abundance of food resources is the essential factor underlying the great variation in badger sociality (from pairs to large groups).

AB Construction of two dams in 1958 and 1982 reduced freshwater inflow events to Rincon Bayou, part of the Nucces Delta near Corpus Christi, Texas, USA. Inflow reduction led to a reverse estuary, where low-salinity water flooded the delta on incoming tides and higher salinities were found near the Nueces River. Hypersaline conditions caused by high evaporation rates and low water levels were common during summer in the upper reaches. In October 1995, an overflow diversion channel was created by lowering the bank of the Nueces River to restore inflow events into Rincon Bayou, which is the main stem creek that runs through the center of the Delta. Hypersaline conditions occurred four times from mid-1994 to mid-1997 and only once after mid-1997. Lower, rather than higher, salinity conditions were found after August 1997 in the upper reaches. Benthic faunal recovery was monitored by changes in macrofauma and meiofauna communities. Macrofauna responded to inflow events with increased abundances, biomass, and diversity but decreased during hypersaline conditions. Meiofauna abundance also increased with increasing inflow. Benthic characteristics were different in Rincon Bayou than in a reference site, upstream from introduced inflow. As inflow events have increased due to the diversion, the opportunities for positive responses to increased flow have increased. Although the overflow channel was filled in at the end of the demonstration project in fall 2000, the City of Corpus Christi reopened the channel in fall 2001 because the ecological benefits were credited toward the state-mandated minimum flow requirement for the Nueces Estuary.

AB We associated patterns of plant diversity with possible causal factors by considering 93 local regions in the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands with respect to biogeography, environmental favourability, and environmental heterogeneity, and their relationship with measured species diversity at four different scales: mean local species richness standardized at a grain of 100 m(2) total species richness in a community type within a region (regional community richness), mean compositional similarity, and mosaic diversity.
   Local regions in biogeographic transition zones to the North African and Atlantic floras had higher regional community richness and greater mosaic diversity than did non-transitional regions, whereas no differences existed in mean local species richness or mean compositional similarity. Mean local species richness was positively related to environmental favourability as measured by actual evapotranspiration, but negatively related to total precipitation and temporal heterogeneity in precipitation. Mean local species richness was greatest in annual grassland and dwarf shrubland communities, and on calcareous bedrock types. Regional community richness was similarly related to actual evapotranspiration and total precipitation, but in addition was positively related to spatial heterogeneity in topography and soil water holding capacity. Mean compositional similarity decreased with increasing spatial heterogeneity and temperature seasonality. Mosaic diversity, a measure of complexity, increased with increasing local and regional richness.
   We hypothesize that these relationships can be explained by four ecological and evolutionary classes of causal factors: numbers of individuals, intermediate environments, limits to adaptation, and niche variation. These factors operate at various scales and manifest themselves in various ways. For example, at the site level, apparently processes that increase the number of individuals increase mean local species richness, but at the level of the entire region no such effects were found.

AB The intensification of agriculture has led to declines in species diversity and abundance within groups of certain flora and fauna. Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) are one group where a decline has been documented, and it is thought to be attributable to a decrease in forage resources and potential nest sites. As bumblebees play an important role in the pollination of many entomophilous crops, this decline could impact on agricultural productivity. We examined the role of naturally regenerated field margins in providing forage plants on land where nectar resources are otherwise impoverished. The following question was addressed - Are naturally regenerated unsprayed field margins more attractive to foraging bumblebees and honeybees than cropped field margins managed as conservation headlands? Significantly more bees visited naturally regenerated field margins than cropped field margins. Honeybees (Apis mellifera), Bombus terrestris, and Bombus lapidarius were the most commonly observed bee species. Different wildflower species within the naturally regenerated margins varied greatly in relative number of visits received, and bumblebee species were found to prefer different flower species to honeybees. The potential role that naturally regenerated field margins could play in the conservation of bumblebee species, and the implications for other species of flora and fauna, are discussed.

AB Our study objective was to develop a better understanding of the ecological significance of unburned forest remnants in successional sub-boreal landscapes created by fire. We characterized remnant forest patches and compared them to matrix forest in young, mature and old age classes. Remnant patches could be discriminated from matrix forest types based on variables relating to tree overstory and snag density. Some remnants displayed a unique uneven-aged pattern of lodgepole pine regeneration. Differences between remnant patches and matrix forest stands, and high variation among patches, may reflect the variable influence of the wildfires through which the patches survived. Remnants share many ecological characteristics with old forest and may provide 'bridging habitats' in landscapes recovering from large-scale disturbance. patches of mature forest retained in logged landscapes may have potential to substitute for wildfire remnants. However, selection and management criteria should be developed to guide the design of habitat retention and to monitor effects. The unusual regeneration dynamics demonstrated by some remnants may suggest an alternative silvicultural model for regenerating stands dominated by lodgepole pine within the boreal forest.

AB During the 20th century, environmental problems have increased from sewage discharge in the first decennia towards climate change today. An increase in scale of threats implies an increase in scale of management and assessment. Successively, physico-chemical, biological and ecological assessment evolved but failed to stop deterioration. The development in techniques runs parallel to the evolution in assessment. Eight major groups of assessment techniques are distinguished: indices (saprobic, diversity, biotic), multimetrics and rapid techniques, physico-ecological, catchment scale, ecosystem components, assemblage/community, process, and non-taxonomic assessment. An increasing refinement is observed in objectives, measures and complexity, and a decreasing one in levels of scale, stream type and, more often, taxonomy. The applied algorithms were typically restricted to single summary measures. Multivariate analysis was introduced only recently. Assessment can do without a reference condition. Still, this condition is often used in assessment. Therefore, the role of the reference is discussed and it is concluded that, if used, it needs to be defined strictly. The role of nine concepts of lotic ecology in assessment is studied. Two major groups of concepts are distinguished. One is related to catchment-scale functioning of streams and the other to instream habitat-related processes and biodiversity. The 5-S-Model, a frame that divides the stream ecosystem into five major components: system conditions, stream hydrology, structures, substances and species (Verdonschot et al., 1998: The 5-S-Model, an integrated approach for stream rehabilitation. In H.O. Hansen & B.L. Madsen, River Restoration '96, Session lectures proceedings. National Environmental Research Institute, Denmark, International Conference arranged by the European Centre for River Restoration: 36-44), is a first attempt to comprise this knowledge in management. Finally, integrated ecological assessment is defined. It is based on three major approaches: an ecological typology approach, an ecological catchment approach and a societal approach. Ecological typology implies a nested multiple parameter approach based on regional ecological stream typology where types are scaled and different taxonomic groups are incorporated. Ecological typology sets the ecological demands necessary to make management sustainable. The ecological catchment approach implies a nested multiple scale approach which couples natural and anthropogenic features and dynamics of the catchment both in space and time. This approach sets the conditions within the catchment to facilitate sustainable catchment management. The societal approach adds human activities to the first two. It couples ecological demands and anthropogenic uses and supports those user choices that make management sustainable. The application of these three approaches is initiated to enable sustainable catchment management.

AB The metazoan meiobenthos along the continental slope of the Goban Spur (NE Atlantic) was studied in the framework of the OMEX-programme (EC-MAST II). Meiobenthic densities, the vertical distribution of the meiobenthos in the sediment, and the biomass and generic composition of the dominant group, the nematodes, were investigated at different water depths. The meiobenthic communities along the depth gradient of the continental slope followed the usual trends: the communities were dominated by nematodes, and meiobenthic densities, total nematode biomass, and mean individual nematode weight decreased with increasing water depth. The shelf station had significantly higher densities, rematode biomass and mean individual weight than the deeper stations. The nematode communities along the OMEX slope were divided into a 'shelf break' community (206 m) and a 'down slope' community (1034-2760 m), with the station at 670 m depth as a transition station. It is suggested that the changes in the nematode community composition along the slope of the Goban Spur are related to the amount of oxygen (and the presence/absence of an oxic mineralisation pathway) in the sediment. The meiobenthos tended to be more concentrated towards the sediment surface with increasing water depth.

AB 1. Juvenile fish were sampled by electrofishing using the point abundance sampling method from August to November 1991 in the Lower Rhone River. Variations in fish abundance between point samples were partitioned according to three spatial scales of habitat heterogeneity.
   2. The compartment scale, differentiating channel and 'dike fields' (an area marginal to the main channel partially enclosed by an artificial embankment), was associated with variation in water current, temperature and biological productivity. Every juvenile fish species studied was more abundant in the dike fields, using them as a nursery.
   3. Within both compartments (i.e. main channel and dike fields), the same five bank types were represented, defining the intermediate scale of habitat heterogeneity. In the dike fields, beaches were selected by most of the species, whereas steep silt banks were more often selected in the main channel.
   4. After having removed the variation explained at the two larger habitat scales, only depth and shelter were found to have a significant effect on fish abundance at the microhabitat scale.
   5. When compared with a classical single-scale approach, the multi-scale approach was found to explain a greater amount of fish abundance variations and to facilitate the interpretation of observed patterns by scaling the species' responses to habitat heterogeneity. The difference between the amounts of variation explained was proposed as a measure of how much habitat selection is hierarchical.

SO FISHERIES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE species composition; Yellow Sea
AB Species diversity of the Yellow Sea fish community in 1959, 1981, 1985 and 1986 was measured by means of several methods. An evenness index, E=log(e)(1/lambda)/log(e)S, was introduced to measure the fish community. The differences in diversity index in the Yellow Sea between seasons are due to fish migration, while the differences between years are attributed to the changes of species composition caused by overfishing and species interactions.
   The numbers of dominant, common and rare species of fish were calculated using Hill's diversity index. The dominant species in 1959 were all demersal fish, which were the major target for fisheries in the 1950s and 1960s. However, in the 1980s, pelagic fish took a very dominant position, especially small pelagic fish, which were the prey of large pelagic and bottom fish. This indicates that the depletion of most demersal fish and large size pelagic fish has resulted in the increase of small planktophagous pelagic fish in the Yellow Sea.

AB Recent work on Carabidae of grasslands and cereals in northern Europe is summarised. In cereals, the biology and role of individual carabids in pest management has been studied in some detail. Grassland studies have concentrated more on classifying the assemblages present, and relating the fauna to environmental conditions and vegetation management. This information is used in the ecological evaluation of grassland habitats. Recent works emphasize landscape features and pattern in the agricultural environment. Examples are given of the author's studies on: pitfall trapping for assessing carabid assemblages; management effects on grassland carabids; multivariate analyses of carabids in UK cereals. A prime need is for further work on individual carabid biologies and population dynamics.

AB Data from a national butterfly monitoring scheme were analysed to test the theory that animal populations are more variable towards the edges of species' ranges. Nine of the 24 species tested fluctuated with significantly greater amplitude nearer their northern limits, providing the first clear evidence of this phenomenon among ectotherms. With some species, the pattern of fluctuations also varied across ranges, with populations increasing and decreasing more gradually, and perhaps cyclically, over several generations in the north.

AB Terrestrial net primary production (NPP) may be determined from remotely-sensed vegetation indices by estimating the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorbed by vegetation. Studies from the literature were used to determine the upper limit of the PAR conversion efficiency (epsilon) as a function of woody biomass for forest vegetation. Without climatic or other limitations, the upper limit was about 3.5 g MJ-1 of absorbed PAR at very low values of stem biomass. Because of increased maintenance respiration with increasing woody biomass, the upper limit decreased to 2.0 g MJ-1. Therefore, global estimates of NPP based on vegetation indices should include a classification among established forest, young forest and non-forest ecosystems to account for differences in epsilon.

AB We used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), an eigenvector ordination technique that includes direct gradient analysis, to investigate habitat use by spotted, Stenella attenuata, spinner, S.longirostris, striped, S. coeruleoalba, and common, Delphinis delphis, dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific during 1986-90. Data were collected during annual research vessel cruises conducted in August-November of each year. Environmental variables included in the analyses were surface temperature, salinity, sigma-t, and chlorophyll, and thermocline depth and thickness. The dominant pattern in the species-environment relationship (1st canonical axis) separated common dolphins from spotted and spinner dolphins, based on their associations with cool upwelling habitat and warm tropical habitat, respectively. The second axis separated whitebelly spinners from eastern spinner dolphins. Both occurred in tropical water, but were separated primarily by thermocline topography. The species-environment correlations were 0.67 on the first axis, 0.42 on the second. Overall, the environmental data explained 15% of the variance in the species data. For individual school types this ranged from 36% for common dolphins to 6% for striped dolphins. Interannual variability in the species data was small but was judged significant by a Monte Carlo randomization test. Residual interannual variance was insignificant after removing variance associated with environmental variables.

ID GERMINATION
AB To analyse the potential reaction to fire-generated heat pulses, seeds of 12 species of plants and rhizomes of three species were exposed to elevated temperatures for 10 min. The tested material split into three groups with respect to heat tolerance: (1) the rhizomes, for which the lethal temperatures were in the range 55-59-degrees-C; (2) the seeds of most of the species tested, for which the lethal temperatures were in the range 65-75-degrees-C; (3) The seeds of two species of Leguminosae and three species of Geranium for which the lethal temperatures were around 100-degrees-C. For all three Geranium species and for one of the legume species, Anthyllis vulneraria, exposure temperatures above ca. 45-degrees-C resulted in dormancy release, and maximum germination occurred above 60-65-degrees-C. Speed of germination was little affected for most species, except after exposure to near-lethal temperatures, where it slowed down dramatically, although the seedlings emerging were healthy. We conclude that due to sharp temperature gradients in the soil during fire, differences in heat tolerance between species in most cases are not large enough to be a decisive factor in their post-fire colonising success. There are exceptions: the seeds of certain taxa that arc impermeable to water in the dormant state, some of which have heat triggered germination.

AB The ability to exploit spatial and temporal heterogeneity in soil resources can be one factor important to the competitive balance of plants. Competition aboveground may limit selective plant responses to belowground heterogeneity, since mechanisms such as root proliferation and alterations in uptake kinetics are energy-dependent processes. We studied the effect of shading on the ability of the perennial tussock grass Agropyron desertorum to take up nutrients from enriched soil microsites in two consecutive growing seasons. Roots of unshaded plants selectively increased phosphate uptake capacity in enriched soil microsites (mean increases of up to 73%), but shading eliminated this response. There were no changes in ammonium uptake capacity for roots in control and enriched patches for either shaded or unshaded plants. The 9-day shade treatments significantly reduced total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) concentrations for roots in 1990, but had no apparent effect on root carbohydrates in 1991 despite dramatic reductions in shoot TNC and fructan concentrations. Enrichment of the soil patches resulted in significantly greater phosphate concentrations in roots of both shaded and unshaded plants, with less dramatic differences for nitrogen and no changes in potassium concentrations. In many respects the shaded plants did surprisingly well, at least in terms of apparent nutrient acquisition. The effects of aboveground competition on nutrient demand, energy requirements, and belowground processes are discussed for plants exploiting soil resource heterogeneity.

AB In the context of a recent massive increase in research on plant root functions and their impact on the environment, root ecologists currently face many important challenges to keep on generating cutting-edge, meaningful and integrated knowledge. Consideration of the below-ground components in plant and ecosystem studies has been consistently called for in recent decades, but methodology is disparate and sometimes inappropriate. This handbook, based on the collective effort of a large team of experts, will improve trait comparisons across studies and integration of information across databases by providing standardised methods and controlled vocabularies. It is meant to be used not only as starting point by students and scientists who desire working on below-ground ecosystems, but also by experts for consolidating and broadening their views on multiple aspects of root ecology. Beyond the classical compilation of measurement protocols, we have synthesised recommendations from the literature to provide key background knowledge useful for: (1) defining below-ground plant entities and giving keys for their meaningful dissection, classification and naming beyond the classical fine-root vs coarse-root approach; (2) considering the specificity of root research to produce sound laboratory and field data; (3) describing typical, but overlooked steps for studying roots (e.g. root handling, cleaning and storage); and (4) gathering metadata necessary for the interpretation of results and their reuse. Most importantly, all root traits have been introduced with some degree of ecological context that will be a foundation for understanding their ecological meaning, their typical use and uncertainties, and some methodological and conceptual perspectives for future research. Considering all of this, we urge readers not to solely extract protocol recommendations for trait measurements from this work, but to take a moment to read and reflect on the extensive information contained in this broader guide to root ecology, including sections I-VII and the many introductions to each section and root trait description. Finally, it is critical to understand that a major aim of this guide is to help break down barriers between the many subdisciplines of root ecology and ecophysiology, broaden researchers' views on the multiple aspects of root study and create favourable conditions for the inception of comprehensive experiments on the role of roots in plant and ecosystem functioning.

AB Managing invasive alien species is particularly challenging in the ocean mainly because marine ecosystems are highly connected across broad spatial scales. Eradication of marine invasive species has only been achieved when species were detected early, and management responded rapidly. Generalized approaches, transferable across marine regions, for prioritizing actions to control invasive populations are currently lacking. Here, expert knowledge was elicited to prioritize 11 management actions for controlling 12 model species, distinguished by differences in dispersion capacity, distribution in the area to be managed, and taxonomic identity. Each action was assessed using five criteria (effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, impacts on native communities, and cost), which were combined in an 'applicability' metric. Raising public awareness and encouraging the commercial use of invasive species were highly prioritized, whereas biological control actions were considered the least applicable. Our findings can guide rapid decision-making on prioritizing management options for the control of invasive species especially at early stages of invasion, when reducing managers' response time is critical.

AB This paper advances an hypothesis that the primary adaptive driver of seasonal migration is maintenance of site fidelity to familiar breeding locations. We argue that seasonal migration is therefore principally an adaptation for geographic persistence when confronted with seasonality - analogous to hibernation, freeze tolerance, or other organismal adaptations to cyclically fluctuating environments. These ideas stand in contrast to traditional views that bird migration evolved as an adaptive dispersal strategy for exploiting new breeding areas and avoiding competitors. Our synthesis is supported by a large body of research on avian breeding biology that demonstrates the reproductive benefits of breeding-site fidelity. Conceptualizing migration as an adaptation for persistence places new emphasis on understanding the evolutionary trade-offs between migratory behaviour and other adaptations to fluctuating environments both within and across species. Seasonality-induced departures from breeding areas, coupled with the reproductive benefits of maintaining breeding-site fidelity, also provide a mechanism for explaining the evolution of migration that is agnostic to the geographic origin of migratory lineages (i.e. temperate or tropical). Thus, our framework reconciles much of the conflict in previous research on the historical biogeography of migratory species. Although migratory behaviour and geographic range change fluidly and rapidly in many populations, we argue that the loss of plasticity for migration via canalization is an overlooked aspect of the evolutionary dynamics of migration and helps explain the idiosyncratic distributions and migratory routes of long-distance migrants. Our synthesis, which revolves around the insight that migratory organisms travel long distances simply to stay in the same place, provides a necessary evolutionary context for understanding historical biogeographic patterns in migratory lineages as well as the ecological dynamics of migratory connectivity between breeding and non-breeding locations.

AB Imidacloprid is a largely commercialized neonicotinoid insecticide, and it is used effectively against a variety of sap-sucking insect pests including melon aphid, Aphis gossypii. In this study, the inhibitory and stimulatory effects of low and sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid were investigated on two successive generations of A. gossypii. The initial bioassay results showed that imidacloprid exhibited high toxicity against adult melon aphids with a LC50 of 0.42 mg/l after 72 h exposure. The low lethal (LC15) and sublethal (LC5) concentrations of imidacloprid reduced adult longevity and fecundity in exposed aphids (F-0). By contrast, hormesis effects were observed on the biological traits of progeny generation (F-1) exposed to both concentrations of imidacloprid. Substantial increases were noted for the adult longevity and fecundity of F-1 aphids. Consequently, the demographic indexes such as intrinsic rate of increase (r) and finite rate of increase (lambda) were enhanced by both concentrations whereas the net reproductive rate (R-0) and gross reproduction rate (GRR) were increased only by the LC15 of imidacloprid. Nonetheless, the mean generation time (T) of F-1 A. gossypii was extended by the LC5 and LC15 of imidacloprid. These results indicated that low or sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid, while negatively affecting biological traits of directly exposed aphids, could induce hormesis effects in the progeny of exposed individuals in the aphid A. gossypii. Therefore, the occurrence of potential hormesis should be taken into consideration when using imidacloprid against aphid pests.

AB Understanding the molecular basis of repeatedly evolved phenotypes can yield key insights into the evolutionary process. Quantifying gene flow between populations is especially important in interpreting mechanisms of repeated phenotypic evolution, and genomic analyses have revealed that admixture occurs more frequently between diverging lineages than previously thought. In this study, we resequenced 47 whole genomes of the Mexican tetra from three cave populations, two surface populations and outgroup samples. We confirmed that cave populations are polyphyletic and two Astyanax mexicanus lineages are present in our data set. The two lineages likely diverged much more recently than previous mitochondrial estimates of 5-7 mya. Divergence of cave populations from their phylogenetically closest surface population likely occurred between similar to 161 and 191 k generations ago. The favoured demographic model for most population pairs accounts for divergence with secondary contact and heterogeneous gene flow across the genome, and we rigorously identified gene flow among all lineages sampled. Therefore, the evolution of cave-related traits occurred more rapidly than previously thought, and trogolomorphic traits are maintained despite gene flow with surface populations. The recency of these estimated divergence events suggests that selection may drive the evolution of cave-derived traits, as opposed to disuse and drift. Finally, we show that a key trogolomorphic phenotype QTL is enriched for genomic regions with low divergence between caves, suggesting that regions important for cave phenotypes may be transferred between caves via gene flow. Our study shows that gene flow must be considered in studies of independent, repeated trait evolution.

AB Due to overuse or abuse, pesticides can bring about severe residue problems, which will lead to potential toxicity for environment and human health. Consequently, it is of great importance to establish simple, rapid, robust, and reliable methods for monitoring pesticides. With outstanding properties like high electrical conductivity, catalytic activity, optical property, and favorable biocompatibility, carbon nanomaterials have been regarded as a promising candidate for the development of high-performance biosensors since they appeared. This review highlights the recent advances and new trends in carbon nanomaterial-enabled biosensors for the detection of pesticides, including the application of graphene, carbon nanotubes, carbon dots, and other carbon nanomaterials with two main biosensing ways, i.e. enzyme and enzyme-free biosensors. In addition, we briefly discuss the current challenges and future prospects for the development and application of carbon nanomaterial-enabled biosensors for pesticides analysis.

AB The primary goal of invasive species management is to eliminate or reduce populations of invasive species. Although management efforts are often motivated by broader goals such as to reduce the negative impacts of invasive species on ecosystems and society, there has been little assessment of the consistency between population-based (e.g., removing invaders) and broader goals (e.g., recovery of ecological systems) for invasive species management. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive review of studies (N = 151) that removed invasive species and assessed ecological recovery over time. We found positive or mixed outcomes in most cases, but 31% of the time ecological recovery did not occur or there were negative ecological outcomes, such as increases in non-target invasive species. Ecological recovery was more likely in areas with relatively little anthropogenic disturbance and few other invaders, and for the recovery of animal populations and communities compared to plant communities and ecosystem processes. Elements of management protocols, such as whether invaders were eradicated (completely removed) versus aggressively suppressed (>= 90% removed), did not affect the likelihood of ecological recovery. Our findings highlight the importance of considering broader goals and unintended outcomes when designing and implementing invasive species management programs.

AB Background: Individual-based models (IBMs) are useful to simulate events subject to stochasticity and/or heterogeneity, and have become well established to model the potential (re) emergence of pathogens (e.g., pandemic influenza, bioterrorism). Individual heterogeneity at the host and pathogen level is increasingly documented to influence transmission of endemic diseases and it is well understood that the final stages of elimination strategies for vaccine-preventable childhood diseases (e.g., polio, measles) are subject to stochasticity. Even so it appears IBMs for both these phenomena are not well established. We review a decade of IBM publications aiming to obtain insights in their advantages, pitfalls and rationale for use and to make recommendations facilitating knowledge transfer within and across disciplines.
   Methods: We systematically identified publications in Web of Science and PubMed from 2006-2015 based on title/abstract/keywords screening (and full-text if necessary) to retrieve topics, modeling purposes and general specifications. We extracted detailed modeling features from papers on established vaccine-preventable childhood diseases based on full-text screening.
   Results: We identified 698 papers, which applied an IBM for infectious disease transmission, and listed these in a reference database, describing their general characteristics. The diversity of disease-topics and overall publication frequency have increased over time (38 to 115 annual publications from 2006 to 2015). The inclusion of intervention strategies (8 to 52) and economic consequences (1 to 20) are increasing, to the detriment of purely theoretical explorations. Unfortunately, terminology used to describe IBMs is inconsistent and ambiguous. We retrieved 24 studies on a vaccine-preventable childhood disease (covering 7 different diseases), with publication frequency increasing from the first such study published in 2008. IBMs have been useful to explore heterogeneous between-and within-host interactions, but combined applications are still sparse. The amount of missing information on model characteristics and study design is remarkable.
   Conclusions: IBMs are suited to combine heterogeneous within-and between-host interactions, which offers many opportunities, especially to analyze targeted interventions for endemic infections. We advocate the exchange of (open-source) platforms and stress the need for consistent "branding". Using (existing) conventions and reporting protocols would stimulate cross-fertilization between research groups and fields, and ultimately policy making in decades to come.

AB AimWe aimed to assess the contribution of marginal habitats to the tree species richness of the Mata Atlantica (Atlantic Forest) biodiversity hotspot. In addition, we aimed to determine which environmental factors drive the occurrence and distribution of these marginal habitats.
   LocationThe whole extension of the South American Atlantic Forest Domain plus forest intrusions into the neighbouring Cerrado and Pampa Domains, which comprises rain forests (core habitat) and five marginal habitats, namely high elevation forests, rock outcrop dwarf-forests, riverine forests, semideciduous forests and restinga (coastal white-sand woodlands).
   MethodsWe compiled a dataset containing 366,875 occurrence records of 4,431 tree species from 1,753 site-checklists, which were a priori classified into 10 main vegetation types. We then performed ordination analyses of the species-by-site matrix to assess the floristic consistency of this classification. In order to assess the relative contribution of environmental predictors to the community turnover, we produced models using 26 climate and substrate-related variables as environmental predictors.
   ResultsOrdination diagrams supported the floristic segregation of vegetation types, with those considered as marginal habitats placed at the extremes of ordination axes. These marginal habitats are associated with the harshest extremes of five limiting factors: temperature seasonality (high elevation and subtropical riverine forests), flammability (rock outcrop dwarf-forests), high salinity (restinga), water deficit severity (semideciduous forests) and waterlogged soils (tropical riverine forests). Importantly, 45% of all species endemic to the Atlantic Domain only occur in marginal habitats.
   Main conclusionsOur results showed the key role of the poorly protected marginal habitats in contributing to the high species richness of the Atlantic Domain. Various types of environmental harshness operate as environmental filters determining the distribution of the Atlantic Domain habitats. Our findings also stressed the importance of fire, a previously neglected environmental factor.

AB As an extension of the classic life history theory, the recently highlighted pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis predicts the coevolution of behavioral, physiological and life-history traits. For instance, bolder and shyer individuals do not only differ in personality profiles, but also in neuro-endocrinology and breeding patterns. While theory predicts that bolder (i.e., proactive), more aggressive individuals should colonize more rapidly urbanized habitats than shyer (i.e., reactive), less aggressive individuals, it is also predicted that across generations, adaptive selection processes could favor shyer individuals that are more sensitive to novel environmental cues. Here we compared two personality traits (handling aggression, exploration score in a novel environment), one physiological trait related to stress response (breath rate) and four breeding traits (lay date, clutch size, hatching success and fledging success) in a rural and an urban study population of Mediterranean great tits Parus major. Mixed models revealed strong phenotypic divergence between forest and city in most traits explored, in particular in personality, whereby urban great tits were more reactive to stress and faster explorers compared to rural birds (yet not more aggressive). Urban birds also laid smaller broods earlier in spring compared to their rural conspecifics, and city broods resulted in lower hatching success yet interestingly fledging success was similar. Nest-box centered measures of anthropogenic (artificial light, pedestrians, and cars) perturbation and resource abundance allowed us to go beyond the classical forest/city comparison by exploring the phenotypic variation across an urbanization gradient. This revealed that high urbanization in nest-box surroundings was associated overall with earlier breeding and smaller clutches, but also with faster breath rate, although these trends showed strong annual variation. Ongoing rapid urbanization and non-random gene flow between rural and urban great tits could both contribute to the high prevalence of bold breeders in the city. Our study suggests the existence of urban and rural great tit ecotypes with different pace-of-life, but also a finer-scale divergence along the degree of urbanization within the city. Future studies are required to determine whether this phenotypic variation at different spatiotemporal scales is adaptive and whether it has a genetic basis or results from phenotypic plasticity.

AB Cumulative environmental impacts driven by anthropogenic stressors lead to disproportionate effects on indigenous communities that are reliant on land and water resources. Understanding and counteracting these effects requires knowledge from multiple sources. Yet the combined use of Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Scientific Knowledge (SK) has both technical and philosophical hurdles to overcome, and suffers from inherently imbalanced power dynamics that can disfavour the very communities it intends to benefit. In this article, we present a 'two-eyed seeing' approach for co-producing and blending knowledge about ecosystem health by using an adapted Bayesian Belief Network for the Slave River and Delta region in Canada's Northwest Territories. We highlight how bridging TM and SK with a combination of field data, interview transcripts, existing models, and expert judgement can address key questions about ecosystem health when considerable uncertainty exists. SK indicators (e.g., bird counts, mercury in fish, water depth) were graded as moderate, whereas TM indicators (e.g., bird usage, fish aesthetics, changes to water flow) were graded as being poor in comparison to the past. SK indicators were predominantly spatial (i.e., comparing to other locations) while the TK indicators were predominantly temporal (i.e., comparing across time). After being populated by 16 experts (local harvesters, Elders, governmental representatives, and scientists) using both TK and SK, the model output reported low probabilities that the social-ecological system is healthy as it used to be. We argue that it is novel and important to bridge TM and SK to address the challenges of environmental change such as the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors on ecosystems and the services they provide. This study presents a critical social-ecological tool for widening the evidence-base to a more holistic understanding of the system dynamics of multiple environmental stressors in ecosystems and for developing more effective knowledge-inclusive partnerships between indigenous communities, researchers and policy decision-makers. This represents new transformational empirical insights into how wider knowledge discourses can contribute to more effective adaptive co-management governance practices and solutions for the resilience and sustainability of ecosystems in Northern Canada and other parts of the world with strong indigenous land tenure.

AB Anaerobic digestion of high-salinity wastewaters often results in process inhibition due to the susceptibility of the methanogenic archaea. The ability of the microbial community to deal with increased salinity levels is of high importance to ensure process perseverance or recovery after failure. The exact strategy of the microbial community to ensure process endurance is, however, often unknown. In this study, we investigated how the microbial community is able to recover process performance following a disturbance through the application of high-salinity molasses wastewater. After a stable start-up, methane production quickly decreased from 625 +/- 17 to 232 35 mL CH4 L-1 d(-1) with a simultaneous accumulation in volatile fatty acids up to 20.5 +/- 1.4 g COD L-1, indicating severe process disturbance. A shift in feedstock from molasses wastewater to waste activated sludge resulted in complete process recovery. However, the bacterial and archaeal communities did not return to their original composition as before the disturbance, despite similar process conditions. Microbial community diversity was recovered to similar levels as before disturbance, which indicates that the metabolic potential of the community was maintained. A mild increase in ammonia concentration after process recovery did not influence methane production, indicating a well-balanced microbial community. Hence, given the change in community composition following recovery after salinity disturbance, it can be assumed that microbial community redundancy was the major strategy to ensure the continuation of methane production, without loss of functionality or metabolic flexibility.

AB Subtropical forests are globally important in providing ecological goods and services, but it is not clear whether functional diversity and composition can predict aboveground biomass in such forests. We hypothesized that high aboveground biomass is associated with high functional divergence (FDvar, i.e., niche complementarity) and community-weighted mean (CWM, i.e., mass ratio; communities dominated by a single plant strategy) of trait values. Structural equation modeling was employed to determine the direct and indirect effects of stand age and the residual effects of CWM and FDvar on aboveground biomass across 31 plots in secondary forests in subtropical China. The CWM model accounted for 78, 20, 6 and 2% of the variation in aboveground biomass, nitrogen concentration in young leaf, plant height and specific leaf area of young leaf, respectively. The FDvar model explained 74,13, 7 and 0% of the variation in aboveground biomass, plant height, twig wood density and nitrogen concentration in young leaf, respectively. The variation in aboveground biomass, CWM of leaf nitrogen concentration and specific leaf area, and FDvar of plant height, twig wood density and nitrogen concentration in young leaf explained by the joint model was 86, 20,13, 7, 2 and 0%, respectively. Stand age had a strong positive direct effect but low indirect positive effects on aboveground biomass. Aboveground biomass was negatively related to CWM of nitrogen concentration in young leaf, but positively related to CWM of specific leaf area of young leaf and plant height, and FDvar of plant height, twig wood density and nitrogen concentration in young leaf. Leaf and wood economics spectra are decoupled in regulating the functionality of forests, communities with diverse species but high nitrogen conservative and light acquisitive strategies result in high aboveground biomass, and hence, supporting both the mass ratio and niche complementarity hypotheses in secondary subtropical forests.

AB Hybridization of parasites is an emerging public health concern in our changing world. Hybridization and introgression in parasites and pathogens can have major impacts on the host and the epidemiology and evolution of disease. Schistosomiasis is a Neglected Tropical Disease of profound medical and veterinary importance across many parts of the world, with the greatest human burden within sub-Saharan Africa. Here we review how early phenotypic identification and recent confirmation through molecular studies on naturally occurring infections, combined with experimental manipulations, have revealed evidence of viable hybridization and introgressions within and between human and animal schistosome species. Environmental and anthropogenic changes in selective pressures following, for instance, new dam constructions, altered agricultural practices, together with mass drug administration programmes, may all be predicted to further impact the availability of suitable definitive and intermediate hosts for schistosomes. It is therefore imperative to understand the distribution and role of such novel zoonotic hybrid schistosomes on host range, drug efficacy, and hence ultimately transmission potential, if we are to achieve and maintain sustainable control.

AB Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms generating parallel genomic divergence patterns among replicate ecotype pairs remains an important challenge in speciation research. We investigated the genomic divergence between the anadromous parasitic river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) and the freshwater-resident nonparasitic brook lamprey (Lampetra planeri) in nine population pairs displaying variable levels of geographic connectivity. We genotyped 338 individuals with RAD sequencing and inferred the demographic divergence history of each population pair using a diffusion approximation method. Divergence patterns in geographically connected population pairs were better explained by introgression after secondary contact, whereas disconnected population pairs have retained a signal of ancient migration. In all ecotype pairs, models accounting for differential introgression among loci outperformed homogeneous migration models. Generating neutral predictions from the inferred divergence scenarios to detect highly differentiated markers identified greater proportions of outliers in disconnected population pairs than in connected pairs. However, increased similarity in the most divergent genomic regions was found among connected ecotype pairs, indicating that gene flow was instrumental in generating parallelism at the molecular level. These results suggest that heterogeneous genomic differentiation and parallelism among replicate ecotype pairs have partly emerged through restricted introgression in genomic islands.

AB Due to possible positive and compensatory interaction between species, mixed stands are a commonly accepted silvicultural response to reduce risks arising from climate change. Nonetheless, only a few species combinations have been studied more detailed so far revealing variable mixing effects. Here, we analyze the effect of the mixture of Douglas fir and European beech with regard to the species-specific climate sensitivity of growth. We focus on three hypotheses: (i) Species-specific long term growing performance and climate sensitivity do not differ between monocultures and mixed stands, (ii) species-specific growth reactions to severe drought events do not differ between monocultures and mixed species stands and (iii) species-specific growth reactions on severe drought events are not influenced by differing ecological growing conditions.
   To scrutinize the hypothesis we analyzed tree cores from both species taken from pure and mixed stands covering different site conditions and age classes. Tree ring characteristics were used to analyze the differences in climate related long-term growth responses in pure and mixed stands. Short-term responses were investigated by growth reaction indices on individual tree and stand level involving drought events during the years 1950-2010. Linear mixed models were applied to detect effects of ecological co-variables on the indices.
   Results reveal that Douglas-fir in mixed stands exhibit a significant improved growing performance compared to pure stands. European beech seems to react indifferently concerning its performance in mixture compared to pure stands.
   Differences in drought stress resistance and growth recovery time mainly arose between the species. Douglas-fir showed a significantly lower resistance and required more time to reach again its initial growth level compared to European beech. In mixture we found a trend that Douglas-fir growth recovery time is shortened and extended for European beech.
   The analysis along the ecological gradients showed that base-limited soils systems are more drought tolerant during drought events. Lower basal area as a proxy for reduced stand competition decreased the relative growth loss by drought.
   We hypothesize that mainly spatial differentiation in height trigger enhanced diameter growth of Douglas-fir in mixture. Temporal differentiation expressed by deferred phenology attenuates climate sensitivity of this conifer. We conclude that in mixed Douglas-fir and European beech stands the former species is stabilized against climatic impacts. On the contrary, climate sensitivity of European beech is increased.

AB Modification of natural ecosystems has threatened biodiversity worldwide, with forests suffering especially. Strategies aimed at mitigating such loss in forests often include enrichment of deadwood, a critical resource for many decomposer species. However, it remains unclear how deadwood can best be enriched to most effectively promote the diversity of saproxylic species. In this study, we investigated saproxylic beetle diversity in experimentally exposed deadwood logs of 13 different tree species across 30 forests in three regions of Germany. We tested whether gamma-diversity differs between tree species and whether the alpha-diversity within an individual log depended on whether logs were placed in unmanaged beech forests, managed beech forests, or managed conifer forests. We found significant differences in gamma- and alpha-diversity of saproxylic beetles among tree species, but the ranking of tree species differed between regions, suggesting differences in regional beetle species pools. Randomization tests aiming to identify how many and which deadwood logs would need to be exposed to best conserve saproxylic beetle diversity, showed that the overall diversity of beetles increased with the number of tree species exposed, due to turnover of beetle species between tree species. However, some species (e.g. Carpinus) and species combinations (e.g. Carpinus-Picea) reached exceptionally high beetle diversity. Alpha-diversity was higher in conifer than in beech forests, but did not differ between managed and unmanaged beech forests. Canopy cover above logs and average stand temperature strongly influenced alpha-diversity, suggesting that environmental conditions that may be affected by management act as habitat filters for species assemblages. We conclude that deadwood enrichment strategies would be most effective when combining particular tree species that support highest diversity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Major environmental gradients co-vary with elevation and have been a longstanding natural tool allowing ecologists to study global diversity patterns at smaller scales, and to make predictions about the consequences of climate change. These analyses have traditionally studied taxonomic diversity, but new functional diversity approaches may provide a deeper understanding of the ecological mechanisms driving species assembly. We examined lichen taxonomic and functional diversity patterns on 195 plots (200 m(2)) together with forest structure along an elevational gradient of 1000 m in a temperate low mountain range (Bohemian Forest, Germany). Along this elevation gradient temperature decreased and precipitation increased, two macroclimatic variables critical for lichens. Elevation was more important than forest structure in driving taxonomic and functional diversity. While species richness increased with elevation, functional diversity decreased and revealed that community patterns shift with elevation from random to clustered, reflecting selection for key shared traits. Higher elevations favored species with a complex growth form (which takes advantage of high moisture) and asexual reproductive mode (facilitating establishment under low temperature conditions). Our analysis highlights the need to examine alternative forms of diversity and opens the avenue for community predictions about climate change. For a regional scenario with increasing temperature and decreasing availability of moisture, we expect a loss of specialized species with a complex growth form and those with vegetative organs at higher elevations in low mountain ranges in Europe.

AB Mountains provide an interesting context in which to study the many facets of biodiversity in response to macroclimate, since environmental conditions change rapidly due to elevation. Although the decrease in biodiversity with increasing elevation is generally accepted, our understanding of the variation of functional diversity along altitudinal gradients is still poorly known. The partitioning of diversity into spatial components can help to understand the processes that influence the distribution of species, and these studies are urgently needed in face of the increasing threats to mountain environments throughout the world. We describe the distribution of dung beetle diversity along an altitudinal gradient on a tropical mountain in southeastern Brazil, including the spatial partitioning of taxonomic and functional diversities. The altitudinal gradient ranged from 800 up to 1400m a.s.l. and we collected dung beetles at every 100 m of altitude. We used the Rao Index to calculate gamma, alpha and beta diversity for taxonomic and functional diversity of dung beetles. Climatic, soil and vegetation variables were used to explain variation in community attributes along the altitudinal gradient. Dung beetle richness declined with altitude and was related to climatic and vegetation variables, but functional diversity did not follow the same pattern. Over 50% of. taxonomic diversity was caused by among altitudes diversity (beta), while almost 100% of functional diversity was due to the a component. Contrasting beta taxonomic with beta functional diversity, we suggest that there is ecological redundancy among communities and that the environment is filtering species in terms of the Grinnellian niche, rather than the Eltonian niche. beta taxonomic diversity is caused mainly by the turnover component, reinforcing the hypothesis of environmental filtering. Global warmingmay have strong effects on mountain communities due to upslope range shifts and extinctions, and these events will lead to an even larger than previously expected loss of diversity as dung beetles. taxonomic diversity is caused mainly by the beta component.

AB Understanding of the penetration behaviors of pesticides in fresh produce is of great significance for effectively applying pesticides and minimizing pesticide residues in food. There is lack, however, of an effective method that can measure pesticide penetration. Herein, we developed a novel method for real-time and in situ monitoring of pesticide penetration behaviors in spinach leaves based on surface enhanced Raman. scattering (SERS) mapping. Taking advantage, of penetrative gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as probes to enhance the internalized pesticide signals in situ, we have successfully obtained the internal signals from thiabenclazole, a systemic pesticide, following its penetration into spinach leaves after removing surface pesticide residues. Comparatively, ferbam, a nonsystemic pesticide, did not show internal signals after removing surface pesticide residues, demonstrating its nonsystemic behavior. In both cases, if the surface pesticides were not removed, copenetration of both AuNPs and pesticides was observed. These results, demonstrate a successful application of SERS as an effective method for measuring pesticides penetration in fresh produce in situ. The information obtained could provide useful guidance for effective and safe applications of pesticides on plants.

AB Context dependency is an emerging topic that is challenging our understanding of the factors shaping biodiversity in metacommunities. River networks and other dendritic systems provide unique systems for examining variation in the processes shaping biodiversity between different metacommunities. We examined biodiversity patterns in five benthic invertebrate data sets, from two catchments in central Germany, with the aim of exploring context dependency in these systems. We used variance partitioning to disentangle the variation explained in three biodiversity metrics: taxonomic richness, Simpson's diversity and local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD; a measure of the uniqueness of a site). As explanatory variables, we used proxies of network position (i.e. catchment size and altitude) and habitat conditions. Contrary to our expectation, we found no evidence of a decline in LCBD downstream in our study. Local habitat conditions and catchment land use played a much stronger role than catchment size and altitude in explaining variation in the three biodiversity metrics. Observed patterns were highly variable between different data sets in our study. These findings suggest that factors shaping biodiversity patterns in these systems are highly context dependent and less related to their position along the river network than local habitat conditions. Given the clear context dependency between data sets, we urge researchers to focus on disentangling the factors driving the high levels of variability between individual systems through the study of a number of replicate, rather than single, metacommunities.

AB To slow the rate of global species loss, it is imperative to understand how to restore and maintain native biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Currently, agriculture is associated with lower spatial heterogeneity and turnover in community composition (-diversity). While some techniques are known to enhance -diversity, it is unclear whether habitat restoration can re-establish -diversity. Using a long-term pollinator dataset, comprising approximate to 9,800 specimens collected from the intensively managed agricultural landscape of the Central Valley of California, we show that on-farm habitat restoration in the form of native plant hedgerows', when replicated across a landscape, can boost -diversity by approximately 14% relative to unrestored field margins, to levels similar to some natural communities. Hedgerows restore -diversity by promoting the assembly of phenotypically diverse communities. Intensively managed agriculture imposes a strong ecological filter that negatively affects several important dimensions of community trait diversity, distribution, and uniqueness. However, by helping to restore phenotypically diverse pollinator communities, small-scale restorations such as hedgerows provide a valuable tool for conserving biodiversity and promoting ecosystem services.

AB Management of biodiversity and ecosystem services requires a better understanding of the factors that influence soil biodiversity. We characterized the species (or genera) richness of 10 taxonomic groups of invertebrate soil animals in replicated monocultures of 14 temperate tree species. The focal invertebrate groups ranged from microfauna to macrofauna: Lumbricidae, Nematoda, Oribatida, Gamasida, Opilionida, Araneida, Collembola, Formicidae, Carabidae, and Staphylinidae. Measurement of invertebrate richness and ancillary variables occurred similar to 34 years after the monocultures were planted. The richness within each taxonomic group was largely independent of richness of other groups; therefore a broad understanding of soil invertebrate diversity requires analyses that are integrated across many taxa. Using a regression-based approach and similar to 125 factors related to the abundance and diversity of resources, we identified a subset of predictors that were correlated with the richness of each invertebrate group and richness integrated across 9 of the groups (excluding earthworms). At least 50% of the variability in integrated richness and richness of each invertebrate group was explained by six or fewer predictors. The key predictors of soil invertebrate richness were light availability in the understory, the abundance of an epigeic earthworm species, the amount of phosphorus, nitrogen, and calcium in soil, soil acidity, and the diversity or mass of fungi, plant litter, and roots. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that resource abundance and diversity strongly regulate soil biodiversity, with increases in resources (up to a point) likely to increase the total diversity of soil invertebrates. However, the relationships between various resources and soil invertebrate diversity were taxon-specific. Similarly, diversity of all 10 invertebrate taxa was not high beneath any of the 14 tree species. Thus, changes to tree species composition and resource availability in temperate forests will likely increase the richness of some soil invertebrates while decreasing the richness of others.

AB 1. Body condition indices, measures of body 'plumpness' or mass relative to frame size, are often used as a proxy for lipid reserves or fitness-related traits of animals and assumed to be positively related to fitness.
   2. The quantification and analysis of body condition indices has been the subject of debate for decades. Here, we summarize three additional concerns with the use of body condition indices.
   3. First, body condition index is often poorly correlated with lipid content in animals. Second, even if body condition index and lipid content are correlated, lipid content of an animal may not be the most important aspect of body composition influencing fitness. Finally, neither body condition index nor lipid reserves are likely to be directly positively related to fitness in animals, as many animals homeostatically regulate intermediate levels of condition index or lipid reserves, with both higher and lower values incurring fitness costs.
   4. A wide range of analytical methods, including some relatively inexpensive and simple measures, are available for more detailed measures of animal body composition or fitness-related traits. Replacing body condition indices with more direct measures of body composition - even relatively simple measures - can inform understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying animal responses in a wide range of behavioural, ecological and evolutionary studies.

AB Males often face a trade-off between investments in precopulatory and postcopulatory traits [1], particularly when male-male contest competition determines access to mates [2]. To date, studies of precopulatory strategies have largely focused on visual ornaments (e.g., coloration) or weapon morphology (e.g., antlers, horns, and canines). However, vocalizations can also play an important role in both male competition and female choice [3-5]. We investigated variation in vocal tract dimensions among male howler monkeys (Alouatta spp.), which produce loud roars using a highly specialized and greatly enlarged hyoid bone and larynx [6]. We examined the relative male investment in hyoids and testes among howler monkey species in relation to the level of male-male competition and analyzed the acoustic consequences of variation in hyoid morphology. Species characterized by single-male groups have large hyoids and small testes, suggesting high levels of vocally mediated competition. Larger hyoids lower formant frequencies, probably increasing the acoustic impression of male body size and playing a role analogous to investment in large body size or weaponry. Across species, as the number of males per group increases, testes volume also increases, indicating higher levels of postcopulatory sperm competition, while hyoid volume decreases. These results provide the first evidence of an evolutionary trade-off between investment in precopulatory vocal characteristics and postcopulatory sperm production.

AB The idea that species boundaries can be semipermeable to gene flow is now widely accepted but the evolutionary importance of introgressive hybridization remains unclear. Here we examine the genomic contribution of gene flow between two hybridizing chipmunk species, Tamias ruficaudus and T. amoenus. Previous studies have shown that ancient hybridization has resulted in complete fixation of introgressed T. ruficaudus mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in some populations of T. amoenus, but the extent of nuclear introgression is not known. We used targeted capture to sequence over 10,500 gene regions from multiple individuals of both species. We found that most of the nuclear genome is sorted between these species and that overall genealogical patterns do not show evidence for introgression. Our analysis rules out all but very minor levels of interspecific gene flow, indicating that introgressive hybridization has had little impact on the overall genetic composition of these species outside of the mitochondrial genome. Given that much of the evidence for introgression in animals has come from mtDNA, our results underscore that unraveling the importance introgressive hybridization during animal speciation will require a genome-wide perspective that is still absent for many species.

AB Over the last 15 years studies on invasion genetics have provided important insights to unravel cryptic diversity, track the origin of colonizers and reveal pathways of introductions. Despite all these advances, to date little is known about how evolutionary processes influence the observed genetic patterns in marine biological invasions. Here, firstly we review the literature on invasion genetics that include samples from European seas. These seas constitute a wide array of unique water masses with diverse degrees of connectivity, and have a long history of species introductions. We found that only a small fraction of the recorded introduced species has been genetically analysed. Furthermore, most studies restrict their approach to describe patterns of cryptic diversity and genetic structure, with the underlying mechanisms involved in the invasion process being largely understudied. Secondly, we analyse how genetic, reproductive and anthropogenic traits shape genetic patterns of marine introduced species. We found that most studies reveal similar genetic diversity values in both native and introduced ranges, report evidence of multiple introductions, and show that genetic patterns in the introduced range are not explained by taxonomic group or reproductive strategy. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary implications derived from genetic patterns observed in non-indigenous species. We identify different scenarios that are determined by propagule pressure, phenotypic plasticity and pre-adaptation, and the effects of selection and genetic admixture. We conclude that there is a need for further investigations of evolutionary mechanisms that affect individual fitness and adaptation to rapid environmental change.

AB Background: Termites and their microbial gut symbionts are major recyclers of lignocellulosic biomass. This important symbiosis is obligate but relatively open and more complex in comparison to other well-known insect symbioses such as the strict vertical transmission of Buchnera in aphids. The relative roles of vertical inheritance and environmental factors such as diet in shaping the termite gut microbiome are not well understood.
   Results: The gut microbiomes of 66 specimens representing seven higher and nine lower termite genera collected in Australia and North America were profiled by small subunit (SSU) rRNA amplicon pyrosequencing. These represent the first reported culture-independent gut microbiome data for three higher termite genera: Tenuirostritermes, Drepanotermes, and Gnathamitermes; and two lower termite genera: Marginitermes and Porotermes. Consistent with previous studies, bacteria comprise the largest fraction of termite gut symbionts, of which 11 phylotypes (6 Treponema, 1 Desulfarculus-like, 1 Desulfovibrio, 1 Anaerovorax-like, 1 Sporobacter-like, and 1 Pirellula-like) were widespread occurring in >= 50% of collected specimens. Archaea are generally considered to comprise only a minority of the termite gut microbiota (<3%); however, archaeal relative abundance was substantially higher and variable in a number of specimens including Macrognathotermes, Coptotermes, Schedorhinotermes, Porotermes, and Mastotermes (representing up to 54% of amplicon reads). A ciliate related to Clevelandella was detected in low abundance in Gnathamitermes indicating that protists were either reacquired after protists loss in higher termites or persisted in low numbers across this transition. Phylogenetic analyses of the bacterial communities indicate that vertical inheritance is the primary force shaping termite gut microbiota. The effect of diet is secondary and appears to influence the relative abundance, but not membership, of the gut communities.
   Conclusions: Vertical inheritance is the primary force shaping the termite gut microbiome indicating that species are successfully and faithfully passed from one generation to the next via trophallaxis or coprophagy. Changes in relative abundance can occur on shorter time scales and appear to be an adaptive mechanism for dietary fluctuations.

AB Complex problems often result from the multiple interactions between human activities and ecosystems. The interconnected nature of ecological and social systems should be considered if these "wicked problems" are to be addressed. Ecosystem service approaches provide an opportunity to link ecosystem function with social values, but in practice the essential role that social dynamics play in the delivery of outcomes remains largely unexplored. Social factors such as management regimes, power relationships, skills, and values, can dramatically affect the definition and delivery of ecosystem services. Input from a diverse group of stakeholders improves the capacity of ecosystem service approaches to address wicked problems by acknowledging diverse sets of values and accounting for conflicting world views. Participatory modeling can incorporate both social and ecological dynamics into decision making that involves stakeholders, but is itself a complex social undertaking that may not yield precise or predictable outcomes. We explore the efficacy of different types of participatory modeling in relation to the integration of social values into ecosystem services frameworks and the generation of four important elements of social capital needed to address wicked problems: enhancing social learning and capacity building; increasing transparency; mediating power; and building trust. Our findings indicate that mediated modeling, group mapping, and mental/conceptual modeling are likely to generate elements of social capital that can improve ecosystem service frameworks. Participatory simulation, system dynamic modeling, and Bayesian belief networks, if utilized in isolation, were found to have a low likelihood of generating the social capital needed to improve ecosystem services frameworks. Scenario planning, companion modeling, group model building, and participatory mapping all generate a moderate to high level of social capital elements that improve the capacity of ecosystem service frameworks to address wicked problems.

AB Measures of body condition, immune function, and hematological health are widely used in ecological studies of vertebrate populations, predicated on the assumption that these traits are linked to fitness. However, compelling evidence that these traits actually predict long-term survival and reproductive success among individuals in the wild is lacking. Here, we show that body condition (i.e., size-adjusted body mass) and cutaneous immune responsiveness to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) injection among neonates positively predict recruitment and subsequent longevity in a wild, migratory population of House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon). However, neonates with intermediate hematocrit had the highest recruitment and longevity. Neonates with the highest PHA responsiveness and intermediate hematocrit prior to independence eventually produced the most offspring during their lifetime breeding on the study site. Importantly, the effects of PHA responsiveness and hematocrit were revealed while controlling for variation in body condition, sex, and environmental variation. Thus, our data demonstrate that body condition, cutaneous immune responsiveness, and hematocrit as a neonate are associated with individual fitness. Although hematocrit's effect is more complex than traditionally thought, our results suggest a previously underappreciated role for this trait in influencing survival in the wild.

AB Early Eocene (similar to 55-52 Ma) laminated lacustrine sediments overlying lignites in the Gurha Mine (27.87398 degrees N, 72.86709 degrees E), Rajasthan, India, yield a diversity of fossil leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds and insects. CLAMP (multivariate foliar physiognomic) analysis of two horizons separated by an estimated several tens of thousands of years of deposition indicates cool equatorial (similar to 10 degrees N) temperatures and a pronounced monsoon signature. A lower assemblage consisting of 54 leaf morphotypes and an upper assemblage of 57 leaf forms yielded mean annual temperatures (MAT) of 24.7 and 23.9 degrees C, respectively. The uncertainty (+/- 2.82 degrees C) means these temperature regimes are identical despite few similarities in the morphotypes between the two assemblages.The mean annual range of temperature (MART) was approximately 9.7 degrees C for both assemblages. When corrected for evapotranspirational cooling these temperature regimes are similar to those experienced today at 10 degrees N on the west coast of India and surprisingly cool for the tropics at a time of extreme global warmth. Growth was year round. The tropical to paratropical fossil floras also suggest a moist regime (80% annual relative humidity) and high mean annual precipitation of similar to 1800 mm for both assemblages but with a pronounced wet/dry seasonality indicative of a pronounced monsoonal regime. The lower assemblage has a stronger monsoon index (11.8) than the upper assemblage (8.8). The two assemblages seem to have been deposited less than 100 ka apart. This suggests that not only a pronounced South Asian monsoon existed when India and Asia first made contact, but also a variation in monsoon strength existed that cannot be ascribed to tectonic drivers.

AB The relationship between chlorophyll a (Chl a) and total phosphorus (TP) is a fundamental relationship in lakes that reflects multiple aspects of ecosystem function and is also used in the regulation and management of inland waters. The exact form of this relationship has substantial implications on its meaning and its use. We assembled a spatially extensive data set to examine whether nonlinear models are a better fit for Chl a TP relationships than traditional log-linear models, whether there were regional differences in the form of the relationships, and, if so, which regional factors were related to these differences. We analyzed a data set from 2105 temperate lakes across 35 ecoregions by fitting and comparing two different nonlinear models and one log-linear model. The two nonlinear models fit the data better than the log-linear model. In addition, the parameters for the best-fitting model varied among regions: the maximum and lower Chl a asymptotes were positively and negatively related to percent regional pasture land use, respectively, and the rate at which chlorophyll increased with TP was negatively related to percent regional wetland cover. Lakes in regions with more pasture fields had higher maximum chlorophyll concentrations at high TP concentrations but lower minimum chlorophyll concentrations at low TP concentrations. Lakes in regions with less wetland cover showed a steeper Chl a-TP relationship than wetland-rich regions. Interpretation of Chl a-TP relationships depends on regional differences, and theory and management based on a monolithic relationship may be inaccurate.

AB Little is known about the role of plant functional diversity for ecosystem-level carbon (C) fluxes. To fill this knowledge gap, we translocated monoliths hosting communities with four and 16 sown species from a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment ('The Jena Experiment') into a controlled environment facility for ecosystem research (Ecotron). This allowed quantifying the effects of plant diversity on ecosystem C fluxes as well as three parameters of C uptake efficiency (water and nitrogen use efficiencies and apparent quantum yield). By combining data on ecosystem C fluxes with vegetation structure and functional trait-based predictors, we found that increasing plant species and functional diversity led to higher gross and net ecosystem C uptake rates. Path analyses and light response curves unravelled the diversity of leaf nitrogen concentration in the canopy as a key functional predictor of C fluxes, either directly or indirectly via LAI and aboveground biomass.

AB After centuries of population decline and range contraction, gray wolves (Canis lupus) are now expanding in Europe. Understanding wolf social structure and population dynamics and predicting their future range expansion is mandatory to design sound conservation strategies, but field monitoring methods are difficult or exceedingly expensive. Noninvasive genetic sampling offers unique opportunities for the reliable monitoring of wolf populations. We conducted a 9-year-long monitoring program in a large area (approximately 19,171 km(2)) in northern Italy, aiming to identify individuals, estimate kinship, reconstruct packs, and describe their dynamics. Of 5,065 biological samples (99% scats), we genotyped and sexed 44% reliably using 12 unlinked autosomal microsatellites, 4 Y-linked microsatellites, and a diagnostic mitochondrial DNA control-region sequence. We identified 414 wolves, 88 dogs, and 16 wolf X dog hybrids. Wolves in the study area belonged to at least 42 packs. We reconstructed the genealogy of 26 packs. The mean pack size was 5.6 +/- 2.4 SD, including adoptees, with a mean minimum pack home range of 74 km(2) +/- 52 SD. We detected turnovers of breeding pairs in 19% of the packs. Reproductive wolves were unrelated and unrelated dispersers founded new packs, except for 1 pack founded by a brother sister pair. We did not detect multiple breeding females in any packs. Overall, the population was not inbred. We found significant isolation by distance and spatial autocorrelation, with nonrandom genetic structure up to a distance of approximately 17 km. We detected 37 dispersers, 14 of which became breeders in new or already existing packs. Our results can be used to model habitat use by wolves, to estimate survival rates, to predict future expansion of the wolf population, and to build risk maps of wolf human conflicts.

AB Altitudinal gradients offer valuable study systems to investigate how adaptive genetic diversity is distributed within and between natural populations and which factors promote or prevent adaptive differentiation. The environmental clines along altitudinal gradients tend to be steep relative to the dispersal distance of many organisms, providing an opportunity to study the joint effects of divergent natural selection and gene flow. Temperature is one variable showing consistent altitudinal changes, and altitudinal gradients can therefore provide spatial surrogates for some of the changes anticipated under climate change. Here, we investigate the extent and patterns of adaptive divergence in animal populations along altitudinal gradients by surveying the literature for (i) studies on phenotypic variation assessed under common garden or reciprocal transplant designs and (ii) studies looking for signatures of divergent selection at the molecular level. Phenotypic data show that significant between-population differences are common and taxonomically widespread, involving traits such as mass, wing size, tolerance to thermal extremes and melanization. Several lines of evidence suggest that some of the observed differences are adaptively relevant, but rigorous tests of local adaptation or the link between specific phenotypes and fitness are sorely lacking. Evidence for a role of altitudinal adaptation also exists for a number of candidate genes, most prominently haemoglobin, and for anonymous molecular markers. Novel genomic approaches may provide valuable tools for studying adaptive diversity, also in species that are not amenable to experimentation.

AB Spatial variation in the direction of selection drives the evolution of adaptive differentiation. However, few experimental studies have examined the relative importance of different environmental factors for variation in selection and evolutionary trajectories in natural populations. Here, we combine 8 y of observational data and field experiments to assess the relative importance of mutualistic and antagonistic interactions for spatial variation in selection and short-term evolution of a genetically based floral display dimorphism in the short-lived perennial herb Primula farinosa. Natural populations of this species include two floral morphs: long-scaped plants that present their flowers well above the ground and short-scaped plants with flowers positioned close to the ground. The direction and magnitude of selection on scape morph varied among populations, and so did the frequency of the short morph (median 19%, range 0-100%; n = 69 populations). A field experiment replicated at four sites demonstrated that variation in the strength of interactions with grazers and pollinators were responsible for among-population differences in relative fitness of the two morphs. Selection exerted by grazers favored the short-scaped morph, whereas pollinator-mediated selection favored the long-scaped morph. Moreover, variation in selection among natural populations was associated with differences in morph frequency change, and the experimental removal of grazers at nine sites significantly reduced the frequency of the short-scaped morph over 8 y. The results demonstrate that spatial variation in intensity of grazing and pollination produces a selection mosaic, and that changes in biotic interactions can trigger rapid genetic changes in natural plant populations.

AB Natural genetic variation is essential for the adaptation of organisms to their local environment and to changing environmental conditions. Here, we examine genomewide patterns of nucleotide variation in natural populations of the outcrossing herb Arabidopsis halleri and associations with climatic variation among populations in the Alps. Using a pooled population sequencing (Pool-Seq) approach, we discovered more than two million SNPs in five natural populations and identified highly differentiated genomic regions and SNPs using F-ST-based analyses. We tested only the most strongly differentiated SNPs for associations with a nonredundant set of environmental factors using partial Mantel tests to identify topo-climatic factors that may underlie the observed footprints of selection. Possible functions of genes showing signatures of selection were identified by Gene Ontology analysis. We found 175 genes to be highly associated with one or more of the five tested topo-climatic factors. Of these, 23.4% had unknown functions. Genetic variation in four candidate genes was strongly associated with site water balance and solar radiation, and functional annotations were congruent with these environmental factors. Our results provide a genomewide perspective on the distribution of adaptive genetic variation in natural plant populations from a highly diverse and heterogeneous alpine environment.

AB Aim: We identify the main forest vegetation types in Taiwan, provide their formal definitions and describe their species composition, habitat affinities and distribution.
   Location: Taiwan.
   Methods: A data set of 9822 vegetation plots with environmental characteristics recorded in the field or derived from digital maps in GIS was compiled from historical literature and an extensive field survey. Using expert knowledge, 6574 of these plots were used to build a classification into broad vegetation types. The units of the resulting classification were formally defined using a Cocktail determination key, which can be used for the automatic assignment of new vegetation plots to these vegetation types.
   Results: Twelve vegetation types of zonal forests and nine types of azonal forests were distinguished. Zonal types in the subtropical region, from high mountains to foothills, are Juniperus subalpine coniferous woodland, Abies-Tsuga upper-montane coniferous forest, Chamaecyparis montane mixed cloud forest, Fagus montane deciduous broad-leaved cloud forest, Quercus montane evergreen broad-leaved cloud forest, Machilus-Castanopsis sub-montane evergreen broad-leaved forest, Phoebe-Machilus sub-montane evergreen broad-leaved forest and Ficus-Machilus semi-evergreen foothill forest. Zonal types in the tropical region, from high mountains to foothills, are Pasania-Elaeocarpus montane evergreen broad-leaved cloud forest, Drypetes-Helicia sub-montane evergreen broad-leaved forest, Dysoxylum-Machilus foothill evergreen broad-leaved forest and Aglaia-Ficus foothill evergreen broad-leaved forest. Azonal types are Illicium-Cyclobalanopsis tropical winter monsoon forest, Pyrenaria-Machilus subtropical winter monsoon forest, Diospyros-Champereia tropical rock-outcrop forest, Zelkova-Quercus subtropical rock-outcrop forest, Pinus successional woodland, Alnus successional woodland, Trema-Mallotus successional woodland, Scaevola-Hibiscus seashore woodland and Kandelia mangrove.
   Conclusions: The diversity of forest vegetation in Taiwan is strongly structured by the temperature and moisture gradient. Along the temperature gradient, five altitudinal zones can be recognized. Azonal forest types develop at sites affected by the winter monsoon, on steep slopes, rocky soils, in seashore saline habitats and in places disturbed by fire, landslides and human activities. Zonal vegetation contains a higher ratio of endemic and Pacific species and occurs in wetter habitats, whereas azonal vegetation contains co-existing species from different regions and usually occurs in drier habitats.

AB Aim Assessing long-term (1992-2009) trends of littoral invertebrate and phytoplankton metacommunities in boreal lakes with emphasis on separating the nestedness and turnover components of beta diversity. Deriving implications for regional biodiversity conservation and management, based on a data-intensive approach with high ecological realism. Location Sweden (Northern Europe). Methods A recently published method was used to partition beta diversity into species turnover and nestedness components. Regression analyses were used to test for monotonic temporal change of these diversity fractions through time. Associations between the temporal diversity patterns of taxonomic groups and environmental variables were studied using correlation analyses. Results Turnover of both metacommunities increased monotonically over the study period, while nestedness decreased. In invertebrates, these changes correlated mainly with regional changes in acidity, while phytoplankton responded more to changing water clarity. Nestedness and turnover patterns were inversely correlated in both groups, but neither turnover nor nestedness was correlated between invertebrates and phytoplankton. Nestedness of both groups explained a lower percentage of the partitioned variance compared with turnover. Main conclusion Results suggest that all lakes contribute more equally to regional diversity over time and are, as a result, all potential targets of management actions. Not only is a regional conservation strategy logistically difficult, it is also a financially expensive expectation.

AB Soil phosphorus (P) composition changes with ecosystem development, leading to changes in P bioavailability and ecosystem properties. Little is known, however, about how soil P transformations proceed with ecosystem development in boreal regions.
   We used 1-dimensional P-31 and 2-dimensional H-1, P-31 correlation nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to characterise soil organic P transformations in humus horizons across a 7,800 year-old chronosequence in Vasterbotten, northern Sweden.
   Total soil P concentration varied little along the chronosequence, but P compounds followed three trends. Firstly, the concentrations of DNA, 2-aminoethyl phosphonic acid, and polyphosphate, increased up to 1,200-2,700 years and then declined. Secondly, the abundances of alpha- and beta-glycerophosphate, nucleotides, and pyrophosphate, were higher at the youngest site compared with all other sites. Lastly, concentrations of inositol hexakisphosphate fluctuated with site age. The largest changes in soil P composition tended to occur in young sites which also experience the largest shifts in plant community composition.
   The apparent lack of change in total soil P is consistent with the youth and nitrogen limited nature of the Vasterbotten chronosequence. Based on 2D NMR spectra, around 40 % of extractable soil organic P appeared to occur in live microbial cells. The observed trends in soil organic P may be related to shifts in plant community composition (and associated changes in soil microorganisms) along the studied chronosequence, but further studies are needed to confirm this.

AB Large mammalian herbivores (LMH) strongly influence plant communities, and these effects can propagate indirectly throughout food webs. Most existing large-scale manipulations of LMH presence/absence consist of a single exclusion treatment, and few are replicated across environmental gradients. Thus, important questions remain about the functional roles of different LMH, and how these roles depend on abiotic context. In September 2008, we constructed a series of 1-ha herbivore-exclusion plots across a 20-km rainfall gradient in central Kenya. Dubbed "UHURU" (Ungulate Herbivory Under Rainfall Uncertainty), this experiment aims to illuminate the ecological effects of three size classes of LMH, and how rainfall regimes shape the direction and magnitude of these effects. UHURU consists of four treatments: total-exclusion (all ungulate herbivores), mesoherbivore-exclusion (LMH >120-cm tall), megaherbivore-exclusion (elephants and giraffes), and unfenced open plots. Each treatment is replicated three times at three locations ("sites") along the rainfall gradient: low (440 mm/year), intermediate (580 mm/year), and high (640 mm/year). There was limited variation across sites in soil attributes and LMH activity levels. Understory-plant cover was greater in plots without mesoherbivores, but did not respond strongly to the exclusion of megaherbivores, or to the additional exclusion of dik-dik and warthog. Eleven of the thirteen understory plant species that responded significantly to exclusion treatment were more common in exclusion plots than open ones. Significant interactions between site and treatment on plant communities, although uncommon, suggested that differences between treatments may be greater at sites with lower rainfall. Browsers reduced densities of several common overstory species, along with growth rates of the three dominant Acacia species. Small-mammal densities were 2-3 times greater in total-exclusion than in open plots at all sites. Although we expect patterns to become clearer with time, results from 2008-2012 show that the effects of excluding successively smaller-bodied subsets of the LMH community are generally non-additive for a given response variable, and inconsistent across response variables, indicating that the different LMH size classes are not functionally redundant. Several response variables showed significant treatment-by-site interactions, suggesting that the nature of plant-herbivore interactions can vary across restricted spatial scales.

AB Total income and income from forest resources among rural dwellers in tropical forest regions are influenced not only by market access, prices, but also organizational, institutional, and social factors. These factors influence the diversity of resources to which the poor have access and result in specializations in livelihood strategies. We analyzed the relation between forest dependence and livelihood strategies in the Bolivian Amazon, applying the SLF. We tested for the differences across strategies with respect to financial, human, physical, social, and natural livelihood assets. Results show that forest income is highly related to cash income from Brazil nut, while income from agriculture and timber exploitation is associated with higher levels of education. Brazil nuts serve as a safety net and start-up capital for certain livelihood strategies in our study region. Livelihood strategies that are based on the commercialization of multiple products from forests and agriculture and services inside and outside communities depend less on forests. Livelihoods can be supported by investing in sustainable livelihood asset endowments. Our results demonstrate that activities that aim to support community forest management and to enhance household income should explicitly consider a differentiated support for different strategies. This will result in a more effective outcome of development efforts from which the poorest people would benefit most. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The megadiverse haplochromine cichlid radiations of the East African lakes, famous examples of explosive speciation and adaptive radiation, are according to recent studies, introgressed by different riverine lineages. This study is based on the first comprehensive mitochondrial and nuclear DNA dataset from extensive sampling of riverine haplochromine cichlids. It includes species from the lower River Congo and Angolan (River Kwanza) drainages. Reconstruction of phylogenetic hypotheses revealed the paradox of clearly discordant phylogenetic signals. Closely related mtDNA haplotypes are distributed thousands of kilometres apart and across major African watersheds, whereas some neighbouring species carry drastically divergent mtDNA haplotypes. At shallow and deep phylogenetic layers, strong signals of hybridization are attributed to the complex Late Miocene/Early Pliocene palaeohistory of African rivers. Hybridization of multiple lineages across changing watersheds shaped each of the major haplochromine radiations in lakes Tanganyika, Victoria, Malawi and the Kalahari Palaeolakes, as well as a miniature species flock in the Congo basin (River Fwa). On the basis of our results, introgression occurred not only on a spatially restricted scale, but massively over almost the whole range of the haplochromine distribution. This provides an alternative view on the origin and exceptional high diversity of this enigmatic vertebrate group.

AB Successions are a central issue of ecological theory. They are governed by changes in community assembly processes that can be tracked by species traits. While single-trait-based approaches have been mostly promoted to address community assembly, ecological strategies actually encompass tradeoffs between multiple traits that are relevant to succession theory. We analyzed plant ecological strategies along a 140-year-long succession primary succession of 52 vertical outcrop communities after roadwork. We performed a RLQ analysis to relate six functional traits, associated with resource acquisition, competition, colonization ability and phenology, to the age of the outcrops. We found the prominence of two main axes of specialization, one related to resource acquisition and the other to reproduction and regeneration. We further examined the community-level variation in ecological strategies to assess the abiotic and biotic drivers of community assembly. Using trait-based statistics of functional richness, regularity and divergence, we found that different processes drove the variation in ecological strategies along the axes of specialization. In late succession, functional convergence was detected for the traits related to resource acquisition as a signature of habitat filtering, while the coexistence of contrasted strategies was found for the traits related to reproduction and regeneration as a result of spatial micro-heterogeneity. We observed a lack of niche differentiation along the succession, revealing a weak importance of biotic interactions for the regulation of community assembly in the outcrops. Overall, we highlight a prominent role of habitat filtering and spatial micro-heterogeneity in driving the primary succession governed by water and nutrient limitation.

AB The main goal of species distribution modeling is to identify important underlying factors related to broad-scale ecological patterns in order to make meaningful explanations or accurate predictions. When standard statistical methods such as regression are used to formulate these models, assumptions about the spatial structure of the data and the model parameters are often violated. Autocorrelation and non-stationarity are characteristics of spatial data and models, respectively, and if present and unaccounted for in model development, they can result in poorly specified models as well as inappropriate spatial inference and prediction. While these spatial issues are addressed here in an ecological context using species distribution models, they are broadly relevant to any statistical modeling applications using spatial data.

AB Habitat size and isolation are considered important drivers for the persistence of insects in fragmented landscapes. In contrast, habitat quality and the composition of the landscape matrix have only recently received more attention. To investigate the effects of habitat area, functional connectivity, landscape context and habitat quality, we analyzed species richness and density of butterfly communities in pre-alpine calcareous grasslands. Through standardized transect walks in meadows (n = 26), pastures (n = 12), and recently abandoned grasslands (n = 8), we sampled butterflies and burner moths, as well as environmental parameters. Habitat specialist species were found in higher numbers if the habitat patches were surrounded by forests rather than non-habitat grasslands. Furthermore, the number of host plants had a positive influence on butterfly diversity and density. Habitat generalists were not affected by any of the landscape variables, but had higher species numbers and densities if the abundance of nectar plants was higher. In contrast to other studies, we showed that the impact of habitat quality on butterfly communities is more important than landscape effects. The proportion of calcareous grassland in our study region seemed to generally be too high to observe fragmentation effects. Contrary to expectations, surrounding forest increased the species richness of habitat specialists in the habitat patch. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Questions Is there evidence for biotic homogenization of upland vegetation? Do the magnitude and nature of floristic and compositional change vary between vegetation types? What can be inferred about the drivers responsible for the observed changes? Location Upland heath, mire and grassland communities of the northwest Highlands of Scotland, UK. Methods We re-survey plots first described in a phytosociological study of 19561958 to assess the changes in plant species composition over the last 50 yr in five major upland vegetation types. Using a combination of multivariate analysis, dissimilarity measures, diversity metrics and published data on species attributes; we quantify, characterize and link potential drivers of environmental change with the observed changes in species composition. Results Grassland and heath vegetation declined in species richness and variation in community composition, while mires showed little change. Previously distinct vegetation types became more similar in composition, characterized by the increased dominance of generalist upland graminoids and reduced dwarf-shrub, forb and lichen cover, although novel assemblages were not apparent. Species with an oceanic distribution increased at the expense of those with an arctic-montane distribution. Temperature, precipitation and acidity were found to be potentially important in explaining changes in species composition: species that had undergone the greatest increases had a preference for warmer, drier and more acidic conditions. Conclusions The vegetation of the northwest Scottish Highlands has undergone marked biotic homogenization over the last 50 yr, manifested through a loss of various aspects of diversity at the local, community and landscape scales. The magnitude of change varies between vegetation types, although the nature of change shows many similar characteristics. Analyses of species attributes suggest these changes are driven by climate warming and acidification, although over-grazing may also be important. This study highlights the importance of the link between the loss of plant diversity and homogenization at multiple scales, and demonstrates that boreal heath communities are particularly at risk from these processes.

AB Transient lulls in air movement are rarely measured, but can cause leaf temperature to rise rapidly to critical levels. The high heat capacity of thick leaves can damp this rapid change in temperature. However, little is known about the extent to which increased leaf thickness can reduce thermal damage, or how thick leaves would need to be to have biological significance. We evaluated quantitatively the contribution of small increases in leaf thickness to the reduction in thermal damage during critically low wind speeds under desert conditions.
   e employed a numerical model to investigate the effect of thickness relative to transpiration, absorptance and leaf size on damage avoidance. We used measured traits and thermotolerance thresholds of real leaves to calculate the leaf temperature response to naturally occurring variable low wind speed.
   Our results demonstrated that an increase in thickness of only fractions of a millimetre can prevent excursions to damaging high temperatures. This damping effect of increased thickness was greatest when other means of reducing leaf temperature (transpiration, reflectance or reduced size) were lacking.
   For perennial desert flora, we propose that increased leaf thickness is important in decreasing the incidence of extreme heat stress and, in some species, in enhancing long-term survival.

AB Aim Existing climate envelope models give an indication of broad scale shifts in distribution, but do not specifically provide information on likely future population changes useful for conservation prioritization and planning. We demonstrate how these techniques can be developed to model likely future changes in absolute density and population size as a result of climate change.
   Location Great Britain.
   Methods Generalized linear models were used to model breeding densities of two northerly- and two southerly-distributed bird species as a function of climate and land use. Models were built using count data from extensive national bird monitoring data and incorporated detectability to estimate absolute abundance. Projections of likely future changes in the distribution and abundance of these species were made by applying these models to projections of future climate change under two emissions scenarios.
   Results Models described current spatial variation in abundance for three of the four species and produced modelled current estimates of national populations that were similar to previously published estimates for all species. Climate change was projected to result in national population declines in the two northerly-distributed species, with declines for Eurasian curlew Numenius arquata projected to be particularly severe. Conversely, the abundances of the two southerly distributed species were projected to increase nationally. Projected maps of future abundance may be used to identify priority areas for the future conservation of each species.
   Main conclusions The analytical methods provide a framework to make projections of impacts of climate change on species abundance, rather than simply projected range changes. Outputs may be summarized at any spatial scale, providing information to inform future conservation planning at national, regional and local scales. Results suggest that as a consequence of climate change, northerly distributed bird species in Great Britain are likely to become an increasingly high conservation priority within the UK.

AB 1. Grassland ecosystems are often used to generate biomass in temperate regions of the world. It is well known that biomass is influenced by climate and biodiversity, but the relative importance of these two factors in relation to management has not been widely studied. To recommend management treatments maximizing biomass yields we aim to quantify the relative effects of climate species and functional diversity on biomass in differently managed grasslands.
   2. We studied the development of biomass yields over the last 37 years on a grassland site in Germany, with mowing at five frequencies (one to eight times per year), each with and without fertilization. We measured plant species richness (SR) and functional richness (FR) (the diversity of functional species properties) using presence-absence indices. We also measured species evenness (SE), functional evenness and functional divergence (FD) using abundance weighted indices. Climate was included as the mean temperature and sum of precipitation during the growing period. By relating biomass to the above-mentioned climatic and biodiversity parameters, we extracted the contribution of these to biomass yields.
   3. Biomass changed over time for all treatments and was maximal at intermediate mowing frequencies. Temporal changes in biomass were partly explained by climate and different aspects of biodiversity, although this differed significantly between treatments. The relative importance of precipitation was highest at high mowing frequencies; the contribution of temperature was highest on less disturbed, unfertilized plots. FR and SR influenced biomass changes in the most intensive disturbance regimes on unfertilized and fertilized plots respectively. FD was most important on intensively disturbed, fertilized plots. SE influenced biomass at low mowing frequencies.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Climate, species and functional diversity influence annual grassland biomass yields but their importance depends on nutrient status and management frequency. Our results indicate that management treatments with intermediate disturbance regimes will maximize biomass yields in temperate environments. This recommendation may become even more important in the context of climate change: at intermediate mowing frequencies the influence of climatic variables on biomass is less important by comparison to different aspects of biodiversity.

AB Subsurface amendments of slow-release substrates (e. g., emulsified vegetable oil [EVO]) are thought to be a pragmatic alternative to using short-lived, labile substrates for sustained uranium bioimmobilization within contaminated groundwater systems. Spatial and temporal dynamics of subsurface microbial communities during EVO amendment are unknown and likely differ significantly from those of populations stimulated by soluble substrates, such as ethanol and acetate. In this study, a one-time EVO injection resulted in decreased groundwater U concentrations that remained below initial levels for approximately 4 months. Pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR of 16S rRNA from monitoring well samples revealed a rapid decline in groundwater bacterial community richness and diversity after EVO injection, concurrent with increased 16S rRNA copy levels, indicating the selection of a narrow group of taxa rather than a broad community stimulation. Members of the Firmicutes family Veillonellaceae dominated after injection and most likely catalyzed the initial oil decomposition. Sulfate-reducing bacteria from the genus Desulforegula, known for long-chain fatty acid oxidation to acetate, also dominated after EVO amendment. Acetate and H-2 production during EVO degradation appeared to stimulate NO3-, Fe(III), U(VI), and SO42- reduction by members of the Comamonadaceae, Geobacteriaceae, and Desulfobacterales. Methanogenic archaea flourished late to comprise over 25% of the total microbial community. Bacterial diversity rebounded after 9 months, although community compositions remained distinct from the preamendment conditions. These results demonstrated that a one-time EVO amendment served as an effective electron donor source for in situ U(VI) bioreduction and that subsurface EVO degradation and metal reduction were likely mediated by successive identifiable guilds of organisms.

AB Although ecology and biogeography had common origins in the natural history of the nineteenth century, they diverged substantially during the early twentieth century as ecology became increasingly hypothesis-driven and experimental. This mechanistic focus narrowed ecology's purview to local scales of time and space, and mostly excluded large-scale phenomena and historical explanations. In parallel, biogeography became more analytical with the acceptance of plate tectonics and the development of phylogenetic systematics, and began to pay more attention to ecological factors that influence large-scale distributions. This trend towards unification exposed problems with terms such as 'community' and 'niche,' in part because ecologists began to view ecological communities as open systems within the contexts of history and geography. The papers in this issue represent biogeographic and ecological perspectives and address the general themes of (i) the niche, (ii) comparative ecology and macroecology, (iii) community assembly, and (iv) diversity. The integration of ecology and biogeography clearly is a natural undertaking that is based on evolutionary biology, has developed its own momentum, and which promises novel, synthetic approaches to investigating ecological systems and their variation over the surface of the Earth. We offer suggestions on future research directions at the intersection of biogeography and ecology.

AB The United Kingdom (UK) Government has national and international commitments to tackle the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010. Biodiversity indicators are used to measure and communicate progress in meeting these commitments. From 2005 onwards, butterflies have been adopted as Governmental biodiversity indicators in England, Scotland and for the UK as a whole. The indicators are compiled using butterfly abundance data collected through the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, at a network of site established from 1976 onwards. The indicators show that butterfly numbers have fluctuated considerably from year-to-year, though analysis of the underlying smoothed multi-species trends for (habitat) 'specialist' species show significant long-term declines in each country since the 1970s. Trends in wider countryside 'generalist' species vary at the country-level from little or no overall change in Scotland and across the UK, to declines over selected years in England. Comparisons of changes in butterfly abundance before and after the 2010 target was set in 2002 suggest that the rate of decline at the UK-level is increasing for specialist species. In spite of large amounts of investment since 2000 to improve the habitat condition of protected areas, the trend for butterfly populations is no different in protected areas compared to elsewhere. Analysis by policy sector in England, shows that butterflies are declining rapidly in both forestry land and farmland, although in the latter habitat type, improvements are being seen on land entered into agri-environment schemes. We conclude by assessing the extent to which butterflies may represent broader biodiversity and help inform and evaluate conservation policy.

AB The Great Plains of North America evolved with significant influence from bison (Bison bison), but is presently dominated by cattle (Bos taurus). While there are a variety of opinions concerning differences between these two species, there is a lack of scientific comparisons, including those that incorporate important ecological variation. We developed a framework to study and compare the grazing behavior and effects of bison and cattle within grassland ecosystems. Environmental (e.g., resource distribution, disturbance) and animal (e.g., number, social organization) factors play a critical role in determining grazing effects and should be incorporated into discussions that compare the effects of bison and cattle. Using this framework we specifically compare the grazing behavior of both species in tallgrass prairie and discuss the implications of these differences in the context of conservation. We collared bison and cattle with global positioning systems and used resource selection functions to estimate the importance of various environmental factors on site selection. Both species preferred recently burned areas and avoided steeper slopes. Cattle selected areas that were closer to water, while bison were not limited by distance to water; cattle also preferred areas with woody vegetation, while bison avoided them. Incorporating broad scale environmental complexity allows for an effective comparison of ecological differences between bison and cattle. While there are similarities and differences in these species, a comprehensive analysis of all conditions and scenarios is not possible. It is clear, however, that the greatest differences between these species will likely be evident from broad scale studies across complex landscapes. In addition to species, conservation and land managers need to consider other environmental factors that are critical to grazing effects and overall conservation.

AB As policymakers and managers work to mitigate the effects of rapid anthropogenic environmental changes, they need to consider organisms' responses. In light of recent evidence that evolution can be quite rapid, this now includes evolutionary responses. Evolutionary principles have a long history in conservation biology, and the necessary next step for the field is to consider ways in which conservation policy makers and managers can proactively manipulate evolutionary processes to achieve their goals. In this review, we aim to illustrate the potential conservation benefits of an increased understanding of evolutionary history and prescriptive manipulation of three basic evolutionary factors: selection, variation, and gene flow. For each, we review and propose ways that policy makers and managers can use evolutionary thinking to preserve threatened species, combat pest species, or reduce undesirable evolutionary changes. Such evolution-based management has potential to be a highly efficient and consistent way to create greater ecological resilience to widespread, rapid, and multifaceted environmental change.

AB P>1. Understanding and accurately predicting the spatial patterns of habitat use by organisms is important for ecological research, biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. However, this understanding is complicated by the effects of spatial scale, because the scale of analysis affects the quantification of species-environment relationships.
   2. We therefore assessed the influence of environmental context (i.e. the characteristics of the landscape surrounding a site), varied over a large range of scales (i.e. ambit radii around focal sites), on the analysis and prediction of habitat selection by African elephants in Kruger National Park, South Africa.
   3. We focused on the spatial scaling of the elephants' response to their main resources, forage and water, and found that the quantification of habitat selection strongly depended on the scales at which environmental context was considered. Moreover, the inclusion of environmental context at characteristic scales (i.e. those at which habitat selectivity was maximized) increased the predictive capacity of habitat suitability models.
   4. The elephants responded to their environment in a scale-dependent and perhaps hierarchical manner, with forage characteristics driving habitat selection at coarse spatial scales, and surface water at fine spatial scales.
   5. Furthermore, the elephants exhibited sexual habitat segregation, mainly in relation to vegetation characteristics. Male elephants preferred areas with high tree cover and low herbaceous biomass, whereas this pattern was reversed for female elephants.
   6. We show that the spatial distribution of elephants can be better understood and predicted when scale-dependent species-environment relationships are explicitly considered. This demonstrates the importance of considering the influence of spatial scale on the analysis of spatial patterning in ecological phenomena.

AB 1. New patterns and trends in land use are becoming increasingly evident in Europe's heavily modified landscape and else whereas sustainable agriculture and nature restoration are developed as viable long-term alternatives to intensively farmed arable land. The success of these changes depends on how soil biodiversity and processes respond to changes in management. To improve our understanding of the community structure and ecosystem functioning of the soil biota, we analyzed abiotic variables across 200 sites, and biological variables across 170 sites in The Netherlands, one of the most intensively farmed countries. The data were derived from the Dutch Soil Quality Network (DSQN), a long-term monitoring framework designed to obtain ecological insight into soil types (STs) and ecosystem types (ETs).
   2. At the outset we describe STs and biota, and we estimate the contribution of various groups to the provision of ecosystem services. We focused on interactive effects of soil properties on community patterns and ecosystem functioning using food web models. Ecologists analyze soil food webs by means of mechanistic and statistical modelling, linking network structure to energy flow and elemental dynamics commonly based on allometric scaling.
   3. We also explored how predatory and metabolic processes are constrained by body size, diet and metabolic type, and how these constraints govern the interactions within and between trophic groups. In particular, we focused on how elemental fluxes determine the strengths of ecological interactions, and the resulting ecosystem services, in terms of sustenance of soil fertility.
   4. We discuss data mining, food web visualizations, and an appropriate categorical way to capture subtle interrelationships within the DSQN dataset. Sampled metazoans were used to provide an overview of below-ground processes and influences of land use. Unlike most studies to date we used data from the entire size spectrum, across 15 orders of magnitude, using body size as a continuous trait crucial for understanding ecological services.
   5. Multimodality in the frequency distributions of body size represents a performance filter that acts as a buffer to environmental change. Large differences in the body-size distributions across ETs and STs were evident. Most observed trends support the hypothesis that the direct influence of ecological stoichiometry on the soil biota as an independent predictor (e.g. in the form of nutrient to carbon ratios), and consequently on the allometric scaling, is more dominant than either ET or ST. This provides opportunities to develop a mechanistic and physiologically oriented model for the distribution of species' body sizes, where responses of invertebrates can be predicted.
   6. Our results highlight the different roles that organisms play in a number of key ecosystem services. Such a trait-based research has unique strengths in its rigorous formulation of fundamental scaling rules, as well as in its verifiability by empirical data. Nonetheless, it still has weaknesses that remain to be addressed, like the consequences of intraspecific size variation, the high degree of omnivory, and a possibly inaccurate assignment to trophic groups.
   7. Studying the extent to which nutrient levels influence multitrophic interactions and how different land-use regimes affect soil biodiversity is clearly a fruitful area for future research to develop predictive models for soil ecosystem services under different management regimes. No similar efforts have been attempted previously for soil food webs, and our dataset has the potential to test and further verify its usefulness at an unprecedented space scale.

AB Effective signal transmission is essential for communication. In environments where signal transmission is highly variable, signalers may utilize complex signals, which incorporate multiple components and modalities, to maintain effective communication. Male Rabidosa rabida wolf spiders produce complex courtship signals, consisting of both visual and seismic components. We test the hypothesis that the complex signaling of R. rabida contributes to male reproductive success in variable signaling environments. We first examine the condition-dependence of foreleg ornamentation (a presumed visual signal) and seismic signal components and find that both may provide potentially redundant information on foraging history. Next, we assessed reproductive success across manipulated signaling environments that varied in the effectiveness of visual and/or seismic signal transmission. In environments where only one signal could be successfully transmitted (e. g., visual or seismic), pairs were still able to successfully copulate. Additionally, we found that males altered their courtship display depending on the current signaling environment. Specifically, males reduced their use of a visual display component in signaling environments where visual signal transmission was ablated. Incorporating signals in multiple modalities not only enables R. rabida males to maintain copulation success across variable signaling environments, but it also enables males to adjust their composite courtship display to current signaling conditions [Current Zoology 57 (2): 175-186, 2011].

AB Fungus-growing (attine) ants and their fungal symbionts passed through several evolutionary transitions during their 50 million year old evolutionary history. The basal attine lineages often shifted between two main cultivar clades, whereas the derived higher-attine lineages maintained an association with a monophyletic clade of specialized symbionts. In conjunction with the transition to specialized symbionts, the ants advanced in colony size and social complexity. Here we provide a comparative study of the functional specialization in extracellular enzyme activities in fungus gardens across the attine phylogeny. We show that, relative to sister clades, gardens of higher-attine ants have enhanced activity of protein-digesting enzymes, whereas gardens of leaf-cutting ants also have increased activity of starch-digesting enzymes. However, the enzyme activities of lower-attine fungus gardens are targeted primarily toward partial degradation of plant cell walls, reflecting a plesiomorphic state of nondomesticated fungi. The enzyme profiles of the higher-attine and leaf-cutting gardens appear particularly suited to digest fresh plant materials and to access nutrients from live cells without major breakdown of cell walls. The adaptive significance of the lower-attine symbiont shifts remains unclear. One of these shifts was obligate, but digestive advantages remained ambiguous, whereas the other remained facultative despite providing greater digestive efficiency.

AB Vegetation mapping of plant communities at fine spatial scales is increasingly supported by remote sensing technology. However, combining ecological ground truth information and remote sensing datasets for mapping approaches is complicated by the complexity of ecological datasets. In this study, we present a new approach that uses high spatial resolution hyperspectral datasets to map vegetation units of a semiarid rangeland in Central Namibia. Field vegetation surveys provide the input to the workflow presented in this study. The collected data were classified by hierarchical cluster analysis into seven vegetation units that reflect different ecological states occurring in the study area. Spectral indices covering vegetation and soil characteristics were calculated from hyperspectral remote sensing imagery and used as environmental variables in a constrained ordination by applying redundancy analysis (RDA). The resulting statistical relationships between vegetation data and spectral indices were transferred into images of ordination axes, which were subsequently used in a supervised fuzzy c-means classification approach relying on a k-NN distance metric. Membership images for each vegetation unit as well as a confusion image of the classification result allowed a sound ecological interpretation of the resulting hard classification map. Classification results were validated with two independent reference datasets. For an internal and external validation dataset, overall accuracy reached 98% and 64% with kappa values of 0.98 and 0.53, respectively. Critical steps during the mapping workflow were highlighted and compared with similar mapping approaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Forest management has been criticised in the last 20 years for its negative impact on the native species, structures and functions of the forest. Of many possible alternatives proposed to minimize these effects, the functional zoning (or TRIAD) approach is gaining popularity in North America. The goal of this approach is to minimize the negative environmental impacts of forestry while maintain timber supply by dividing the forest into three broad land-use zones: (1) conservation, (2) ecosystem management, and (3) wood production. In this study, we used a spatially explicit landscape model to simulate the effects of fire and six different forest management scenarios on a boreal mixedwood forest management unit in central Quebec. The management scenarios examined included the current practices scenario, a scenario proposed by the provincial governments and four TRIAD scenarios varying in the amount of forest allocated to each of the three zones. For each scenario, we examined the harvest volume, percentage old-growth forest or old forest managed to favour old-growth attributes, and effective mesh size of forest patches by 20-year age classes. With more area set aside for conservation and high-retention partial cut harvesting techniques designed to maintain the attributes of old-growth stands, all TRIAD scenarios resulted in higher percentages of stands with old-growth attributes than the current practices scenario and the government proposed scenario, and two of the four TRIAD scenarios also resulted in higher harvest volume over the long term. All forest management scenarios resulted in significantly lower effective mesh size than the fire-only scenario, but this difference was not as pronounced for the four TRIAD scenarios as for the current practice and government proposed scenarios. We conclude that the TRIAD approach has the potential to minimize some of the negative impacts of forestry on the landscape, while maintaining timber supply over the long term. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Trophic scaling models describe how topological food-web properties such as the number of predator prey links scale with species richness of the community. Early models predicted that either the link density (i.e. the number of links per species) or the connectance (i.e. the linkage probability between any pair of species) is constant across communities. More recent analyses, however, suggest that both these scaling models have to be rejected, and we discuss several hypotheses that aim to explain the scale dependence of these complexity parameters. Based on a recent, highly resolved food-web compilation, we analysed the scaling behaviour of 16 topological parameters and found significant power law scaling relationships with diversity (i.e. species richness) and complexity (i.e. connectance) for most of them. These results illustrate the lack of universal constants in food-web ecology as a function of diversity or complexity. Nonetheless, our power law scaling relationships suggest that fundamental processes determine food-web topology, and subsequent analyses demonstrated that ecosystem-specific differences in these relationships were of minor importance. As such, these newly described scaling relationships provide robust and testable cornerstones for future structural food-web models.

AB The present work proposes new boundaries for the current submediterranean territories of the Iberian Peninsula, defining them at the smallest scale attempted to date. The boundaries proposed are not sharp divisions but somewhat 'gradual', reflecting the transitional nature of the territories they encompass. Climate change predictions were used to estimate how the distribution of these submediterranean regions might change in the near future. The maps constructed are based on the distribution of marcescent Quercus species-trees that characterise the submediterranean plant landscape where they form the main forest communities. To determine their climatic range, the distribution of different types of Iberian oak forest was represented in 'climate diagrams' (ordination diagrams derived from principal components analysis), both in terms of individual species and groups of species based on leaf ecophysiological type, i.e. marcescent (Submediterranean), sclerophyllous (Mediterranean), semideciduous (Mediterranean) and deciduous (Eurosiberian). The climate range of each type of forest was determined, and the means of representative climate variables are analysed by one way ANOVA. The variables differentiating the forest groups were also examined by discriminant analysis. The range of the climate variables found to be associated with the majority of marcescent forests was used to determine the distribution of territories throughout the Peninsula with the same conditions (i.e. whether marcescent forests were present or not), thus providing a map of the Iberian submediterranean territories. Predictions of climate change were used to investigate possible climate-induced modifications in the boundaries of these territories in the near future. The patterns obtained show dramatic reductions in the extension of the Iberian submediterranean environment. Submediterranean conditions will probably disappear from the areas where they currently reign, and it seems unlikely that any new, large submediterranean areas will form by displacement towards higher altitudes. The outlook for the unique submediterranean vegetation of the Iberian Peninsula is gloomy.

AB Drought is the main selection agent in Mediterranean ecosystems and it has been suggested as an important evolutionary force responsible for population diversification in these types of environments. However, population divergence in quantitative traits can be driven by either natural selection, genetic drift or both. To investigate the roles of these forces on among-population divergence in ecophysiological traits related to drought tolerance (carbon isotope discrimination, specific leaf area, leaf size and leaf nitrogen content), we compared molecular and quantitative genetic differentiation in a common garden experiment including thirteen cork oak (Quercus suber L.) populations across a gradient of rainfall and temperature. Population differentiation for height, specific leaf area, leaf size and nitrogen leaf content measured during a dry year far exceeded the molecular differentiation measured by six nuclear microsatellites. Populations from dry-cool sites showed the lowest nitrogen leaf content and the smallest and thickest leaves contrasting with those from humid-warm sites. These results suggest (i) these traits are subjected to divergence selection and (ii) the genetic differences among populations are partly due to climate adaptation. By contrast, the low among-population divergence found in basal diameter, annual growth and carbon isotopic discrimination (a surrogate for water use efficiency) suggests low or no divergence selection for these traits. Among-population differentiation for neutral markers was not a good predictor for differentiation regarding the quantitative traits studied here, except for leaf size. The correlation observed between the genetic differentiation for leaf size and that for molecular markers was exclusively due to the association between leaf size and the microsatellite QpZAG46, which suggests a possible linkage between QpZAG46 and genes encoding for leaf size.

AB The relative contribution of density-dependent regulation and environmental stochasticity to the temporal dynamics of animal populations is one of the central issues of ecology. In insects, the primary role of the latter factor, typically represented by weather patterns, is widely accepted. We have evaluated the impact of density dependence as well as density-independent factors, including weather and mowing regime, on annual fluctuations of butterfly populations. As model species, we used Maculinea alcon and M. teleius living in sympatry and, consequently, we also analysed the effect of their potential competition. Density dependence alone explained 62 and 42% of the variation in the year-to-year trends of M. alcon and M. teleius, respectively. The cumulative Akaike weight of models with density dependence, which can be interpreted as the probability that this factor should be contained in the most appropriate population dynamics model, exceeded 0.97 for both species. In contrast, the impacts of inter-specific competition, mowing regime and weather were much weaker, with their cumulative weights being in the range of 0.08-0.21; in addition, each of these factors explained only 2-5% of additional variation in Maculinea population trends. Our results provide strong evidence for density-dependent regulation in Maculinea, while the influence of environmental stochasticity is rather minor. In the light of several recent studies on other butterflies that detected significant density-dependent effects, it would appear that density-dependent regulation may be more widespread in this group than previously thought, while the role of environmental stochasticity has probably been overestimated. We suggest that this misconception is the result of deficiencies in the design of most butterfly population studies in the past, including (1) a strong focus on adults and a neglect of the larval stage in which density-dependent effects are most likely to occur; (2) an almost exclusive reliance on transect count results that may confound the impact of environmental stochasticity on butterfly numbers with its impact on adult longevity.

AB Eupatorium adenophorum is one of the more noxious invasive plants worldwide. However, the mechanisms underlying its invasiveness are still not well elucidated. In this study, we compared the invader with its two native congeners (E. heterophyllum and E. japonicum) at four irradiances in terms of growth, biomass allocation, morphology, and photosynthesis. The higher light-saturated photosynthetic rate (P (max)) and total leaf area of the invader may contribute to its higher relative growth rate (RGR) and total biomass compared with its native congeners. Total biomass and RGR increased significantly with the increase of P (max) and total leaf area. The higher support organ mass fraction and the lower root mass fraction of the invader may also contribute to its higher RGR and biomass through increasing carbon assimilation and reducing respiratory carbon loss, respectively. The higher growth rate of the invader increased its total leaf area, ramet number, and crown area. These traits may help the invader to form dense monoculture, outshading native plant species. However, consistently higher leaf area ratio, specific leaf area, and leaf mass fraction were not found across irradiances for the invader compared with its native congeners. Higher plasticity in response to irradiance was also not found for the invader. The invader retained advantages over the natives across irradiances, while its performance decreased with lower irradiance. The results indicate that the invader may be one of the few super invaders. Reducing irradiance may inhibit its invasions.

AB Speciation via interspecific hybrids is very rare in animals, as compared to plants. Whereas most plants overcome the problem of meiosis between different chromosome sets by tetraploidization, animal hybrids often escape hybrid sterility by clonal reproduction. This comes at the expense of genetic diversity and the ability to purge deleterious mutations. However, here we show that all-hybrid populations of diploid (LR) and triploid (LLR and LRR) water frogs (Pelophylax esculentus) have secondarily acquired sexual reproduction. First, in a crossing experiment analyzed with microsatellite markers, triploid hybrids of both sexes and genotypes (LLR and LRR) recombined their homospecific genomes. Second, the great majority of natural populations investigated had low multilocus linkage disequilibrium, indicating a high recombination rate. As predicted from mating system models, the L genome had constant, low levels of linkage disequilibrium, whereas linkage disequilibrium in the R genome showed a significant reduction with increasing proportion of recombining triploids. This direct evidence of sexual reproduction in P. esculentus calls for a change of the conventional view of hybridogens as clonally reproducing diploids. Rather, hybridogens can be independent sexually reproducing units with an evolutionary potential.

AB Species that depend on ephemeral habitat often evolve distinct dispersal strategies in which the propensity to disperse is closely integrated with a suite of morphological, behavioural and physiological traits that influence colonizing ability. These strategies are maintained by natural selection resulting from spatial and temporal variation in resource abundance and are particularly evident during range expansion. Yet the mechanisms that maintain close alignment of such strategies with resource availability, integrate suites of dispersal traits and generate variability in dispersal propensity are rarely known. Breeding females can influence offspring phenotype in response to changes in current environmental conditions, making maternal effects uniquely suited to bridge fluctuations in resource abundance in the maternal generation and variation in offspring dispersal ability. Western bluebirds' (Sialia mexicana) dependence on nest cavities-an ephemeral resource has led to the evolution of two distinct dispersal phenotypes: aggressive males that disperse and non-aggressive males that remain philopatric and cooperate with their relatives. Over the last 40 years, western bluebirds rapidly expanded their geographical range, providing us with an opportunity to test, in newly established populations, the importance of maternal effects for generating variability in dispersal propensity. Here, I show that, under variable resource conditions, breeding females group offspring of different competitive ability in different positions in the egg-laying order and, consequently, produce aggressive males that are more likely to disperse when resources are low and non-aggressive philopatric males when resources are abundant. I then show experimentally that the association between resource availability and sex-specific birth order is robust across populations. Thus, this maternal effect enables close tracking of resource availability and may explain how variation in dispersal is generated in newly colonized populations. More generally, these results suggest that, as a key source of variation in colonizing phenotypes, maternal effects are of crucial importance for understanding the dynamics of range expansion.

AB Feeding competition is suggested as a major factor constraining group size in social foragers. It has, however, been challenging to demonstrate consequences of reduced energy gain in terms of fitness, possibly because social foragers may compensate negative effects of scramble competition via adjustments in time budgets. Herbivorous animals are particularly interesting in this context because their fibrous diet and slow digestion process may make it difficult to adjust time budgets. Here we investigate infant development and reproductive rates in Phayre's leaf monkeys (Trachypithecus phayrei) at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand. The diet of the species consists of 39.0% leaves (maximum 81.2% per month). Our analysis is based on data for 3 groups (185 group months) of different sizes (mean 11.4, 18.3, and 25.8 individuals, respectively). Infant development was significantly slower in the large group, in which infants changed to the adult coat later than in the medium-sized group (20.3 vs. 26.3 weeks) and were older when weaned (18.3, 19.7, and 21.4 months, respectively). The interbirth interval after a surviving infant significantly increased with group size (21.3, 22.8, and 24.5 months) while rearing success did not differ (77.8%, 76.5%, and 82.4%, survival to 2 years). Thus, infants in the large group developed more slowly were weaned later and females reproduced more slowly. With similar infant survival rates, these different reproductive rates indicate fitness differences across groups. As in other herbivores, these group-specific differences may reflect scramble competition for food or differences in habitat quality.

AB Clonal reproduction in vertebrates can always be traced back to hybridization events as all known unisexual vertebrates are hybrids between recognized species or genetically defined races. Interestingly, clonal vertebrates often also rely on interspecific matings for their reproduction because gynogenesis ( sperm- dependent parthenogenesis) and hybridogenesis are common modes of propagation. While in most cases these hybridization events leave no hereditary traces in the offspring, occasionally the genome exclusion mechanism fails and either small parts of male genetic material remain inside the oocyte in the form of microchromosomes, or fusion of the sperm nucleus with the oocyte nucleus leads to polyploid individuals. In this review, we highlight the important role of hybridization for the origin and evolution of a unisexual hybrid: the Amazon molly, Poecilia formosa.

AB 1. Pathogens have been proposed as potentially important drivers of population dynamics, but while a few studies have investigated the impact of specific pathogens, the wealth of information provided by general indices of health has hardly been exploited. By evaluating haematological parameters in wild populations, our knowledge of the dynamics of health and infection may be better understood.
   2. Here, haematological dynamics in natural populations of field voles are investigated to determine environmental and host factors associated with indicators of inflammatory response (counts of monocytes and neutrophils) and of condition: measures of immunological investment (lymphocyte counts) and aerobic capacity (red blood cell counts).
   3. Individuals from three field vole populations were sampled monthly for 2 years. Comparisons with individuals kept under controlled conditions facilitated interpretation of field data. Mixed effects models were developed for each cell type to evaluate separately the effects of various factors on post-juvenile voles and mature breeding females.
   4. There were three well-characterized 'physiological' seasons. The immunological investment appeared lowest in winter (lowest lymphocyte counts), but red blood cells were at their highest levels and indices of inflammatory response at their lowest. Spring was characterized by a fall in red blood cell counts and peaks in indicators of inflammatory response. During the course of summer-autumn, red blood cell counts recovered, the immunological investment increased and the indicators of inflammatory response decreased.
   5. Poor body condition appeared to affect the inflammatory response (lower neutrophil and monocyte peaks) and the immunological investment (lower lymphocyte counts), providing evidence that the capacity to fight infection is dependent upon host condition.
   6. Breeding early in the year was most likely in females in better condition (high lymphocyte and red blood cell counts).
   7. All the haematological parameters were affected adversely by high population densities.

AB The genetic impacts of hybridization between native and introduced species are of considerable conservation concern, while the possibility of reticulate evolution affects our basic understanding of how species arise and shapes how we use genetic data to understand evolutionary diversification. By using mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) sequences and 467 amplified fragment-length polymorphism nuclear DNA markers, we show that the introduced white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) has hybridized with two species native to the Colorado River Basin-the flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis) and the bluehead sucker (Catostomus discobolus). Hybrids between the flannelmouth sucker and white sucker have facilitated introgression between the two native species, previously isolated by reproductive barriers, such that individuals exist with contributions from all three genomes. Most hybrids had the mitochondrial haplotype of the introduced white sucker, emphasizing its pivotal role in this three-way hybridization. Our findings highlight how introduced species can threaten the genetic integrity of not only one species but also multiple previously reproductively isolated species. Furthermore, this complex three-way reticulate (as opposed to strictly bifurcating) evolution suggests that seeking examples in other vertebrate systems might be productive. Although the present study involved an introduced species, similar patterns of hybridization could result from natural processes, including stream capture or geological formations (e.g., the Bering land bridge).

AB Previous phylogenetic studies of Lupinus (Leguminosae) based on nuclear DNA have shown that the western New World taxa form a monophyletic group representing the majority of species in the genus, with evidence for high rates of recent diversification in South America following final uplift of the Andes 2-4 million years ago (Mya). For this study, three regions of rapidly evolving non-coding chloroplast DNA (trnL intron, trnS-trnG, and trnT-trnL) were examined to estimate the timing and rates of diversification in the western New World, and to infer ancestral states for geographic range, life history, and maximum elevation. The western New World species (5.0-9.3 Mya, 0.6-1.1 spp./My) comprise a basally branching assemblage of annual plants endemic to the lower elevations of western North America, from which two species-rich clades are recently derived: (i) the western North American perennials from the Rocky Mountains, Great Basin, and Pacific Slope (0.7-2.1 Mya, 2.0-5.9 spp./My) and (ii) the predominantly perennial species from the Andes Mountains of South America and highlands of Mexico (0.8-3.4 Mya, 1.4-5.7 spp./My). Bayesian posterior predictive tests for association between life history and maximum elevation demonstrate that perennials are positively correlated with higher elevations. These results are consistent with a series of one or more recent radiations in the western New World, and indicate that rapid diversification of Lupinus coincides with the derived evolution of perennial life history, colonization of montane habitats, and range expansion from North America to South America.

AB The purpose of this study was to verify the longitudinal distribution of phytoplankton biomass in two subtropical Brazilian reservoirs in the State of Parana and investigate intervening factors on changes in phytoplankton biomass according to functional groups. In the Capivari and Segredo reservoirs, samples were obtained every 3 months during 2002, along a longitudinal axis (fluvial, transition, and lacustrine zones) at different depths. One hundred and eighteen taxa were identified, with Chlorophyceae as the most specious group. During the study period, both reservoirs had mostly low biomass values (less than 1 mm(3) l(-1)). The short retention time of these reservoirs constituted the principal limiting factor to phytoplankton development. Biomass values above 1 mm(3) l(-1) were observed in the Capivari fluvial zone in March and in the Segredo lacustrine zone in December, with dominance by Microcystis aeruginosa Kutz (L-M) and Anabaena circinalis Rab. (H-1), respectively. Vertical and horizontal gradients of analyzed abiotic variables and phytoplankton biomass were observed. Considering the phytoplankton biomass values, both reservoirs were oligotrophic for the duration of the study. The Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) evidenced temporal and spatial gradients of phytoplankton biomass; nevertheless, it did not follow the classic model proposed for deep reservoirs, since higher biomass was registered in the lacustrine zone during some months and in fluvial zones during other months. Distinct functional groups of phytoplankton characterized both studied reservoirs. Capivari Reservoir was best characterized by L-M and Y groups, indicative of its greater water column stability and higher phosphorus concentration, whereas Segredo Reservoir was principally characterized by the MP functional group, indicative of its greater mixing zone extension and higher nitrate concentration. The obtained results also evidenced the influence of morphometric conditions and watershed purposes as important structuring factors of phytoplankton biomass in these reservoirs.

AB We investigate the range-wide population structure and phylogeography of thuriferous juniper (Juniperus Received 12 October 2007 thurifera L), a species with a highly disjunct distribution in the western Mediterranean. We genotyped a total of 327 individuals from 20 populations using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP). Different analyses such as principal co-ordinate analysis (PCoA), nonmetric multidimensional scaling of F-ST distances among populations, unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA), and Bayesian clustering revealed that the Strait of Gibraltar acted as an efficient barrier against gene flow between the Moroccan and European populations for a very long time, and consequently support that the Moroccan populations should be recognised as a distinct subspecies (J. thurifera L. subsp. africana (Maire) Romo and Boratynsky). The Algerian population was genetically more closely related to the European than to the Moroccan ones, probably due to dispersal events from Europe to Algeria. With respect to the mainland European populations, our data are not conclusive to reject any of the two following hypotheses: (1) the Iberian Peninsula was subdivided into different gene pools, and was the source for the colonisation of the Pyrenees and the Alps; and (2) the pattern we see today is partly the result of immigration into the Iberian Peninsula, e.g. from the Alps. Finally, the Corsican population was closely related genetically to two northern Iberian populations most probably due to relatively recent long-distance dispersal. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Mating systems are thought to play a key role in molecular evolution through their effects on effective population size (N-e) and effective recombination rate. Because of reduced N-e selection in self-fertilizing species is supposed to be less efficient, allowing fixation of weakly deleterious alleles or lowering adaptation, which may jeopardize their long-term evolution. Relaxed selection pressures in selfers should be detectable at the molecular level through the analyses of the ratio of nonsynonymous and synonymous divergence, D-n/D-s or the ratio of nonsynonymous and synonymous polymorphism, pi(n)/pi(s). On the other hand, selfing reveals recessive alleles to selection (homozygosity effect), which may counterbalance the reduction in N-e Through population genetics models, this study investigates which process may prevail in natural populations and which conditions are necessary to detect evidence for relaxed selection signature at the molecular level in sellers. Under a Aide range of plausible population and mutation parameters, relaxed selection against deleterious mutations should be detectable, but the differences between the two mating systems can be weak. At equilibrium, differences between outcrossers and selfers should be more pronounced using divergence measures (D-n/D-s ratio) than using polymorphism data (pi(n)/pi(s) ratio). The difference in adaptive substitution rates between outcrossers and selfers is much less predictable because it critically depends on the dominance levels of new advantageous mutations, which are poorly known. Different ways of testing these predictions are suggested, and implications of these results for the evolution of self-fertilizing species are also discussed.

AB 1. Indigenous species of Acacia are common in African savannas that have N-rich soils. This raises doubt regarding the extent of plant dependence on N-2 -fixation. Why would Acacia spp. enjoy an advantage over other tree species on N-replete soils?
   2. We tested the hypothesis that competition by grass for nutrients would induce increased nodulation of Acacia karroo, A. nilotica, A. tortilis and A. nigrescens seedlings that would enable them to survive better than a non-nodulating congeneric species (A. ataxacantha). A glasshouse pot experiment was conducted to determine the capacity of the Acacia spp. to nodulate. The Acacia spp. were also grown in a randomized field plot experiment in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park with and without grass coexistence, and biomass accumulation and delta N-15 values were determined. We also sampled a range of legume and non-legume saplings from the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park for delta N-15 values.
   3. In the pot experiment all species, except A. ataxacantha, which is a forest margin species, nodulated and consequently had lower delta N-15 isotope values than A. ataxacantha. In the field experiment the delta N-15 values of the plants grown with grass were significantly lower (delta N-15 = 0.77 +/- 0.08 parts per thousand) than those grown without grass (delta N-15 = 5.0 +/- 0.16 parts per thousand) for all species, except A. ataxacantha. The delta N-15 isotope abundances of field-collected leaves of legume saplings were found to be significantly lower than those of non-legume species (legume delta N-15 = 0.98 +/- 0.32 parts per thousand, non-legume delta N-15 = 2.15 +/- 0.32 parts per thousand).
   4. These data confirm that A. karroo, A. nilotica, A. tortilis and A. nigrescens seedlings are capable of nodulating, and do so in their native habitat. The decreased delta N-15 in plants grown with grass indicates that N-2 fixation was strongly enhanced by competition with grass for N.
   5. N-2 fixation may thus be an important attribute allowing legume tree seedlings to survive competition with grass through a critical period when tree roots and grass roots must compete for nutrients.

AB A mathematical model for plant communities in water-limited systems is introduced and applied to a mixed woody-herbaceous community. Two feedbacks between biomass and water are found to be of crucial importance for understanding woody-herbaceous interactions: water uptake by plants' roots and increased water infiltration at vegetation patches. The former acts to increase interspecific competition while the latter favors facilitation. The net interspecific interaction is determined by the relative strength of the two feedbacks. The model is used to highlight new mechanisms of plant-interaction change by studying factors that tilt the balance between the two feedbacks. Factors addressed in this study include environmental stresses and patch dynamics of the woody species. The model is further used to study mechanisms of species-diversity change by taking into consideration tradeoffs in species traits and conditions giving rise to irregular patch patterns.

AB The role of species diversity on ecosystem resistance in the face of strong environmental fluctuations has been addressed from both theoretical and experimental viewpoints to reveal a variety of positive and negative relationships. Here we explore empirically the relationship between the richness of forest woody species and canopy resistance to extreme drought episodes. We compare richness data from an extensive forest inventory to a temporal series of satellite imagery that estimated drought impact on forest canopy as NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) anomalies of the dry summer in 2003 in relation to records of previous years. We considered five different types of forests that are representative of the main climatic and altitudinal gradients of the region, ranging from lowland Mediterranean to mountain boreal-temperate climates.
   The observed relationship differed among forest types and interacted with the climate, summarised by the Thorntwaite index. In Mediterranean Pinus halepensis forests, NDVI decreased during the drought. This decrease was stronger in forests with lower richness. In Mediterranean evergreen forests of Quercus ilex, drought did not result in an overall NDVI loss, but lower NDVI values we're observed in drier localities with lower richness, and in more moist localities with higher number of species. In mountain Pinus sylvestris forests NDVI decreased, mostly due to the drought impact on drier localities, while no relation to species richness was observed. In moist Fagus sylvatica forests, NDVI only decreased in plots with high richness. No effect of drought was observed in the high mountain Pinus uncinata forests.
   Our results show that a shift on the diversity-stability relationship appears across the regional, climatic gradient. A positive relationship appears in drier localities, supporting a null model where the probability of finding a species able to cope with drier conditions increases with the number of species. However, in more moist localities we hypothesize that the proportion of drought-sensitive species would increase in richer localities, due to a higher likelihood of co-occurrence of species that share moist climatic requirements. The study points to the convenience of considering the causes of disturbance in relation to current environmental gradients and historical environmental constraints on the community.

AB Male-female pair bonds are common to most bird species, and these bonds affect fundamental aspects of mating systems and the strength of selection, for example, by limiting extrapair paternity. Therefore, understanding factors that strengthen and erode pair bonds are important in elucidating the selection pressures that avian populations will experience. Here, we studied the effects of environmental noise on pair bonds and the strength of pair preferences ( i. e. preferences for a pair- bonded partner versus an unfamiliar individual) in the monogamous zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, a model species in studies of sexual selection. Based on a previous study, we hypothesized that high- amplitude environmental noise would decrease the strength of pair preferences. Explicitly, we tested whether females' relative preference for their pair- bonded males, compared with extrapair males, decreased as the amplitude of environmental white noise increased. Our results generally supported our hypothesis, as females' preference for their pair-bonded males significantly decreased under conditions of high environmental noise. This erosion of preference may result from the masking or distortion of the paired males' pair- bond maintaining call, although the decrease in preference could also occur because a female cannot recognize her pair- bonded male. Our findings suggest that songbird populations in areas with high environmental noise may have ( temporarily or permanently) weakened pair bonds, suggesting that extrapair behaviours could increase in areas of greater environmental noise.

AB Earlier studies indicated that plant diversity influences community resistance in biomass when ecosystems are exposed to perturbations. This relationship remains controversial, however. Here we constructed grassland communities to test the relationships between species diversity and productivity under control and experimental drought conditions. Species richness was not correlated with biomass either under constant conditions or under drought conditions. However, communities with lower biomass production were more resistant to drought stress than those that were more productive. Our results also showed that ecosystem resistance to drought is a decreasing but nonlinear function of biomass. In contrast, species diversity had little and an equivocal effect on ecosystem resistance. From the results reported here, and the results of several previous studies, we suggest that thigh biomass systems exhibited a greater biomass reduction in response to drought than low biomass systems did, regardless of the relationship between plant diversity and community biomass production.

AB With almost 3000 species, earthworms provide important mode[ systems for studying soil fauna. However, species identification of earthworms is difficult and therefore limiting. The use of DNA barcodes, which are short sequences from standardized regions of the genome, has been regarded as a promising approach to resolve this taxonomic dilemma. We evaluated sequence diversity in the mitochondrial. cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) gene as a tool. for resolving differences among species of Chinese earthworms. Members of six genera and 28 species were examined, and species were successfutly discriminated in all cases. Sequence divergence within species was generally less than 1%, whereas divergence between species was greater than 15% in all cases. Divergence among individuals of Eisenia fetida were much higher (up to 7.8%); however, this may represent the presence of unrecognized sibling species or subspecies. We conclude that although it cannot completely replace taxonomy, the DNA barcode is a powerful tool. for identifying species of earthworms and provides a useful complement to traditional morphological taxonomy.

AB Recent theories on speciation suggest that interspecific hybridization is an important mechanism for explaining adaptive radiation. According to this view, hybridization can promote the rapid transfer of adaptations between different species; the hybrid population thus invades new habitats and diversifies into a variety of new species. Although hybridization is well accepted as a fairly common mechanism for diversification in plants, its role in the evolution of animals is more controversial, because reduced fitness would typically condemn animal hybrids to an evolutionary dead-end. Here, we examine DNA sequences of four mitochondrial and four nuclear genes selected for resolving phylogenetic relationships between goats, sheep, and their allies. Our analyses provide evidence of strong discordance for the position of Capra between mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies. We suggest that the common ancestor of wild goats arose from interspecific hybridization, and that the mitochondrial genome of a species better adapted to life at high attitudes was transferred via this route into the common ancestor of Capra. We propose that the acquisition of more efficient mitochondria has conferred a selective advantage on goats, allowing their rapid adaptive radiation during the Plio-Pleistocene epoch. Our study therefore agrees with theories that predict an important role for interspecific hybridization in the evolution and diversification of animal species. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB We explored two hypotheses that may explain intraspecific variability in nest size. The "thermoregulatory" hypothesis states that species adjust nest size to maintain egg temperature and minimize temperature fluctuations in the nest. Recently, the suggestion has been made that nest size may reflect the health status or phenotypic quality of the builder, potentially making it a sexually selected trait ("sexual selection" hypothesis). For two years, we weighed nests of Blue Tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) at initiation of reproduction in a nest-box breeding population in central Spain. We recorded laying date, clutch size, incubation period, and hatching success. We measured and took blood samples of adult females when nestlings reached three days of age. General regression models controlling for potential variables that could affect nest weight revealed that prevalence of Trypanosoma avium and immunoglobulin levels in females were significantly related to nest weight in only one of the study years. Females not infected with Trypanosoma avium built heavier nests than infected ones, whereas female immunoglobulin levels were negatively associated with nest weight. Hatching success and duration of the incubation period were not related to nest weight in either year. Thus, our results do not support the thermoregulatory hypothesis and show that certain measures of female health are related to nest-building effort in some years, probably depending on environmental conditions.

AB Population genetic theory predicts that the self-incompatible and perennial herb, Arabidopsis lyrata, will have a genetic structure that differs from the self-fertilizing, annual Arabidopsis thaliana. We quantified the genetic structure for eight populations of A. lyrata ssp. petraea in historically nonglaciated regions of central Europe. Analysis of 20 microsatellite loci for 344 individuals demonstrated that, in accordance with predictions, diploid populations had high genome-wide heterozygosity (H-O = 0.48; H-E = 0.52), high within-population diversity (83% of total) compatible with mutation-drift equilibrium, and moderate differentiation among populations (F-ST = 0.17). Within a single population, the vast majority of genetic variability (92%) was found at the smallest spatial scale (< 3 m). Although there was no evidence of biparental inbreeding or clonal propagation at this scale (F-IS = 0.003), significant fine-scale spatial autocorrelation indicated localized gene flow presumably due to gravity dispersed seeds (Sp = 0.018). Limited gene flow between isolated population clusters (regions) separated by hundreds of kilometres has given rise to an isolation by distance pattern of diversification, with low, but significant, differentiation among regions (F-ST = 0.05). The maintenance of geographically widespread polymorphisms and uniformly high diversity throughout central Europe is consistent with periglacial survival of A. lyrata ssp. petraea north of the Alps in steppe-tundra habitats during the last glacial maximum. As expected of northern and previously glaciated localities, A. lyrata in Iceland was genetically less diverse and highly differentiated from central Europe (H-E = 0.37; F-ST = 0.27).

AB Understanding the partitioning of genetic variance in peripheral and central populations may shed more light on the effects of genetic drift and gene flow on population genetic structure and, thereby, improve attempts to conserve genetic diversity. We analysed genetic structure of peripheral and central populations of three insect-pollinated violets (Viola elatior, Viola pumila, Viola stagnina) to evaluate to what extent these patterns can be explained by gene flow and genetic drift. Amplified fragment length polymorphism was used to analyse 930 individuals of 50 populations. Consistent with theoretical predictions, peripheral populations were smaller and more isolated, differentiation was stronger, and genetic diversity and gene flow lower in peripheral populations of V. pumila and V. stagnina. In V. elatior, probably historic fragmentation effects linked to its specific habitat type were superimposed on the plant geographic (peripheral-central) patterns, resulting in lower relative importance of gene flow in central populations. Genetic variation between regions (3-6%), among (30-37%) and within populations (60-64%) was significant. Peripheral populations lacked markers that were rare and localized in central populations. Loss of widespread markers in peripheral V. stagnina populations indicated genetic erosion. Autocorrelation within populations was statistically significant up to a distance of 10-20 m. Higher average genetic similarity in peripheral populations than in central ones indicated higher local gene flow, probably owing to management practices. Peripheral populations contributed significantly to genetic variation and contained unique markers, which made them valuable for the conservation of genetic diversity.

AB Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to detect prey within the gut contents of predators and allows specific trophic interactions to be studied among soil-dwelling invertebrates which cannot be examined by other approaches. PCR-inhibitory substances, however, are commonly found in DNA prepared from soil organisms or from biological material contaminated with soil. This can lead to false-negative results and the risk of not detecting trophic connections or of underestimating predation rates in field studies. In the present study, we developed mitochondrial DNA markers to detect Amphimallon solstitiale (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) in the gut contents of invertebrate predators. Larvae of A. solstitiale can cause serious damage in grasslands, field crops, and forests by feeding on roots. Adequate methodologies to study predation on these pests are lacking, and their invertebrate predator guild is, therefore, barely known. To test the new molecular markers for prey detection, larvae and eggs of A. solstitiale were fed to Poecilus versicolor larvae (Coleoptera: Carabidae), which are abundant below-ground predators in grassland ecosystems. Unfortunately, even when specific DNA extraction and purification methods were used, DNA extracts from predators were of poor quality and not amplifiable by PCR; this yielded false-negative results and a dramatically lower prey-detection rate. We overcame PCR-inhibition by applying >= 1.28 mu g ul(-1) bovine serum albumin to the PCR reaction mix. This enabled us to detect A. solstitiale DNA within fed carabid larvae up to 48 and 40 h post-feeding for 127 and 463 bp sized DNA fragments, respectively. When single A. solstitiale eggs were consumed by the carabid larvae, predation could be verified in 100% of the predators within the first 8 h of digestion; some carabid larvae even tested positive 32 h after feeding. Moreover, by multiplexing primers targeting both prey and predator, we were able to simultaneously screen for prey consumption and check for co-purified PCR inhibitors. Sensitivity in prey detection was not reduced compared to singleplex PCR. We recommend the multiplex approach because it considerably reduces time and costs compared to singleplex assays. We also show that multiplex PCR not only detects specific prey, but also can identify the predator itself. This allows the identification of taxa which are difficult or not identifiable based on morphological characters, such as soil-dwelling predatory beetle larvae. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The management of invasive non-native species is a frequent cause of conflict in the field of biodiversity conservation because perceptions of their costs and benefits differ among stakeholder groups. A lack of cohesion between scientific researchers, the commercial sector and policy makers lies at the root of a widespread failure to develop and implement sustainable management practices for invasive species. The crisis of this situation is intensified by drivers stemming from international conventions and directives to address invasive species issues. There are further direct conflicts between legislative instruments promoting biodiversity conservation on the one hand while liberalizing trade at the national, European and global level on the other. The island of Ireland provides graphic illustration of the importance of cross-jurisdictional approaches to biological invasions. Using primarily Irish examples in this review, we emphasize the importance of approaching risk assessment, risk reduction and control or eradication policies from a cost-efficient, highly flexible perspective, incorporating linkages between environmental, economic and social objectives. The need for consolidated policies between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is particularly acute, though few model cross-border mechanisms for such consolidation are available. The importance of engaging affected stakeholders through positive interactions is discussed with regard to reducing the currently fragmented nature of invasive species management between the two jurisdictions.

AB Background and Aims Baobab (Adansonia digitata) is a multi-purpose tree used daily by rural African communities. The present study aimed at investigating the level of morphometric and genetic variation and spatial genetic structure within and between threatened baobab populations from the three climatic zones of Benin.
   Methods A total of 137 individuals from six populations were analysed using morphometric data as well as molecular marker data generated using the AFLP technique.
   Key Results Five primer pairs resulted in a total of 217 scored bands with 78.34 % of them being polymorphic. A two-level AMOVA of 137 individuals from six baobab populations revealed 82.37 % of the total variation within populations and 17.63 % among populations (P < 0.001). Analysis of population structure with allele-frequency based F-statistics revealed a global F-ST of 0.127 +/- 0.072 (P < 0.001). The mean gene diversity within populations (H-S) and the average gene diversity between populations (D-ST) were estimated at 0.309 +/- 0.000 and 0.045 +/- 0.072, respectively. Baobabs in the Sudanian and Sudan-Guinean zones of Benin were short and produced the highest yields of pulp, seeds and kernels, in contrast to the ones in the Guinean zone, which were tall and produced only a small number of fruits with a low pulp, seed and kernel productivity. A statistically significant correlation with the observed patterns of genetic diversity was observed for three morphological characteristics: height of the trees, number of branches and thickness of the capsules.
   Conclusions The results indicate some degree of physical isolation of the populations collected in the different climatic zones and suggest a substantial amount of genetic structuring between the analysed populations of baobab. Sampling options of the natural populations are suggested for in or ex situ conservation.

AB In this study, the population structure of the Lusitanian sea star Asterina gibbosa was assessed using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). One hundred and twenty-two (AFLP) loci were analysed in 159 individuals from eight populations from across the species' range and revealed high levels of genetic diversity, with all individuals but two harbouring a unique banding pattern. As reported for other marine invertebrates, we found high levels of genetic differentiation between the Atlantic and Mediterranean basins, suggesting that the Strait of Gibraltar represents a major barrier to dispersal for this sea star. Our assignment studies suggest that, in the Atlantic, a measurable degree of gene flow occurs between populations, which could result in the isolation-by-distance pattern of differentiation observed in this basin. In contrast, no evidence of contemporary gene flow was found in the Mediterranean, suggesting contrasting patterns of dispersal of Asterina gibbosa in the Atlantic and Mediterranean basins.

AB To date, molecular markers have not settled the question of the specific status of the closely related, but phylogenetically unresolved, brown seaweeds, hermaphroditic Fucus spiralis and dioecious Fucus vesiculosus, nor their propensity for natural hybridization. To test the degree of species integrity and to assess effect of the mating system on the population genetic structure, 288 individuals coming from parapatric (discontinuous) and sympatric (contiguous) spatial configurations at two sites were genotyped with five microsatellite loci. Using a Bayesian admixture analysis, our results show that F. spiralis and F. vesiculosus comprise clearly distinct genetic entities (clusters) generally characterized by cosexual and unisexual individuals, respectively. Genetic diversity within each entity suggests that F. spiralis reproduces primarily through selfing while F. vesiculosus is characterized by an endogamous breeding regime. Nevertheless, aberrant sexual phenotypes were observed in each cluster, no diagnostic alleles were revealed and 10% of study individuals were intermediate between the two genetic entities. This pattern can be explained by recent divergence of two taxa with retention of ancestral polymorphism or asymmetrical, introgressive hybridization. However, given (i) coincident monomorphism at three loci in spiralis clusters and (ii) that significantly more intermediates were observed in sympatric stations than in parapatric stations, we argue that interspecific gene flow has occurred after divergence of the two taxa. Finally, we show that whether recently separated or recently introgressive, the divergent breeding systems probably contribute to species integrity in these two taxa.

AB Recent developments in community models emphasize the importance of incorporating stochastic processes (e.g. ecological drift) in models of niche-structured community assembly. We constructed a finite, spatially explicit, lottery model to simulate the distribution of species in a one-dimensional landscape with an underlying gradient in environmental conditions. Our framework combines the potential for ecological drift with environmentally-mediated competition for space in a heterogeneous environment. We examined the influence of niche breadth, dispersal distances, community size (total number of individuals) and the breadth of the environmental gradient on levels of species and functional trait diversity (i.e. differences in niche optima). Three novel results emerge from this model: (1) niche differences between adjacent species (e.g. limiting similarity) increase in smaller communities, because of the interaction of competitive effects and finite population sizes; (2) immigration from a regional species pool, stochasticity and niche-assembly generate a bimodal distribution of species residence times ('transient' and 'resident') under a heterogeneous environment; and (3) the magnitude of environmental heterogeneity has a U-shaped effect on diversity, because of shifts in species richness of resident vs. transient species. These predictions illustrate the potential importance of stochastic (although not necessarily neutral) processes in community assembly.

AB 1 Tests of the relationship between resident plant species richness and habitat invasibility have yielded variable results. I investigated the roles of experimental manipulation of understorey species richness and overstorey characteristics in resistance to invader establishment in a floodplain forest in south-western Virginia, USA.
   2 I manipulated resident species richness in experimental plots along a flooding gradient, keeping plot densities at their original levels, and quantified the overstorey characteristics of each plot.
   3 After manipulating the communities, I transplanted 10 randomly chosen invaders from widespread native and non-native forest species into the experimental plots. Success of an invasion was measured by survival and growth of the invader.
   4 Native and non-native invader establishment trends were influenced by different aspects of the biotic community and these relationships depended on the site of invasion. The most significant influence on non-native invader survival in this system of streamside and upper terrace plots was the overstorey composition. Non-native species survival in the flooded plots after 2 years was significantly positively related to proximity to larger trees. However, light levels did not fully explain the overstorey effect and were unrelated to native survivorship. The effects of understorey richness on survivorship depended on the origin of the invaders and the sites they were transplanted into. Additionally, native species growth was significantly affected by understorey plot richness.
   5 The direction and strength of interactions with both the overstorey (for non-native invaders) and understorey richness (for natives and non-natives) changed with the site of invasion and associated environmental conditions. Rather than supporting the hypothesis of biotic resistance to non-native invasion, my results suggest that native invaders experienced increased competition with the native understorey plants in the more benign upland habitat and facilitation in the stressful riparian zone.

AB Remington (1968) argued that 13 suture zones exist in North America. Remington defined a suture zone as, "a band of geographic overlap between major biotic assemblages, including some pairs of species or semispecies which hybridize in the zone" (p. 322). Although initially controversial, the idea that suture zones exist has picked up momentum over the past decade, due largely to the phylogeographic work of Hewitt, A vise, and their colleagues. Nevertheless, the reality of suture zones has not yet been subjected to rigorous analysis using statistical and geographic information system (GIS) approaches. To test for the existence of Remington's suture zones, we first identified 117 terrestrial hybrid zones in Canada and the United States through a literature search for the key words "cline," "contact zone," "hybrid zone," and "hybridization" in articles published between 1970 and 2002. The 117 hybrid zones were mapped using a GIS approach and compared with a digitized version of Remington's original suture zone map. Overall, there does appear to be an association between hybrid zones and suture zones, but this association is largely attributable to clustering of hybrid zones in only two of the 13 suture zones recognized by Remington. The results suggest that evolutionary biologists should retain some skepticism toward Remington's suture zones.

AB Questions: 1. How does species richness of recipient communities affect Reynoutria invasion? 2. How does Reynoutria invasion change host community structure? 3. Are there any differences in habitat preferences among three closely related Reynoutria taxa? 4. How does the genetic structure of Reynoutria populations change along the course of a river?
   Location: River Jizera basin, north Bohemia, Czech Republic.
   Methods: Nine 0.25 km(2) plots were chosen along the river. Within each plot all main habitat types were determined and sampled using the Braun-Blanquet scale to determine the invasibility of various communities. The patches invaded by Reynoutria taxa and surrounding Reynoutria-free vegetation in the same habitat type were sampled as releve pairs to compare the composition of invaded and non-invaded vegetation. In addition, to characterize the genetic structure of Reynoutria populations along the river, 30 samples front different clones were collected.
   Results and conclusions: 1. The species richness of communities has no influence on the success of Reynoutria invasion in the area studied. The combination of environmental conditions and propagule spread is more important to the invasion success than the number of species in the host community. 2. Reynoutria invasion greatly reduces species diversity. 3. R. japonica invaded more habitat types than R. sachalinensis and R. X bohemica. The hybrid R. x bohemica outcompetes the parental taxa at sites where both taxa co-occur. 4. Isozyme analysis revealed phenotype variability in the hybrid in contrast to the parental taxa. Different hybrid phenotypes are distributed randomly on the middle and lower reaches of the River Jizera; one of them dominates and the other three occur occasionally. This pattern supports the hypothesis that sexual reproduction occasionally occurs within Reynoutria taxa.

AB Procedures for assessing a marine coastal ecosystem health are presented in this paper. The assessment includes the following five steps: (1) review of human activities; (2) identification of human-induced stresses; (3) analysis of ecosystem responses to the stresses; (4) development of ecosystem health indicators; and (5) assessment of ecosystem health. A set of comprehensive indicators integrating classical indicators with thermodynamic indicators was proposed and applied to assess the Tolo Harbour marine coastal ecosystem health. The indicators encompass the stress indicators and the responses indicators including physical, chemical, biological, general ecosystem-level and ecosystem-service-function aspects. The assessment results of the Tolo Harbour ecosystem health show that a temporal order of ecosystem health state from good to bad is determined as follows: the 1970s > the 1990s > the 1980s; while, a spatial order of health state from good to bad is Channel Subzone > Buffer Subzone > Harbour Subzone. Some recommendations to improve further the marine coastal ecosystem health in the Tolo Harbour are finally discussed in the paper. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Meadows are often managed by mowing to prevent succession and brushwood encroachment. This management practice is efficient to maintain plant diversity, but the effect on arthropod groups is less well known. We sampled spiders in the Grande Caricaie (Switzerland), a site of nature conservation importance, in two types of wet meadows, an unmanaged site and one 2-years-old mown conditions. Numbers of individuals for the most abundant families, diversity measures, and indicator taxa were compared among vegetation and treatment types. The results indicate that the less mobile spiders and species linked to litter or dead reeds, including rare species, are reduced by mowing. Present management consists in triennial mowing of 2-4 ha non-contiguous sectors. We investigate the conflict between the need to mow the meadows to maintain them, and the negative effect of mowing on spider communities. We therefore propose a new management scheme aimed at maintain the vegetation while lessening its negative effects on spider communities by providing refuges. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The spatial genetic structuring of the land snail Helix aspersa was investigated for 32 colonies within an intensive agricultural area, the polders of the Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel ( France). Given the habitat patchiness and environmental instability, the setting of H. aspersa colonies meets the broader view of a metapopulation structure. The identification of extrinsic barriers to migration and their impact on the genetic distribution was addressed through the genotyping of 580 individuals using a combined set of enzyme and microsatellite loci. To evaluate the distance as well as the direction over which the spatial genetic arrangement occurs, two-dimensional spatial autocorrelation analyses, Mantel tests of association and multivariate Mantel correlograms were used. Different connectivity networks and geographical distances based on landscape features were constructed to evaluate the effect of environmental heterogeneity and to test the adequacy of an isolation by distance model on the distribution of the genetic variability. Genetic divergence was assessed using either classical IAM-based statistics, or SMM-based genetic distances specifically designed to accommodate the mutational processes thought to fit microsatellite evolution (IAM: Infinite Allele Model; SMM: Stepwise Mutation Model). Genetic distances based only on genetic drift yielded the most plausible biologically meaningful interpretation of the observed spatial structure. Applying a landscape-based geographical distance which postulates that migration arises along roadside verges, hedges or irrigation canal embankments gave a better fit to an isolation by distance model than did a simple Euclidean distance. The progressive decline of genetic similarity with physical distance appeared to be environmentally induced, leading to functional migration pathways.

AB Decreasing species diversity is thought to both reduce community productivity and increase invasibility to other species. However, it remains unclear whether identical mechanisms drive both diversity-productivity and diversity-invisibility relationships. We found a positive diversity-productivity relationship and negative diversity-invisibility and productivity-invisibility relationships using microcosm communities constructed from spatial niche specialist genotypes of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens. The primary mechanism driving these relationships was a dominance (or selection) effect: more diverse communities were more likely to contain the most productive and least invasible type. Statistical elimination of the dominance effect greatly weakened the diversity-invisibility relationship and eliminated the diversity-productivity relationship, but also revealed the operation of additional mechanisms (niche complementarity, positive and negative interactions) for particular combinations of niche specialists. However, these mechanisms differed for invasibility and productivity responses, resulting in the invisibility-productivity relationship changing from strongly negative to weakly positive. In the absence of the dominance effect, which may be an experimental artefact, decreasing diversity can have unexpected or no effects on ecosystem properties.

AB Using original and literature data on species richness, I compared the species-area relations for 5 different size classes of the Arctic benthos: macrofauna sensu lato, polychaetes, nematodes, ciliates and diatom algae. The data pool covered a wide range of areas from single samples to the whole seas, Both the slopes and intercepts of the curves depended significantly on the logarithm of the mean body size of the group, The number of small species (ciliates and diatom algae) showed relatively higher local diversity but increased more slowly with the area than the number of larger ones, Thus, both alpha- and beta-components of species diversity of the marine benthos were size-dependent. As a consequence. the actual relations between number of species and their physical size are spatially scale-dependent: there are many more species of smaller Size classes in any one local community, but at a global scope the situation changes drastically. The possible reasons are discussed, including dispersal efficiency, rates of speciation and size-dependent perception of environmental heterogeneity. Body size is suggested to be the important scaling factor in manifestation of so-called ''general ecological laws'' .

ID SECONDARY CHANNELS; NETHERLANDS; RESTORATION; HABITAT; TEMPLET; SYSTEM
AB In this paper, the status of ecological rehabilitation of the Dutch lowland basin of the river Rhine has been reviewed. The historical perspective, mainly with regard to river regulation measures in the past, is given. The lower river Rhine comprises a man-dominated, strongly regulated catchment, polluted water and sediments, and annihilated and deteriorated ecosystems. During the past 25 years, the water quality and, to a lesser extent, the sediment quality, has improved considerably, hence leading to improvement of biotic diversity. The rehabilitation of lost and disturbed ecosystems started some 15 years ago. The non-refutable boundary conditions for restoration projects are protection against flooding and transport by cargo ships. Holistic ecological theories to promote river catchment management are available, but the rehabilitation projects dominantly rely on local and regional planning policies. The use and application of ecological criteria are increasingly playing a role in rehabilitation schemes. Ecological rehabilitation mainly focuses on nature conservation and restoration strategies, i.e. exploiting the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic potentials of the flowing river, and introducing a semi-natural grazing regime by large herbivores. Particularly the creation of new secondary channels contributes to the restoration of riverine habitat diversity and heterogeneity, and hence to the species diversity. The assessment of a number of rehabilitation projects has led to the conclusion that no general statement can be given concerning 'success' or 'failure' of specific restoration measures. The overall balance of 14 assessed projects out of approximately 30 running projects is positive. The highly dynamic river Waal offers the best possibilities for the restoration of natural sandy levees and back swamps. It will be very difficult to rehabilitate the hardwood floodplain forests under the present management conditions. Further recovery of the river biota depends on continued decrease of pollution, an increase of morphological dynamics, and the development of the original natural habitats.

AB Promoting indigenous submerged macrophytes is considered an important measure to restore shallow lakes. On the other hand, dense stands of aquatic vegetation often cause nuisance for boating, swimming and by obstruction of water flow. Consequently, the interests of recreational users may conflict with nature conservation. At first sight, aiming lake management at intermediate vegetation biomass seems a good solution for this controversy. However, as can be shown with a simple economical model, such a compromise may not always be an optimal solution in terms of total welfare across all users of a lake. Here, we show that a management strategy aimed at moderate plant biomass can also be unfeasible for ecological reasons. This is shown by applying two very different models: a minimal logistic model of plant growth which is easy to understand, and the relatively complex and realistic simulation model Charisma which, among other things, includes the seasonal cycle and a detailed description of the dynamics of light availability for macrophytes. The qualitative results of both models were remarkably similar. If the ecosystem has no alternative stable states, it is possible to set vegetation to any desired sustainable level using an appropriate harvesting strategy. However, if an intermediate vegetation biomass is to be realized the costs of harvesting are high, because the yield is predicted to be maximal in that case, If the ecosystem has alternative stable states, harvesting becomes risky because the vegetation may collapse entirely below a certain, in practice unknown, biomass. Also, even moderate harvesting may reduce the resilience of the vegetated state, making the ecosystem more vulnerable to adverse conditions such as unfavorable weather conditions or bird grazing.

AB Recent studies have shown that incubation temperatures can profoundly affect the phenotypes of hatchling lizards, but the effects of hydric incubation environments remain controversial. We examined incubation-induced phenotypic variation in Bassiana duperreyi (Gray, 1938; Sauria: Scincidae), an oviparous montane lizard from south-eastern Australia. We incubated eggs from this species in four laboratory treatments, mimicking cool and moist, cool and dry, warm and moist, and warm and dry natural nest-sites, and assessed several morphological and behavioural traits of lizards after hatching. Incubation temperature influenced a lizard's hatching success, incubation period, tail length and antipredator behaviour, whereas variation in hydric conditions did not engender significant phenotypic variation for most traits. However, moisture affected incubation period slightly differently in males and females, and for a given snout-vent length moisture interacted weakly with temperature to affect lizard body mass. Although incubation conditions can substantially affect phenotypic variation among hatchling lizards, the absence of strong hydric effects suggests that hatchling lizards react less plastically to variation in moisture levels than they do to thermal conditions. Thus, our data do not support the generalization that water availability during embryogenesis is more important than temperature in determining the phenotypes of hatchling reptiles.

AB Thirteen estuaries in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, were broadly categorised according to size and salinity distribution and were assigned to one of the following categories: permanently open estuaries having a strong salinity gradient between mouth and upper estuary, freshwater-deprived permanently open estuaries, medium-sized temporarily open/closed estuaries, and small, temporarily open/closed estuaries. The macrobenthos collected during surveys was then compared in terms of the following parameters: species composition, salinity, sediment mud content, density of macrobenthic animals, Hill's N0 (species richness), and Hill's N1 (diversity). Mud content was found to be the most important environmental variable responsible for biotic patterns found, and sites were consequently assigned to either a sand zone fauna, or a mud zone fauna. Both types of fauna are present in all estuaries sampled, with upper sites of river dominated estuaries having an additional oligohaline fauna, and freshwater-deprived estuaries providing habitat for many marine species. Small, temporarily open/closed estuaries have the highest macrobenthic density, whereas N0 and N1 are highest in freshwater-deprived permanently open systems. River-dominated permanently open estuaries tend to have lower macrobenthic densities, species richness, and diversities compared to estuaries in the other categories. No seasonal differences in these ecological indices were found within any of the estuarine categories.

   FRAMEWORK
AB 1. Knowledge of what a habitat should be like, in the absence of the effects of human activities, is fundamental to local stream habitat assessment. It has been suggested that stream habitats are influenced by large-scale catchment features. This study aimed to identify these relationships so that local-scale habitat features could be predicted from larger-scale characteristics.
   2. Fifty-one reference sites from the Upper Murrumbidgee River catchment, south-eastern Australia, were classified on the basis of the local features of their stream habitat. Large-scale variables, namely catchment area, stream length, relief ratio, alkalinity, percentage of volcanic rocks, percentage of metasediments, dominant geology and dominant soil type, provided sufficient information for classifying 69% of reference sites into appropriate reference site groups.
   3. A model created using these large-scale catchment variables was able to predict the local habitat features that were expected (E) to occur at a site in the absence of the effects of human activities. These were compared with observed (O) local habitat features to provide an observed-to-expected (O/E) ratio, an assessment score of the habitat at a site. The departure of this ratio from 1 enables identification of those sites that may be impacted. A list of habitat features that are expected at a site can provide targets for habitat restoration or enhancement.
   4. For impacted sites, when habitat assessment from the habitat predictive model was compared with biological assessment from the Australian River Assessment System (AUSRIVAS) predictive model, it was possible to identify whether habitat degradation or water quality degradation was the cause of biological impairment. Such assessment may make it possible to identify rehabilitation goals relevant to the biota.

AB The Guadiana River has an irregular hydrological regime, with severe droughts and floods, but little is known about how aquatic fauna respond to these natural events. Macroinvertebrate data and environmental information were collected at seven sites from three tributaries in the middle reaches of the Guadiana River, approximately every 3 months from April 1995 to April 1997. Despite considerable annual variation in discharge (related to duration of flood and drought periods), the number of macroinvertebrates found was consistently high. Diptera represented the major proportion of the benthic fauna (73.2%) followed by Ephemeroptera (10.3%), Coleoptera (4.1%) and Trichoptera (3.1%). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to evaluate the relationships between taxa density and habitat variables. Generally, Plecoptera and Ephemeroptera were found in the upstream sampling sites. Wider and deeper sites were associated with the presence of Diptera and were least diverse. High values for both the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and the average score per taxon were usually found at upstream sites where Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera predominated. The data suggest that macroinvertebrates have a great capacity to recover rapidly from severe drought periods, both in terms of taxonomic diversity and number of individuals.

AB The ecomorphological relationship between oral and pharyngeal jaw morphology and diet was investigated for five labrids: Lachnolaimus maximus, Halichoeres garnoti, H. bivittatus, H, maculipinna, and Thalassoma bifasciatum. The goals were to examine the following: (I) the relationship between diet and oral and pharyngeal jaw morphology; and (2) the influence of feeding behavior on diet. Twelve morphological measurements reflecting aspects of feeding ability were made. Interspecific differences in dentition were described. Principal components analysis (PCA) explained 96% of the variance among morphological variables with the first two PCs. Principal component I accounted for 92.2% of the variance, separating species by body size, whereas PC2 (3.8% of variance) separated species by oral jaw shape and degree of protrusibility, Twenty-six prey categories were identified. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that only 4.7% of the variation in diet was attributable to morphological variables, indicating a low correlation between oral and pharyngeal jaw characters and diet. However, variables that measured some aspect of performance were good predictors of diet. The proportion of hard prey consumed was correlated to the estimates of biting force for each species, Species with stronger pharyngeal jaw musculature consumed larger amounts of hard prey than those with lesser force generating ability. Feeding behaviors, classified as suction feeding, winnowing, or biting, corresponded to oral jaw morphology, Species with less protrusible jaws were found to bite their prey, and species with more protrusible jaws picked items out of the water column or winnowed on the substrate.

AB Sites at 244 locations along the west and north Norwegian coasts were investigated to evaluate whether kelp (Laminaria hyperborea) beds had been overgrazed by the sea urchins Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis and Echinus esculentus in the years 1981-1992. Barren ground communities were found in sheltered and moderately wave-exposed areas mainly in the inner and middle archipelago from Nordmore (63 degrees N) northwards. Densities of large-sized (adult and intermediate) L. hyperborea were 20.7 individuals.m(-2) in kelp beds and 9.7 individuals m(-2) in transition areas. Juvenile Laminaria spp. were present at densities of 23.9 individuals.m(-2) in kelp beds, 3.6 individuals.m(-2) in transition areas, 0.0 individuals.m(-2) in barren grounds, and 59.1 individuals.m(-2) in kelp-harvested locations. Both the densities and the mean size of S. droebachiensis in barren grounds decreased northwards. The mean densities were 52.2 and 26.1 individuals.m(-2) for the areas south and north of the Arctic Circle, respectively. Multivariate analysis (CANOCO) showed that seven "environmental" factors (i.e., kelp depth gradient, distance (latitude), time of sampling, nematode infection in S. droebachiensis, wave exposure, coastal gradient, and substratum) contributed significantly to variability in the distribution of kelp beds and barren grounds. Species in hard-bottom communities in shallow waters could be divided into three distinct BIOTA.

AB The persistence of metapopulations is likely to be highly dependent on whether population dynamics are correlated among habitat patches as a result of migration between patches and spatially-correlated environmental stochasticity (weather effects). We examined whether population dynamics of the ringlet butterfly, Aphantopus hyperantus, were synchronous in an area of approximately 0.5 km(2), with respect to extinction, colonization and population fluctuations. Monks Wood Butterfly Monitoring Scheme transect count data from 1973 to 1995, revealed (A) a major environmental perturbation, the drought of 1976, which caused synchronized extinctions of A. hyperantus in subsequent years, (B) synchronized recolonization in years following the large number of apparent extinctions, and (C) population changes by A. hyperantus were highly correlated in many of the 14 sections of the transect, presumably re fleeting similar responses to environmental stochasticity, and the exchange of individuals among sections. However, extinction and population synchrony depended on habitat type. Following the 1976 drought, A. hyperantus apparently became extinct from the most open and most shady habitats it occupied, with some persistence in habitats of intermediate shading, thus showing retraction to core populations in central parts of an environmental gradient, albeit with an average shift to relatively open habitat. Populations at extreme ends of the environmental gradient occupied by A. hyperantus fluctuated least synchronously, suggesting a potential buffering effect of habitat heterogeneity, but this was not crucial to survival after the 1976 drought. Thus, not all habitats are equally important to persistence. Correlated temporal dynamics, variation in habitat quality and the interaction between habitat quality and temporal environmental stochasticity are important determinants of metapopulation persistence and should be incorporated in metapopulation models.

AB Temporal dynamics of planktonic diatoms and cyanobacteria in four eutrophic hardwater lakes in central Alberta, Canada, were investigated from May to October for up to 4 years. Biomass of individual species of the two phytoplankton groups was related to seven environmental variables with canonical correspondence analysis. Temporal dynamics of the two groups differed among lakes in a given year, suggesting that regional weather patterns did not cause these variations. In a given lake, diatom biomass varied up to 15-fold whereas cyanobacterial biomass remained relatively stable over the years. Diatoms were dominant at low water column stability (Brunt Vasala: frequency, N-2 < 5 x 10(-4) s(-2)) and temperature (<15 degrees C). In contrast, except for some species (e.g., Aphanizomenon flos-aquae), cyanobacteria generally preferred higher water temperature and N-2 than diatoms. Total phosphorus concentrations were more closely related to total phytoplankton biomass than to diatom or cyanobacterial biomass. These results suggested that the dominance of cyanobacteria or diatoms in these phytoplankton communities was related to water temperature and mixing patterns, whereas the total phytoplankton biomass was related to total phosphorus concentrations.

AB Results are presented of a partial quantitative survey of Eurodryas aurinia colonies in 1983 and a full review of all UK colonies in 1990. Since records began, the butterfly has declined from 663 10-km grid squares to 253 squares in 1990: a reduction of 62 %. A total of 432 separate colonies were identified in 1990 (228 in England, 111 in Wales, 58 in N. Ireland, and 35 in Scotland), confirming that the UK is a major European stronghold of the species. However, the current loss rate of colonies in Britain is estimated to be at least 11.5 % per decade and is almost as high on protected as on unprotected sites. The butterfly usually breeds in damp, acidophilous grassland but spread onto calcicolous grassland during the present century, probably due to a general relaxation in grazing pressure combined with a switch from sheep to cattle grazing. Almost half the colonies surveyed in 1983 occupied very small habitat patches (<2 ha) and only one-sixth occupied patches larger than 10 ha (max = 40 ha). The species is sedentary and colonial, but 149 single adults were reported from non-breeding habitats in 1971-1990 and at least nine sites were colonised. Certain habitats appear to be transient or are intrinsically suboptimal and patch occupancy is often short, leading to a constant state of flux in the butterfly's distribution. The suspected metapopulation structure of E. aurinia and its implications for conservation are discussed.

AB The free-flight behaviour of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae), the sweet potato whitefly, was investigated in a vertical flight chamber. A mercury-vapour lamp presented from above induced a phototactic flight response. Although flight propensity was comparable from 06.00 to 19.00 hours, flight duration was maximum between 06.00 and 10.00 hours. Males flew longer than females and their mean flight duration remained constant throughout the day. Females flew longer from 06.00 to 13.00 hours than from 13.00 to 19.00 hours. Both sexes were capable of sustaining flight for more than 2 h, although less than 5% of those tested did so.
   Flight activity also was influenced by age and by host quality. The propensity to take off, proportion exhibiting phototactic orientation and flight duration varied with the age of the whitefly. Host quality influenced the timing of flight behaviour. Whiteflies reared on senescing plants exhibited greater take-off rates and initiated longer phototactic flights up to 4 days following adult eclosion when compared to individuals reared on vegetative plants. Thereafter, individuals reared on vegetative plants exhibited greater response levels. Whiteflies reared on vegetative plants weighed more and survived longer than did individuals reared on senescing plants.
   Whiteflies that responded to the overhead light initially exhibited a strong photokinetic and phototactic response. Over the course of the flight, these responses declined and flight instability increased, as indicated by an overall decrease in the mean rate of climb, accompanied by an increase in the variability of this parameter and an increase in horizontal displacement. Although males and females displayed similar flight characteristics, females exhibited a greater rate of climb than did males, and for both sexes, individuals that flew longer than 25 min had a greater rate of climb than did individuals that flew for less than 25 min.

AB We synthesized 20 years of research to explain the interrelated processes that determine soil and plant responses to biochar. The properties of biochar and its effects within agricultural ecosystems largely depend on feedstock and pyrolysis conditions. We describe three stages of reactions of biochar in soil: dissolution (1-3 weeks); reactive surface development (1-6 months); and aging (beyond 6 months). As biochar ages, it is incorporated into soil aggregates, protecting the biochar carbon and promoting the stabilization of rhizodeposits and microbial products. Biochar carbon persists in soil for hundreds to thousands of years. By increasing pH, porosity, and water availability, biochars can create favorable conditions for root development and microbial functions. Biochars can catalyze biotic and abiotic reactions, particularly in the rhizosphere, that increase nutrient supply and uptake by plants, reduce phytotoxins, stimulate plant development, and increase resilience to disease and environmental stressors. Meta-analyses found that, on average, biochars increase P availability by a factor of 4.6; decrease plant tissue concentration of heavy metals by 17%-39%; build soil organic carbon through negative priming by 3.8% (range -21% to +20%); and reduce non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from soil by 12%-50%. Meta-analyses show average crop yield increases of 10%-42% with biochar addition, with greatest increases in low-nutrient P-sorbing acidic soils (common in the tropics), and in sandy soils in drylands due to increase in nutrient retention and water holding capacity. Studies report a wide range of plant responses to biochars due to the diversity of biochars and contexts in which biochars have been applied. Crop yields increase strongly if site-specific soil constraints and nutrient and water limitations are mitigated by appropriate biochar formulations. Biochars can be tailored to address site constraints through feedstock selection, by modifying pyrolysis conditions, through pre- or post-production treatments, or co-application with organic or mineral fertilizers. We demonstrate how, when used wisely, biochar mitigates climate change and supports food security and the circular economy.

AB Species distribution models are used to study biogeographic patterns and guide decision-making. The variable quality of these models makes it critical to assess whether a model's outputs are suitable for the intended use, but commonly used evaluation approaches are inappropriate for many ecological contexts. In particular, unrealistically high performance assessments have been associated with models for rare species and predictions over large geographic extents. We evaluated the area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) as a performance metric for rare binary events, focusing on the assessment of species distribution models. Precision is the probability that a species is present given a predicted presence, while recall (more commonly called sensitivity) is the probability the model predicts presence in locations where the species has been observed. We simulated species at three levels of prevalence, compared AUC-PR and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) when the geographic extent of predictions was increased and assessed how well each metric reflected a model's utility to guide surveys for new populations. AUC-PR was robust to species rarity and, unlike AUC-ROC, not affected by an increasing geographic extent. The major advantages of AUC-PR arise because it does not incorporate correctly predicted absences and is therefore less prone to exaggerate model performance for unbalanced datasets. AUC-PR and precision were useful indicators of a model's utility for guiding surveys. We show that AUC-PR has important advantages for evaluating models of rare species, and its benefits in the context of unbalanced binary responses will make it applicable for other ecological studies. By not considering the true negative quadrant of the confusion matrix, AUC-PR ameliorates issues that arise when the geographic extent is increased beyond the species' range or when a large number of background points are used when absence information is unavailable. However, no single metric captures all aspects of performance nor provides an absolute index that can be compared across datasets. Our results indicate AUC-PR and precision can provide useful and intuitive metrics for evaluating a model's utility for guiding sampling, and can complement other metrics to help delineate a model's appropriate use.

AB Many researchers want to report an to measure the variance explained by a model. When the model includes correlation among data, such as phylogenetic models and mixed models, defining an faces two conceptual problems. (i) It is unclear how to measure the variance explained by predictor (independent) variables when the model contains covariances. (ii) Researchers may want the to include the variance explained by the covariances by asking questions such as How much of the data is explained by phylogeny? Here, I investigated three s for phylogenetic and mixed models. is an extension of the ordinary least-squares that weights residuals by variances and covariances estimated by the model; it is closely related to presented by Nakagawa and Schielzeth (2013. A general and simple method for obtaining R2 from generalized linear mixed-effects models. Methods Ecol. Evol. 4:133-142). is based on predicting each residual from the fitted model and computing the variance between observed and predicted values. is based on the likelihood of fitted models, and therefore, reflects the amount of information that the models contain. These three s are formulated as partial s, making it possible to compare the contributions of predictor variables and variance components (phylogenetic signal and random effects) to the fit of models. Because partial s compare a full model with a reduced model without components of the full model, they are distinct from marginal s that partition additive components of the variance. I assessed the properties of the s for phylogenetic models using simulations for continuous and binary response data (phylogenetic generalized least squares and phylogenetic logistic regression). Because the s are designed broadly for any model for correlated data, I also compared s for linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models. , , and all have similar performance in describing the variance explained by different components of models. However, gives the most direct answer to the question of how much variance in the data is explained by a model. is most appropriate for comparing models fit to different data sets, because it does not depend on sample sizes. And is most appropriate to assess the importance of different components within the same model applied to the same data, because it is most closely associated with statistical significance tests.

AB Separating evapotranspiration (ET) into evaporation (E) and transpiration (7) is challenging but key for a better understanding and prediction of the hydrological cycle and plant water use. In this study, flux data at 30 routine eddy-covariance sites were used to develop a new and simple method for ET partitioning based on the separation of soil and canopy conductances, with the main assumption that the latter is proportional to gross primary productivity (GPP). The result of T:ET across different plant functional types (PFTs) was consistent with recent modeling or empirical results. The mean annual T:ET was highest for evergreen needleleaf forests (0.75 +/- 0.17), followed by croplands (0.62 +/- 0.16) and grasslands (0.56 +/- 0.15). The leaf area index (LAI) was shown to explain only small (20%) variations of mean annual T:ET across sites. However, at each site, the correlation of T:ET with LAI was strong at the seasonal scale, where T:ET increased nonlinearly with LAI. The results did not show significant relationship of T:ET with long-term mean precipitation across sites at multiyear timescales. However, the partitioned soil evaporation after each precipitation pulse is consistent with three-stage soil evaporation theory. This ET partitioning method is an objective assessment as it is mainly data-driven. The procedure to apply this method is also simple so it can be readily applied to global flux tower networks at different temporal and spatial scales, enabling continuous estimation of T:ET to monitor ecosystem dynamics and hydrological responses to environmental change.

AB One interest of using biochar as soil amendment is to reduce pesticide adverse effects. In this paper, the sorption and degradation of thiacloprid (THI) in a black soil amended by various biochars were systematically investigated, and the mechanisms therein were explored by analyzing the changes in soil physicochemical properties, degrading enzymes and genes and microorganism community. Biochar amendment increased THI sorption in soil, which was associated with an increase in organic carbon and surface area and a decrease in H/C. Amendments of 300-PT (pyrolyzing temperature) biochar promoted the biodegradation of THI by increasing the microbe abundance and improving nitrite hydratase (NHase) activity. In contrast, 500- and 700-PT biochar amendments inhibited biodegradation by reducing THI availability and changing NHase activity and THI-degradative nth gene abundance, and instead promoted chemical degradation mainly through elevated pH, active groups on mineral surface and generation of center dot OH and other free radicals. Furthermore, THI shifted the soil microbial community, stimulated the NHase activity and elevated nth gene abundance. Biochar amendments also changed soil bacterial community by modulating soil pH, dissolved organic matter and nitrogen and phosphorus levels, which further influenced THI biodegradation. Therefore, the impact of biochars on the fate of a pesticide in soil depends greatly on their type and properties, which should be comprehensively examined when applying biochar to soil.

AB The concept of a pace-of-life syndrome describes inter- and intraspecific variation in several life-history traits along a slow-to-fast pace-of-life continuum, with long lifespans, low reproductive and metabolic rates, and elevated somatic defences at the slow end of the continuum and the opposite traits at the fast end. Pace-of-life can vary in relation to local environmental conditions (e.g. latitude, altitude), and here we propose that this variation may also occur along an anthropogenically modified environmental gradient. Based on a body of literature supporting the idea that city birds have longer lifespans, we predict that urban birds have a slower pace-of-life compared to rural birds and thus invest more in self maintenance and less in annual reproduction. Our statistical meta-analysis of two key traits related to pace-of-life, survival and breeding investment (clutch size), indicated that urban birds generally have higher survival, but smaller clutch sizes. The latter finding (smaller clutches in urban habitats) seemed to be mainly a characteristic of smaller passerines. We also reviewed urbanization studies on other traits that can be associated with pace-of-life and are related to either reproductive investment or self-maintenance. Though sample sizes were generally too small to conduct formal meta-analyses, published literature suggests that urban birds tend to produce lower-quality sexual signals and invest more in offspring care. The latter finding is in agreement with the adult survival hypothesis, proposing that higher adult survival prospects favour investment in fewer offspring per year. According to our hypothesis, differences in age structure should arise between urban and rural populations, providing a novel alternative explanation for physiological differences and earlier breeding. We encourage more research investigating how telomere dynamics, immune defences, antioxidants and oxidative damage in different tissues vary along the urbanization gradient, and suggest that applying pace-of-life framework to studies of variation in physiological traits along the urbanization gradient might be the next direction to improve our understanding of urbanization as an evolutionary process.

AB Urban environments are often seen as unique or degraded habitats that both present hardships for some sensitive species and provide opportunities to others. Non-indigenous species (NIS) are commonly referenced in the latter group, and are comprised of species that can tolerate the unique conditions or capitalize on the opportunities found in urban environments. Moreover, these urban beneficiaries may be those that normally cannot overcome competitive interactions in intact native communities, but find opportunity to flourish in urban habitats. We ask the question: do NIS benefit from urbanization? We answer this question using three strategies. First, we explore the problem conceptually, using community assembly theory. Second, we perform a broad literature review. Finally, we analyze studies with sufficient information using a meta-analysis. We show that the available evidence supports the proposition that NIS benefit from urbanization, with NIS obtaining higher abundances and greater diversity in more urbanized habitats. There were only 43 studies that measured NIS abundance and diversity while adequately quantifying the degree of urbanization surrounding plots, and effect sizes (measured by Hedge's D) reveal that NIS obtain higher abundances in more urbanized habitats, and especially for invertebrates. Despite the intense interest in NIS dynamics and impacts, we note a general dearth of robust studies that adequately quantify 'urbanization', and we end with a general call for more detailed research.

AB Histoplasma capsulatum is a pathogenic fungus that causes life-threatening lung infections. About 500,000 people are exposed to H. capsulatum each year in the United States, and over 60% of the U.S. population has been exposed to the fungus at some point in their life. We performed genome-wide population genetics and phylogenetic analyses with 30 Histoplasma isolates representing four recognized areas where histoplasmosis is endemic and show that the Histoplasma genus is composed of at least four species that are genetically isolated and rarely interbreed. Therefore, we propose a taxonomic rearrangement of the genus.
   IMPORTANCE The evolutionary processes that give rise to new pathogen lineages are critical to our understanding of how they adapt to new environments and how frequently they exchange genes with each other. The fungal pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum provides opportunities to precisely test hypotheses about the origin of new genetic variation. We find that H. capsulatum is composed of at least four different cryptic species that differ genetically and also in virulence. These results have implications for the epidemiology of histoplasmosis because not all Histoplasma species are equivalent in their geographic range and ability to cause disease.

AB Storm events can drive highly variable behavior in catchment nutrient and water fluxes, yet short-term event dynamics are frequently missed by low-resolution sampling regimes. In addition, nutrient source zone contributions can vary significantly within and between storm events. Our inability to identify and characterize time-dynamic source zone contributions severely hampers the adequate design of land use management practices in order to control nutrient exports from agricultural landscapes. Here we utilize an 8month high-frequency (hourly) time series of streamflow, nitrate (NO3-N), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and hydroclimatic variables for a headwater agricultural catchment. We identified 29 distinct storm events across the monitoring period. These events represented 31% of the time series and contributed disproportionately to nutrient loads (42% of NO3-N and 43% of DOC) relative to their duration. Regression analysis identified a small subset of hydroclimatological variables (notably precipitation intensity and antecedent conditions) as key drivers of nutrient dynamics during storm events. Hysteresis analysis of nutrient concentration-discharge relationships highlighted the dynamic activation of discrete NO3-N and DOC source zones, which varied on an event-specific basis. Our results highlight the benefits of high-frequency in situ monitoring for characterizing short-term nutrient fluxes and unraveling connections between hydroclimatological variability and river nutrient export and source zone activation under extreme flow conditions. These new process-based insights, which we summarize in a conceptual model, are fundamental to underpinning targeted management measures to reduce nutrient loading of surface waters.

AB Transdisciplinary approaches are becoming increasingly adopted as a way to research complex socioenvironmental problems. Conceptually, transdisciplinarity aims to foster meaningful knowledge co-production through integrative and participatory processes that bring together diverse actors, disciplines, and knowledge bases. In practice, transdisciplinarity is more ambiguous. While there is a growing body of literature on such approaches, there remains no widely-accepted definition, concrete framework, or empirical strategy for how to carry out a transdisciplinary project. We propose that this lack of explicit structure and entrenched meaning leaves space for transdisciplinary approaches to be shaped by the evolving network of participating scientists and stakeholders, according to their perspectives of the approach and what it embodies. Here, we examine the perspectives of a diverse group of actors (n = 42) embarking on a 10-year transdisciplinary research project focused on building resilience to natural hazards and disasters in New Zealand. We present the findings of qualitative surveys and group interviews that investigate stakeholders' and scientists' early perspectives of transdisciplinary, or co-created, research. The study represents the first stage of longitudinal research that will continue over the course of the project. Results show that early actors in the project share an overall consistent understanding of co-created research. Participants described a process that integrated diverse people and knowledge; created benefits on both a social and personal level; fostered clear, two-way dialogue; and overcame pragmatic and intrinsic challenges. Collectively, participants agreed with adopting transdisciplinary approaches to natural hazard, risk, and resilience research, with stakeholders showing a stronger degree of agreement than scientists. While attitudes towards transdisciplinarity were overall positive, a number of underlying conflicts emerged in regards to carrying out new modes of knowledge production within traditional social and institutional structures. These conflicts result in a tension that is felt by actors involved in transdisciplinary projects early on, and in some cases, influences perception of their ability to fully participate in such an approach. Evaluating actor perspectives and expectations early in the transdisciplinary process can give insight into how attitudes, expectations, and conflicts might shape transdisciplinary efforts, and can provide relevant parameters for assessing change over time.

AB Land plants exhibit a degree of homeostasis in leaf water content to protect against damage to photosynthetic and xylem tissues, and to maintain an efficient allocation of resources. This is achieved by a strong coordination between the systems regulating water delivery (xylem) and water loss (stomata). This review discusses evolution in xylem and stomatal function, specifically focussing on the interactions between them.

AB Depending on their relationship with the pelagic particulate matter, planktonic prokaryotes have traditionally been classified into two types of communities: free-living (FL) or attached (ATT) to particles, and are generally separated using only one pore-size filter in a differential filtration. Nonetheless, particulate matter in the oceans appears in a continuum of sizes. Here we separated this continuum into six discrete size-fractions, from 0.2 to 200 mu m, and described the prokaryotes associated to each of them. Each size-fraction presented different bacterial communities, with a range of 23-42% of unique (OTUs) in each size-fraction, supporting the idea that they contained distinct types of particles. An increase in richness was observed from the smallest to the largest sizefractions, suggesting that increasingly larger particles contributed new niches. Our results show that a multiple size-fractionation provides a more exhaustive description of the bacterial diversity and community structure than the use of only one filter. In addition, and based on our results, we propose an alternative to the dichotomy of FL or ATT lifestyles, in which we differentiate the taxonomic groups with preference for the smaller fractions, those that do not show preferences for small or large fractions, and those that preferentially appear in larger fractions.

AB How climate constrains species' distributions through time and space is an important question in the context of conservation planning for climate change. Despite increasing awareness of the need to incorporate mechanism into species distribution models (SDMs), mechanistic modeling of endotherm distributions remains limited in this literature. Using the American pika (Ochotona princeps) as an example, we present a framework whereby mechanism can be incorporated into endotherm SDMs. Pika distribution has repeatedly been found to be constrained by warm temperatures, so we used Niche Mapper, a mechanistic heat-balance model, to convert macroclimate data to pika- specific surface activity time in summer across the western United States. We then explored the difference between using a macroclimate predictor (summer temperature) and using a mechanistic predictor (predicted surface activity time) in SDMs. Both approaches accurately predicted pika presences in current and past climate regimes. However, the activity models predicted 8-19% less habitat loss in response to annual temperature increases of similar to 3-5 degrees C predicted in the region by 2070, suggesting that pikas may be able to buffer some climate change effects through behavioral thermoregulation that can be captured by mechanistic modeling. Incorporating mechanism added value to the modeling by providing increased confidence in areas where different modeling approaches agreed and providing a range of outcomes in areas of disagreement. It also provided a more proximate variable relating animal distribution to climate, allowing investigations into how unique habitat characteristics and intraspecific phenotypic variation may allow pikas to exist in areas outside those predicted by generic SDMs. Only a small number of easily obtainable data are required to parameterize this mechanistic model for any endotherm, and its use can improve SDM predictions by explicitly modeling a widely applicable direct physiological effect: climate-imposed restrictions on activity. This more complete understanding is necessary to inform climate adaptation actions, management strategies, and conservation plans.

AB The provision of multiple ecosystem services (ES) within a landscape is commonly referred to as landscape multifunctionality. Modifying landscapes to increase multifunctionality and reduce trade-offs with concurrent services bears the potential to enhance sustainability in human-dominated landscapes. Assessing landscape multifunctionality is thus crucial for land management and planning, but lack of a clear definition and operationalization of multifunctionality impedes comparisons of different study results.
   We want to address how elements of the study design affect results of multifunctionality assessments. Furthermore, we want to quantify future multifunctionality in the European Union (EU) and indicate the role of land use change and land use diversity on multifunctionality.
   We analyzed diverging scenarios depicting land use change in the EU between 2000 and 2040 for their effects on landscape multifunctionality. We tested different multifunctionality indicators at various spatial scales based on the modelling of 12 ES and biodiversity indicators.
   Particularly the analysis scale determines the interpretation of landscape multifunctionality. Coldspots identified by different indicators are in higher agreement than hotspots. We could not confirm links between land use diversity and landscape multifunctionality. While, at EU scale, multifunctionality slightly increases in future scenarios, agricultural intensification and (peri-)urban growth pose large threats to multifunctional landscapes.
   The choice of indicator and analysis scale strongly determine possible interpretations of the results. Rather than focusing on the impacts of land use change on multifunctionality, it is recommended to base land use policy on the impacts of location-specific change on ES supply and demands.

AB Ecological restoration of grasslands is increasingly based on regional seeds derived from predefined seed transfer zones. However, the degree and spatial pattern of genetic differentiation among provenances of different seed transfer zones is largely unknown. We assessed the genetic differentiation among eight out of 22 German seed transfer zones for seven common grassland species (Arrhenatherum elatius, Centaurea jacea, Daucus carota, Galium album, Hypochaeris radicata, Knautia arvensis and Lychnis flos-cuculi) using AFLP markers. We analysed genetic population structure with AMOVA and Bayesian cluster analysis and tested for isolation by distance and isolation by environment. In all of the investigated species, almost all pairs of provenances were genetically differentiated. Bayesian cluster analysis revealed species-specific numbers and spatial patterns of gene pools, with between two (Arrhenatherum) and eight clusters (Lychnis). Most investigated seed transfer zones represented a unique gene pool in the majority of the species. We found isolation by distance in four species, isolation by environment, driven by climatic seasonality, in three species, and a lack of both in three species. Thus, the observed genetic differentiation appears to be caused by both neutral and adaptive processes.Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that grassland plants are indeed strongly genetically differentiated across Germany supporting the strategy of seed transfer zones for ecological restoration. Although the predefined seed transfer zones are unlikely to match the exact genetic structure of many species, they serve their purpose by capturing a substantial amount of intraspecific genetic variation across species.

AB This study examines the effects of a prescribed fire on soil chemical properties in the Montgri Massif (Girona, Spain). The prescribed forest fire was conducted in 2006 to reduce understory vegetation and so prevent potential severe wildfires. Soil was sampled at a depth of 0-5 cm at 42 sampling points on four separate occasions: prior to the event, immediately after, one year after and nine years after. The parameters studied were pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+). All parameters (except pH) increased significantly immediately after the fire. One year after burning, some chemical parameters - namely, EC, available P and K+ - had returned to their initial, or even lower, values; while others - pH and total C - continued to rise. Total N, Ca2+ and Mg2+ levels had fallen one year after the fire, but levels were still higher than those prior to the event. Nine years after the fire, pH, total C, total N and available P are significantly lower than pre-fire values and nutrients concentrations are now higher than at the outset but without statistical significance. The soil system, therefore, is still far from being recovered nine years later. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Watershed management is an ever-evolving practice involving the management of land, water, biota, and other resources in a defined area for ecological, social, and economic purposes. In this paper, we explore the following questions: How has watershed management evolved? What new tools are available and how can they be integrated into sustainable watershed management? To address these questions, we discuss the process of developing integrated watershed management strategies for sustainable management through the incorporation of adaptive management techniques and traditional ecological knowledge. We address the numerous benefits from integration across disciplines and jurisdictional boundaries, as well as the incorporation of technological advancements, such as remote sensing, GIS, big data, and multi-level social-ecological systems analysis, into watershed management strategies. Weuse three case studies from China, Europe, and Canada to review the success and failure of integrated watershed management in addressing different ecological, social, and economic dilemmas in geographically diverse locations. Although progress has been made in watershed management strategies, there are still numerous issues impeding successful management outcomes; many of which can be remedied through holistic management approaches, incorporation of cutting-edge science and technology, and cross-jurisdictional coordination. We conclude by highlighting that future watershed management will need to account for climate change impacts by employing technological advancements and holistic, cross-disciplinary approaches to ensure watersheds continue to serve their ecological, social, and economic functions. We present three case studies in this paper as a valuable resource for scientists, resource managers, government agencies, and other stakeholders aiming to improve integrated watershed management strategies and more efficiently and successfully achieve ecological and socio-economic management objectives.

AB Worldwide pollinator declines are attributed to a number of factors, including pesticide exposures. Neonicotinoid insecticides specifically have been detected in surface waters, non-target vegetation, and bee products, but the risks posed by environmental exposures are still not well understood. Pollinator strips were tested for clothianidin contamination in plant tissues, and the risks to honey bees assessed. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) quantified clothianidin in leaf, nectar, honey, and bee bread at organic and seed-treated farms. Total glycogen, lipids, and protein from honey bee workers were quantified. The proportion of plants testing positive for clothianidin were the same between treatments. Leaf tissue and honey had similar concentrations of clothianidin between organic and seed-treated farms. Honey (mean +/- SE: 6.61 +/- 0.88 ppb clothianidin per hive) had seven times greater concentrations than nectar collected by bees (0.94 +/- 0.09 ppb). Bee bread collected from organic sites (25.8 +/- 3.0 ppb) had significantly less clothianidin than those at seed treated locations (41.6 +/- 2.9 ppb). Increasing concentrations of clothianidin in bee bread were correlated with decreased glycogen, lipid, and protein in workers. This study shows that small, isolated areas set aside for conservation do not provide spatial or temporal relief from neonicotinoid exposures in agricultural regions where their use is largely prophylactic.

AB Habitat connectivity and dispersal interact to structure metacommunities, but few studies have examined these patterns jointly for organisms across the aquatic-terrestrial ecotone. We assessed metacommunity structure and beta diversity patterns of instream benthic invertebrates, riparian carabid beetles (Order: Coleoptera; Family: Carabidae) and riparian spiders (Order: Araneae) at fifteen sites in a river-floodplain system. Sampling took place over a three-year period (2010-2012) in the Rhine-Main-Observatory LTER site on the Kinzig River, central Germany. This allowed disentangling the combined influence, and temporal variability, of habitat connectivity (i.e. between aquatic and terrestrial) and dispersal ability (i.e. between spiders and beetles, and aerial and aquatic dispersing invertebrates) on the dominant paradigms structuring these metacommunities. We found mostly consistent differences in the manner that metacommunities were structured between groups, with lower levels of variability explained for beetles compared to the other groups. Beetles were consistently structured more by turnover than nestedness components, with greater beta diversity than expected by chance and a minor spatial compared to environmental signal emerging with variance partitioning. Conversely, spiders and benthic invertebrates had lower beta diversity and greater nestedness than null expectation, and a clearer spatial signal controlling metacommunity structure. Our results suggest varying levels of mass effects and species sorting shape river-floodplain metacommunities, depending on habitat connectivity and dispersal ability. That is, greater connectivity and lower fragmentation along the river compared to the terrestrial zone promoted mass effects, and differences in overall dispersal ability and mode (i.e. active and passive) for instream and riparian communities shifted paradigms between mass effects and species sorting.

AB The conservation and sustainable use of forests in the twenty-first century pose huge challenges for forest management and policy. Society demands that forests provide a wide range of ecosystem services, from timber products, raw materials and renewable energy to sociocultural amenities and habitats for nature conservation. Innovative management and policy approaches need to be developed to meet these often-conflicting demands in a context of environmental change of uncertain magnitude and scale. Genetic diversity is a key component of resilience and adaptability. Overall, forest tree populations are genetically very diverse, conferring them an enormous potential for genetic adaptation via the processes of gene flow and natural selection. Here, we review the main challenges facing our forests in the coming century and focus on how recent progress in genetics can contribute to the development of appropriate practical actions that forest managers and policy makers can adopt to promote forest resilience to climate change. Emerging knowledge will inform and clarify current controversies relating to the choice of appropriate genetic resources for planting, the effect of silvicultural systems and stand tending on adaptive potential and the best ways to harness genetic diversity in breeding and conservation programs. Gaps in our knowledge remain, and we identify where additional information is needed (e.g., the adaptive value of peripheral populations or the genetic determinism of key adaptive traits) and the types of studies that are required to provide this key understanding.

AB The evolutionary potential of long-lived species, such as forest trees, is fundamental for their local persistence under climate change (CC). Genome-environment association (GEA) analyses reveal if species in heterogeneous environments at the regional scale are under differential selection resulting in populations with potential preadaptation to CC within this area. In 79 natural Fagus sylvatica populations, neutral genetic patterns were characterized using 12 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, and genomic variation (144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) out of 52 candidate genes) was related to 87 environmental predictors in the latent factor mixed model, logistic regressions and isolation by distance/environmental (IBD/IBE) tests. SSR diversity revealed relatedness at up to 150m intertree distance but an absence of large-scale spatial genetic structure and IBE. In the GEA analyses, 16 SNPs in 10 genes responded to one or several environmental predictors and IBE, corrected for IBD, was confirmed. The GEA often reflected the proposed gene functions, including indications for adaptation to water availability and temperature. Genomic divergence and the lack of large-scale neutral genetic patterns suggest that gene flow allows the spread of advantageous alleles in adaptive genes. Thereby, adaptation processes are likely to take place in species occurring in heterogeneous environments, which might reduce their regional extinction risk under CC.

AB In several species genetic differentiation across environmental gradients or between geographically separate populations has been reported to center at ''genomic islands of divergence," resulting in heterogeneous differentiation patterns across genomes. Here, genomic regions of elevated divergence were observed on three chromosomes of the highly mobile fish Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) within geographically fine-scaled coastal areas. The "genomic islands" extended at least 5, 9.5, and 13 megabases on linkage groups 2, 7, and 12, respectively, and coincided with large blocks of linkage disequilibrium. For each of these three chromosomes, pairs of segregating, highly divergent alleles were identified, with little or no gene exchange between them. These patterns of recombination and divergence mirror genomic signatures previously described for large polymorphic inversions, which have been shown to repress recombination across extensive chromosomal segments. The lack of genetic exchange permits divergence between noninverted and inverted chromosomes in spite of gene flow. For the rearrangements on linkage groups 2 and 12, allelic frequency shifts between coastal and oceanic environments suggest a role in ecological adaptation, in agreement with recently reported associations between molecular variation within these genomic regions and temperature, oxygen, and salinity levels. Elevated genetic differentiation in these genomic regions has previously been described on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and we therefore suggest that these polymorphisms are involved in adaptive divergence across the species distributional range.

AB There is high-level political support for the use of green infrastructure (GI) across Europe, to maintain viable populations and to provide ecosystem services (ES). Even though GI is inherently a spatial concept, the modern tools for spatial planning have not been recognized, such as in the recent European Environment Agency (EEA) report. We outline a toolbox of methods useful for GI design that explicitly accounts for biodiversity and ES. Data on species occurrence, habitats, and environmental variables are increasingly available via open-access internet platforms. Such data can be synthesized by statistical species distribution modeling, producing maps of biodiversity features. These, together with maps of ES, can form the basis for GI design. We argue that spatial conservation prioritization (SCP) methods are effective tools for GI design, as the overall SCP goal is cost-effective allocation of conservation efforts. Corridors are currently promoted by the EEA as the means for implementing GI design, but they typically target the needs of only a subset of the regional species pool. SCP methods would help to ensure that GI provides a balanced solution for the requirements of many biodiversity features (e.g., species, habitat types) and ES simultaneously in a cost-effective manner. Such tools are necessary to make GI into an operational concept for combating biodiversity loss and promoting ES.

AB The collation of citizen science data in open-access biodiversity databases makes temporally and spatially extensive species' observation data available to a wide range of users. Such data are an invaluable resource but contain inherent limitations, such as sampling bias in favour of recorder distribution, lack of survey effort assessment, and lack of coverage of the distribution of all organisms. Any technical assessment, monitoring program or scientific research applying citizen science data should therefore include an evaluation of the uncertainty of its results. We use 'ignorance' scores, i.e. spatially explicit indices of sampling bias across a study region, to further understand spatial patterns of observation behaviour for 13 reference taxonomic groups. The data is based on voluntary observations made in Sweden between 2000 and 2014. We compared the effect of six geographical variables (elevation, steepness, population density, log population density, road density and footpath density) on the ignorance scores of each group. We found substantial variation among taxonomic groups in the relative importance of different geographic variables for explaining ignorance scores. In general, road access and logged population density were consistently important variables explaining bias in sampling effort, indicating that access at a landscape-scale facilitates voluntary reporting by citizen scientists. Also, small increases in population density can produce a substantial reduction in ignorance score. However the between-taxa variation in the importance of geographic variables for explaining ignorance scores demonstrated that different taxa suffer from different spatial biases. We suggest that conservationists and researchers should use ignorance scores to acknowledge uncertainty in their analyses and conclusions, because they may simultaneously include many correlated variables that are difficult to disentangle.

AB Migration is a common strategy used by birds that breed in seasonal environments. Selection for greater migration efficiency is likely to be stronger for terrestrial species whose migration strategies require non-stop transoceanic crossings. If multiple species use the same transoceanic flyway, then we expect the migration strategies of these species to converge geographically towards the most optimal solution. We test this by examining population-level migration trajectories within the Western Hemisphere for 118 migratory species using occurrence information from eBird. Geographical convergence of migration strategies was evident within specific terrestrial regions where geomorphological features such as mountains or isthmuses constrained overland migration. Convergence was also evident for transoceanic migrants that crossed the Gulf of Mexico or Atlantic Ocean. Here, annual population-level movements were characterized by clockwise looped trajectories, which resulted in faster but more circuitous journeys in the spring and more direct journeys in the autumn. These findings suggest that the unique constraints and requirements associated with transoceanic migration have promoted the spatial convergence of migration strategies. The combination of seasonal atmospheric and environmental conditions that has facilitated the use of similar broad-scale migration strategies may be especially prone to disruption under climate and land-use change.

AB 1. Decreasing rate of migration in several species as a consequence of climate change and anthropic pressure, together with increasing evidence of space-use strategies intermediate between residency and complete migration, are very strong motivations to evaluate migration occurrence and features in animal populations.
   2. The main goal of this paper was to perform a relative comparison between methods for identifying and characterizing migration at the individual and population level on the basis of animal location data.
   3. We classified 104 yearly individual trajectories from five populations of three deer species as migratory or non-migratory, by means of three methods: seasonal home range overlap, spatio-temporal separation of seasonal clusters and the Net Squared Displacement (NSD) method. For migratory cases, we also measured timing and distance of migration and residence time on the summer range. Finally, we compared the classification in migration cases across methods and populations.
   4. All methods consistently identified migration at the population level, that is, they coherently distinguished between complete or almost complete migratory populations and partially migratory populations. However, in the latter case, methods coherently classified only about 50% of the single cases, that is they classified differently at the individual-animal level. We therefore infer that the comparison of methods may help point to 'less-stereotyped' cases in the residency-to-migration continuum. For cases consistently classified by all methods, no significant differences were found in migration distance, or residence time on summer ranges. Timing of migration estimated by NSD was earlier than by the other two methods, both for spring and autumn migrations.
   5. We suggest three steps to identify improper inferences from migration data and to enhance understanding of intermediate space-use strategies. We recommend (i) classifying migration behaviours using more than one method, (ii) performing sensitivity analysis on method parameters to identify the extent of the differences and (iii) investigating inconsistently classified cases as these may often be ecologically interesting (i.e. less-stereotyped migratory behaviours).

AB Range shift, a widespread response to climate change, will depend on species abilities to withstand warmer climates. However, these abilities may vary within species and such intraspecific variation can strongly impact species responses to climate change. Facing warmer climates, individuals should disperse according to their thermal optimum with consequences for species range shifts. Here, we studied individual dispersal of a reptile in response to climate warming and preferred temperature using a semi-natural warming experiment. Individuals with low preferred temperatures dispersed more from warmer semi-natural habitats, whereas individuals with higher preferred temperatures dispersed more from cooler habitats. These dispersal decisions partly matched phenotype-dependent survival rates in the different thermal habitats, suggesting adaptive dispersal decisions. This process should result into a spatial segregation of thermal phenotypes along species moving ranges which should facilitate local adaptation to warming climates. We therefore call for range shift models including intraspecific variation in thermal phenotype and dispersal decision.

AB Using genetic data to resolve the evolutionary relationships of species is of major interest in evolutionary and systematic biology. However, reconstructing the sequence of speciation events, the so-called species tree, in closely related and potentially hybridizing species is very challenging. Processes such as incomplete lineage sorting and interspecific gene flow result in local gene genealogies that differ in their topology from the species tree, and analyses of few loci with a single sequence per species are likely to produce conflicting or even misleading results. To study these phenomena on a full phylogenomic scale, we use whole-genome sequence data from 200 individuals of four black-and-white flycatcher species with so far unresolved phylogenetic relationships to infer gene tree topologies and visualize genome-wide patterns of gene tree incongruence. Using phylogenetic analysis in nonoverlapping 10-kb windows, we show that gene tree topologies are extremely diverse and change on a very small physical scale. Moreover, we find strong evidence for gene flow among flycatcher species, with distinct patterns of reduced introgression on the Z chromosome. To resolve species relationships on the background of widespread gene tree incongruence, we used four complementary coalescent-based methods for species tree reconstruction, including complex modeling approaches that incorporate post-divergence gene flow among species. This allowed us to infer the most likely species tree with high confidence. Based on this finding, we show that regions of reduced effective population size, which have been suggested as particularly useful for species tree inference, can produce positively misleading species tree topologies. Our findings disclose the pitfalls of using loci potentially under selection as phylogenetic markers and highlight the potential of modeling approaches to disentangle species relationships in systems with large effective population sizes and post-divergence gene flow.

AB Aim Early in their evolution, angiosperms evolved a diversity of leaf form far greater than that of any other group of land plants. Some of this diversity evolved in response to varying climate. Our aim is to test the global relationship between leaf form in woody dicot angiosperms and the climate in which they live.
   Location We have compiled a data set describing leaf form(using 31 standardized categorical characters) from 378 natural or naturalized vegetation sites from around the world. Our data include sites from all continents except Antarctica and encompass biomes from tropical to taiga, over a range of elevations from 0.5 m to over 3000 m.
   Methods We chose the Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program sampling, scoring and analytical protocols to test the relationships between climate and leaf form, which is based on canonical correspondence analysis. Cluster analysis evaluates the role of historical factors in shaping the patterns, and pairwise Pearson correlations examine the relationships among leaf characters.
   Results Woody dicot leaf characters form a physiognomic spectrum that reflects local climate conditions. On a global scale, correlations between leaf form and climate are consistent, irrespective of climate regime, vegetation type or biogeographic history. Relationships with temperature variables are maintained even when leaf margin characters, regarded as being particularly well correlated with mean annual temperature, are removed.
   Main conclusions In natural woody dicot vegetation an integrated spectrum of leaf form has developed across multiple leaf character states and species. This spectrum appears more strongly influenced by prevailing climate than biogeographic history. The covariation of leaf traits across species suggests strong integration of leaf form. New methods of exploring structure in multidimensional physiognomic space enable better application of leaf form to palaeoclimate reconstruction.

AB Daily animal movements are usually limited to a discrete home range area that scales allometrically with body size, suggesting that home-range size is shaped by metabolic rates and energy availability across species. However, there is little understanding of the relative importance of the various mechanisms proposed to influence home-range scaling (e.g., differences in realm productivity, thermoregulation, locomotion strategy, dimensionality, trophic guild, and prey size) and whether these extend beyond the commonly studied birds and mammals. We derive new home-range scaling relationships for fishes and reptiles and use a model-selection approach to evaluate the generality of home-range scaling mechanisms across 569 vertebrate species. We find no evidence that home-range allometry varies consistently between aquatic and terrestrial realms or thermoregulation strategies, but we find that locomotion strategy, foraging dimension, trophic guild, and prey size together explain 80% of the variation in home-range size across vertebrates when controlling for phylogeny and tracking method. Within carnivores, smaller relative prey size among gape-limited fishes contributes to shallower scaling relative to other predators. Our study reveals how simple morphological traits and prey-handling ability can profoundly influence individual space use, which underpins broader-scale patterns in the spatial ecology of vertebrates.

AB Earth system models demonstrate large uncertainty in projected changes in terrestrial carbon budgets. The lack of inclusion of adaptive responses of vegetation communities to the environment has been suggested to hamper the ability of modeled vegetation to adequately respond to environmental change. In this study, variation in functional responses of vegetation has been added to an earth system model (ESM) based on ecological principles. The restriction of viable mean trait values of vegetation communities by the environment, called habitat filtering', is an important ecological assembly rule and allows for determination of global scale trait-environment relationships. These relationships were applied to model trait variation for different plant functional types (PFTs). For three leaf traits (specific leaf area, maximum carboxylation rate at 25 degrees C, and maximum electron transport rate at 25 degrees C), relationships with multiple environmental drivers, such as precipitation, temperature, radiation, and CO2, were determined for the PFTs within the Max Planck Institute ESM. With these relationships, spatiotemporal variation in these formerly fixed traits in PFTs was modeled in global change projections (IPCC RCP8.5 scenario). Inclusion of this environment-driven trait variation resulted in a strong reduction of the global carbon sink by at least 33% (2.1 Pg C yr(-1)) from the 2nd quarter of the 21st century onward compared to the default model with fixed traits. In addition, the mid- and high latitudes became a stronger carbon sink and the tropics a stronger carbon source, caused by trait-induced differences in productivity and relative respirational costs. These results point toward a reduction of the global carbon sink when including a more realistic representation of functional vegetation responses, implying more carbon will stay airborne, which could fuel further climate change.

AB Novel assemblages of native and introduced species characterize a growing proportion of ecosystems worldwide. Some introduced species have contributed to extinctions, even extinction waves, spurring widespread efforts to eradicate or control them. We propose that trophic cascade theory offers insights into why introduced species sometimes become harmful, but in other cases stably coexist with natives and offer net benefits. Large predators commonly limit populations of potentially irruptive prey and mesopredators, both native and introduced. This top-down force influences a wide range of ecosystem processes that often enhance biodiversity. We argue that many species, regardless of their origin or priors, are allies for the retention and restoration of biodiversity in top-down regulated ecosystems.

AB Biodiversities can differ substantially among different wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) communities. Whether differences in biodiversity translate into differences in the provision of particular ecosystem services, however, is under active debate. Theoretical considerations predict that WWTP communities with more biodiversity are more likely to contain strains that have positive effects on the rates of particular ecosystem functions, thus resulting in positive associations between those two variables. However, if WWTP communities were sufficiently biodiverse to nearly saturate the set of possible positive effects, then positive associations would not occur between biodiversity and the rates of particular ecosystem functions. To test these expectations, we measured the taxonomic biodiversity, functional biodiversity, and rates of 10 different micropollutant biotransformations for 10 full-scale WWTP communities. We have demonstrated that biodiversity is positively associated with the rates of specific, but not all, micropollutant biotransformations. Thus, one cannot assume whether or how biodiversity will associate with the rate of any particular micropollutant biotransformation. We have further demonstrated that the strongest positive association is between biodiversity and the collective rate of multiple micropollutant biotransformations. Thus, more biodiversity is likely required to maximize the collective rates of multiple micropollutant biotransformations than is required to maximize the rate of any individual micropollutant biotransformation. We finally provide evidence that the positive associations are stronger for rare micropollutant biotransformations than for common micropollutant biotransformations. Together, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that differences in biodiversity can indeed translate into differences in the provision of particular ecosystem services by full-scale WWTP communities.

AB Fencing with grazing exclusion is an effective grassland restoration and management practice used to achieve sustainability of grassland ecosystems worldwide. However, how the fencing with grazing exclusion affects ecosystem services related to carbon and nitrogen dynamics in grassland ecosystems has remained controversial over the past two decades. We investigated plant biomass, diversity and function groups, as well as soil bulk density, pH, soil carbon and nitrogen contents and the carbon/nitrogen ratio within the upper 0-1 m soil layer in fenced grassland with grazing exclusion and in grazed grassland on the Loess Plateau (China) in 2012 and 2013. We estimated the carbon and nitrogen pools of the plants and soils to determine how the grazing exclusion affected them. Results showed that soil carbon content in the topsoil, plant biomass and diversity, and grasses increased, while bulk density, pH and forbs decreased after grazing exclusion. The increases in soil carbon content, the cumulative organic carbon pool and the rate of change in the cumulative organic carbon pool mainly occurred in the upper 20 cm soil layer after 8 years of grazing exclusion. Our study suggested that the 8-year grazing exclusion had a great influence on the carbon pools, but there were no changes in the soil nitrogen pool. Identifying the main factors that affect the carbon and nitrogen dynamics after grazing exclusion among the soil and plant properties should be given more attention in future studies.

AB In Europe, southern peninsulas served as major refugia during Pleistocene cold periods. However, growing evidence has revealed complex patterns of glacial survival within these southern regions, with multiple glacial refugia within each larger refugial area. We investigated the extent to which patterns of endemism and phylogeographic are concordant across animal species in the Iberian Peninsula, one of the most important unglaciated areas in Europe during the Pleistocene, can be explained in terms of climatic stability. We found that historical climatic stability (notably climate velocity measures integrating macroclimatic shifts with local spatial topoclimate gradients) was often among the most important predictors of endemic species richness for different taxonomic groups using models that also incorporated measures of modern climate. Furthermore, for some taxonomic groups, climatic stability was also correlated with patterns of spatial concordance in interpopulation genetic divergence across multiple taxa, and private haplotypes were more frequently found in relatively stable areas. Overall, our results suggest that both endemism patterns and cross-taxa concordant phylogeographic patterns across the Iberian Peninsula to some extent are linked to spatial variation in Late Quaternary climate stability, in agreement with the proposed 'refugia-within-refugia' scenario.

AB The modified ogive analysis and the block ensemble average were employed to investigate the impact of the averaging time extension on the energy balance closure over six land-use types. The modified ogive analysis, which requires a steady-state condition, can extend the averaging time up to a few hours and suggests that an averaging time of 30 min is still overall sufficient for eddy-covariance measurements over low vegetation. The block ensemble average, which does not require a steady-state condition, can extend the averaging time to several days. However, it can improve the energy balance closure for some sites during specific periods, when secondary circulations exist in the vicinity of the sensor. These near-surface secondary circulations mainly transport sensible heat, and when near-ground warm air is transported upward, the sensible heat flux observed by the block ensemble average will increase at longer averaging times. These findings suggest an alternative energy balance correction for a ground-based eddy-covariance measurement, in which the attribution of the residual depends on the ratio of sensible heat flux to the buoyancy flux. The fraction of the residual attributed to the sensible heat flux by this energy balance correction is larger than in the energy balance correction that preserves the Bowen ratio.

AB Cryoconite holes are known as foci of microbial diversity and activity on polar glacier surfaces, but are virtually unexplored microbial habitats in alpine regions. In addition, whether cryoconite community structure reflects ecosystem functionality is poorly understood. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and Fourier transform infrared metabolite fingerprinting of cryoconite from glaciers in Austria, Greenland and Svalbard demonstrated cryoconite bacterial communities are closely correlated with cognate metabolite fingerprints. The influence of bacterial-associated fatty acids and polysaccharides was inferred, underlining the importance of bacterial community structure in the properties of cryoconite. Thus, combined application of T-RFLP and FT-IR metabolite fingerprinting promises high throughput, and hence, rapid assessment of community structure-function relationships. Pyrosequencing revealed Proteobacteria were particularly abundant, with Cyanobacteria likely acting as ecosystem engineers in both alpine and Arctic cryoconite communities. However, despite these generalities, significant differences in bacterial community structures, compositions and metabolomes are found between alpine and Arctic cryoconite habitats, reflecting the impact of local and regional conditions on the challenges of thriving in glacial ecosystems.

AB Institution-oriented, top-down and community-oriented, bottom-up stakeholder approaches are evaluated for their ability to enable or constrain the implementation of adaptation in developing nations. A systematic review approach is used evaluate the project performance of 18 adaptation projects by three of the Global Environment Facility's (GEF) adaptation programmes (the Strategic Priority for Adaptation (SPA), the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), and the National Adaptation Programs of Action (NAPA)) according to effectiveness, efficiency, equity, legitimacy, flexibility, sustainability, and replicability. The ten SPA projects reviewed performed highest overall, especially with regards to efficiency, legitimacy, and replicability. The five SCCF projects performed the highest in equity, flexibility, and sustainability, and the three NAPA-related projects were the highest-performing projects with regards to effectiveness. A comparison of top-down and bottom-up approaches revealed that community stakeholder engagement in project design and implementation led to higher effectiveness, efficiency, equity, flexibility, legitimacy, sustainability, and replicability. Although low institutional capacity constrained both project success and effective community participation, projects that hired international staff to assist in implementation experienced higher overall performance. These case studies also illustrate how participatory methods can fail to genuinely empower or involve communities in adaptation interventions in both top-down and bottom-up approaches. It is thus crucial to carefully consider stakeholder engagement strategies in adaptation interventions.Policy relevanceWhile adaptation is now firmly on the policy and research agenda, actual interventions to reduce vulnerability and enhance resilience remain in their infancy, and there is limited information on the factors that influence the successful implementation of adaptation in developing areas. Engaging stakeholders in assessing vulnerability and implementing adaptation interventions is widely regarded to be an important factor for adaptation implementation and success. However, no study has evaluated the effects of stakeholder engagement in the actual implementation of adaptation initiatives. Effective stakeholder engagement is challenging, especially in a developing nation setting, due to high levels of poverty, inadequate knowledge on adaptation options, weak institutions, and competing interests to address more immediate problems related to poverty and underdevelopment. In this context, this article documents and characterizes stakeholder engagement in adaptation interventions supported through the GEF, examining how top-down or bottom-up stakeholder approaches enable or constrain project performance.

AB Many insects rely on symbiotic microbes for survival, growth, or reproduction. Over evolutionary timescales, the association with intracellular symbionts is stabilized by partner fidelity through strictly vertical symbiont transmission, resulting in congruent host and symbiont phylogenies. However, little is known about how symbioses with extracellular symbionts, representing the majority of insect-associated microorganisms, evolve and remain stable despite opportunities for horizontal exchange and de novo acquisition of symbionts from the environment. Here we demonstrate that host control over symbiont transmission (partner choice) reinforces partner fidelity between solitary wasps and antibiotic-producing bacteria and thereby stabilizes this Cretaceous-age defensive mutualism. Phylogenetic analyses show that three genera of beewolf wasps (Philanthus, Trachypus, and Philanthinus) cultivate a distinct clade of Streptomyces bacteria for protection against pathogenic fungi. The symbionts were acquired from a soil-dwelling ancestor at least 68 million years ago, and vertical transmission via the brood cell and the cocoon surface resulted in host-symbiont codiversification. However, the external mode of transmission also provides opportunities for horizontal transfer, and beewolf species have indeed exchanged symbiont strains, possibly through predation or nest reuse. Experimental infection with nonnative bacteria reveals that-despite successful colonization of the antennal gland reservoirs-transmission to the cocoon is selectively blocked. Thus, partner choice can play an important role even in predominantly vertically transmitted symbioses by stabilizing the cooperative association over evolutionary timescales.

AB Rain Use Efficiency (RUE), defined as Aboveground Net Primary Production (ANPP) divided by rainfall, is increasingly used to diagnose land degradation. Yet, the outcome of RUE monitoring has been much debated since opposite results were found about land degradation in the Sahel region. The debate is fueled by methodological issues, especially when using satellite remote sensing data to estimate ANPP, and by differences in the ecological interpretation. An alternative method which solves part of these issues relies on the residuals of ANPP regressed against rainfall (ANPP residuals). In this paper, we use long-term field observations of herbaceous vegetation mass collected in the Gourma region in Mali together with remote sensing data (GIMMS-3g Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to estimate ANPP, RUE, and the ANPP residuals, over the period 1984-2010. The residuals as well as RUE do not reveal any trend over time over the Gourma region, implying that vegetation is resilient over that period, when data are aggregated at the Gourma scale. We find no conflict between field-derived and satellite-derived results in terms of trends. The nature (linearity) of the ANPP/rainfall relationship is investigated and is found to have no impact on the RUE and residuals interpretation. However, at odds with a stable RUE, an increased run-off coefficient has been observed in the area over the same period, pointing towards land degradation. The divergence of these two indicators of ecosystem resilience (stable RUE) and land degradation (increasing run-off coefficient) is referred to as the second Sahelian paradox. When shallow soils and deep soils are examined separately, high resilience is diagnosed on the deep soil sites. However, some of the shallow soils show signs of degradation, being characterized by decreasing vegetation cover and increasing run-off coefficient. Such results show that contrasted changes may co-exist within a region where a strong overall re-greening pattern is observed, highlighting that both the scale of observations and the scale of the processes have to be considered when performing assessments of vegetation changes and land degradation.

AB The largest digitized dataset of land plant distributions in Australia assembled to date (750,741 georeferenced herbarium records; 6,043 species) was used to partition the Australian continent into phytogeographical regions. We used a set of six widely distributed vascular plant groups and three non-vascular plant groups which together occur in a variety of landscapes/habitats across Australia. Phytogeographical regions were identified using quantitative analyses of species turnover, the rate of change in species composition between sites, calculated as Simpson's beta. We propose six major phytogeographical regions for Australia: Northern, Northern Desert, Eremaean, Eastern Queensland, Euronotian and South-Western. Our new phytogeographical regions show a spatial agreement of 65% with respect to previously defined phytogeographical regions of Australia. We also confirm that these new regions are in general agreement with the biomes of Australia and other contemporary biogeographical classifications. To assess the meaningfulness of the proposed phytogeographical regions, we evaluated how they relate to broad scale environmental gradients. Physiographic factors such as geology do not have a strong correspondence with our proposed regions. Instead, we identified climate as the main environmental driver. The use of an unprecedentedly large dataset of multiple plant groups, coupled with an explicit quantitative analysis, makes this study novel and allows an improved historical bioregionalization scheme for Australian plants. Our analyses show that: (1) there is considerable overlap between our results and older biogeographic classifications; (2) phytogeographical regions based on species turnover can be a powerful tool to further partition the landscape into meaningful units; (3) further studies using phylogenetic turnover metrics are needed to test the taxonomic areas.

AB Plant functional characteristics may drive plant species richness effects on ecosystem processes. Consequently, the focus of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiments has expanded from the manipulation of plant species richness to manipulating functional trait composition. Involving ecophysiological plant traits in the experimental design might allow for a better understanding of how species loss alters ecosystem processes. Here we provide the theoretical background, design and first results of the 'Trait-Based Biodiversity Experiment' (TBE), established in 2010 that directly manipulates the trait composition of experimental plant communities.
   Analysis of six plant traits related to resource acquisition and use were analyzed using principal component analysis of 60 grassland species. The resulting two main axes describe gradients in functional similarity, and were used as the basis for designing plant communities with different functional and species diversity levels. Using such an approach allowed us to manipulate different levels of complementarity in spatial and temporal plant resource acquisition. In contrast to previous biodiversity experiments, the TBE is designed according to more realistic scenarios of non-random species loss along orthogonal axes of species trait dissimilarities. This allows us to tease apart the relative importance of selection and complementarity effects on multiple ecosystem processes, and to mechanistically study the consequences of plant community simplification.

AB Background: The Amazon to Andes transition zone provides large expanses of relatively pristine forest wilderness across environmental gradients. Such elevational gradients are an excellent natural laboratory for establishing long-term interactions between forest ecosystems and environmental parameters, which is valuable for understanding ecosystem responses to environmental change.
   Aims: This study presents data on elevational trends of forest structure (biomass, basal area, height, stem density), species richness, and composition from six elevational transects in the Andes.
   Methods: We analysed the spatial patterns of forest structure, above-ground biomass and composition from 76 permanent plots, ranging from lowland Amazonian rain forest to high-elevation cloud forests in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia.
   Results: Forest above-ground woody biomass stocks ranged from 247 Mg ha(-1) (Peru, 210 m) to 86 Mg ha(-1) (Peru, 3450 m), with significantly decreasing trends of tree height and biomass and an increasing trend of stem density with increasing elevation. We observed an increase in forest richness at three taxonomic levels at mid-elevation, followed by a decrease in richness within the cloud immersion zone.
   Conclusions: The transects show an increase in stem density, a decline in tree height and above-ground coarse wood biomass and a hump-shaped trend in species richness with increasing elevation. These results suggest that environmental change could lead to significant shifts in the properties of these ecosystems over time.

AB AimTo test two predictions of the phylogenetic niche conservatism hypothesis for the latitudinal diversity gradient: (1) species in colder regions tend to be more phylogenetically related to each other (i.e. greater phylogenetic clustering) than those in warmer regions, and (2) clades are younger in colder regions.
   LocationNorth America.
   MethodsCorrelation analysis was used to relate richness, mean clade age and phylogenetic relatedness (measured as phylogenetic species variability and net relatedness index) of angiosperm trees in 1175 regional assemblages (each with 12100 km(2)) to latitude and minimum temperature. The analysis was conducted for North America north of Mexico as a whole as well as for each of the three longitudinal bands (eastern, central and western) of North America.
   ResultsSpecies richness and mean clade age are negatively correlated with latitude and positively correlated with minimum temperature. Tree species in regional assemblages tend to be more phylogenetically related (clustered) in regions at higher latitudes with lower temperatures.
   Main conclusionsThe results of this study support two of the major predictions of the phylogenetic niche conservatism hypothesis for the latitudinal diversity gradient: species tend to be more phylogenetically clustered and ages of clades tend to be younger in colder regions, compared with those in warmer regions.

AB A fully coupled land surface hydrologic model, Flux-PIHM, is developed by incorporating a land surface scheme into the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM). The land surface scheme is adapted from the Noah land surface model. Because PIHM is capable of simulating lateral water flow and deep groundwater at spatial resolutions sufficient to resolve upland stream networks, Flux-PIHM is able to represent heterogeneities due to topography and soils at high resolution, including spatial structure in the link between groundwater and the surface energy balance (SEB). Flux-PIHM has been implemented at the Shale Hills watershed (0.08 km(2)) in central Pennsylvania. Multistate observations of discharge, water table depth, soil moisture, soil temperature, and sensible and latent heat fluxes in June and July 2009 are used to manually calibrate Flux-PIHM at hourly temporal resolution. Model predictions from 1 March to 1 December 2009 are evaluated. Both hydrologic predictions and SEB predictions show good agreement with observations. Comparisons of model predictions between Flux-PIHM and the original PIHM show that the inclusion of the complex SEB simulation only brings slight improvement in hourly model discharge predictions. Flux-PIHM adds the ability of simulating SEB to PIHM and does improve the prediction of hourly evapotranspiration, the prediction of total runoff (discharge), and the predictions of some peak discharge events, especially after extended dry periods. Model results reveal that annual average sensible and latent heat fluxes are strongly correlated with water table depth, and the correlation is especially strong for the model grids near the stream.

AB The extent to which similar ecological processes operate on land and in the sea has been much debated, with apparently 'fundamental' differences often disappearing when appropriate comparisons are made. However, marine and terrestrial ecology have developed as largely separate intellectual endeavours, which has hampered the search for general patterns and mechanisms. Here, I argue that marine-terrestrial comparative studies can be extremely useful at uncovering mechanisms when they explicitly consider those facets of the environment that are important to a particular hypothesis. Furthermore, the binary 'marine-terrestrial' division misses many opportunities for more interesting comparisons, several of which I highlight here. Increasing the flow of concepts, hypotheses, and data between marine and terrestrial ecologists is essential to reveal those differences that really are important.

AB Social networks are static illustrations of dynamic societies, within which social interactions are constantly changing. Fundamental sources of variation include ranging behaviour and temporal demographic changes. Spatiotemporal dynamics can favour or limit opportunities for individuals to interact, and then a network may not essentially represent social processes. We examined whether a social network can embed such nonsocial effects in its topology, whereby emerging modules depict spatially or temporally segregated individuals. To this end, we applied a combination of spatial, temporal and demographic analyses to a long-term study of the association patterns of Guiana dolphins, Sotalia guianensis. We found that association patterns are organized into a modular social network. Space use was unlikely to reflect these modules, since dolphins' ranging behaviour clearly overlapped. However, a temporal demographic turnover, caused by the exit/entrance of individuals (most likely emigration/immigration), defined three modules of associations occurring at different times. Although this factor could mask real social processes, we identified the temporal scale that allowed us to account for these demographic effects. By looking within this turnover period (32 months), we assessed fission-fusion dynamics of the poorly known social organization of Guiana dolphins. We highlight that spatiotemporal dynamics can strongly influence the structure of social networks. Our findings show that hypothetical social units can emerge due to the temporal opportunities for individuals to interact. Therefore, a thorough search for a satisfactory spatiotemporal scale that removes such nonsocial noise is critical when analysing a social system.

AB 1. Deforestation and forest fragmentation can drive species to local extinction, potentially changing the phylogenetic community structure and diversity of remaining assemblages. We tested this hypothesis analysing a large vegetation data set from a highly fragmented rain forest.
   2. We assessed 9000 trees (both saplings and adults) from 268 species in 45 rain forest patches (ranging from < 1 to 700 ha) in three landscapes with different deforestation levels (4%, 11%, and 24% forest cover) in Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. We tested whether species density (i.e. number of species per unit area) and phylogenetic structure and diversity differed among landscapes, whether they were related to patch area, and whether the relationships differed among landscapes.
   3. Overall, the observed differences in sapling and adult species densities across forest patches and landscapes (e. g. lower species densities in smaller patches) resulted in few and very weak changes in the phylogenetic community structure and diversity. Our results indicate that local extirpation of tree species may occur randomly or uniformly (but not in a clustered manner) throughout the phylogenetic tree, supporting the hypothesis of low phylogenetic conservatism of traits associated with vulnerability to forest fragmentation in the Neotropics.
   4. Synthesis. This study indicates that in highly deforested and fragmented rain forests, the local extirpation of tree species does not occur across entire lineages. These novel and hopeful findings have direct implications for the ecology and conservation of fragmented rain forests. The maintenance of phylogenetic diversity in highly fragmented landscapes suggests that ecosystem function and stability may be maintained despite the loss of a number of tree species. We argue that in this unique Neotropical region, both large and small rain forest patches are critical for conserving regional tree evolutionary history.

ID REGIONAL RESILIENCE; METAPHOR; CITY
AB For much of the 1990s and 2000s, the emphasis of urban policy in many global cities was on managing and mitigating the social and environmental effects of rapid economic growth. The credit crunch of 2008 and the subsequent recession have undermined some of the core assumptions on which such policies were based. It is in this context that the concept of resilience planning has taken on a new significance. Drawing on contemporary research in London and Hong Kong, the paper shows how resilience and recovery planning has become a key area of political debate. It examines what is meant by conservative and radical interpretations of resilience and how conservative views have come to dominate 'recovery' thinking, with Slite groups unwilling to accept the limits to the neo-liberal orthodoxies that helped to precipitate the economic crisis. The paper explores the implications of such thinking for the politics of urban development.

AB Generalist predators and parasitoids are considered to be important regulators of aphids. The former not only feed on these pests, but might also consume parasitoids at all stages of development. This direct or coincidental interference affects the natural control of aphids, the scale of which is largely unknown, and it has rarely been examined under natural conditions. Here, molecular diagnostics were used to track trophic interactions in an aphid-parasitoid-generalist predator community during the build-up of a cereal aphid population. We found that generalist predators, principally carabid and staphylinid beetles as well as linyphiid spiders, had strong trophic links to both parasitoids and aphids. Remarkably, more than 50% of the parasitoid DNA detected in predators stems from direct predation on adult parasitoids. The data also suggest that coincidental intraguild predation is common too. Generalist predators, hence, disrupt parasitoid aphid control, although the levels at which the predators feed on pests and parasitoids seem to vary significantly between predator taxa. Our results suggest that taxon-specific trophic interactions between natural enemies need to be considered to obtain a more complete understanding of the route to effective conservation biological control.

AB Trait-based microbial models show clear promise as tools to represent the diversity and activity of microorganisms across ecosystem gradients. These models parameterize specific traits that determine the relative fitness of an "organism" in a given environment, and represent the complexity of biological systems across temporal and spatial scales. In this study we introduce a microbial community trait-based modeling framework (MicroTrait) focused on nitrification (MicroTrait-N) that represents the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) using traits related to enzyme kinetics and physiological properties. We used this model to predict nalfier diversity, ammonia (NH3) oxidation rates, and nitrous oxide (N20) production across pH, temperature, and substrate gradients. Predicted nitrifier diversity was predominantly determined by temperature and substrate availability, the latter was strongly influenced by pH. The model predicted that transient N20 production rates are maximized by a decoupiing of the AOB and NOB communities, resulting in an accumulation and detoxification of nitrite to N20 by AOB. However, cumulative N20 production (over 6 month simulations) is maximized in a system where the relationship between AOB and NOB is maintained. When the reactions uncouple, the AOB become unstable and biomass declines rapidly, resulting in decreased NH3 oxidation and N20 production. We evaluated this model against site level chemical datasets from the interior of Alaska and accurately simulated NH3 oxidation rates and the relative ratio of AOA:A0B biomass. The predicted community structure and activity indicate (a) parameterization of a small number of traits may be sufficient to broadly characterize nitrifying community structure and (b) changing decadal trends in climate and edaphic conditions could impact nitrification rates in ways that are not captured by extant biogeochemical models.

AB The landscape matrix is suggested to influence the effect of habitat fragmentation on species richness, but the generality of this prediction has not been tested. Here, we used data from 10 independent studies on butterfly species richness, where the matrix surrounding grassland patches was dominated by either forest or arable land to test if matrix land use influenced the response of species richness to patch area and connectivity. To account for the possibility that some of the observed species use the matrix as their main or complementary habitat, we analysed the effects on total species richness and on the richness of grassland specialist and non-specialist (generalists and specialists on other habitat types) butterflies separately. Specialists and non-specialists were defined separately for each dataset. Total species richness and the richness of grassland specialist butterflies were positively related to patch area and forest cover in the matrix, and negatively to patch isolation. The strength of the species-area relationship was modified by matrix land use and had a slope that decreased with increasing forest cover in the matrix. Potential mechanisms for the weaker effect of grassland fragmentation in forest-dominated landscapes are (1) that the forest matrix is more heterogeneous and contains more resources, (2) that small grassland patches in a matrix dominated by arable land suffer more from negative edge effects or (3) that the arable matrix constitutes a stronger barrier to dispersal between populations. Regardless of the mechanisms, our results show that there are general effects of matrix land use across landscapes and regions, and that landscape management that increases matrix quality can be a complement to habitat restoration and re-creation in fragmented landscapes.

AB The geographic distributions of many taxonomic groups remain mostly unknown, hindering attempts to investigate the response of the majority of species on Earth to climate change using species distributions models (SDMs). Multi-species models can incorporate data for rare or poorly-sampled species, but their application to forecasting climate change impacts on biodiversity has been limited. Here we compare forecasts of changes in patterns of ant biodiversity in North America derived from ensembles of single-species models to those from a multi-species modeling approach, Generalized Dissimilarity Modeling (GDM). We found that both single- and multi-species models forecasted large changes in ant community composition in relatively warm environments. GDM predicted higher turnover than SDMs and across a larger contiguous area, including the southern third of North America and notably Central America, where the proportion of ants with relatively small ranges is high and where data limitations are most likely to impede the application of SDMs. Differences between approaches were also influenced by assumptions regarding dispersal, with forecasts being more similar if no-dispersal was assumed. When full-dispersal was assumed, SDMs predicted higher turnover in southern Canada than did GDM. Taken together, our results suggest that 1) warm rather than cold regions potentially could experience the greatest changes in ant fauna under climate change and that 2) multi-species models may represent an important complement to SDMs, particularly in analyses involving large numbers of rare or poorly-sampled species. Comparisons of the ability of single- and multi-species models to predict observed changes in community composition are needed in order to draw definitive conclusions regarding their application to investigating climate change impacts on biodiversity.

AB Reconsidering the relationship between human well-being and environmental quality is central for the management of wetlands and water resources and for public health itself We propose an integrated strategy involving three approaches. The first is to make assessments of the ecosystem services provided by wetlands more routine. The second is to adopt the "settings" approach, most developed in health promotion, wherein wetlands are one of the settings for human health and provide a context for health policies. Finally, a layered suite of health issues in wetland settings is developed, including core requirements for human health (food and water); health risks from wetland exposures; and broader social determinants of health in wetland settings, including livelihoods and lifestyles. Together, these strategies will allow wetland managers to incorporate health impact assessment processes into their decision making and to examine the health consequences of trade-offs that occur in planning, investment, development, and decision making outside their direct influence.

AB Large carnivores, such as brown bears, are focal species for conservation efforts. Historically, brown bears were persecuted in Europe for centuries before their gradual elimination from much of Western Europe. In contrast, large carnivore populations in North America were eradicated within two centuries in the east and within a few decades in the west. After a change towards conservation-oriented management in the 20th century, many bear populations are again increasing on both continents. Europe is seemingly less suited (i.e. higher human densities, greater habitat alteration and landscape fragmentation) than in North America, however bears seem to respond faster to conservation measures in Europe. We analyzed ecological and historical factors that may affect differences in reproductive allocation (mean litter size in relation to mean adult female body mass) and help explain why different brown bear populations react differently to conservation measures. The results indicated that mean litter size increased significantly with mean adult female body mass and a long persecution history. Our results suggest that high and long-term rates of nonselective harvesting can change life-history traits of large mammals, as has also been shown by modeling, but only has been documented for morphological traits. Incidentally, this "ghost of persecution past" may have helped some brown bear populations to be more productive and therefore to respond more positively to protective management policies than populations with short exploitation histories.

AB Two models for speciation via selection have been proposed. In the well-known model of 'ecological speciation', divergent natural selection between environments drives the evolution of reproductive isolation. In a second 'mutation-order' model, different, incompatible mutations (alleles) fix in different populations adapting to the same selective pressure. How to demonstrate mutation-order speciation has been unclear, although it has been argued that it can be ruled out when gene flow occurs because the same, most advantageous allele will fix in all populations. However, quantitative examination of the interaction of factors influencing the likelihood of mutation-order speciation is lacking. We used simulation models to study how gene flow, hybrid incompatibility, selective advantage, timing of origination of new mutations and an initial period of allopatric differentiation affect population divergence via the mutation-order process. We find that at least some population divergence can occur under a reasonably wide range of conditions, even with moderate gene flow. However, strong divergence (e. g. fixation of different alleles in different populations) requires very low gene flow, and is promoted when (i) incompatible mutations have similar fitness advantages, (ii) less fit mutations arise slightly earlier in evolutionary time than more fit alternatives, and (iii) allopatric divergence occurs prior to secondary contact.

AB Wildfire is the major disturbance in Mediterranean forests. Prescribed fire can be an alternative to reduce the amount of fuel and hence decrease the wildfire risk. However the effects of prescribed fire must be studied, especially on ash properties, because ash is an important nutrient source for ecosystem recovery. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of a low severity prescribed fire on water-soluble elements in ash including pH, electrical conductivity (EC), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), potassium (K), aluminum (Al), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), silica (SiO2) and total sulphur (TS). A prescribed fire was conducted in a cork oak (Quercus suber) (Q.S) forest located in the northeast part of the Iberian Peninsula. Samples were collected from a flat plot of 40 x 70 m mainly composed of Q.S and Quercus robur (Q.R) trees. In order to understand the effects of the prescribed fire on the soluble elements in ash, we conducted our data analysis on three data groups: all samples, only Q.S samples and only Q.R samples. All three sample groups exhibited a significant increase in pH, EC (p < 0.001), water-soluble Ca, Mg, Na, SiO2 and IS and a decrease in water-soluble Mn, Fe and Zn. Differences were identified between oak species for water-soluble K, Al and Fe. In Q.S samples we registered a significant increase in the first two elements p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively, and a non-significant impact in the third, at p < 0.05. In Q.R data we identified a non-significant impact on water-soluble K and Al and a significant decrease in water-soluble Fe (p < 0.05). These differences are probably due to vegetation characteristics and burn severity. The fire induced a higher variability in the ash soluble elements, especially in Q.S samples, that at some points burned with higher severity. The increase of pH, EC, Ca, Mg, Na and K will improve soil fertility, mainly in the study area where soils are acidic. The application of this low severity prescribed fire will improve soil nutrient status without causing soil degradation and thus is considered to be a good management strategy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB Activatable cell-penetrating peptides (ACPPs) are a new class of promising molecular imaging probes for the visualization of enzymes in vivo. The cell-penetrating function of a polycationic peptide is efficiently blocked by intramolecular electrostatic interactions with a polyanionic peptide. Proteolysis of a cleavable linker present between the polycationic cell-penetrating peptide and polyanionic peptide affords dissociation of both domains and enables the activated cell-penetrating peptide to enter cells. Here, we aimed to develop an ACPP sensitive to matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 (MMP-2/9) for nuclear imaging purposes. Methods: MMP-2/9 ACPPs and nonactivatable cell-penetrating peptides (non-ACPP) were prepared by 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl solid-phase peptide synthesis and labeled with Lu-177 or Lu-177/I-125 for dual-isotope studies. The in vivo biodistribution of these probes was assessed in MMP-2/9-positive tumor-bearing mice (n = 6) and healthy mice (n = 4) using g-counting. Furthermore, a radiolabeled cell-penetrating peptide serving as a positive control was evaluated in tumor-bearing mice (n = 6). Results: Biodistribution studies showed a 5-fold-higher retention of ACPP in tumor than in muscle (P < 0.01) and a 6-fold-higher tumor retention relative to non-ACPP (P < 0.01), supporting earlier studies on fluorescently labeled ACPPs proposing activation by tumor-associated MMP-2/9. Surprisingly, however, the uptake of ACPP was significantly higher than that of non-ACPP in almost all tissues (P < 0.01). To unravel the activation process of ACPP in vivo, we developed dual-isotope ACPP analogs (dACPPs) that allowed us to discriminate between uncleaved dACPP and activated dACPP. In vivo biodistribution of dACPP indicated that the tissue-associated counts originated from activated dACPP. Interestingly, dACPP administration to healthy mice, compared with MMP2/9-positive tumor-bearing mice, resulted in a similar dACPP biodistribution. Furthermore, a radiolabeled cell-penetrating peptide showed tumor-to-tissue ratios equal to those found for ACPP (P > 0.05). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the tumor targeting of radiolabeled MMP-2/9 ACPPs is most likely caused by the activation in the vascular compartment rather than tumor-specific activation, as suggested earlier. The results in the present paper indicate that different and more tissue-specific enzyme-ACPP combinations are needed to unleash the full potential of the elegant ACPP concept in living animals.

AB Native sagebrush ecosystems in the Great Basin (western USA) are often invaded following fire by exotic Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass), a highly flammable annual grass. Once B. tectorum is established, higher fire frequencies can lead to local extirpation of Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana (mountain big sagebrush) and have cascading effects on sagebrush ecosystems and the species that depend on them. We conducted a landscape-scale observational study to examine the distribution and cover of B. tectorum and A. tridentata 6 years after a large wildland fire. We used structural equation models to quantify the interacting influences of pre-fire tree canopy cover, perennial species cover, distance from potential seed source, and site environment on post-fire cover of B. tectorum and A. tridentata. Results confirmed a hypothesised negative effect of pre-fire tree canopy cover on post-fire cover of A. tridentata. Site-and landscape-level abiotic factors influenced pre-fire tree canopy cover, which, in turn, influenced the probability of rapid recovery to A. tridentata. However, B. tectorum cover was primarily influenced by a positive effect of incident solar radiation and a negative effect of perennial herbaceous species cover. Restoration efforts to reduce tree canopy cover should be limited to productive sites with sufficient cover of perennial herbaceous species to facilitate site recovery.

AB Wolf Canis lupus diet was studied by scat analysis in four main and several other locations recolonised by this species in Central and Western Poland between 2002 and 2009. Wild ungulates made up 94.8% of the total biomass of food consumed, with the most common being roe deer Capreolus capreolus (42.8%), wild boar Sus scrofa (22.6%) and red deer Cervus elaphus (22.2%). Supplementary prey were: fallow deer Dama dama (2.7%), brown hare Lepus europeus (2.5%) and Eurasian beaver Castor fiber (1.4%). Domestic animals, exclusively dogs and cats, made up 1.0% of food biomass. A high similarity in the ratio of wild ungulate species in wolf food biomass between study sites was observed. Wolves hunted wild ungulate species accordingly to their relative abundance in the community. As wild ungulates are abundant and livestock density is low the large forest tracts of Western Poland seems to be very good habitat for wolves. Therefore, with more dispersing wolves from Eastern Poland and Eastern Germany, wolf recovery could significantly accelerate in the next few years in this region.

AB Steep decline in forest fires about a century ago occurred in coniferous forests over large areas in North America and Fennoscandia. This poorly understood phenomenon has been explained by different factors in different regions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the validity of the four most commonly suggested causes of the decrease in forest fires: fire fighting, over-grazing, climate change and human influence. I compiled the available dendrochronological data and estimated the annually burned proportions of Pinus-dominated forests in four subcontinental regions during the past 500 years. These data were compared to the development of fire suppression, grazing pressure, climate and human livelihoods. The annually burned proportions declined over 90% in all studied regions. In three out of the four regions fires decreased decades before fire suppression began. Available drought data are annually well correlated with fires but could not explain the decrease of the level in annually burned areas. A rapid increase in the number of livestock occurred at the same time with the decrease in fires in the Western US but not in Fennoscandia. Hence, fire suppression in Central Fennoscandia and over-grazing in the Western US may have locally contributed to the reduction of burned areas. More general explanation is offered by human influence hypothesis: the majority of the past forest fires were probably caused by humans and the decrease in the annually burned areas was because of a decrease in human caused fires. This is in accordance with the old written records and forest fire statistics. The decrease in annually burned areas, both in Fennoscandia and the United States coincides with an economic and cultural transition from traditional livelihoods that are associated with high fire use to modern agriculture and forestry.

AB With growing pressure for conservation to pay its way, the merits of compensation for wildlife damage must be understood in diverse socio-ecological settings. Here we compare compensation programs in Wisconsin, USA and Solapur, India, where wolves (Canis lupus) survive in landscapes dominated by agriculture and pasture. At both sites, rural citizens were especially negative toward wolves, even though other wild species caused more damage. Wisconsin and Solapur differ in payment rules and funding sources, which reflect distinct conservation and social goals. In Wisconsin, as wolves recolonized the state, some periodically preyed on livestock and hunting dogs. Ranchers and some hunters were more likely to oppose wolves than were other citizens. The Wisconsin compensation program aimed to restore an iconic species by using voluntary contributions from wolf advocates to pay affected individuals more for wolf losses than for other species. By contrast, wolves had been continuously present in Solapur, and damages were distributed amongst the general populace. Government-supported compensation payments were on offer to anyone suffering losses, yet claims registered were low. There were no significant differences in attitudes of any particular segment of the population, but those losing high value livestock applied for compensation. Residents at both sites did not report (Wisconsin) or expect (Solapur) a change in attitude towards wolves as a result of compensation, yet they support the existence of such programs. To assess the merits of any compensation program, one must disentangle the multiple goals of compensation, such as reducing wolf killing or more fairly sharing the costs of conserving large carnivores.

AB Bathymodiolinae mussels have been used as a biological model to better understand the evolutionary origin of faunas associated with deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. Most studies to date, however, have sampled with a strong bias towards vent and seep species, mainly because of a lack of knowledge of closely related species from organic falls. Here we reassess the species diversity of deep-sea mussels using two genes and a large taxon sample from the South-Western Pacific. This new taxonomic framework serves as a basis for a phylogenetic investigation of their evolutionary history. We first highlight an unexpected allopatric pattern and suggest that mussels usually reported from organic falls are in fact poorly specialized with regard to their environment. This challenges the adaptive scenarios proposed to explain the diversification of the group. Second, we confirm that deep-sea mussels arose from organic falls and then colonized hydrothermal vents and cold seeps in multiple events. Overall, this study constitutes a new basis for further phylogenetic investigations and a global systematic revision of deep-sea mussels. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Ecosystem assessment and monitoring requires the development and application of suitable indicators, i.e. they need to be (i) reliable and capable of simplifying complex relationships, (ii) quantifiable and transparent in order to enable an easy communication, and (iii) fit for the purpose of indication. These requirements are scarcely fulfilled in current ecosystem assessment and monitoring efforts to address the requirements of international biodiversity conventions. Here we present and test a set of seven criteria towards an improved framework for ecosystems indication with particular emphasis on the indication of biodiversity and ecosystem services: purpose of indication, indicator type according to the EEA's Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response scheme, direct/indirect linkages to biodiversity and ecosystem services, spatial scale and scalability across scales, applicability of benchmarks/reference values, availability of data and protocols, and applicability of remote sensing. The criteria are tested using 24 indicators of ecosystem assessment and monitoring at the global, continental and regional scale. Based on the general trends revealed by our evaluation, we present recommendations to streamline and improve ecosystem indication with respect to international biodiversity conventions. The implementation of our recommendations does require concerted international effort, comparable, for instance, to the implementation of the Water Framework Directive in Europe.

AB The occurrence of multiple introductions may be a crucial factor in the successful establishment of invasive species, but few studies focus on the introduction of fungal pathogens, despite their significant effect on invaded habitats. Although Cryphonectria parasitica, the chestnut blight fungus introduced in North America and Europe from Asia during the 20th century, caused dramatic changes in its new range, the history of its introduction is not well retraced in Europe. Using 10 microsatellite loci, we investigated the genetic diversity of 583 isolates in France, where several introductions have been hypothesized. Our analyses showed that the seven most frequent multilocus genotypes belonged to three genetic lineages, which had a different and geographically limited distribution. These results suggest that different introduction events occurred in France. Genetic recombination was low among these lineages, despite the presence of the two mating types in each chestnut stand analysed. The spatial distribution of lineages suggests that the history of introductions in France associated with the slow expansion of the disease has contributed to the low observed rate of recombination among the divergent lineages. However, we discuss the possibility that environmental conditions or viral interactions could locally reduce recombination among genotypes.

AB The future trajectory of forest ecosystems under climate change is heavily debated. Previous studies on the impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems have focused mainly on direct effects of altered climatic conditions, whereas interactions with disturbance events have been largely neglected. The aim of this study is to explore interactions of drought with fire disturbance and to assess their effects on tree species shifts in the European Central Alps. Tree recruitment after a stand replacing wildfire in the Rhone valley, Switzerland, was measured along an altitudinal temperature moisture gradient. Recruitment was more successful in pioneer species (Betula pendula, Populus tremula and Salix appendiculata) than in pre-fire stand forming (PFSF) species (Larix decidua, Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris). Seedling and sapling density was not related to fire intensity, but it correlated with the distance to the forest edge in PFSF species. The window of opportunity for seedling establishment was short (1-2 years), and moisture deficit was the main limiting factor for tree recruitment at lower altitudes. We suggest that prolonged drought periods, as projected under continued global warming, will further aggravate tree recruitment success after fire disturbance at low altitudes of the Central Alps and may eventually lead to a shift from PFSF species to either more drought-tolerant species or to forest-free vegetation.

AB Freshwater mussels (Unionoida) show high intraspecific morphological variability, and some shell morphological traits are believed to be associated with habitat conditions. It is not known whether and which of these ecophenotypic differences reflect underlying genetic differentiation or are the result of phenotypic plasticity. Using 103 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers, we studied population genetics of three paired Unio pictorum populations sampled from two different habitat types (marina and river) along the River Thames. We found genetic differences along the Thames which were consistent with a pattern of isolation by distance and probably reflect limited dispersal via host fish species upon which unionoid larvae are obligate parasites. No consistent genetic differences were found between the two different habitat types suggesting that morphological differences in the degree of shell elongation and the shape of dorso-posterior margin are caused by phenotypic plasticity. Our study provides the first good evidence for phenotypic plasticity of shell shape in a European unionoid and illustrates the need to include genetic data in order properly to interpret geographic patterns of morphological variation.

AB This paper uses a farm level panel data from Ethiopia and a comprehensive empirical strategy to investigate the contribution of crop biodiversity on food production. We find that increasing the number of crop variety increases production. This result is stronger when rainfall level is lower. Moreover, the productivity analysis is complemented with the study of the determinants of farm level crop biodiversity. Empirical results suggest that rainfall, tenure security and household endowments tend to govern crop diversity decisions at the farm level. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Divergence and speciation can sometimes proceed in the face of, and even be enhanced by, ongoing gene flow. We here study divergence with gene flow in Darwin's finches, focusing on the role of ecological/adaptive differences in maintaining/promoting divergence and reproductive isolation. To this end, we survey allelic variation at 10 microsatellite loci for 989 medium ground finches (Geospiza fortis) on Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos. We find only small genetic differences among G. fortis from different sites. We instead find noteworthy genetic differences associated with beak. Moreover, G. fortis at the site with the greatest divergence in beak size also showed the greatest divergence at neutral markers; i.e. the lowest gene flow. Finally, morphological and genetic differentiation between the G. fortis beak-size morphs was intermediate to that between G. fortis and its smaller (Geospiza fuliginosa) and larger (Geospiza magnirostris) congeners. We conclude that ecological differences associated with beak size (i.e. foraging) influence patterns of gene flow within G. fortis on a single island, providing additional support for ecological speciation in the face of gene flow. Patterns of genetic similarity within and between species also suggest that interspecific hybridization might contribute to the formation of beak-size morphs within G. fortis.

AB We quantified fire-driven loss and post-fire recovery of understory and soil carbon (C) and nutrient pools for one to three years following a single prescribed fire in a naturally regenerated longleaf (Pinus palustris Mill.) and slash pine (Pintis elliottii Engelm. var. elliottii) forest located in north central Florida. Fire immediately reduced total aboveground understory C and nitrogen (N) pools, but these pools recovered to pre-fire levels after three years. Our results also showed that the effect of fire on the understory composition and structure was only short-lived. Prescribed fire significantly reduced total C and N pools in the forest floor (F and H horizon,,), and this effect persisted for at least one year postfire. Available NH4+, PO43-, Ca2+, Mg-2, and K+ concentrations in the forest floor decreased immediately after fire, but increased in the surface mineral soil (0 to 5 cm depth); Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ remained elevated for the first year after fire. Fire immediately reduced total ecosystem C and N pools by 40% and 27%, respectively, emitting 3860 g C m(-2) and 170 g N m(-2) to the atmosphere. The pools recovered to 67% and 76% of pre-fire C and N pools, respectively, after one year. Of the pools measured, C and N recovery in forest floor materials was the slowest, and projections of initial recovery rates suggest that it will take more than six years, the previous fire interval, to reach pre-fire levels. This slow recovery may indicate variation in past rates of forest floor accumulation due to management practices as well as effects of the severity of this or previous fires.

   2-GENERATION ANALYSIS
AB While habitat fragmentation is a central issue in forest conservation studies in the face of broad-scale anthropogenic changes to the environment, its effects on contemporary mating patterns remain controversial. This is partly because of the inherent variation in mating patterns which may exist within species and the fact that few studies have replication at the landscape level. To study the effect of forest fragmentation on contemporary mating patterns, including effective pollen dispersal, we compared four native populations of the Australian forest tree, Eucalyptus globulus. We used six microsatellite markers to genotype 1289 open-pollinated offspring from paired fragmented and continuous populations on the island of Tasmania and in Victoria on mainland Australia. The mating patterns in the two continuous populations were similar, despite large differences in population density. In contrast, the two fragmented populations were variable and idiosyncratic in their mating patterns, particularly in their pollen dispersal kernels. The continuous populations showed relatively high outcrossing rates (86-89%) and low correlated paternity (0.03-0.06) compared with the fragmented populations (65-79% and 0.12-0.20 respectively). A greater proportion of trees contributed to reproduction in the fragmented (de/d >= 0.5) compared with the continuous populations (de/d = 0.03-0.04). Despite significant inbreeding in the offspring of the fragmented populations, there was little evidence of loss of genetic diversity. It is argued that enhanced medium-and long-distance dispersal in fragmented landscapes may act to partly buffer the remnant populations from the negative effects of inbreeding and drift.

AB This paper reports 3 years of eddy covariance measurements (2002-2004) on a poplar plantation (Populus; x cancidensis Moench, Clone I-214) in Northern Italy. We analyzed seasonal and interannual variability of the net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) and evapotranspiration (ET) in relation to different meteorological and environmental conditions experienced by the plantation and to natural disturbances.
   In particular, during 2003 climatic conditions were exceptionally severe, with the highest mean air temperatures and the lowest precipitations observed in the study area in the last 50 years. In addition, during the late summer of 2004, the plantation was attacked by fall webworm larvae (Hyphantria cunea).
   The cumulated NEE during the three growing season (April-September) was -752.8, -626.7 and -702.7 g C m(-2) for 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. In the period June-August 2003, NEE was 35% and 29% higher than the NEE measured in the same period in 2002 and 2004, respectively, resulting in a lower net carbon uptake. As R-ECO did not show large differences over the three growing seasons, the reduction in net carbon sequestration of June-August 2003 is mainly explained by a reduction of GPP (-18% and -17% in 2002 and 2004, respectively).
   The cumulated ET over the three growing seasons was 388, 471, 484 kg H2O m(-2) for 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. This behaviour was due to the fact that the position of the water table remained close to the roots, therefore supplying enough water to the plantation, even during the driest period.
   The analysis of light curve parameters, their residuals and canopy conductance suggests that the reduction Of CO2 uptake during summer 2003 was mainly controlled by stomatal and non-stomatal limitations due to high temperatures, directly and in particular indirectly (i.e. through D) rather than by soil water stress.
   In conclusion, our study shows that in the presence of a heat-wave, a significant reduction of net productivity during summer may occur even in the absence of marked soil water stress. In addition to this sensitivity to high temperatures, which will likely increase in the future, the effects of natural disturbances may add further uncertainties, thus suggesting caution in the evaluation of the potential carbon sequestration of these ecosystems.

AB Metapopulation theory predicts that species richness and total population density of habitat specialists increase with increasing area and regional connectivity of the habitat. To test these predictions, we examined the relative contributions of habitat patch area, connectivity of the regional habitat network and local habitat quality to species richness and total density of butterflies and day-active moths inhabiting semi-natural grasslands. We studied butterflies and moths in 48 replicate landscapes situated in southwest Finland, including a focal patch and the surrounding network of other semi-natural grasslands within a radius of 1.5 km from the focal patch. By applying the method of hierarchical partitioning, which can distinguish between independent and joint contributions of individual explanatory variables, we observed that variables of the local habitat quality (e.g. mean vegetation height and nectar plant abundance) generally showed the highest independent effect on species richness and total density of butterflies and moths. Habitat area did not show a significant independent contribution to species richness and total density of butterflies and moths. The effect of habitat connectivity was observed only for total density of the declining butterflies and moths. These observations indicate that the local habitat quality is of foremost importance in explaining variation in species richness and total density of butterflies and moths. In addition, declining butterflies and moths have larger populations in well-connected networks of semi-natural grasslands. Our results suggest that, while it is crucial to maintain high-quality habitats by management, with limited resources it would be appropriate to concentrate grassland management and restoration to areas with well-connected grassland networks in which the declining species currently have their strongest populations.

AB Question: How does semi-natural grassland diversify after 65 years of differential application of Ca, N, P, and K fertilizers? Is fertilizer application adequately reflected by the Ellenberg indicator values (EIVs)?
   Location: Eifel Mountains, West Germany.
   Methods: The Rengen Grassland Experiment (RGE) was established in an oligotrophic grassland in 1941. Six fertilizer treatments (Ca, CaN, CaNP, CaNP- KCl, CaNP-K2SO4, and unfertilized control) were applied annually in five complete randomized blocks. Species composition of experimental plots was sampled in 2006 and compared with constancy tables representing grassland types in a phytosociological monograph of a wider area. Each plot was matched to the most similar community type using the Associa method. Mean EIVs were calculated for each treatment.
   Results: The control plots supported oligotrophic Nardus grassland of the Polygalo-Nardetum association (Violion caninae alliance). Vegetation in the Ca and CaN treatments mostly resembled montane meadow of Geranio-Trisetetum (Polygono-Trisetion). Transitional types between Poo-Trisetetum and Arrhenatheretum ( both from the Arrhenatherion alliance) developed in the CaNP treatment. In the CaNP- KCl and CaNP-K2SO4 treatments, vegetation corresponded to the mesotrophic Arrhenatheretum meadow. Major discontinuity in species composition was found between control, Ca, and CaN treatments, and all treatments with P application. EIVs for both nutrients and soil reaction were considerably higher in P treatments than in Ca and CaN treatments. Surprisingly, the control plots had the lowest EIVs for continentality and moisture, although these factors had not been manipulated in the experiment.
   Conclusions: Long-term fertilizer application can create different plant communities belonging to different phytosociological alliances and classes, even within a distance of a few meters. Due to their correlated nature, EIVs can erroneously indicate changes in factors that actually did not change, but co-varied with factors that did change. In P-limited ecosystems, EIVs for nutrients may indicate availability of P rather than N.

AB State and transition models provide a simple and versatile way of describing vegetation dynamics in rangelands. However, state and transition models are traditionally descriptive, which has limited their practical application to rangeland management decision support. This paper demonstrates an approach to rangeland management decision support that combines a state and transition model with a Bayesian belief network to provide a relatively simple and updatable rangeland dynamics model that can accommodate uncertainty and be used for scenario, diagnostic, and sensitivity analysis. A state and transition model, developed by the authors for subtropical grassland in south-east Queensland, Australia, is used as an example. From the state and transition model, an influence diagram was built to show the possible transitions among states and the factors influencing each transition. The influence diagram was populated with probabilities to produce a predictive model in the form of a Bayesian belief network. The behaviour of the model was tested using scenario and sensitivity analysis, revealing that selective grazing, grazing pressure, and soil nutrition were believed to influence most transitions, while fire frequency and the frequency of good wet seasons were also important in some transitions. Overall, the integration of a state and transition model with a Bayesian belief network provided a useful way to utilise the knowledge embedded in a state and transition model for predictive purposes. Using a Bayesian belief network in the modelling approach allowed uncertainty and variability to be explicitly accommodated in the modelling process, and expert knowledge to be utilised in model development. The methods used also supported learning from monitoring data, thereby supporting adaptive rangeland management. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Communities of aquatic macroinvertebrates, fish density and biomass, and environmental variables were investigated in three Patagonian mountain rivers affected by urbanization. The rivers Las Minas, Esquel and Carbon that flow through the towns of Cholila, Esquel and Corcovado, respectively (northwest Chubut, Argentina) were selected to assess the degree of impairment. A reference site and an urban site were established on each river. Water quality variables including conductivity, major nutrients, total suspended solids (TSS) and dissolved oxygen, habitat conditions and quality of riparian ecosystems were investigated in autumn, winter, spring and summer 2005-2006. Macroinvertebrates were sampled concurrently in three riffles and three pools at each site. Invertebrate species richness, EPT richness, the Shannon-Weaver diversity index, % EPT density, and the BMPS index were lower at urban sites, whereas % collectors increased. The most impaired site was below Esquel, the largest town. Senzilloides panguipulli (Plecoptera), Polypedilum and Rheotanytarsus species (Diptera: Chironomidae), Nais communis (Oligochaeta) and Meridialaris chiloeensis (Ephemeroptera) dominated assemblages at reference and moderately impaired sites in summer, whereas the strongly polluted reach below Esquel had low flow in summer and a community dominated by Limnodrilus spp. (Oligochaeta), Helobdella spp. (Hirudinea), and two Hyallela species (Amphipoda). Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that ammonia, conductivity and TSS were important variables structuring invertebrate assemblages. In contrast, fish density and biomass varied in a non-systematic manner among sites. Overall, urbanization resulted in varying degrees of habitat degradation, sedimentation and nutrient enrichment that were reflected by the macroinvertebrate assemblages, which can be used effectively to monitor the effects of urban communities on Patagonian mountain streams.

AB The most popular quantitative measure of landscape island use. The most frequent data sources of land use are satellite images, aerial photographs and maps. Another source of the data can also be land cadaster. The advantages of research based on data from land registers are their relatively good accessibility, nationwide coverage and updates at equal yearly intervals, and the direct possibility to combine the data with statistics published for administrative units. The author of this paper used the above resources to analyse land use changes in the region of Wielkopolska (Poland) in the period of system transformation (1989-2005). The analysis was performed using a synthetic measure of the landscape change, being a quotient of the share of land where hardened ground are dominant and land where biologically active areas prevail. The analysis showed that although the rate of land use changes decreased after 1989, it was marked with spatial irregularity and the differences became greater over time. The changes depend on environmental conditions to a very small extent. For the most part it was the socio-economic factors that caused land use changes, primarily the economic activity of residents. Economically underdeveloped regions were intensively afforested, nevertheless environmental conditions are favourable to technical development. Therefore underdeveloped areas should be stimulated, particularly in the scope of education and entrepreneurship. Such stimulating actions should be emphasised in regional programming documents, especially in the province development strategy. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dynamic vegetation models are useful tools for analysing terrestrial ecosystem processes and their interactions with climate through variations in carbon and water exchange. Long-term changes in structure and composition (vegetation dynamics) caused by altered competitive strength between plant functional types (PFTs) are attracting increasing attention as controls on ecosystem functioning and potential feedbacks to climate. Imperfect process knowledge and limited observational data restrict the possibility to parameterise these processes adequately and potentially contribute to uncertainty in model results. This study addresses uncertainty among parameters scaling vegetation dynamic processes in a process-based ecosystem model, LPJ-GUESS, designed for regional-scale studies, with the objective to assess the extent to which this uncertainty propagates to additional uncertainty in the tree community structure (in terms of the tree functional types present and their relative abundance) and thus to ecosystem functioning (carbon storage and fluxes). The results clearly indicate that the uncertainties in parameterisation can lead to a shift in competitive balance, most strikingly among deciduous tree PFTs, with dominance of either shade-tolerant or shade-intolerant PFTs being possible, depending on the choice of plausible parameter values. Despite this uncertainty, our results indicate that the resulting effect on ecosystem functioning is low. Since the vegetation dynamics in LPJ-GUESS are representative for the more complex Earth system models now being applied within ecosystem and climate research, we assume that our findings will be of general relevance. We suggest that, in terms of carbon storage and fluxes, the heavier parameterisation requirement of the processes involved does not widen the overall uncertainty in model predictions.

AB A fundamental goal of ecology is to understand whether ecological communities are structured according to general assembly rules or are essentially dictated by random processes. In the context of fragmentation, understanding assembly patterns and their mechanistic basis also has important implications for conservation. Using distribution data of 20 bat species collected on 11 islands in Gatun Lake, Panama, we tested for non-randomness in presence-absence matrices with respect to nestedness and negative species co-occurrence. We examined the causal basis for the observed patterns and conducted separate analyses for the entire assemblage and for various species submatrices reflecting differences in species' trophic position and mobility. Furthermore, we explored the influence of weighting factors (area, isolation, abundance) on co-occurrence analyses. Unweighted analyses revealed a significant negative co-occurrence pattern for the entire assemblage and for phytophagous bats alone. Weighting analyses by isolation retained a pattern of species segregation for the whole assemblage but nullified the non-random structure for phytophagous bats and suggested negative associations for animalivores and species with low mobility. Area- and abundance-weighted analyses always indicated random structuring. Bat distributions followed a nested subset structure across islands, regardless of whether all species or different submatrices were analysed. Nestedness was in all cases unrelated to island area but weakly correlated with island isolation for incidence matrices of all species, phytophagous bats, and mobile species. Overall, evidence for negative interspecific interactions indicative of competitive effects was weak, corroborating previous studies based on ecomorphological analyses. Our findings indicate that bat assemblages on our study islands are most strongly shaped by isolation effects and species' differential movement and colonization ability. From a conservation viewpoint this suggests that even in systems with high fragment-matrix contrast, a purely area-based approach may be inadequate, and structural and functional connectivity among patches are important to consider in reserve planning.

AB We have studied the surface runoff and sediment production on unpaved forest roads in Los Alcomocales Natural Park (southern Spain) using a simple portable rainfall simulator at an intensity of 72 turn h(-1). Thirty rainfall simulations were carried out on 10 road plots: on the roadbank (10), on the sidecast fill (10), and on the roadbed (10). On the roadbanks, the runoff coefficient was 58% and runoff flow appeared after 60-90 s. On the sidecast fills, the runoff coefficient was 27% and time to runoff was 5-108 s. Finally, on the roadbeds, the runoff coefficient was 51% and time to runoff was 25-89 s. The highest soil loss rate was found on the roadbanks (106 g m(-2)), due to slopes, the existence of loose colluviums, and a low plant cover. The total soil loss from the roadbank was 5 and 6 times higher than those from the roadbed and the sidecast fill, respectively. The sediment concentration increased during the first 6-8 min from the beginning of the simulations and then decreased steadily due to the loss of fine soil surface particles and porosity changes. Statistical analysis shows that plant cover on roadbanks, sidecast fills, and roadbeds has a significant effect on runoff. Rock fragment cover and slopes on the roadbank and the sidecast also influence runoff significantly. The behavior of roadbanks was similar to that of other cultivated soils and abandoned sloping fields. Sidecast fills had the same response as abandoned terraces or non-vegetated road embankments. Reducing the roadbank angle by approximately 40% and increasing the plant cover to 35-40% are necessary for keeping erosion below 18 g m(-2), as it was on the sidecast fills. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB When reproduction competes with the amount of resources available for survival during an unpredictable nonbreeding season, individuals should adopt a risk-sensitive regulation of their reproductive allocation. We tested this hypothesis on female reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), which face a trade-off between reproduction and acquisition of body reserves during spring and summer, with autumn body mass functioning as insurance against stochastic winter climatic severity. The study was conducted in a population consisting of two herds: one that received supplementary winter feeding for four years while the other utilized natural pastures. The females receiving additional forage allocated more to their calves. Experimental translocation of females between the herds was conducted to simulate two contrasting rapid alterations of winter conditions. When females receiving supplementary feeding were moved to natural pastures, they promptly reduced their reproductive allocation the following summer. However, when winter conditions were improved, females were reluctant to increase their reproductive allocation. This asymmetric response to improved vs. reduced winter conditions is consistent with a risk-averse adjustment in reproductive allocation. The ability of individuals to track their environment and the concordant risk-sensitive adjustment of reproductive allocation may render subarctic reindeer more resilient to climate change than previously supposed.

AB Eryngium is the largest and arguably the most taxonomically complex genus in the family Apiaceae. Infrageneric relationships within Eryngium were inferred using sequence data from the chloroplast DNA trnQ-trnK 5'-exon and nuclear ribosomal DNA ITS regions to test previous hypotheses of subgeneric relationships, explain distribution patterns, reconstruct ancestral morphological features, and elucidate the evolutionary processes that gave rise to this speciose genus. In total, 157 accessions representing 118 species of Eryngium, 15 species of Sanicula (including the genus Hacquetia that was recently reduced to synonymy) and the monotypic Petagnaea were analyzed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian methods. Both separate and simultaneous analyses of plastid and nuclear data sets were carried out because of the prevalence of polyploids and hybrids within the genus. Eryngium is confirmed as monophyletic and is divided into two redefined subgenera: Eryngium subgenus Eryngium and E. subgenus Monocotyloidea. The first subgenus includes all examined species From the Old World (Africa, Europe, and Asia), except Eryngium tenue, E. viviparum, E. galioides, and E. corniculatum. Eryngium subgenus Monocotyloidea includes all examined species from the New World (North, Central and South America, and Australia; herein called the "New World sensu strieto" clade) plus the aforementioned Old World species that fall at the base of this clade. Most sectional and subgeneric divisions previously erected on the basis of morphology are not monophyletic. Within the "New World sensu stricto" group, six clades are well supported in analyses of plastid and combined plastid and nuclear data sets; the relationships among these clades, however, are unresolved. These clades are designated as "Mexican", "Eastern USA", "South American", "North American monocotyledonous", "South American monocotyledonous", and "Pacific". Members of each clade share similar geographical distributions and/or morphological or ecological traits. Evidence from branch lengths and low sequence divergence estimates suggests a rapid radiation at the base of each of these lineages. Conflict between chloroplast and nuclear data sets is weak, but the disagreements found are suggestive that hybrid speciation in Eryngium might have been a cause, but also a consequence, of the different rapid radiations observed. Dispersal-vicariance analysis indicates that Eryngium and its two subgenera originated from western Mediterranean ancestors and that the present-day distribution of the genus is explained by several dispersal events, including one trans-Atlantic dispersal. in general, these dispersals coincide with the polytomies observed, suggesting that they played key roles in the diversification of the genus. The evolution of Eryngium combines a history of long distance dispersals, rapid radiations, and hybridization, culminating in the taxonomic complexity observed today in the genus.

AB Trans-Arctic dispersals and population and range expansions during the Pleistocene enhanced opportunities for evolutionary diversification and contributed to the process of speciation within the capelin, a northern marine-fish complex exhibiting a circumpolar distribution. Capelin is composed of four highly divergent and geographically discrete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) clades (609 bp; cytochrome b). Two clades occur in the North Atlantic, one associated with Canadian Atlantic waters, including Hudson Bay, and the second distributed from West Greenland to the Barents Sea. Two additional clades occur in the Arctic and northeast Pacific Oceans, representing the most recent divergence within the capelin phylogenetic tree. Judged from mtDNA diversity, capelin populations comprising all clades experienced at least one demographic and spatial reduction-expansion episode during recent Pleistocene glaciations that imprinted their molecular architecture. The large contemporary populations in the northeast Pacific and Arctic Oceans exhibited significant genetic structure whereas no such structure was detected in the equally extensive North Atlantic clades. All clades are characterized by one or two prevalent mtDNA haplotypes distributed over the entire range of the clade. Assuming a Pacific ancestor for capelin, we infer that capelin dispersed on two separate occasions to the North Atlantic. A more recent event resulted in the isolation of eastern Pacific and Arctic clades, with the Arctic clade positioned for a potential third Atlantic invasion, as revealed by the presence of this clade in the Labrador Sea. The Labrador Sea is a potential contact zone for three of the four capelin clades.

AB Male mate choice, expressed through courtship preferences, sometime occurs even under the mating system of polygyny, when the operational sex ratio is skewed toward males. The conditions under which male mate choice may be expected during polygyny are not well established. Servedio and Lande (2006, Evolution 60:674-685), assuming strict polygyny where all females have equal mating success, show that when having a preference does not increase the amount of energy that a male can put into courtship, male preferences for "arbitrary" female ornaments should not be expected to evolve; direct selection acts against them because they place males that carry them into situations in which there is high competition for mates. Here I explore in detail two situations under which logic dictates that this effect may be overcome or reversed. First I determine the contributions that direct and indirect selection place on male versus female preferences for traits that increase viability, using notation that allows the exact expression of these measures of selection. I find that direct selection against male preferences still predominates in the male mate choice model, causing less evolution by male than female preferences under these conditions. Second I address whether male mate choice is likely to evolve as a mechanism of premating isolation leading to species recognition, driven by the process of reinforcement. Reinforcement is compared under male and female mate choice, using a variety of models analyzed by both analytical techniques assuming weak selection and numerical techniques under broader selective conditions. I demonstrate that although under many conditions stronger premating isolation evolves under female mate choice, reinforcement may indeed occur via male mate choice alone.

AB Urban developments and road networks extend their impacts on the surrounding habitats along a variable distance, affecting birds living in natural environments. This study identifies the threshold distances upon which several cities and roads, located across a large mosaic landscape of ca. 300 km(2) in central Spain, alter the abundance patterns of the native avifauna. Total species richness, total bird abundance, and abundance of different guilds of birds which are potentially sensitive to human disturbances were modelled by means of tree regression analyzes. Nearby cities do not affect the total bird species richness in natural habitats of the study region. Total bird abundance increases near urban areas, mainly through its positive influence on urban-exploiter species. The effect of roads is negative and highly generalized, although threshold distances to roads vary among different groups of species. The bird communities of deciduous woodlands (ash groves, oak patches and poplars) show higher resilience to deletereous influences from nearby cities and roads. It would be desirable not to build new scattered urban developments within the remnant natural areas of this heavily fragmented region, because their existence and connection to the nearby cities by new roads would add 'invisible' negative effects on the native bird fauna (e.g. on some threatened species from open habitats), considering the buffer distances determining most significant impacts (400 m for urban areas, and 300 m for roads).

AB Recent studies have stressed the role of scent marks as signals potentially mediating competitor assessment. According to this view, receivers may use scent marks to derive information about the costs of exploiting a given area, but few studies have directly addressed this hypothesis. One of its main predictions is that scent marks should reflect a signaller's competitive ability. We simulated the situation faced by an intruding male when entering the scent-marked territories of rival males of varying competitive ability to test predictions about the role of scent marks in a lizard, Podarcis hispanica. We report that males were attracted to areas marked by males of similar or higher competitive ability (i.e. larger size), but not to areas scent marked by males of lower competitive ability, and that this preference disappeared towards the end of the breeding season. Our results show that ( 1) male lizards can assess rival competitive ability (i.e. rival size) on the basis of scent marks alone, ( 2) scent marks do not function as chemical barriers to deter intruders, and ( 3) male response to marked areas varies throughout the breeding season, suggesting a shift in the cost-to-benefit balance of entering a scent-marked area. We propose that male assessment of rival competitive ability may function as an indirect assessment mechanism of territory resource quality in this species, and thus that scent marks may convey information not only about costs but also about the benefits of exploiting a scent-marked area.

AB The influence of cyclic climate fluctuations and their impact on high-altitude species is still insufficiently understood. We therefore analysed in this study the genetic structure of cold-adapted animals and their coherence with geographical distributions throughout the Late Quaternary. We analysed 588 individuals from 23 populations of the alpine-endemic lesser mountain ringlet, Erebia melampus, by allozyme electrophoresis to detect its intraspecific differentiation. As an outgroup, we added one population of Erebia sudetica inalpina from Grindelwald (Swiss Alps). Seventeen of 18 loci were polymorphic. The mean F-ST over all samples was 37%. We detected strong differentiation into three lineages with the genetic distances between the two E. melampus groups being larger than between each of the two E. melampus groups and E. sudetica. The mean genetic distance among these three groups was 0.17. These results give evidence for the existence of a species complex within the E. melampus/sudetica group and indicate a discontinuous distribution within this group during at least the last ice age. One of them, E. sudetica inalpina, is found in the northern Alps and most probably had its Wurm glacial refugium north of the glaciated Alps. The western E. melampus group might have had a refugium at the southwestern Alps margin, the eastern group in the lower altitudes of the southeastern and/or eastern Alps. In the latter, a further subdivision within this relict area is possible.

AB The importance of developing multi-disciplinary approaches to solving problems relating to anthropogenic pollution is now clearly appreciated by the scientific community, and this is especially evident in boreal ecosystems exposed to escalating threats of petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC) contamination through expanded natural resource extraction activities. This review aims to synthesize information regarding the fate and behaviour of PHCs in boreal forest soils in both ecological and sustainable management contexts. From this, we hope to evaluate potential management strategies, identify gaps in knowledge and guide future research. Our central premise is that mycorrhizal systems, the ubiquitous root symbiotic fungi and associated food-web communities, occupy the structural and functional interface between decomposition and primary production in northern forest ecosystems (i.e. underpin survival and productivity of the ecosystem as a whole), and, as such, are an appropriate focal point for such a synthesis. We provide pertinent basic information about mycorrhizas, followed by insights into the ecology of ecto- and ericoid mycorrhizal systems. Next, we review the fate and behaviour of PHCs in forest soils, with an emphasis on interactions with mycorrhizal fungi and associated bacteria. Finally, we summarize implications for ecosystem management. Although we have gained tremendous insights into understanding linkages between ecosystem functions and the various aspects of mycorrhizal diversity, very little is known regarding rhizosphere communities in PHC-contaminated soils. This makes it difficult to translate ecological knowledge into environmental management strategies. Further research is required to determine which fungal symbionts are likely to survive and compete in various ecosystems, whether certain fungal - plant associations gain in ecological importance following contamination events, and how PHC contamination may interfere with processes of nutrient acquisition and exchange and metabolic processes. Research is also needed to assess whether the metabolic capacity for intrinsic decomposition exists in these ecosystems, taking into account ecological variables such as presence of other organisms (and their involvement in syntrophic biodegradation), bioavailability and toxicity of mixtures of PHCs, and physical changes to the soil environment.

AB The purpose of our study was to compare the number, proportion, and species composition of introduced plant species in forest patches situated within predominantly forested, agricultural, and urban landscapes. A previous study suggested that agricultural landscape context does not have a large effect on the proportion of introduced species in forest patches. Therefore, our main goal was to test the hypothesis that forest patches in an urban landscape context contain larger numbers and proportions of non-native plant species. We surveyed the vegetation in 44 small remnant forest fragments (3-7.5 ha) in the Ottawa region; 15 were situated within forested landscapes, 18 within agricultural landscapes, and 11 within urban landscapes. Forest fragments in urban landscapes had about 40% more introduced plant species and a 50% greater proportion of introduced plant species than fragments found in the other two types of landscape. There was no significant difference in the number or proportion of introduced species in forest fragments within forested vs. agricultural landscapes. However, the species composition of introduced species differed among the forest patches in the three landscape types. Our results support the hypothesis that urban and suburban areas are important foci for spread of introduced plant species.

AB Protected areas are becoming increasingly isolated. River corridors represent crucial links to the surrounding landscape but are also major conduits for invasion of alien species. We developed a framework to assess the risk that alien plants in watersheds adjacent to a protected area will invade the protected area along rivers. The framework combines species- and landscape-level approaches and has five key components: (l) definition of the geographical area of interest, (2) delineation of the domain into ecologically meaningful zones, (3) identification of the appropriate landscape units, (4) categorization of alien species and mapping of their distribution and abundance, and (5) definition of management options. The framework guides the determination of species distribution and abundance through successive, easily followed steps, providing the means for the assessment of areas of concern. We applied the framework to Kruger National Park (KAP) in South Africa. We recorded 231 invasive alien plant species (of which 79 were major invaders) in the domain. The KNP is facing increasing pressure from alien species in the upper regions of the drainage areas of neighboring watersheds. On the basis of the climatic modeling, we showed that most major riparian invaders have the ability to spread across the KNP should they be transported down the rivers, With this information, KNP managers can identify areas for proactive intervention, monitoring, and resource allocation. Even for a very large protected area such as the KNP, sustainable management of biodiversity will depend heavily on the response of land managers upstream managing alien plants. We suggest that this framework is applicable to plants and other passively dispersed species that invade protected areas situated at the end of a drainage basin.

AB General statistical patterns in community ecology have attracted considerable recent debate. Difficulties in discriminating among mathematical models and the ecological mechanisms underlying them are likely related to a phenomenon first described by Frank Preston. He noted that the frequency distribution of abundances among species was uncannily similar to the Boltzmann distribution of kinetic energies among gas molecules and the Pareto distribution of incomes among wage earners. We provide additional examples to show that four different 'distributions of wealth' (species abundance distributions, species-area and species-time relations, and distance decay of compositional similarity) are not unique to ecology, but have analogues in other physical, geological, economic and cultural systems. Because these appear to be general statistical patterns characteristic of many complex dynamical systems they are likely not generated by uniquely ecological mechanistic processes.

AB Sperm competition theory predicts that sperm traits influencing male fertilizing ability will evolve adaptively. However, it has been suggested that some sperm traits may be at least partly encoded by mitochondrial genes. If true, this may constrain the adaptive evolution of such traits because mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is maternally inherited and there is thus no selection on mtDNA in males. Phenotypic variation in such traits may nevertheless be high because mutations in mtDNA that have deleterious effects on male traits, but neutral or beneficial effects in females, may be maintained by random processes or selection in females. We used backcrossing to create introgression lines of seed beetles (Callosobruchus maculatus), carrying orthogonal combinations of distinct lineages of cytoplasmic and nuclear genes, and then assayed sperm viability and sperm length in all lines. We found sizeable cytoplasmic effects on both sperm traits and our analyses also suggested that the cytoplasmic effects varied across nuclear genetic backgrounds. We discuss some potential implications of these findings for sperm competition theory.

AB We evaluated the potential for using diatoms to assess and monitor nutrient enrichment in New Jersey streams and rivers, and propose inference models and indices for regulatory purposes. We assessed the relationship between benthic diatom and water chemistry samples (n = 101) collected from 45 sites in 3 ecoregions: Northern Piedmont, Northeastern Highlands and Ridge and Valley. Diatom assemblages were dominated by pollution-tolerant taxa. Multivariate analysis showed that nutrient concentrations explained significant proportions of the variation in diatom species composition. Weighted-averaging partial least square (WA-PLS) total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) inference models (n = 91) showed good predictive ability (TP model: r(apparent)(2) = 0.87; r(boot)(2) = 0.72; RMSEboot = 0.23 log(10) mu g L-1 TP; TN model: r(apparent)(2) = 088; r(boot)(2) = 0.58; RMSEboot = 0.23 log10 mu g L-1 TN). Diatom TP and TN indices were created to simplify presentation of results for the general public by rescaling the inferred TP and TN values from 0 to 100. The obtained index scores were assigned to nutrient impairment categories for regulatory assessment purposes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While transfers of formerly coppiced or grazed woodlands into shady high forests cause severe declines of woodland butterflies across Europe, increasing numbers of wild ungulates contribute to maintaining stand openness. To disentangle the relative effects of management and ungulates, we studied butterfly assemblages in the Milovicky Wood, southeastern Czech Republic. After centuries of short-rotation coppicing, the wood was abandoned in the 1950s and two game parks, for deer and mouflon, were established there in the 1960s. Comparisons of historical and recent records show severe declines, but the wood still hosts 83 butterfly and burnet species, including 19 nationally endangered ones. Recording along fixed transects disentangled effects of game keeping and management. Stands situated in the mouflon park hosted fewer species than those in either the deer park or outside of the parks. Clearings, coppice, coppice with standards and rides hosted more species than closed forest. The strongest predictors of composition of butterfly assemblages were plant communities and stand management, followed by vegetation covers, plant species richness and kind of game (mouflon, deer, none). Both game and management exhibited independent effects. Past high game densities contributed to butterfly losses, but have maintained open structures absent from woods managed for timber. Under reduced densities, mouflon exhibit adverse effects on butterflies but deer do not. Recent plans to transfer the area to high forest are incompatible with conserving local butterflies and incur high costs of forest protection against the animals. In contrast, re-establishment of active coppicing for fuel wood production would be optirrial for butterflies, compatible with game keeping. Finding a balance between game and traditional forms of management offers an opportunity for threatened biodiversity of European lowland forests. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Whether the mate sampling and choice performed by females in nature influences offspring performance is a controversial issue in theory and an open empirical question. Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) females engage in an obvious and energetically expensive mate sampling process to identify vigorous males. Although individual females sample independently, their choices converge on a small proportion of males that sire most young. offspring of attractive males were more likely to survive to weaning and to age classes as late as 5 years, resulting in a selection differential, calculated by expected differences in lifetime number of offspring weaned, of 0.32 against random mating. Enhanced survival to weaning appeared to be accomplished by faster growth rates. Females compensated for matings with a less attractive mate by elevating rates of milk delivery to their young. Because pronghorn males do not have costly ornaments, we conclude that female choice for good genes can exist in the absence of ornaments. Furthermore, female choice may be important and unrecognized as a force that can lower population genetic load.

AB Genetic structure and evolutionary patterns of the wild olive tree (Olea europaea L.) were investigated with AFLP fingerprinting data at three geographic levels: (a) phylogenetic relationships of the six currently recognized subspecies in Eurasia and Africa; (b) lineage identification in subsp. europaea of the Mediterranean basin; and (c) phylogeography in the western Mediterranean. Two statistical approaches (Bayesian inference and analysis of molecular variance) were used to analyse the AFLP fingerprints. To determine the congruency and transferability of results across studies previous RAPD and ISSR data were analysed in a similar manner. Comparisons proved that qualitative results were mostly congruent but quantitative values differed, depending on the method of analysis. Neighbour-Joining analysis of AFLP phenotypes supported current classification of subspecies. At a Mediterranean scale no clear cut phylogeographic pattern was recovered, likely due to extensive gene flow between populations of subsp. europaea. Gene flow estimates calculated with conventional F-statistics showed that reproductive barriers separated neither populations nor lineages of O. europaea. Genetic divergence between eastern and western parts of the Mediterranean basin was observed only when geographical and population information were incorporated into the analyses through hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). Within the western Mediterranean, the highest genetic diversity was found in two regions: on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar and in the Balearic archipelago. Additionally, long-lasting isolation of the northern-most populations of the Iberian Peninsula appeared to be responsible for a significant divergence.

AB Two different Cymodocea nodosa (Ucria) Ascherson beds growing in mining-contaminated sediments were compared with two reference beds in the Mar Menor coastal lagoon. The accumulation of Zn, Pb and Cd in different fractions of the plant, the sediment parameters that regulate the availability of metals, the seabed structure and dynamics of each seagrass bed and its associated macroinvertebrate community were studied. C nodosa accumulates metals from the sediments and reflects their bioavailability for this seagrass. At each station, the metal content of the rhizomes was lower than that of leaves and roots. The concentration of acid-volatile sulfides does not seem to influence the availability of metals to the seagrass, possibly due to oxygen transport to underground tissues. The highest metal concentration in all the contaminated stations was found in the leaf-biofilm, due to the formation of complexes between metals and the extracellular polymeric substances that form the biofilm. All the seagrass beds were seen to be undergoing expansion, those growing in contaminated sediments accumulating great quantities of metals and showing highest photosynthetic leaf surface area and highest leaf biomass. However, these structural parameters were not seen to be responsible for the differences in the faunal composition observed between contaminated and reference beds. Moreover, the multivariate analysis identified the metal content of leaves, biofilm and sediments as important variables that may be responsible for these differences in faunal composition. In this study we have demonstrated that both the seagrass C nodosa and the biofilm on the plant leaves may be used as environmental tools in the Mar Menor lagoon. The former is an useful indicator of sediment contamination, whereas the latter seems to be a good sentinel of water quality. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The increased potential for long-term degradative change associated with large-scale diffuse impacts in urban marine environments highlights the need to develop methods for assessing the ecological significance of any observed changes. This study defines "health" on the basis of the range of communities observed along gradients of anthropogenic impacts. This definition identifies both acute effects and broader scale degradation in community structure. Three multivariate constrained ordination techniques were used to assess changes in communities occurring along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient of stormwater pollution in two different habitats (estuaries and harbors). All three techniques detected changes, even when historical data sets, not specifically designed for the purpose, were utilized. Comparison with five diversity indices suggested that the multivariate approach was more successful in defining change and, thus, ecological health. Moreover, the information can easily be examined for changes in individual species, or for changes in function, trophic status, or biomass/size structure, improving interpretation of the ecological consequences of change. As this multivariate approach allows for monitoring community composition to determine whether sites are improving or degrading over time, it would be useful for aiding management decisions and assessing the efficiency of management actions. While this study occurred in one region only, the approach should be able to be utilized in other marine (or freshwater or terrestrial) systems where commensurable regional-scale multivariate databases exist.

AB Several studies have reported glacial refugia and migration pathways for different pine species in the Iberian Peninsula, all of them based on a single-species approach. In this paper, chloroplast microsatellites (cpSSRs) are used to compare population genetic structure and diversity estimates for interspecific pairs of populations located along a cline from southwestern (latitude 36 degrees 32' N, longitude 5 degrees 17' W) to northeastern Spain (latitude 42 degrees 14' N, longitude 2 degrees 47' E) in two widely distributed Mediterranean pines, Pinus halepensis Mill. and Pinus pinaster Ait. Some cpSSRs were shared between species, facilitating comparison of levels of gene diversity at the species level and inferences about within and among species differentiation. P. pinaster showed a much higher number of variants (29) and haplotypes (69) than P. halepensis (20 and 21, respectively). Moreover, genetic diversity estimates for interspecific pairs of populations along the cline were negatively correlated. Three main causes may explain the differences between species in the present-day distribution of genetic diversity: (1) the distribution of genetic variability before the Quaternary glaciations, with an earlier presence of P. pinaster in the Iberian Peninsula and a late spread of P. halepensis from eastern and central Europe, (2) the location of the Holocene glacial refugia and the migration pathways from these refugia to the present-day range (from northeast to southwest in P. halepensis and from southwest to northeast and northwest in P. pinaster) and (3) the interactions between species during the postglacial spread.

AB Despite their vulnerability to forest disturbances in the Neotropics, the consequences of forest perturbation on mixed species flocks are poorly understood in the threatened Southeast Asian rainforests. We examined the effects of local-scale habitat disturbance on mixed species flocks along an escalating gradient of anthropogenic modification (i.e., forest interior, forest edge, and urban) in a sub-montane tropical rainforest in Peninsular Malaysia that is presently experiencing low intensity development. Mixed species flocks in the forest interior and forest edge habitats (9.3 +/- 2.3 and 8.4 +/- 2.3, respectively) had significantly higher number of species than those observed in the urban habitat (5.1 +/- 1.7). Flock participation was influenced by environmental characteristics (e.g., canopy cover). Flocking species sensitive to habitat disturbance were likely to be from the Families Corvidae, Nectariniidae, and Sylviidae: had narrow to restricted altitudinal ranges; and were exclusively dependent on primary forest and understory micro-habitats. We conclude that sub-montane mixed species flocks are affected by even small scale urbanization and that they, particularly with species richness as a parameter, can be used as effective ecological indicators. With the looming development pressure on the sub-montane/montane habitats in Peninsular Malaysia and the Southeast Asian region, urgent conservation actions are needed for the preservation of their biotas.

AB The differential allocation hypothesis predicts that females invest more resources into reproduction when mating with attractive males. In oviparous animals this can include prefertilization decisions such as the production of larger eggs and the deposition of hormones, such as the steroid testosterone, into yolks. On the other hand, a compensatory hypothesis posits that females allocate more resources into the eggs when mated with males of inferior quality. In the present study, we show that free-living females of the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis), a small passerine bird, do not produce larger eggs or deposit more testosterone into eggs when mating with attractive males reflected by a large forehead patch size, which is contrary to the prediction of the differential allocation hypothesis. However, we found higher yolk testosterone concentrations in eggs laid for young than older males. Because in young males genetic quality, parental experience, or willingness to invest into paternal care is likely to be low, high yolk testosterone level in their clutches may indicate that their females follow a compensatory tactic. They may elicit more paternal care from young, inexperienced males by hormonally increasing nestling begging. Laying date was also correlated with yolk testosterone level; however, when we controlled for it, male age still remained a strong determinant of testosterone allocation.

AB Models of sexual selection propose that exaggerated secondary sexual ornaments indicate a male's own fitness and the fitness of his offspring. These hypotheses have rarely been thoroughly tested in free-living individuals because overall fitness, as opposed to fitness components, is difficult to measure. We used 20 years of data from song sparrows ( Melospiza melodia) inhabiting Mandarte Island, British Columbia, Canada, to test whether a male's song repertoire size, a secondary sexual trait, predicted overall measures of male or offspring fitness. Males with larger song repertoires contributed more independent and recruited offspring, and independent and recruited grandoffspring, to Mandarte's population. This was because these males lived longer and reared a greater proportion of hatched chicks to independence from parental care, not because females mated to males with larger repertoires laid or hatched more eggs. Furthermore, independent offspring of males with larger repertoires were more likely to recruit and then to leave more grandoffspring than were offspring of males with small repertoires. Although we cannot distinguish whether observed fitness variation reflected genetic or environmental effects on males or their offspring, these data suggest that female song sparrows would gain immediate and intergenerational fitness benefits by pairing with males with large song repertoires.

AB The relative influence of local habitat variables and stream network position on fish assemblages was evaluated in this study of first-order through third-order streams within the Beaverkill-Willowemoc watershed in New York. We compared fish distribution and abundance over local and landscape scales by surveying 69 randomly selected tributaries within this 775-km(2) watershed. We used watershed-level metrics of stream link magnitude, branch link, confluence link, downstream link, and stream order to evaluate the importance of stream network position upon fish assemblages. Results of canonical correspondence analysis indicated that six factors significantly influenced fish species abundance in our study watershed. The proportion of fine substrate, canopy cover, in-stream vegetation, and water temperature were the four local habitat factors related to the abundance of fish species in this watershed; confluence link and stream order were the stream network position measures with the greatest influence on fish assemblages. Our results show that stream fish assemblages in the study watershed were influenced by a combination of small-scale habitat variables and stream position within a watershed network. The significance of confluence link relative to that of other link measures designed to evaluate stream network position has never been previously established in a direct comparison. The usefulness of confluence link to characterize fish assemblages is consistent with efforts to identify metrics that are relevant to both watershed network geomorphology and ecology.

AB Accumulating publications on the feeding ecology of the Eurasian badger (Meles meles Linnaeus, 1758) in different habitats throughout Europe provide a basis for intra-specific comparisons, however, none has described their diet in cork oak "montado" woodlands, found in the southwestern extreme of the species' distribution. This study aims to understand how badgers use the available trophic resources in "Serra de Grandola" (SW Portugal) and is based on 450 scat samples collected between 1999 and 2000. Nine food-items were identified, 3 of which comprise 89% of the biomass ingested by badgers in the cork oak woodland: fruits (mainly olives, pears and figs), and adult and larval arthropods. Food abundance was measured, and was shown to fluctuate seasonally; the comparison between availability and consumption suggests that food selection is affected by the pattern of olive availability. These findings reinforce the accumulating evidence that badger ecology in many parts of Europe is heavily affected by local patterns of agriculture and reveal that in this habitat the badger is a generalist forager with seasonal specialisms.

TI Invasive plants in wildland ecosystems: merging the study of invasion
   processes with management needs
SO FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Review
ID PATTERNS; RECRUITMENT; DIVERSITY; MODEL
AB Increasing numbers of non-native species threaten the values of wildland ecosystems. As a result, interest in and research on invasive plant species in wildland settings has accelerated. Nonetheless, the ecological and economic impacts of non-native species continue to grow, raising the question of how to best apply science to the regulation and management of invasive plants. A major constraint to controlling the flow of potentially undesirable plant species is the lack of a strong regulatory framework concurrent with increases in trade volume. To address this, ecologists have been developing models to predict which species will be harmful to wildland values and are working with the horticultural industry to apply this information to the sale of species. The management of established invasive plants is hampered by conflicting goals, a lack of information on management outcomes, and a lack of funding. Ecologists and weed scientists can provide a scientific basis for prioritizing species for control and for managing species composition through the application of control technology, which can take place simultaneously with the manipulation of the ecological processes that influence community susceptibility to invasion. A stronger scientific basis for land management decisions is needed and can be met through nationally funded partnerships between university and agency scientists and land managers.

AB Processes operating at multiple spatial scales govern the structure and functioning of ecological communities. We conducted a resource manipulation and propagule addition experiment in grassland to evaluate the interaction of local resource availability and propagule pools in governing local-scale plant colonization, biodiversity, and above-ground productivity. The availabilities of establishment microsites and water were manipulated in field plots for two years through the application of experimental soil disturbances and irrigation, respectively. Resource manipulations led to increased invasibility of the community, as predicted by the theory of fluctuating resources. Rates of colonization, enhanced by the sowing of 32 grassland species, increased plant diversity and above-ground productivity, but to a greater extent under conditions of resource enrichment. Although resource enrichment generally increased diversity and productivity, these responses were contingent upon species availability and tended to be more pronounced in the presence of an expanded propagule pool. These findings suggest that biodiversity at the level of the available propagule pool and fluctuations in resources interact to regulate local resident diversity and productivity by determining opportunities for species sorting, by mediating community assembly, and by governing the potential for functional compensation in the community.

AB In order to elucidate the past distribution and colonization routes of broad-leaved evergreen (lucidophyllous) forests, we investigated the intraspecific phylogeographic patterns of lucidophyllous forests in Japan and surrounding areas. We selected 6 component species with a similar geographic distributions growing in Castanopsis-dominant forests. We defined possible important refugia during the glacial periods as the regions rich in rare haplotypes (with a frequency of 5% or less), or as regions rich in the number of common haplotypes (with a frequency of more than 5%). We then located the sites of refuge by comparing the intraspecific phylogeographic patterns among 6 component species of lucidophyllous forests with respect to these two parameters (i.e., haplotype uniqueness and the number of haplotypes). The following results were obtained during the course of this study: (1) rare haplotypes were distributed among islands around the main islands of Japan; (2) rare subtypes and the greatest numbers of common haplotypes were observed in Kyushu, a finding which agreed with fossilized pollen data demonstrative of the past existence of refugia in southern Kyushu; and (3) rare haplotypes were found on the Muroto Peninsula, and the second greatest numbers of common haplotypes were observed on the Kii Peninsula, a finding which suggested the existence of additional important refugia along the Pacific coast of Japan during the glacial ages.

AB 1. Predation may be a strong selective factor affecting individual behaviour and life histories. However, few studies have investigated whether predators affect breeding habitat selection of prey species.
   2. We tested whether breeding habitat selection and reproduction of a tropical migrant, the red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio L.), was related to the presence of breeding pairs of its potential nest predators, magpie (Pica pica L.), hooded crow (Corvus corone cornix L.) and jackdaw (C. monedula L.).
   3. Only magpie and hooded crow territories were associated with an elevated risk of predation based on an artificial nest experiment with nests mimicking red-backed shrike nests. Predation risk on real red-backed shrike nests was also higher close to nests of hooded crow and magpie than elsewhere in the landscape.
   4. Occupation frequency of known red-backed shrike territory sites during 3 years of study increased with increasing mean distance to the nearest magpie nest.
   5. Changes in spatial distribution of corvids affected the spatial distribution of red-backed shrikes. Vacant red-backed shrike territory sites were more likely to become occupied in the next year when magpie and hooded crows had moved away from the site, while occupied sites were more likely to be abandoned in the next year when at least hooded crows had moved closer.
   6. Our results suggest that breeding territories of nest predators may affect breeding habitat selection of prey species. Thus, a large part of an observed spatial dynamics of prey species may be caused by a corresponding spatial dynamics of predators. Because sink territories are occupied more irregularly than source territories, we suggest that the dynamics in predator sinks may be the driving force of the spatial dynamics of prey species.

AB If phylogeographic studies are to be broadly used for assessing population-level processes relevant to speciation and systematics, the ability to identify and incorporate instances of hybridization into the analytical framework is essential. Here, we examine the evolutionary history of two chipmunk species, Tamias ruficaudus and Tamias amoenus, in the northern Rocky Mountains by integrating multivariate morphometrics of bacular (os penis) variation, phylogenetic estimation, and nested clade analysis with regional biogeography. Our results indicate multiple examples of mitochondrial DNA introgression layered within the evolutionary history of these nonsister species. Three of these events are most consistent with recent and/or ongoing asymmetric introgression of mitochondrial DNA across morphologically defined secondary contact zones. In addition, we find preliminary evidence where a fourth instance of nonconcordant characters may represent complete fixation of introgressed mitochondrial DNA via a more ancient hybridization event, although alternative explanations of convergence or incomplete sorting of ancestral polymorphisms cannot be dismissed with these data. The demonstration of hybridization among chipmunks with strongly differentiated bacular morphology contradicts long-standing assumptions that variation within this character is diagnostic of complete reproductive isolation within Tamias. Our results illustrate the utility of phylogeographic analyses for detecting instances of reticulate evolution and for incorporating this and other information in the inference of the evolutionary history of species.

AB The abundance, diet, and prey relationships of American mink Mustela vison were studied in the Slonsk Reserve (W Poland) on two plots: shore and reservoir. Estimated mink number within the Reserve was 69 in autumn-winter 1998/1999 and 50 during spring 1999. The diet of American mink consisted mainly of mammals, birds and fish. In autumn-winter, birds formed 4-16%, whereas mammals constituted up to 56% and fish up to 62% of the biomass consumed, depending on the plot. In spring and summer, however, birds formed 45-60% of the biomass consumed in the reservoir and 35-46% of the biomass taken by mink on the shore. The European coot Fulica atra was the most frequently consumed prey. In spring, mink removed 7.8% (N=278 killed birds) of coots nesting in the Reserve, 1.8% (N=9) of breeding grebes Podiceps spp. and 11.2% of ducks (N=93 taken birds). On straw platforms only 13.6% of greylag geese Anser anser broods were successful. From 35 to 77% of the nests on straw platforms were destroyed by mink. In wooden boxes 46.4% of mallard Anas platyrhynchos and 33.3% of shelduck Tadorna tadorna nests were successful. American mink destroyed 22-40% of the nests in boxes. However, the arrival of American mink to the Slonsk Reserve has not resulted in a noteworthy decrease in waterfowl populations.

AB We investigated the interactive effects of soil phosphorus (P) heterogeneity, plant density and mycorrhizal symbiosis on plant growth and size variability of Trifolium subterraneum. We set up mesocosms (trays 49x49 cm and 12 cm deep) with the same amount of available P, but distributed either homogeneously or heterogeneously, in randomly arranged cells (7x7 cm each) with high or low available P. The trays were planted with either 1 or 4 seedlings of T subterraneum per cell. Half of the trays were inoculated with spores of the mycorrhizal fungus Gigaspora margarita. We harvested the plants when leaves just started to overlap, 8 weeks after planting. Plants growing in high P cells had the lowest percentage infection, but the highest mean shoot and root biomass and root length. The mean size of the plants in each cell was determined mainly by local P concentration. However, in plants growing in high density, low P cells, ca. 20% of the variability in plant biomass was explained by the number of adjacent cells with high P. Patchy trays had the highest total shoot biomass, independently of mycorrhizal infection or plant density. Inoculated trays (M) had higher total shoot biomass and relative competition intensity (measured as reduction in plant biomass due to increased density) than non-inoculated trays (NM). Plant density reduced the plant response to mycorrhizal infection, and its effect was independent of P distribution. All populations growing in patchy trays, and low density mycorrhizal ones, had the highest plant-size inequality, presumably because patchy distribution of P and mycorrhizal infection increased competitive asymmetry. We conclude that mycorrhizal symbiosis has the potential to strongly influence plant population structure when soil nutrient distribution is heterogeneous because it promotes pre-emption of limiting resources.

AB The effects of species richness and elevated CO2 on community productivity under altered nutrient levels were studied in experimental herbaceous communities composed of species from the Midwestern United States annual community, which consists of three functional groups C-3, C-4 and N-fixers. Aboveground and belowground biomass were measured at flowering stage and at the end of the experiment when fruits of most plants were ripe. At the low nutrient level, species richness did not have a significant effect on community productivity. However, at the high nutrient level, the community biomass decreased with decreasing species richness at both ambient and elevated CO2 in the first harvest, and at elevated CO2 in the second harvest. At low nutrient level, CO2 slightly increased community biomass at medium and high species richness. At high nutrient level, CO2 significantly increased community biomass in all species-richness treatments in the first harvest, but a significant response was observed only in the high richness treatment in the second harvest. At the functional group level, biomass of C-3 responded positively to CO2, and C-4 responded very negatively to CO2. The N-fixers responded positively to CO2 at low and medium species richness, but negatively at high species richness, showing a CO2 x richness interaction. CO2 increased species evenness in the communities, depending on nutrient level. Species varied in the responses of light-saturated net photosynthesis (P-max) to elevated CO2, even within functional groups. Our findings suggest that (1) the relationship between productivity and species diversity was dependent on nutrient levels. (2) Species diversity enhances responses of communities to elevated CO2. (3) Harvest time can affect the results of diversity-productivity experiments. (4) Responses of C-3, C-4, and N-fixers to elevated CO2 in communities did not follow the prediction based on functional groups or plants grown individually, rather it depended on species richness.

AB Mortality, growth, gas exchange and biomass distribution were measured in the seedlings of 12 Chilean temperate rainforest angiosperm trees in two contrasting artificial light environments (150 and 12 mumoles m(-2) s(-1)), in order to explore life history diversity in this forest type, and examine the physiological and/or morphological traits associated with interspecific variation in seedling performance. Gas exchange traits were measured only in the high-light treatment (150 mumoles m(-2) s(-1)), owing to the very small size of leaves in the low-light treatment. Relative growth rates (RGR) in high light were strongly correlated with photosynthetic capacity (P < 0.0001). Mortality rates in low light had a strong positive correlation with light compensation point (P = 0.007) and photosynthetic capacity (P = 0.004). Furthermore, high-light RGR was strongly positively correlated with low-light mortality (P = 0.001). Biomass distribution traits showed little relationship with mortality or growth within either light level, except for a marginally significant positive correlation (P = 0.04) between leaf area ratio and mortality in low light. In view of the large interspecific differences in final size, the weak relationships between biomass distribution parameters and plant performance could be partially attributable to ontogenetic drift in these traits. Among taxa with high mortality rates in low light, short-lived species (e.g. Aristotelia chilensis) had lower light compensation points, had greater phenotypic plasticity and grew much faster in both light environments than did longer-lived species (Nothofagus dombeyi , Weinmannia trichosperma, Eucryphia cordifolia). Results support the view that survival of first-year seedlings in low light is not enhanced by morphological traits that maximize growth potential (e.g. high leaf area ratio), and that leaf-level gas exchange traits have an important role as determinants of interspecific variation in seedling performance. However, the limited range of interspecific variation observed in light compensation points indicates that other traits apart from those that we measured (e.g. carbon storage) must also be involved in seedling shade tolerance differences. The weak relationship between longevity and shade tolerance level among our 12 species suggests that it may not be feasible to ordinate life histories of Chilean temperate rainforest trees on a single axis of trait variation.

AB 1. Measures of the quality of an individual are important in the study of proximate and ultimate factors in biology. Records of developmental history are particularly desirable, as many phenotypical traits are influenced by conditions during growth. Conspicuous irregularities in feathers, known as fault bars, result from a variety of stresses that occur during feather growth. The frequency of fault bars was evaluated on primary and tail feathers (grown 1 year previously) of 1919 adult American kestrels from a breeding population in Canada (1990-97).
   2. Most (91.5%) birds exhibited some fault-barring, although females had significantly more feathers with fault bars than mates (17% vs. 14%, respectively). Body size, intensity of haematozoan infections and leucocyte differentials were all unrelated to fault bars; however, birds with many fault bars were in poor body condition during prelaying (males) and incubation (males and females).
   3. Individual kestrels tended to be consistent in the number of feathers with fault bars from year to year.
   4. The percentage of feathers with fault bars was not associated with the timing of arrival in spring or prey abundance per territory; however, birds of both sexes with many bars were less likely to breed. Birds paired non-randomly, as mates tended to have a similar frequency of fault bars. Males and females with many bars had significantly later clutch initiation dates, but there were no negative consequences regarding clutch size or egg size.
   5. Female kestrels with many fault bars had lower survival probabilities. Both sexes were also less likely to be recaptured in years following initial banding if they had many bars, suggesting that they were more likely to emigrate from the study area temporarily.
   6. Fault bars on feathers appear to be indicative of an individual's susceptibility to stress, and are useful in predicting components of fitness. The use of fault bars is a promising toot as they are easy to evaluate and can be assessed on live or dead birds, on moulted feathers and on individuals repeatedly over time.

AB Floristic differences between alpine communities on calcareous and siliceous rocks have been mainly attributed to soil chemical properties in the European Alps. In contrast. water availability arid temperature. factors that correlate with calcareous and siliceous substrates, have received more attention in other mountain ranges. To compare the relative importance of soil chemical versus physical factors for explaining differences in floristic composition between Communities from calcareous and siliceous rocks, we conducted a fine-scale correlative study in the northern French Alps, in which the effects of' topographic variations were compared on dolomitic limestone (calcareous) and gneiss (siliceous). We analyzed 192 plots with correspondence analysis (CA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) using a matrix of 20 environmental variables including snow melt dates and water availability. We also measured aboveground biomass and available nitrogen and phosphorus for a subset of' the plots, Species composition, aboveground biomass, and species richness were highly correlated With Substrate type. However water availability. not substrate chemistry, appeared to drive differences in community composition, biomass, and richness, Siliceous substrates appeared to be more mesic because of' the water supplied at the Subsurface level. Conversely calcareous soils were drier, probably because of' the higher porosity of the rock.

AB A series of 10 samples from sediment in and adjacent to a shallow coastal iceberg scour at Signy Island. Antarctica. were taken by hand coring from 17 December 1993 until 23 August 1994. Scouring by the iceberg led to more than a 95% decrease in meiofaunal abundance and to a certain degree of reduction in diversity. Nematodes were always the most dominant group of meiofauna. The return of major meiofauna groups to control levels was accomplished in 30 days, although a decrease in abundance on the 50th day made interpretation difficult. The pioneering meiofaunal colonisers were copepods and ostracods. followed by nematodes. Microlaimus sp.1 was dominant among the nematodes throughout the whole period. Epistratum feeders and non-selective deposit feeders were highly dominant over selective deposit feeders and predators/omnivores. The Maturity Index. a measure for stress within nematode communities. was relatively low at all times and in controls, which indicates that r-strategists prevail in this community. In spite of the catastrophic destruction, nematode community structure was not affected by the iceberg impact. and there was no evidence of succession during recovery. This suggests that the nematode community in the shallow subtidal coast at Signy Island is well adapted to ice disturbance.

AB Inca Terns Larosterna inca are medium-size seabirds that breed along the Peruvian and Chilean coast. They are monogamous and both sexes incubate and contribute to chick provisioning. The sexes are similar in appearance and have elaborate ornaments, including a long white moustache of feathers and fleshy yellow wattles. In this paper we report the differences in ornamentation between sexes and examine whether the trait predicts body condition, reproductive performance or chick quality in either sex. The ornaments were similar in size and coloration between the sexes, except for the wattle length, the difference in which can be due to greater head length in males. Moustache length was the most reliable signal of body condition in both sexes. Moreover, there was a significant relationship between the moustache length and reproductive category of adults (non-breeder, unsuccessful breeder, or one or two chicks fledged). Both asymptotic chick body mass and the T-cell mediated response of chicks (a measure of immunocompetence) were related to the moustache length of male and female adults. These results provide support for the role of ornaments in mutual signalling of condition in this species. Female and male ornaments predict body condition, reproductive performance and chick quality, as predicted by sexual selection models.

AB Widespread hunting had fragmented and severely reduced elephant populations in South Africa by 1900. Elephant numbers increased during the 1900s, although rates of recovery of individual populations varied. The Kruger National Park elephant population increased rapidly, to more than 6000 by 1967, with recruitment boosted by immigration from Mozambique. The Addo Elephant National Park population was reduced to 11 elephants in 1931 and remains relatively small (n = 325). Loss of genetic variation is expected to occur whenever a population goes through a bottleneck, especially when post-bottleneck recovery is slow. Variation at nine polymorphic microsatellite loci was analysed for Kruger and Addo elephants, as well as museum specimens of Addo elephants shot prior to the population bottleneck. Significantly reduced genetic variation and heterozygosity were observed in Addo in comparison to Kruger (mean alleles/locus and H-E: Addo 1.89, 0.18; Kruger 3.89, 0.44). Two alleles not present in the current Addo population were observed in the museum specimens. Addo elephants represent a genetic subset of the Kruger population, with high levels of genetic differentiation resulting from rapid genetic drift. The Kruger population is low in genetic diversity in comparison to East African elephants, confirming this population also suffered an appreciable bottleneck.

AB The recent colonization of North America by Drosophila subobscura has provided a great opportunity to analyze a colonization process from the beginning. A comparative study using 10 microsatellite loci was conducted for five European and two North American populations. No genetic differentiation between European populations was detected, indicating that gene flow is high among them and that the microsatellites used in the present work represent neutral markers not subject to differentiation due to selection. Extensive reduction in the number of alleles and a significant decrease in heterozygosity in colonizing populations were detected that could be explained by the founder effect and a subsequent quick but not infinite expansion. Assuming that all alleles present in the colonized area were carried by the sample of colonizers, we estimated that most probably 4-11 individuals expanded in the new area. F-ST and the chord distance measures reflect the colonization process more accurately, since drift has been the major force in differentiating the Old and New World populations, and thus other measures considering allele size differences, such as Rho(ST) and delta mu (2), are less reliable for studying nonequilibrium populations. Finally, our results were consistent with the two-phase microsatellite mutational model, indicating that most alleles are generated by gain or loss of a repeat unit, while some alleles originate by more complex mutations.

AB The relative merits of different methods for separating root and shoot competition in plants are reviewed. The 'Divided Pot' technique involves vertical partitions that divide above- and below-ground competition within pots. This design usually creates unrealistic competition for light by using artificial barriers around pot perimeters to contain above-ground growth and by using a constant orientation of incident light from directly above. The 'Row' technique involves parallel rows of plants that are separated by vertical partitions above- and below-ground. Although, this design may be well suited to some agricultural applications, its value for field studies of wild plants is limited. The Divided Pot and Row techniques have been associated often with the replacement series design, which has a number of limitations. The 'Target' technique has always been associated with an additive planting design as it involves surrounding a plant of interest (the 'target') with other plants (the 'neighbours') while including above- and below-ground partitions to prevent root and shoot competition. Most studies using this technique have not provided adequate control for apparatus effects, yet this method appears to have the most potential for application in ecological studies, especially in the field. A standard protocol for the target technique is proposed allowing greater control over potential apparatus effects than in previous studies and allowing assessment of the interaction between root competition and shoot competition.

AB 1. Agonistic behaviour can be an important trait in determining individual success under interference competition, but it also generates energetic and physiological costs. The ensuing trade-off is expected to be dependent on the individual state. This study tests whether aggression patterns of juvenile Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar are linked to the recent growth history and the developmental pathway adopted by fish (early vs late migrants).
   2. By manipulating growth rates over 1 month in the autumn, three groups of fish were produced differing in body size and thereby in the length increment necessary to achieve the threshold size for migration in the following spring. Fish that had experienced reduced rations or abnormally low temperatures during the manipulation period experienced 'catch-up' growth after the resumption of standard growth conditions.
   3. Aggression was strongly connected to growth bimodality and the underlying developmental polyphenism. Fast-growing (upper modal group, UMG) fish (which would migrate in the spring) were more aggressive than slow-growing (lower modal group, LMG) fish (which would delay migration for another year), but they were also more vulnerable to being attacked by conspecifics.
   4. Aggressive acts initiated by UMG fish were strongly biased towards fish of the same category (57-77% of aggressive acts being against other UMG fish). Under illumination conditions simulating overcast nights, UMG individuals sharply reduced their aggressiveness and were not selective in their attacks. The aggression by LMG fish was more evenly distributed between modal groups (44-74% of attacks were against UMG) regardless of light levels.
   5. Recent growth history had no consistent effect on aggression rates, although under overcast night conditions the rate of attacks received by non-manipulated UMG fish was twice as high as that for fish undergoing compensatory growth.
   6. These results demonstrate a link between developmental pathways and aggression patterns. They also show that individuals maintaining a fast growth strategy over the winter experience a more aggressive social environment than individuals adjusting feeding rates to ensure safe maintenance levels. The reduced involvement of LMG fish in agonistic encounters conforms to a strategy of avoidance of those energetic and physiological costs that ultimately could compromise overwintering survival.

AB Dendrochronological data and microscopic charcoal particle series from annually laminated lake sediment covering the past 520 years were compared. Slash-and-burn cultivation had been practised in the area (63 degrees 10'N, 30 degrees 58'E) for about 300 years during this period, causing a considerable increase in the number of forest fires. The fire years based on fire-scar data coincided with peaks in the microscopic charcoal series, suggesting that a significant proportion of charcoal particles usually counted on pollen slides can originate from local fires or fires within a few kilometres of the sampling point. Thus, contrary to the theories of charcoal particle transport, the abundance of microscopic charcoal may indicate, in some cases, fires at close quarters better than at a regional or broader spatial scale. Regional sources contribute to the microscopic charcoal records, but an increase in the proportion of largest particles and a decrease in particle size c. < 10 mu m in diameter suggest local burning. The result may be due to fires of a low-intensity in the area. The particles collected during an experimental low-intensity burn supported the results obtained from the sediment samples. The majority of the particles collected were of the same sizes that are most abundant on pollen slides.

AB We analyse the population dynamic effects of sex ratio distortion by vertically transmitted, feminizing parasites, We show that, for diploid hosts, sex ratio distortion may lead to extinction as males become too rare to maintain the host population through reproduction. Feminizers can magnify Allee effects, broadening the range of conditions leading to extinction of small populations, Depending on male mating constraints and strength of density dependence, feminizers may either increase or decrease the equilibrium host density. Under conditions leading to deterministic host extinction, stochastic elimination of the parasite may allow the host population to recover. Hence, infection by parasitic sex ratio distorters may be transient in finite populations. We consider the implications of this process for parasite prevalence, host population regulation, and sex ratio evolution. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB Aim The New Zealand terrestrial mollusc fauna is among the most speciose in the world, with often remarkably high richness at lowland forest sites. We sought to elucidate general explanations for patterns of richness in terrestrial mollusc communities by analysis of species coexistence and habitat relationships within a New Zealand district fauna.
   Location Pukeamaru Ecological District, eastern North Island, New Zealand.
   Methods We sampled molluscs using qualitative methods at twenty-three sites and quantitatively by frame sampling of scrubland-forest floor litter at six-teen of these sites and analysed patterns of species richness and turnover in relation to regional species pools and local habitat attributes. We then tested for nonrandom assemblage of taxa along diversity and habitat gradients.
   Results Ninety-four indigenous mollusc species were recorded from a district fauna estimated at 102 indigenous species: only two species were endemic. From the presumptive geological history of the district, the low endemism, and Brooks parsimony and indicator species analyses of faunal relationships, the communities were indicated to have resulted by accumulation of colonists from other New Zealand districts since the Miocene. Richness ranged from two or three indigenous species in dune habitats to fifty-nine species in a floristically rich forest. Beta diversity was high and site occupancy per species was low, indicating communities structured by successive replacement of ecological equivalents. Sites differing in vegetation had characteristic species assemblages, indicating a degree of habitat specialization. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that canopy tree species, canopy height, floristic diversity, altitude, litter mass, and litter pH were important determinants of species assemblage in scrubland and forest. Richness was strongly associated with site floristic diversity and, for litter-dwelling species, the pH of litter substrate. High richness occurred at those sites supporting molluscs in high abundance. Shell-shape distributions were essentially Cainian unimodal, with communities dominated by snail species with subglobose to discoidal shells. Mean and variance of shell size increased with mollusc species richness and floristic diversity at sites, indicating dominance of communities by small-shelled species at early successional or floristically poor sites, and increased richness resulting from addition of larger snails into vacant niches. Shifts in shell form were associated with sympatry in several congeneric taxa.
   Main conclusions The underdispersion of shell shape, relative to faunas elsewhere in the world, indicates that community structure in New Zealand land snail faunas has been constrained by limited phylogenetic diversity and/or by convergence upon successful adaptations. The remarkably high richness that characterizes these communities indicates special conditions allow coexistence of numerous species. The relationship between floristic diversity at sites and the richness, diversity, and shell-size distributions of the molluscs suggests assemblages structured around niche partitioning among competing species. While there is an element of congruence between vegetation and mollusc pattern, this study indicates that assembly rules will be defined, and spatial pattern predicted, only through a better understanding of the linkage between regional species Fool, organism traits, environment, and local community assemblage.

AB The degree to which primary production, soil carbon, and trace gas fluxes in tropical forests of the Amazon are limited by moisture availability and other environmental factors was examined using an ecosystem modelling application for the country of Brazil. A regional geographical information system (GIS) serves as the data source of climate drivers, satellite images, land cover, and soil properties for input to the NASA Ames-CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach) model over a 8-km grid resolution. Simulation results lead us to hypothesize that net primary production (NPP) is limited by cloud interception of solar radiation over the humid north-western portion of the region. Peak annual rates for NPP of nearly 1.4 kg C m(-2) year(-1) are localized in the seasonally dry eastern Amazon in areas that we assume are primarily deep-rooted evergreen forest cover. Regional effects of forest conversion on NPP and soil carbon content are indicated in the model results, especially in seasonally dry areas. Comparison of model flux predictions along selected eco-climatic transects reveal moisture, soil, and land use controls on gradients of ecosystem production and soil trace gas emissions (CO2, N2O, and NO). These results are used to formulate a series of research hypotheses for testing in the next phase of regional modelling, which includes recalibration of the light-use efficiency term in NASA-CASA using field measurements of NPP, and refinements of vegetation index and soil property (texture and potential rooting depth) maps for the region.

AB Spatial patterns of 5 components of the macrobenthos (corals, macroalgae, mollusks, sponges, and echinoderms) at 42 stations on 4 reef types were compared in Moorea. Fifteen abiotic and biotic factors were measured and included in Canonical Correspondence Analyses. Macrobenthic communities were dominated by corals and macroalgae, Two major gradients (along the bays, and from the fringing reef to the outer reef slope) were found for corals, macroalgae, and echinoderms. The gradients were realized at a small spatial scale in Moorea (less than 2 km from the fringing reef to the outer reef slope at 35 m depth), while the same type of variation occurs at a large spatial scale (more than 100 km) on the Great Barrier Reef. Abiotic and biotic factors explained a large amount of the variance in sponge and coral communities, but less for mcllusks and markedly less for macroalgae and echinoderms. Some of the factors identified in this study, such as depth, sand coverage, and algal coverage, have been also reported as controlling factors in other coral reefs. In contrast, the high abundance of sea urchins and its impact seem to be characteristic of coral reefs around Moorea.

AB A survey of the patterns of lignicolous fungi to record occurrence of fruitbodies on fallen logs of Picea abies. has been performed. Ninetythree forest stands with different ages, ecology and histories of management in Sor-Trondelag County, Central Norway were investigated. In each stand an investigation plot of 40 m diameter was established, in which five logs were randomly selected. Environmental variables of the logs and plots and geographical positions of the plots were recorded. The numerical methods used include detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA).
   A total of 140 species of Aphyllophorales, Agaricales with eccentrically attached caps, heterobasiodomycetes, and prominent ascomycetes and deuteromycetes were registered. More than one third of the species were only found once. The main gradient in the data set was shown to be related to decay. The second gradient was related to size of the logs and some forest management variables (in addition to decay). Of the variation in composition of the species, 13.8 % can be ascribed to solely environmental variance, 6 % to solely spatial structure, and only 0.8 % to the combination of the environment and spatial component of variation. The results are discussed in the light of wood decay, forest management, and landscape fragmentation.

AB 1. The predictions of an empirical model were tested, based on a game theory approach that describes how a population of oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus, in which individual birds vary in their competitive ability and foraging efficiency, becomes distributed over its spatially variable mussel Mytilus edulis food supply. Model predictions on the distribution of the birds over the main mussel beds of the Exe estuary, on where particular cohorts of birds feed and on their intake rates and local dominance ranks were tested against already published data.
   2. The model predicted quite well the preference ranks of the 12 beds; the spreading out of birds over more mussel beds as oystercatcher numbers increased; the decrease in immature oystercatcher numbers on the most preferred beds as adult numbers increased; the higher proportion of immatures on the lower ranked beds; the high rate of movement between beds of birds with low dominance scores; and, on the most preferred beds, the higher intake rates of dominant individuals and the similarity between the intake rates of adults and immatures with the same dominance.
   3. Although, with a few exceptions, the qualitative trends were predicted correctly, their magnitudes were sometimes under-predicted, suggesting that some parameter values need to be refined. None the less, the model tests were considered encouraging. Future work should aim to incorporate into the model other aspects of the birds' behaviour, such as the effect on dominance of familiarity with a feeding area, and prey depletion.
   4. By assuming that birds require a certain minimum rate of food intake, either to remain on the estuary or to survive the winter, and by running simulations over a wide range of initial population sizes, it was demonstrated how such a model can be used to predict (i) the carrying capacity for oystercatchers of beds of different preference rank, and of all the mussel beds combined, and (ii) the parameter values of the overwinter density-dependent mortality function. These findings, in turn, can be used to predict the local and global population consequences of winter habitat loss.

AB 1. The paper by Hassell, Lawton & May (1976) on the characterization of natural population dynamics by fitting field and laboratory data to a discrete model is reviewed. In particular, we study the effects of spatial degrees of freedom on the qualitative behaviour of such single population maps.
   2. Using the spatially extended counterpart of these discrete systems by means of the Coupled Map Lattice formalism, we show that space is able to induce dynamical bifurcations.
   3. As the spatial domain is increased, the stability boundaries in the parameter space are modified, driving the population through different kinds of dynamics. The same result is reached by increasing the diffusion rate for a given lattice size.
   4. Our results suggest that the dynamical behaviour shown by a population depends not only on intrinsic factors, but also on external or environmental ones. Some evidence from field studies is also discussed.

AB Eight different methods for dating the fall of uprooted trees were used in a boreal spruce forest in northern Sweden:  (i) cross dating, (ii) growth release, (iii) initial growth, (iv) tree regeneration on the fallen log, (v) tree regeneration in the pit, (vi) fell scar, (vii) reaction wood, and (viii) stage of decay.  First, we calibrated the cross-dating method on tree falls of known age.  Then, to evaluate the limitations of the remaining methods, all methods were used on 23 tree falls of unknown age where the results of cross dating were known to be reliable.  Finally, 12 tree falls of unknown age, where cross dating was hard to conduct, were dated using all methods.  Most methods gave only the minimum possible age.  Cross dating and growth release were the only methods that gave exact-year results (i.e., the calendar year when the fall supposedly occurred).  All methods contributed to the dating in at least some cases.  Fewer methods gave valuable information in each old (> 50 years) uprooting than in each recent ( < 50 years) one.  For recent uprootings, cross dating always gave best obtainable results, but for older tree falls, no method was generally superior.  The simultaneous use of several methods is recommended, especially for older tree falls.

AB Closing the yield gap between actual and potential wheat yields in Australia is important to meet the growing global demand for food. The identification of hotspots of the yield gap, where the potential for improvement is the greatest, is a necessary step towards this goal. While crop growth models are well suited to quantify potential yields, they lack the ability to provide accurate large-scale estimates of actual yields, owing to the sheer quantity of data they require for parameterisation. In this context, we sought to provide accurate estimates of actual wheat yields across the Australian wheat belt based on machine-learning regression methods, climate records and satellite image time series. Out of nine base learners and two ensembles, support vector regression with radial basis function emerged as the single best learner (root mean square error of 0.55 t ha(-1) and R-2 of 0.77 at the pixel level). At national scale, this model explained 73% of the yield variability observed across statistical units. Benchmark approaches based on peak Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and on a harvest index were largely outperformed by the machine-learning regression models (R-2 < 0.46). Climate variables such as maximum temperatures and accumulated rainfall provided additional information to the 16-day NDVI time series as they significantly improved yield predictions. Variables observed up to and around the flowering period had a particularly high predictive power with additional information gained from data during grain filling. We further showed that, while all models were sensitive to a reduction of the training set size, a large majority had not reached saturation with a data set of 125 fields (2000 pixels). This indicates that additional training data are likely to further improve the skill of the models. We estimated that observations from 75 fields (1200 pixels) are required for the best single model to reach an R-2 of 0.7. We contend that machine-learning regression methods applied to climate and satellite image time series can achieve reliable crop yield monitoring across years at both the pixel and the country scale. The resulting yield estimates meet the accuracy requirements for mapping the yield gap and identifying yield gap hotspots which could be targeted for further work by agricultural researchers and advisers.

AB Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) techniques were originally developed in the mid-1980s. In this century they are gaining increasing attention in the literature and in practical use as a powerful tool to support forest management strategies especially under climate change. In this review paper we consider species occurrence datasets, climatic and soil predictor variables, modelling algorithms, evaluation methods and widely used software for SDM studies. We describe several important and freely available sources for species occurrence and interpolated climatic data. We outline the use of both presence-only and presence/absence modelling algorithms including distance-based algorithms, machine learning algorithms and regression-based models. We conclude that SDM techniques provide a valuable asset for forest managers. However, it is essential to consider uncertainties behind the use of future climate change scenarios.

AB In 2014-2016 the west coast of North America experienced a marine heatwave that was unprecedented in the historical record in terms of its duration and intensity. This event was expected to have a devastating impact on populations of giant kelp, an important coastal foundation species found in cool, nutrient rich waters. To evaluate this expectation, we used a time series of satellite imagery to examine giant kelp canopy biomass before, during, and after this heatwave across more than 7 degrees of latitude in southern and Baja California. We examined spatial patterns in resistance, i.e., the initial response of kelp, and resilience, i.e., the abundance of kelp 2 years after the heatwave ended. The heatwave had a large and immediate negative impact on giant kelp near its southern range limit in Baja. In contrast, the impacts of the heatwave were delayed throughout much of the central portion of our study area, while the northern portions of our study area exhibited high levels of resistance and resilience to the warming, despite large positive temperature anomalies. Giant kelp resistance throughout the entire region was most strongly correlated with the mean temperature of the warmest month of the heatwave, indicating that the loss of canopy was more sensitive to exceeding an absolute temperature threshold than to the magnitude of relative changes in temperature. Resilience was spatially variable and not significantly related to SST metrics or to resistance, indicating that local scale environmental and biotic processes played a larger role in determining the recovery of kelp from this extreme warming event. Our results highlight the resilient nature of giant kelp, but also point to absolute temperature thresholds that are associated with rapid loss of kelp forests.

AB A better understanding of regional differences in ecosystem health and its driving factors is conducive to ecosystern management and restoration. Although various studies on ecosystem health have been carried out in different regions, few studies have been devoted to the insightful exploration of the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem health and its driving forces at a national scale. In this study, we used an evaluation framework in terms of vigor, organization, resilience, and ecosystem service functions to assess the ecosystem health level in China from 2000 to 2015. Then, spatial agglomeration and regional differences in ecosystem health were examined using the spatial aulocorrelation method and K-means clustering analysis, and the factors driving the regional differences of ecosystem health were explored based on the geographical detector model Our results showed the following: (1) the ecosystem health level in China spatially increases from the northwest to the southeast, exhibiting significant global spatial autocorrelation and local spatial agglomeration; (2) eleven zones with three types were identified to indicate the regional differences of ecosystem health; (3) In terms of the driving factors, the moisture index and land use intensity contributed 24.5% and 20.7% to the variation in ecosystem health at the national scale. The ecosystem health changes were influenced by the interaction of meteorological and socio-economic factors in most regions with high ecosystem health types. Socio-economic factors act as a bridge that linked and reinforced the other factors in most regions with low and medium ecosystem health types. Ecologically protected factors were found to exert a remarkable impact in the southwestern region and the Loess Plateau region. Our findings can provide more effective and detailed decision-making support for ecosystem conservation and management in China. (C) 2019 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

AB Animals regularly return to locations such as foraging patches, nests, dens, watering holes, or movement corridors, and these revisited locations are often sites of ecological significance. Analyzing the temporal and spatial pattern of revisitation can lead to important insights into the life history and ecology of populations. We introduce the R package 'recurse' to calculate revisitations to locations in the movement trajectory or other locations for one or multiple individuals. The package also calculates metrics such as residence time and time between visits. It can be used to quantitatively identify frequently used sites (e.g. dens, nests, foraging locations), to examine patterns of revisitation and link them with covariates such as habitat features or climatic data, and to address conservation questions of interest about specific locations. We present an example application with movement trajectory data from a turkey vulture Cathartes aura during the breeding season and demonstrate analyzing recursions, specific locations, seasonal and daily temporal patterns, and visit timing. The 'recurse' package should be of interest both to ecologists looking to analyze their movement data and to conservationists needing site-specific information for management and conservation actions.

AB Suspension-feeding bivalve molluscs are foundation species in coastal intertidal systems. The selective feeding capabilities of these animals can have a large influence on phytoplankton communities and nutrient flow to the benthos. Particle selection, including the types of particles chosen for ingestion and the possible mechanisms mediating selection, has been studied extensively and reported in the literature. To date, however, the possible mechanisms mediating these selective processes have remained elusive. Generally, the focus on a few key commercial species, and their demonstrated range of selective capabilities, has made it difficult to design studies that elucidate the mechanisms behind particle selection. This review focuses on key research that has been carried out in the last 20 y toward better understanding the mechanism that underlays selective capture and ingestion of particles in this important group of animals. Recently, work has been completed which has advanced the field in pointing to a passive mechanism as a mediator of selection, with the interactions between the physicochemical properties of particles and the mucus covering the pallial organs most likely mediating food choice. Although no strong evidence for an immediate, active mechanism which underlies particle selection was found, avenues for future research are suggested in this review. The possible mechanisms that control capture, including qualitative precapture selection, are also summarized and discussed in depth. Methodological considerations for rigorous experiments to advance the field are also discussed, including suggestions of general guidelines for experimental designs, which will allow better comparison of findings across studies.

AB Predicting responses of tropical forests to climate change-type drought is challenging because of high species diversity. Detailed characterization of tropical tree hydraulic physiology is necessary to evaluate community drought vulnerability and improve model parameterization.
   Here, we measured xylem hydraulic conductivity (hydraulic efficiency), xylem vulnerability curves (hydraulic safety), sapwood pressure-volume curves (drought avoidance) and wood density on emergent branches of 14 common species of Eastern Amazonian canopy trees in Paracou, French Guiana across species with the densest and lightest wood in the plot. Our objectives were to evaluate relationships among hydraulic traits to identify strategies and test the ability of easy-to-measure traits as proxies for hard-to-measure hydraulic traits.
   Xylem efficiency was related to capacitance, sapwood water content and turgor loss point, and other drought avoidance traits, but not to xylem safety (P-50). Wood density was correlated (r = -0.57 to -0.97) with sapwood pressure-volume traits, forming an axis of hydraulic strategy variation.
   In contrast to drier sites where hydraulic safety plays a greater role, tropical trees in this humid tropical site varied along an axis with low wood density, high xylem efficiency and high capacitance at one end of the spectrum, and high wood density and low turgor loss point at the other.

AB Background: Epilithic sister genera Oresitrophe and Mukdenia (Saxifragaceae) have an epilithic habitat (rocky slopes) and a parapatric distribution in East Asia, which makes them an ideal model for a more comprehensive understanding of the demographic and divergence history and the influence of climate changes in East Asia. However, the genetic background and resources for these two genera are scarce.
   Results: The complete chloroplast (cp) genomes of two Oresitrophe rupifraga and one Mukdenia rossii individuals were reconstructed and comparative analyses were conducted to examine the evolutionary pattern of chloroplast genomes in Saxifragaceae. The cp genomes ranged from 156,738 bp to 156,960 bp in length and had a typical quadripartite structure with a conserved genome arrangement. Comparative analysis revealed the intron of rpl2 has been lost in Heuchera parviflora, Tiarella polyphylla, M. rossii and O. rupifraga but presents in the reference genome of Penthorum chinense. Seven cp hotspot regions (trnH-psbA, trnR-atpA, atpI-rps2, rps2-rpoC2, petN-psbM, rps4-trnT and rpl33-rps18) were identified between Oresitrophe and Mukdenia, while four hotspots (trnQ-psbK, trnR-atpA, trnS-psbZ and rpl33-rps18) were identified within Oresitrophe. In addition, 24 polymorphic cpSSR loci were found between Oresitrophe and Mukdenia. Most importantly, we successfully developed 126 intergeneric polymorphic gSSR markers between Oresitrophe and Mukdenia, as well as 452 intrageneric ones within Oresitrophe. Twelve randomly selected intergeneric gSSRs have shown that these two genera exhibit a significant genetic structure.
   Conclusions: In this study, we conducted genome skimming for Oresitrophe rupifraga and Mukdenia rossii. Using these data, we were able to not only assemble their complete chloroplast genomes, but also develop abundant genetic resources (cp hotspots, cpSSRs, polymorphic gSSRs). The genomic patterns and genetic resources presented here will contribute to further studies on population genetics, phylogeny and conservation biology in Saxifragaceae.

AB Climate change is driving global species redistribution with profound social and economic impacts. However, species movement is largely constrained by habitat availability and connectivity, of which the interaction effects with climate change remain largely unknown. Here we examine published data on 2798 elevational range shifts from 43 study sites to assess the confounding effect of land-use change on climate-driven species redistribution. We show that baseline forest cover and recent forest cover change are critical predictors in determining the magnitude of elevational range shifts. Forest loss positively interacts with baseline temperature conditions, such that forest loss in warmer regions tends to accelerate species' upslope movement. Consequently, not only climate but also habitat loss stressors and, importantly, their synergistic effects matter in forecasting species elevational redistribution, especially in the tropics where both stressors will increase the risk of net lowland biotic attrition.

AB In an era of global change, the process of biotic homogenisation by which regional biotas become more similar through time has attracted considerable attention from ecologists. Here, a retrospective look at the literature is taken and the question asked how comprehensive is the understanding of this global phenomenon? The goal is to identify potential areas for additional and future enquiries to advance this research frontier and best ensure the long-term preservation of biological diversity across the world. Six propositions are presented here to; (1) broaden our geographic and taxonomic understanding, (2) diversify the spatial and temporal scales of inquiry, (3) reconcile past and embrace new approaches to quantification, (4) improve our knowledge of the underlying drivers, (5) reveal the conservation implications and (6) forecast future homogenisation. It is argued that significant progress in the understanding of the causes, consequences and conservation implication of biotic homogenisation will come by integrating concepts and approaches from ecology, evolution and conservation across a hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales.

AB Functional traits and their variation mediate plant species coexistence and spatial distribution. Yet, how patterns of variation in belowground traits influence resource acquisition across species and plant communities remains obscure.
   To characterize diverse belowground strategies in relation to species coexistence and abundance, we assessed four key belowground traits - root diameter, root branching intensity, first-order root length and mycorrhizal colonization - in 27 coexisting species from three grassland communities along a precipitation gradient.
   Species with thinner roots had higher root branching intensity, but shorter first-order root length and consistently low mycorrhizal colonization, whereas species with thicker roots enhanced their capacity for resource acquisition by producing longer first-order roots and maintaining high mycorrhizal colonization. Plant species observed across multiple sites consistently decreased root branching and/or mycorrhizal colonization, but increased lateral root length with decreasing precipitation. Additionally, the degree of intraspecific trait variation was positively correlated with species abundance across the gradient, indicating that high intraspecific trait variation belowground may facilitate greater fitness and chances of survival across multiple habitats.
   These results suggest that a small set of critical belowground traits can effectively define diverse resource acquisition strategies in different environments and may forecast species survival and range shifts under climate change.

AB An emerging hypothesis of animal personality posits that animals choose the habitat that best fits their personality, and that the match between habitat and personality can facilitate population differentiation, and eventually speciation. However, behavioural plasticity and the adjustment of behaviours to new environments have been a classical explanation for such matching patterns. Using a population of dunnocks (Prunella modularis), we empirically tested whether personality or behavioural plasticity is responsible for the non-random distribution of shy and bold individuals in a heterogeneous environment. We found evidence for bold individuals settling in areas with high human disturbance, but also that birds became bolder with increasing age. Importantly, personality primarily determines the distribution of individuals, and behavioural adjustment over time contributes very little to the observed patterns. We cannot, however, exclude a possibility of very early behavioural plasticity (a type of developmental plasticity) shaping what we refer to as 'personality'. Nonetheless, our findings highlight the role personality plays in shaping population structure, lending support to the theory of personality-mediated speciation. Moreover, personality-matching habitat choice has important implications for population management and conservation.

AB Bumblebees are essential pollinators of crops and wild plants, but are in decline across the globe. Neonicotinoid pesticides have been implicated as a potential driver of these declines, but most of our evidence base comes from studies of a single species. There is an urgent need to understand whether such results can be generalized across a range of species. Here, we present results of a laboratory experiment testing the impacts of field relevant doses (1.87-5.32 ppb) of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on spring-caught wild queens of four bumblebee species: Bombus terrestris, B. lucorum, B. pratorum and B. pascuorum. Two weeks of exposure to the higher concentration of thiamethoxam caused a reduction in feeding in two out of four species, suggesting species-specific anti-feedant, repellency or toxicity effects. The higher level of thiamethoxam exposure resulted in a reduction in the average length of terminal oocytes in queens of all four species. In addition to providing the first evidence for general effects of neonicotinoids on ovary development in multiple species of wild bumblebee queens, the discovery of species-specific effects on feeding has significant implications for current practices and policy for pesticide risk assessment and use.

AB The composition of human microbiota is affected by a multitude of factors. Understanding the dynamics of our microbial communities is important for promoting human health because microbiota has a crucial role in the development of inflammatory diseases, such as allergies. We have studied the skin microbiota of both arms in 275 Finnish children of few months old to teenagers living in contrasting environments. We show that while age is a major factor affecting skin microbial composition, the living environment also discriminates the skin microbiota of rural and urban children. The effect of environment is age-specific; it is most prominent in toddlers but weaker for newborns and non-existent for teenagers. Within-individual variation is also related to age and environment. Surprisingly, variation between arms is smaller in rural subjects in all age groups, except in teenagers. We also collected serum samples from children for characterization of allergic sensitization and found a weak, but significant association between allergic sensitization and microbial composition. We suggest that physiological and behavioral changes, related to age and the amount of contact with environmental microbiota, jointly influence the dynamics of the skin microbiota, and explain why the association between the living environment skin microbiota is lost in teenager.

AB It is widely recognized that ecological dynamics influence evolutionary dynamics, and conversely that evolutionary changes alter ecological processes. Because fragmentation impacts all biological levels (from individuals to ecosystems) through isolation and reduced habitat size, it strongly affects the links among evolutionary and ecological processes such as population dynamics, local adaptation, dispersal and speciation. Here, we review our current knowledge of the eco-evolutionary dynamics in fragmented landscapes, focusing on both theory and experimental studies. We then suggest future experimental directions to study eco-evolutionary dynamics and/or feedbacks in fragmented landscapes, especially to bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental validations.

AB Continuous Integration (CI) has become a disruptive innovation in software development: with proper tool support and adoption, positive effects have been demonstrated for pull request throughput and scaling up of project sizes. As any other innovation, adopting CI implies adapting existing practices in order to take full advantage of its potential, and "best practices" to that end have been proposed. Here we study the adaptation and evolution of code writing and submission, issue and pull request closing, and testing practices as TRAVIS CI is adopted by hundreds of established projects on GITHUB. To help essentialize the quantitative results, we also survey a sample of GITHUB developers about their experiences with adopting TRAVIS CI. Our findings suggest a more nuanced picture of how GITHUB teams are adapting to, and benefiting from, continuous integration technology than suggested by prior work.

AB Wildfires can play an important role in the environmental distribution of major and trace elements, including through their mobilization by fire-induced runoff and associated transport of soil and ash particles. In particular, fire-induced inputs of these elements into the environment are relevant due to their toxicity and environmental persistence. This study aimed to evaluate the role of wildfire and time-since-fire on the redistribution of major and trace elements, which is a topic poorly documented. To this end, levels of V, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Cd and Pb were assessed in soil and ash samples collected immediately following awild fire in north-central Portugal as well as 4 (after the first post-fire rainfall events), 8 and 15 months later. The role of forest type was determined by sampling burnt eucalypt and pine plantations. The main findings of this study were the following: (1) levels of V, Mn, Ni, Cd and Pb were consistently higher in the burnt than unburnt soils, while levels of Co and Cu revealed no differences; (2) time-since-fire affected major and trace elements in three different ways: concentrations of Mn and Cd declined abruptly after the first rainfall events while levels of V, Co and Ni increased during the first 8 months and levels of Cu and Pb hardly changed during the study period; (3) all studied elements revealed peak concentrations in the ashes immediately after the fire, which then declined sharply four months later; (4) levels of Co and Ni soils and ashes were higher at the pine plantations than at the eucalypt plantations. This study highlighted the role of wildfire in enhancing levels of major and trace elements in ashes and topsoil of forest plantations and their mobilization within the first year after fire, pointing towards recently burnt forest areas as a potential source of environmental contamination.

TI Effectiveness of Contemporary Techniques for Reducing Livestock

AB Mitigation of large carnivore depredation is essential to increasing stakeholder support for human-carnivore coexistence. Lethal and non-lethal techniques are implemented by managers, livestock producers, and other stakeholders to reduce livestock depredations by large carnivores. However, information regarding the relative effectiveness of techniques commonly used to reduce livestock depredations is currently lacking. We evaluated 66 published, peer-reviewed research papers that quantitatively measured livestock depredation before and after employing 4 categories of lethal and non-lethal mitigation techniques (livestock husbandry, predator deterrents and removal, and indirect management of land or wild prey) to assess their relative effectiveness as livestock protection strategies. Effectiveness of each technique was measured as the reported percent change in livestock losses. Husbandry (42-100% effective) and deterrents (0-100% effective) demonstrated the greatest potential but also the widest variability in effectiveness in reducing livestock losses. Removal of large carnivores never achieved 100% effectiveness but exhibited the lowest variation (67-83%). Although explicit measures of effectiveness were not reported for indirect management, livestock depredations commonly decreased with sparser and greater distances from vegetation cover, at greater distances from protected areas, and in areas with greater wild prey abundance. Information on time duration of effects was available only for deterrents; a tradeoff existed between the effectiveness of tools and the length of time a tool remained effective. Our assessment revealed numerous sources of bias regarding the effectiveness of techniques as reported in the peer-reviewed literature, including a lack of replication across species and geographic regions, a focus on Canid carnivores in the United States, Europe, and Africa, and a publication bias toward studies reporting positive effects. Given these limitations, we encourage managers and conservationists to work with livestock producers to more consistently and quantitatively measure and report the impacts of mitigation techniques under a wider range of environmental, economic, and sociological conditions.

AB This paper examines the phenomena of online crowdsourcing from the perspectives of both volunteers and the campaign coordinator of Tomnod - an online mapping project that uses crowdsourcing to identify objects and places in satellite images. A mixed-methods approach was used to study the enablers and barriers to participation, taking into consideration the whole spectrum of volunteers. The results show broad diversity in online volunteers, both in their demographics and the factors affecting their voluntary participation. The majority are older than 50 years and many - particularly the most active volunteers - have disabilities or long term health problems. The personal circumstances of participants are highlighted as a major factor affecting involvement in campaigns. Like many other platforms, altruism is a key motivator, yet many participants are more interested in the quality of their data and the impact it has on the ground. For many participants of online crowdsourcing campaigns, their involvement is strongly linked to the level of contact they have with campaign coordinators, both in the design of the platform and in providing feedback on the impact of their contributions.

AB Aim In the alpine life zone, plant diversity is strongly determined by local topography and microclimate. We assessed the extent to which aspect and its relatedness to temperature affect plant species diversity, and the colonization and disappearance of species on alpine summits on a pan-European scale.
   Location Mountain summits in Europe's alpine life zone.
   Methods Vascular plant species and their percentage cover were recorded in permanent plots in each cardinal direction on 123 summits in 32 regions across Europe. For a subset from 17 regions, resurvey data and 6-year soil temperature series were available. Differences in temperature sum and Shannon index as well as species richness, colonization and disappearance of species among cardinal directions were analysed using linear mixed-effects and generalised mixed-effects models, respectively.
   Results Temperature sums were higher in east-and south-facing aspects than in the north-facing ones, while the west-facing ones were intermediate; differences were smallest in northern Europe. The patterns of temperature sums among aspects were consistent among years. In temperate regions, thermal differences were reflected by plant diversity, whereas this relationship was weaker or absent on Mediterranean and boreal mountains. Colonization of species was positively related to temperature on Mediterranean and temperate mountains, whereas disappearance of species was not related to temperature.
   Main conclusions Thermal differences caused by solar radiation determine plant species diversity on temperate mountains. Advantages for plants on eastern slopes may result from the combined effects of a longer diurnal period of radiation due to convection cloud effects in the afternoon and the sheltered position against the prevailing westerly winds. In northern Europe, long summer days and low sun angles can even out differences among aspects. On Mediterranean summits, summer drought may limit species numbers on the warmer slopes. Warmer aspects support a higher number of colonization events. Hence, aspect can be a principal determinant of the pace of climate-induced migration processes.

AB Understanding physiological acclimation of photosynthesis and respiration is important in elucidating the metabolic performance of trees in a changing climate. Does physiological acclimation to climate warming mirror acclimation to seasonal temperature changes? We grew Eucalyptus tereticornis trees in the field for 14months inside 9-m tall whole-tree chambers tracking ambient air temperature (T-air) or ambient T-air+3 degrees C (i.e. warmed'). We measured light- and CO2-saturated net photosynthesis (A(max)) and night-time dark respiration (R) each month at 25 degrees C to quantify acclimation. Tree growth was measured, and leaf nitrogen (N) and total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) concentrations were determined to investigate mechanisms of acclimation. Warming reduced A(max) and R measured at 25 degrees C compared to ambient-grown trees. Both traits also declined as mean daily T-air increased, and did so in a similar way across temperature treatments. A(max) and R (at 25 degrees C) both increased as TNC concentrations increased seasonally; these relationships appeared to arise from source-sink imbalances, suggesting potential substrate regulation of thermal acclimation. We found that photosynthesis and respiration each acclimated equivalently to experimental warming and seasonal temperature change of a similar magnitude, reflecting a common, nearly homeostatic constraint on leaf carbon exchange that will be important in governing tree responses to climate warming.

AB The sum of Akaike weights (SW) is often used to quantify relative variable importance (RVI) within the information-theoretic (IT) multimodel inference framework. A recent study (Galipaud etal. 2014, Methods in Ecology and Evolution 5: 983) questioned the validity of the SW approach. Regrettably, this study is flawed because SW was evaluated with an inappropriate benchmark. Irrespective of this study's methodological issues, RVI metrics based on the relative contribution of explanatory variables in explaining the variance in the response variable (partitioned R-2-based) are lacking in multimodel inference. We re-evaluated the validity of SW by repeating Galipaud etal.'s experiment but with an appropriate benchmark. When explanatory variables are uncorrelated, the quantity that SW estimates (i.e. the probability that a variable is included in the actual best IT model) is monotonically related to squared zero-order correlation coefficients (r(2)) between explanatory variables and the response variable. The degree of correspondence between SW and r(2)rankings (not values) of variables in data sets with uncorrelated explanatory variables was therefore used as a benchmark to evaluate the validity of SW as a RVI metric. To address the lack of partitioned R-2-based RVI metrics in multimodel inference, we proposed 2 metrics: (a) I-weighted, the average model probability-weighted partitioned R-2; and (b) I-best, the partitioned R-2 derived from the best IT model. We performed Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the utility of I-weighted and I-best versus partitioned R-2 derived from the global model (I-global). SW rankings matched r(2) rankings of variables; therefore, SW is a valid measure of RVI. Among partitioned R-2-based metrics, I-weighted and I-global were generally more accurate in estimating the population partitioned R-2. I-weighted performed better when explanatory variables were uncorrelated, whereas I-global was better in smaller data sets with correlated explanatory variables. To improve the utility of I-weighted in such data sets, we proposed approaches to eliminate or reduce the influence of correlated variables. Despite recent criticisms, our results show that SW is a valid RVI metric. To quantify RVI in terms of the R-2 explained by each variable, I-weighted and I-global are the preferred RVI metrics.

AB The present study was developed in four sub-basins of rivers Cavado and Douro, located in the North of mainland Portugal. The goal was to identify main stressors as well as driving and attenuating processes responsible for the presence of phosphorus in masses of surface water in those catchments. To accomplish the goal, the basins were selected where a quality station was present at the outlet, the forest occupation was greater than 75% and the phosphorus concentrations have repeatedly exceeded the threshold for the good ecological status in the period 2000-2006. Further, in two basins the quality station was installed in a lotic (free-flow water) environment whereas in the other two was placed in a lentic (dammed water) environment. The ArcMap GIS-based software package was used for the spatial analysis of stressors and processes. The yields of phosphorus vary widely across the studied basins, from 0.2-30 kg.ha(-1).yr(-1). The results point to post-fire soil erosion and hardwood clear cuttings as leading factors of phosphorus exports across the watersheds, with precipitation intensity being the key variable of erosion. However, yields can be attenuated by sediment deposition along the pathway from burned or managed areas to water masses. The observed high yields and concentrations of phosphorus in surface water encompass serious implications for water resources management in the basins, amplified in the lentic cases by potential release of phosphorus from lake sediments especially during the summer season. Therefore, a number of measures were proposed as regards wildfire combat, reduction of phosphorus exports after tree cuts, attenuation of soil erosion and improvement of riparian buffers, all with the purpose of preventing phosphorus concentrations to go beyond the regulatory good ecological status.

AB Although specific leaf area (SLA) has been proposed to reflect plant responses to climatic changes, the link between SLA and temperature has never been systematically evaluated. Using in situ measured SLA values for 223 species occurring in 29 calcareous grasslands along a temperature gradient in the Bavarian Alps, we explored the SLA-temperature relationship at population (intraspecific), species (interspecific) and community level and investigated the relative impact of other environmental factors on SLA variation along the temperature gradient at the community level. Only 14 % of the studied species showed significant changes in their SLA values along the temperature gradient, despite high intraspecific variability of the SLA values. At the species level, we revealed a very weak positive SLA-temperature relationship (r (2) = 0.04, p < 0.001). A very strong positive correlation between SLA and temperature was detected at the community level (r (2) = 0.70, p < 0.001). In addition to temperature, disturbance also had a significant influence on trait variation at the community level. We conclude that the variation in SLA along the temperature gradient comes primarily from changes in the relative abundances of species, whereas the trait variation at the population and the species levels was affected by other environmental factors. We therefore recommend the use of community-weighted mean values in studies employing SLA-temperature relationships because they reveal more regular patterns than the underlying distribution of within- and among-site SLA values.

AB 1. The biodiversity of mixed-species samples of arthropods can be characterized by shotgun sequencing of bulk genomic DNA and subsequent bioinformatics assembly of mitochondrial genomes. Here, we tested the power of mitochondrial metagenomics by conducting Illumina sequencing on mixtures of >2600 individuals of leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) from 10 communities.
   2. Patterns of species richness, community dissimilarity and biomass were assessed from matches of reads against three reference databases, including (i) a custom set of mitogenomes generated for 156 species (89% of species in the study); (ii) mitogenomes obtained by the de novo assembly of sequence reads from the real-world communities; and (iii) a custom set of DNA barcode (cox1-5) sequences.
   3. Species detection against the custom-built reference genomes was very high (>90%). False presences were rare against mitogenomes but slightly higher against the barcode references. False absences were mainly due to the incompleteness of the reference databases and, thus, more prevalent in the de novo data set. Biomass (abundancexbody length) and read numbers were strongly correlated, demonstrating the potential of mitochondrial metagenomics for studies of species abundance.
   4. A phylogenetic tree from the mitogenomes showed high congruence with known relationships in Chrysomelidae. Patterns of taxonomic and phylogenetic dissimilarity between sites were highly consistent with data from morphological identifications.
   5. The power of mitochondrial metagenomics results from the possibility of rapid assembly of mitogenomes from mixtures of specimens and the use of read counts for accurate estimates of key parameters of biodiversity directly from community samples.

AB The quantification, mapping and monitoring of biomass are now central issues due to the importance of biomass as a renewable energy source in many countries of the world. The estimation of biomass is a challenging task, especially in areas with complex stands and varying environmental conditions, and requires accurate and consistent measurement methods. To efficiently and effectively use biomass as a renewable energy source, it is important to have detailed knowledge of its distribution, abundance, and quality. Remote sensing offers the technology to enable rapid assessment of biomass over large areas relatively quickly and at a low cost. This paper provides a comprehensive review of biomass assessment techniques using remote sensing in different environments and using different sensing techniques. It covers forests, savannah, and grasslands/rangelands, and for each of these environments, reviews key work that has been undertaken and compares the techniques that have been the most successful.

AB Currently, the most important guideline for the application of the moss technique to monitor the atmospheric deposition of heavy metals is the "Heavy metals, nitrogen and POPs in European mosses: 2015 survey" published by the UNECE ICP Vegetation. Two main problems have been identified with this guideline: i) some of the recommendations regarding the methodological aspects involved in the application of the moss technique are not based on scientific criteria; and, ii) some recommendations in the manual are very vague and some aspects are even left out (e.g., elevation, distance to the coast). As a result there exists a high variability in the application of the protocol and many scientists adapt it to the specific conditions in the studied areas without evaluating how changes affect the results obtained. Therefore, in this article a total of 369 studies were reviewed including both methodological and application studies of the passive biomonitoring of the atmospheric deposition of heavy metals with terrestrial mosses. The results of this review have shown on the one hand, that none of the articles completely accomplished the ICP-Vegetation protocol suggestions, either because the information regarding some aspects was lacking or simply because the authors did not follow the manual suggestions. On the other hand, it was found that the results of methodological studies sometimes contradicted the ICP Vegetation manual recommendations. Thus, a new protocol in which each suggestion has been carefully and rigorously contrasted with the available literature has been proposed in this paper. In addition, practical and economic issues have also been considered and much more concise suggestions have been proposed which would facilitate its fulfilment in a more objective way.

AB Hydrology is a fundamental factor influencing ecosystem dynamics, life-history strategies, and diversity patterns in running-water habitats. However, it remains unclear how hydrology may structure the taxonomic and functional composition of communities, especially in systems with high spatiotemporal variability in flow. We examined invertebrate diversity from 7 desert streams in the Huachuca Mountains of southeastern Arizona, USA, that span a flow permanence continuum from highly intermittent to perennial. We examined the relative roles of flow permanence, habitat size, season, and microhabitat in determining taxonomic and functional structure (according to 7 species traits compiled for 234 taxa) of these communities. We predicted that both functional and taxonomic diversity would be positively related to flow permanence and negatively related to the duration and number of stream drying events. As predicted, increased flow permanence was associated with increased functional richness, functional evenness, and taxonomic richness. Conversely, drying events reduced functional diversity across all measured indices. We found a saturating relationship between functional richness and taxonomic richness, indicating functional redundancy in species-rich communities, which may promote resilience of ecosystem function to environmental variation. Our study adds further evidence that hydrology is a key determinant of aquatic invertebrate diversity, and that stream hydroperiod strongly influences both functional and taxonomic diversity in arid-land streams.

AB Net primary production (NPP) is one of the important indexes of ecological change. In this study, the spatial distribution of NPP in Gansu province was simulated using an improved Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model, from 2000 to 2010, using MODIS-NDVI data at 250 x 250 m spatial resolution. We analyzed NPP responses in forest, grassland, agricultural and desert biomes to climate change, by combining the simulated data with meteorological data. The results indicated that: (i) The spatial distribution of the annual NPP from 2000 to 2010 varied significantly over the region, with NPP high in the southeast, but low in the northwest, of Gansu. The mean annual NPP values for forest, grassland, agricultural and desert biomes were 580.12 gC m(-2) yr(-1), 380.12 gC m(-2) y(-1), 280.71 gC m(-2) yr(-1) and 83.27 gC m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. (ii) The annual NPP values with extremely significant increase (ESI, theta(slope) > 0 and p < 0.01) and significant increase (SI, theta(slope) > 0 and 0.01 p <= 0.05) from 2000 to 2010 accounted for 6.00% and 17.49% of the total area, respectively. The annual NPP values with extremely significant decrease (ESD, theta(slope) < 0 and p < 0.01) and significant decrease (SD, theta(slope) < 0 and 0.01 <= p < 0.05) from 2000 to 2010 accounted for 12.31% and 27.07% of the total area, respectively. Overall, the NPP values displayed a decreasing trend. (iii) The forest and grassland biomes were influenced mainly by temperature, while precipitation was the main controlling factor in the desert and agricultural biomes, at the annual scale. (iv) Compared with the forest and desert biomes, the grassland and agricultural biomes showed time-lag and cumulative correlations with precipitation and temperature, respectively.

AB This study investigated the possible effects of tree species diversity and identity on the soil microbial community in a species-rich temperate broad-leaved forest. For the first time, we separated the effects of tree identity and tree species diversity on the link between above and belowground communities in a near-natural forest. We established 100 tree clusters consisting of each three tree individuals represented by beech (Fagus sylvatica L), ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L), maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), or lime (Tilia spec.) at two different sites in the Hainich National Park (Thuringia, Germany). The tree clusters included one, two or three species forming a diversity gradient. We investigated the microbial community structure, using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles, in mineral soil samples (0-10 cm) collected in the centre of each cluster.
   The lowest total PLFA amounts were found in the pure beech clusters (79.0 +/- 23.5 nmol g(-1) soil dw), the highest PLFA amounts existed in the pure ash clusters (287.3 +/- 211.3 nmol g(-1) soil dw). Using principle components analyses (PCA) and redundancy analyses (RDA), we found only for the variables 'relative proportion of beech trees' and 'living lime fine root tips associated with ectomycorrhiza' a significant effect on the PLFA composition. The microbial community structure was mainly determined by abiotic environmental parameters such as soil pH or clay content. The different species richness levels in the clusters did not significantly differ in their total PLFA amounts and their PLFA composition. We observed a tendency that the PLFA profiles of the microbial communities in more tree species-rich clusters were less influenced by individual PLFAs (more homogenous) than those from species-poor clusters.
   We concluded that tree species identity and site conditions were more important factors determining the soil microbial community structure than tree species diversity per se. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The universal temperature dependence of metabolic rates has been used to predict how ocean biology will respond to ocean warming. Determining the temperature sensitivity of phytoplankton metabolism and growth is of special importance because this group of organisms is responsible for nearly half of global primary production, sustains most marine food webs, and contributes to regulate the exchange of CO2 between the ocean and the atmosphere. Phytoplankton growth rates increase with temperature under optimal growth conditions in the laboratory, but it is unclear whether the same degree of temperature dependence exists in nature, where resources are often limiting. Here we use concurrent measurements of phytoplankton biomass and carbon fixation rates in polar, temperate and tropical regions to determine the role of temperature and resource supply in controlling the large-scale variability of in situ metabolic rates. We identify a biogeographic pattern in phytoplankton metabolic rates, which increase from the oligotrophic subtropical gyres to temperate regions and then coastal waters. Variability in phytoplankton growth is driven by changes in resource supply and appears to be independent of seawater temperature. The lack of temperature sensitivity of realized phytoplankton growth is consistent with the limited applicability of Arrhenius enzymatic kinetics when substrate concentrations are low. Our results suggest that, due to widespread resource limitation in the ocean, the direct effect of sea surface warming upon phytoplankton growth and productivity may be smaller than anticipated.

AB Hybridization is increasingly being recognized as a common process in both animal and plant species. Negative epistatic interactions between genes from different parental genomes decrease the fitness of hybrids and can limit gene flow between species. However, little is known about the number and genome-wide distribution of genetic incompatibilities separating species. To detect interacting genes, we perform a high-resolution genome scan for linkage disequilibrium between unlinked genomic regions in naturally occurring hybrid populations of swordtail fish. We estimate that hundreds of pairs of genomic regions contribute to reproductive isolation between these species, despite them being recently diverged. Many of these incompatibilities are likely the result of natural or sexual selection on hybrids, since intrinsic isolation is known to be weak. Patterns of genomic divergence at these regions imply that genetic incompatibilities play a significant role in limiting gene flow even in young species.

AB During the past century, the biomass of woody species has increased in many grassland and savanna ecosystems. As many of these species fix nitrogen symbiotically, they may alter not only soil nitrogen (N) conditions but also those of phosphorus (P). We studied the N-fixing shrub Dichrostachys cinerea in a mesic savanna in Zambia, quantifying its effects upon pools of soil N, P, and carbon (C), and availabilities of N and P. We also evaluated whether these effects induced feedbacks upon the growth of understory vegetation and encroaching shrubs. Dichrostachys cinerea shrubs increased total N and P pools, as well as resin-adsorbed N and soil extractable P in the top 10-cm soil. Shrubs and understory grasses differed in their foliar N and P concentrations along gradients of increasing encroachment, suggesting that they obtained these nutrients in different ways. Thus, grasses probably obtained them mainly from the surface upper soil layers, whereas the shrubs may acquire N through symbiotic fixation and probably obtain some of their P from deeper soil layers. The storage of soil C increased significantly under D. cinerea and was apparently not limited by shortages of either N or P. We conclude that the shrub D. cinerea does not create a negative feedback loop by inducing P-limiting conditions, probably because it can obtain P from deeper soil layers. Furthermore, C sequestration is not limited by a shortage of N, so that mesic savanna encroached by this species could represent a C sink for several decades.

AB Spatial variation in predation risk generates a 'landscape of fear', with prey animals modifying their distribution and behaviour in response to this variable predation risk. In systems comprising multiple predators and prey species, a key challenge is distinguishing the independent effects of different predator guilds on prey responses. We exploited the acoustically distinct alarm calls of samango monkeys, Cercopithecus mitis erythrarchus, to create a predator-specific landscape of fear from eagles to assess its impact on space use within mixed regressive-spatial regressive models incorporating data on resource distribution and structural characteristics of the environment. The landscape of fear from eagles was the most significant determinant of samango range use, with no effect of resource availability. The monkeys also selected areas of their range with higher canopies and higher understory visibility, behaviour consistent with further minimizing risk of predation. These results contrast with those of vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus aethiops pygerythrus, at the same site for which the landscapes of fear from leopards and baboons were the most significant determinants of space use. While highlighting that predation risk is a key driver of primate behaviour in this population, the landscapes of fear experienced by samango monkeys and vervet monkeys appear to differ despite exposure to identical predator guilds. This emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between the risk effects of different predators in understanding prey ecology, but also that closely related prey species may respond to these predator-specific risks in different ways.

AB Genetic variation is usually estimated empirically from statistics based on population gene frequencies, but alternative statistics based on allelic diversity (number of allelic types) can provide complementary information. There is a lack of knowledge, however, on the evolutionary implications attached to allelic-diversity measures, particularly in structured populations. In this article we simulated multiple scenarios of single and structured populations in which a quantitative trait subject to stabilizing selection is adapted to different fitness optima. By forcing a global change in the optima we evaluated which diversity variables are more strongly correlated with both short- and long-term adaptation to the new optima. We found that quantitative genetic variance components for the trait and gene-frequency-diversity measures are generally more strongly correlated with short-term response to selection, whereas allelic-diversity measures are more correlated with long-term and total response to selection. Thus, allelic-diversity variables are better predictors of long-term adaptation than gene-frequency variables. This observation is also extended to unlinked neutral markers as a result of the information they convey on the demographic population history. Diffusion approximations for the allelic-diversity measures in a finite island model under the infinite-allele neutral mutation model are also provided.

AB The Tonle Sap is the largest wetland in Southeast Asia and one of the world's most productive inland fisheries. The Mekong River inundates the Tonle Sap every year, shaping a mosaic of natural and agricultural habitats. Ongoing hydropower development, however, will dampen the flood pulse that maintains the Tonle Sap. This study established the current underlying relationship among hydrology, vegetation, and human use. We found that vegetation is strongly influenced by flood duration; however, this relationship was heavily distorted by fire, grazing, and rice cultivation. The expected flood pulse alteration will result in higher water levels during the dry season, permanently inundating existing forests. The reduction of the maximum flood extent will facilitate agricultural expansion into natural habitats. This study is the most comprehensive field survey of the Tonle Sap to date, and it provides fundamental knowledge needed to understand the underlying processes that maintain this important wetland.

AB Community-level patterns of functional traits relate to community assembly and ecosystem functioning. By modelling the changes of different indices describing such patterns - trait means, extremes and diversity in communities - as a function of abiotic gradients, we could understand their drivers and build projections of the impact of global change on the functional components of biodiversity. We used five plant functional traits (vegetative height, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen content and seed mass) and non-woody vegetation plots to model several indices depicting community-level patterns of functional traits from a set of abiotic environmental variables (topographic, climatic and edaphic) over contrasting environmental conditions in a mountainous landscape. We performed a variation partitioning analysis to assess the relative importance of these variables for predicting patterns of functional traits in communities, and projected the best models under several climate change scenarios to examine future potential changes in vegetation functional properties. Not all indices of trait patterns within communities could be modelled with the same level of accuracy: the models for mean and extreme values of functional traits provided substantially better predictive accuracy than the models calibrated for diversity indices. Topographic and climatic factors were more important predictors of functional trait patterns within communities than edaphic predictors. Overall, model projections forecast an increase in mean vegetation height and in mean specific leaf area following climate warming. This trend was important at mid elevation particularly between 1000 and 2000 m a.s.l. With this study we showed that topographic, climatic and edaphic variables can successfully model descriptors of community-level patterns of plant functional traits such as mean and extreme trait values. However, which factors determine the diversity of functional traits in plant communities remains unclear and requires more investigations.

AB Conflicts between humans and snow leopards are documented across much of their overlapping distribution in Central Asia. These conflicts manifest themselves primarily in the form of livestock depredation and the killing of snow leopards by local herders. This source of mortality to snow leopards is a key conservation concern. To investigate human-snow leopard conflicts in the Sanjiangyuan Region of the Tibetan Plateau, we conducted household interviews about local herders' traditional use of snow leopard parts, livestock depredation, and overall attitudes towards snow leopards. We found most respondents (58%) knew that snow leopard parts had been used for traditional customs in the past, but they claimed not in the past two or three decades. It may be partly due to the issuing of the Protection of Wildlife Law in 1998 by the People's Republic of China. Total livestock losses were damaging (US$ 6193 per household in the past 1 year), however snow leopards were blamed by herders for only a small proportion of those losses (10%), as compared to wolves (45%) and disease (42%). Correspondingly, the cultural images of snow leopards were neutral (78%) and positive (9%) on the whole. It seems that human-snow leopard conflict is not intense in this area. However, snow leopards could be implicated by the retaliatory killing of wolves. We recommend a multi-pronged conservation program that includes compensation, insurance programs, and training local veterinarians to reduce livestock losses. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB When looking at social conflicts around forests, both foresters and researchers tend to frame conflicts as rational differences related to diverging knowledge, values, and interests. In past centuries, and in areas where the forests are of immediate livelihood importance, this has been a powerful approach to explaining disputes. However for many stakeholders, including local communities, environmental campaigners and foresters themselves, feelings and emotions are also relevant components of a conflict. In this paper we argue that an overall tendency to 'rationalise' nature and forests has pushed emotion out of sight, and delegitimised it. Using examples from our own research in-The Netherlands and the UK, we argue that feelings need to be visible and legitimate, in order to address the underlying causes of conflict. We begin the paper by examining how conflicts have been framed as rational, by researchers, managers and politicians. We seek explanations for both the 'hidden' nature of emotions and their labelling as 'irrational' in the rationalisation of forest science and management as a result of wider modernisation processes. We propose bringing emotions back in, to show how conflict is not merely based in diverging views, but is in fact a dimension of engagement. We suggest four aspects of forest conflicts in which emotions should be incorporated in research, all connected to literature from outside forestry: emotional sources of diverging views on forest management, emotional influences on the processing of information, the motivating power of emotions for social movements and the role of emotions in the escalation of protests.

AB Phenotypic plasticity can be adaptive when phenotypes are closely matched to changes in the environment. In crickets, rhythmic fluctuations in the biotic and abiotic environment regularly result in diel rhythms in density of sexually active individuals. Given that density strongly influences the intensity of sexual selection, we asked whether crickets exhibit plasticity in signaling behavior that aligns with these rhythmic fluctuations in the socio-sexual environment. We quantified the acoustic mate signaling behavior of wild-caught males of two cricket species, Gryllus veletis and G. pennsylvanicus. Crickets exhibited phenotypically plastic mate signaling behavior, with most males signaling more often and more attractively during the times of day when mating activity is highest in the wild. Most male G. pennsylvanicus chirped more often and louder, with shorter interpulse durations, pulse periods, chirp durations, and interchirp durations, and at slightly higher carrier frequencies during the time of the day that mating activity is highest in the wild. Similarly, most male G. veletis chirped more often, with more pulses per chirp, longer interpulse durations, pulse periods, and chirp durations, shorter interchirp durations, and at lower carrier frequencies during the time of peak mating activity in the wild. Among-male variation in signaling plasticity was high, with some males signaling in an apparently maladaptive manner. Body size explained some of the among-male variation in G. pennsylvanicus plasticity but not G. veletis plasticity. Overall, our findings suggest that crickets exhibit phenotypically plastic mate attraction signals that closely match the fluctuating socio-sexual context they experience.

AB We studied benthic macroinvertebrate communities upstream and downstream of five small reservoirs (surface release in autumn-winters) (north Spain) to assess the effect of flow regulation on structural and functional characteristics of stream ecosystems. We based our approach on the use of structural metrics (density, biomass, richness and diversity) in combination with two functional diversity indices based on biological and ecological traits: FDPG index, related to species richness, and FDQ, which incorporates evenness across taxa. Although water physicochemical parameters were unaffected by the reservoirs during the study period (autumn-winter), macroinvertebrate metrics were lower below the dams, with detritivores (shredders and collector-gatherers) being the most affected. The alder leaf breakdown rate estimated by the litter-bag technique was related to the density, biomass, richness, diversity and FDPG index of shredders, compromising the ecosystem functioning. The most plausible origin for the observed differences in macroinvertebrate metrics between upstream and downstream reaches was the change of the flow regime caused by the impoundments at downstream sites, leading to droughts in summer in those naturally permanently flowing streams. The observed functional diversity loss might reduce the chances of the community to override natural or man-induced fluctuations in their environment with possible repercussions on important ecosystem functions and services.

AB Sonic thermometry and anemometry are fundamental to all eddy-covariance studies of surface energy balance. Recent studies have suggested that sonic anemometers with non-orthogonal transducers can underestimate vertical wind velocity (w) and sensible heat flux (H) when compared to orthogonal designs. In this study we tested whether a non-orthogonal sonic anemometer (CSAT3, Campbell Scientific, Inc.) measures lower w and H than an orthogonal sonic anemometer (SATI/3Vx, Applied Technologies, Inc.) and through experimental manipulation we tested if this difference can be attributed to errors in the CSAT3. Four CSAT3s and one SATI/3Vx were mounted symmetrically in a horizontal array on top of the Glacier Lakes Ecosystem Experiments Site (GLEES) AmeriFlux scaffold (southeastern Wyoming, USA) and in close enough proximity to allow covariance measurements between neighboring sonic anemometers. The CSAT3s were paired and measurements of the three orthogonal wind velocities (u, v, and w) were tested by alternatively rotating each sonic anemometer 90 degrees around its u-axis, essentially forcing the sonic v-axis transducer system to measure w. Analysis was performed on data corresponding to gusts of wind located within the 15 degrees cone defined around the u-axis to ensure operation within manufacturer specifications. We found that the CSAT3 measured 8% lower H than the SATI/3Vx and that was associated with a 6-42% lower measurement of w. From the CSAT3 manipulations we found w was underestimated by 6-10% which led directly to an 8-12% underestimate of the kinematic heat flux, the fundamental covariance of H. These results have implications for ecosystem flux research and the energy imbalance problem considering the prevalence of the CSAT3 and the non-orthogonal sonic anemometer design.

AB The fixed and plastic traits possessed by a plant, which may be collectively thought of as its strategy, are commonly modelled as density-independent adaptations to its environment. However, plant strategies may also represent density- or frequency-dependent adaptations to the strategies used by neighbours. Game theory provides the tools to characterise such density- and frequency-dependent interactions. Here, we review the contributions of game theory to plant ecology. After briefly reviewing game theory from the perspective of plant ecology, we divide our review into three sections. First, game theoretical models of allocation to shoots and roots often predict investment in those organs beyond what would be optimal in the absence of competition. Second, game theoretical models of enemy defence suggest that an individual's investment in defence is not only a means of reducing its own tissue damage but also a means of deflecting enemies onto competitors. Finally, game theoretical models of trade with mutualistic partners suggest that the optimal trade may reflect competition for access to mutualistic partners among plants. In short, our review provides an accessible entrance to game theory that will help plant ecologists enrich their research with its worldview and existing predictions.

AB We examine the potential of trait-based parameters of taxa for linking above- and below-ground ecological networks (hereafter 'green' and 'brown' worlds) to understand and predict community dynamics. This synthesis considers carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus-related traits, the abundance of component species and their size distribution across trophic levels under different forms of management. We have analysed existing and novel databases on plants, microbes and invertebrates that combine physico-chemical and biological information from (agro)ecosystems spanning the globe. We found (1) evidence that traits from above- and below-ground systems may be integrated in the same model and (2) a much greater than expected stoichiometric plasticity of plants and microbes which has implications for the entire food-web mass abundance scaling. Nitrogen and phosphorus are primary basal resources (hence, drivers) and more retranslocation of P than of N from leaves will lead to higher N:P in the litter and soil organic matter. Thus, under nutrient-rich conditions, higher foliar concentrations of N and P are reflected by lower N:P in the brown litter, suggesting less P retranslocated than N. This apparent stoichiometric dichotomy between green and brown could result in shifts in threshold elemental ratios critical for ecosystem functioning. It has important implications for a general food-web model, given that resource C:N:P ratios are generally assumed to reflect environmental C:N:P ratios. We also provide the first evidence for large-scale allometric changes according to the stoichiometry of agroecosystems. Finally, we discuss insights that can be gained from integrating carbon and nitrogen isotope data into trait-based approaches, and address the origin of changes in Delta C-13 and Delta N-15 fractionation values in relation to consumer-resource body-mass ratios.

AB Rapid changes in climate and land use and the resulting shifts in species distributions and ecosystem functions have motivated the development of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). Integrating across spatial scales from ground sampling to remote sensing, NEON will provide data for users to address ecological responses to changes in climate, land use, and species invasion across the United States for at least 30 years. Although NEON remote sensing and tower sensor elements are relatively well known, the biological measurements are not. This manuscript describes NEON terrestrial sampling, which targets organisms across a range of generation and turnover times, and a hierarchy of measurable biological states. Measurements encompass species diversity, abundance, phenology, demography, infectious disease, ecohydrology, and biogeochemistry. The continental-scale sampling requires collection of comparable and calibrated data using transparent methods. Data will be publicly available in a variety of formats and suitable for integration with other long-term efforts. NEON will provide users with the data necessary to address large-scale questions, challenge current ecological paradigms, and forecast ecological change.

AB Conservation projects spend billions of dollars clearing invasive alien plants, yet few studies have measured the cost-effectiveness of doing this, especially over larger spatial and temporal scales, relevant to operational contexts. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of South Africa's national invasive alien plant control programme, Working for Water, in reducing invasive alien plant cover in the Krom and Kouga river catchments over 7 years. We assessed change in invasive alien plant cover by comparing post-treatment cover with the first recorded pre-treatment cover across all 740 of the two project's treatment sites (ranging from 0.03 to 227.6 ha in size). We also used regression analysis to estimate the effect of predictor variables on the cost-effectiveness of invasive alien plant clearing. We found - by dividing the total costs by the change in invasive alien plant cover - that it cost 2.4 times more (1.5 times for the Krom, and 8.6 times for the Kouga project) to clear invaded land than the highest equivalent estimate made elsewhere. At current rates of clearing, it would take 54 and 695 years to clear the catchments, in the Krom and Kouga, respectively, assuming no further spread. If spread is considered, current control efforts are inadequate, and invasions are likely to continue to spread in the catchments. Pre-treatment invasive alien plant cover and treatment costs per hectare had the greatest positive and negative influence, respectively on cost-effectiveness. Our assessment suggests that invasive alien plant control projects urgently need to monitor their cost-effectiveness so that management practices can be adapted to use scarce conservation funds more effectively.

AB There is a divergence between models examining the evolution of group living in species in which groups are largely based on families and those based on fluid aggregations of nonrelatives. In the former, the onus has been on ecological and demographic factors that select for offspring philopatry; in the latter, the importance of factors such as foraging success and predation risk are more typically emphasized. We examined the association between predation risk and both group size and foraging behaviour in the chestnut-crowned babbler, Pomatostomus ruficeps, a family-living cooperatively breeding bird that does not appear to face classic ecological or demographic constraints on dispersal and breeding. Groups were more likely to encounter, and be attacked by, avian predators when dependent young were present. Large groups were also more likely to encounter a predator, but less likely to be attacked by it, consistent with a benefit of group living through early predator detection or confusion effects. In addition, the average risk of predation for a given individual was reduced in large groups compared to small ones, owing to the dilution effect. That predation might partly select for group living in this species is boosted by findings showing reductions in ground foraging and increases in sentinel behaviour when predation risk was higher. We conclude that predation might represent an important force selecting for sociality in chestnut-crowned babblers, and highlight the need for future studies to consider more explicitly inherent benefits to group living in the evolution of vertebrate cooperative breeding systems. 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Phylogenetic community ecology combines phylogenetic hypotheses with local species composition and functional-trait information to evaluate historical and contemporary mechanisms influencing local assemblage structure. Most studies assume that, if functional traits are conserved, then patterns of trait variation should match patterns of phylogenetic structure within local assemblages. Here we evaluated if we could predict trait structure by assuming that environmental filtering or biotic interactions work primarily on phylogenetically conserved functional traits. We investigated patterns of phylogenetic assemblage structure and functional-trait variation in bill length, wing length, and body mass in 236 hummingbird assemblages (126 species) across two major gradients in northern South America: elevation and precipitation. While mean trait values for assemblages vary predictably based on empirical knowledge of hummingbird biology, the distribution of trait values within assemblages do not correspond to those predicted based on phylogenetic signal and phylogenetic structure. Instead, we were able to identify instances where assemblages have high levels of morphological variation despite their close evolutionary relatedness and vice versa. Our results provide support for both filtering and biotic interactions across gradients, as has been documented in other studies.

AB Biogeomorphologists study the roles of biota in landscape formation and decay. Ecologists interested in ecosystem engineering study environmental change caused by biota and the consequences for the engineer, other organisms, and ecological processes. The interface is geomorphological change, an interface both are aware of but study somewhat independently and differently. Interaction and integration among the two fields is the goal of this special issue. Here I take an ecological perspective of geomorphological change caused by ecosystem engineers in patches within landscapes that I hope can help facilitate this goal. I ask the following general questions: When will an ecosystem engineering species create a geomorphological signature in a landscape? What, in qualitative terms, is such a signature? How can the signature be estimated and how long will it last? What engineer attributes and ecological factors will determine signature change? What creates complications? How do the answers inform whether or not life leaves a geomorphological signature? To attempt answers, I develop a provisional, general theory of ecosystem engineering signatures that draws on and integrates a geomorphological foundation of balance between formation and decay; landscape patch dynamics; a general framework for ecosystem engineering; and empirical studies. I treat a landscape engineering signature as the balance of rates of formation (F) and rates of decay (D) across patches whose ratio value (F/D) can be transformed (>1), intermediate (1) or untransformed (<1). I suggest amenable systems for study. I describe how the signature can be estimated and evaluated for potential persistence, and how to identify when decay or engineer density and per capita engineering activity control the signature. I examine the influences on shifts from transformed to untransformed signatures, and vice versa, at constant and changing rates of decay. I show how the likelihood of signature shifts depends on: 1. engineer density in the landscape and per patch; 2. per capita engineering activity as structure per patch and patches per engineer, or its contribution for engineers occurring in groups; 3. the degree of patch maintenance, abandonment, and re-engineering of abandoned patches; and in some situations, 4. the direction of the signature shift that is considered. I use this to illustrate how different ecological factors affecting engineer species (e.g., abiotic resources and conditions, natural enemies) and engineer feedbacks can drive signature transitions. I address complications and how they might be dealt with for situations where an engineer species causes formation and decay; when multiple engineering species co-occur; and when patches are materially interconnected. I end by considering whether life leaves a geomorphological signature, using this to contrast my approach with biogeomorphology, and asking what a hypothetical analysis of signature patterns across many engineer species/landscape combinations might imply for the interface of ecology and biogeomorphology.

AB Urban environments contain habitats for flowering plants and their pollinating animal species. It is, however, unclear how the urban matrix influences plant-pollinator processes. We recorded plant diversity, floral abundance, flower visitor diversity and plot visits at 89 plant patches within the city of Zurich. The urban matrix surrounding each site was analyzed for the landscape metrics edge density and the extent of green area up to 200 m radius. The correlation between edge density and bee diversity and visitation frequency varied over the entire spatial range, while the correlation for syrphid diversity and visitation frequency levelled off at 80 m radius. In contrast, the correlations with green area were more consistent, with bee diversity levelling off after 100 m, while syrphid diversity and visits continued to increase. The variation in the correlation of bee visits was partly accounted for by the large contribution of honeybees. Plant diversity significantly affected bee diversity and visits, and syrphid visits. Floral abundance had a positive effect on bee visits and bee diversity. Syrphid diversity had a negative interaction with floral abundance and green area. The extent of green area increased bee diversity and visits, and syrphid visits, while edge density reduced visitation by bees. This study showed that plant diversity and floral abundance in urban environments promote pollinating flower visitors. The extent of green area and edge density are important urban mosaic attributes that affect pollinator abundance and visitation frequency at multiple scales.

AB Environmental conditions experienced by parents are increasingly recognized to affect offspring performance. We set out to investigate the effect of parental larval diet on offspring development time, adult body size and adult resistance to the bacterium Serratia marcescens in Drosophila melanogaster. Flies for the parental generation were raised on either poor or standard diet and then mated in the four possible sex-by-parental diet crosses. Females that were raised on poor food produced larger offspring than females that were raised on standard food. Furthermore, male progeny sired by fathers that were raised on poor food were larger than male progeny sired by males raised on standard food. Development times were shortest for offspring whose one parent (mother or the father) was raised on standard and the other parent on poor food and longest for offspring whose parents both were raised on poor food. No evidence for transgenerational effects of parental diet on offspring disease resistance was found. Although paternal effects have been previously demonstrated in D. melanogaster, no earlier studies have investigated male-mediated transgenerational effects of diet in this species. The results highlight the importance of not only considering the relative contribution each parental sex has on progeny performance but also the combined effects that the two sexes may have on offspring performance.

AB Demographic heterogeneity-variation among individuals in survival and reproduction-is ubiquitous in natural populations. Structured population models address heterogeneity due to age, size, or major developmental stages. However, other important sources of demographic heterogeneity, such as genetic variation, spatial heterogeneity in the environment, maternal effects, and differential exposure to stressors, are often not easily measured and hence are modeled as stochasticity. Recent research has elucidated the role of demographic heterogeneity in changing the magnitude of demographic stochasticity in small populations. Here we demonstrate a previously unrecognized effect: heterogeneous survival in long-lived species can increase the long-term growth rate in populations of any size. We illustrate this result using simple models in which each individual's annual survival rate is independent of age but survival may differ among individuals within a cohort. Similar models, but with nonoverlapping generations, have been extensively studied by demographers, who showed that, because the more "frail" individuals are more likely to die at a young age, the average survival rate of the cohort increases with age. Within ecology and evolution, this phenomenon of "cohort selection" is increasingly appreciated as a confounding factor in studies of senescence. We show that, when placed in a population model with overlapping generations, this heterogeneity also causes the asymptotic population growth rate lambda, to increase, relative to a homogeneous population with the same mean survival rate at birth. The increase occurs because, even integrating over all the cohorts in the population, the population becomes increasingly dominated by the more robust individuals. The growth rate increases monotonically with the variance in survival rates, and the effect can be substantial, easily doubling the growth rate of slow-growing populations. Correlations between parent and offspring phenotype change the magnitude of the increase in lambda, but the increase occurs even for negative parent-offspring correlations. The effect of heterogeneity in reproductive rate on lambda is quite different: growth rate increases with reproductive heterogeneity for positive parent-offspring correlation but decreases for negative parent-offspring correlation. These effects of demographic heterogeneity on lambda have important implications for population dynamics, population viability analysis, and evolution.

AB Floodplain meadows are severely threatened by land use change and intensification in Central Europe. This study investigates quantitative and qualitative changes in the vegetation of wet and species-rich mesic meadows in the floodplains of north Germany since the 1950s, considering their spatial extent, fragmentation, and replacement by other land use types. Historical high-resolution vegetation maps were compared with recent vegetation surveys in seven study regions (six unprotected areas, one protected reference area) in former West and East Germany. The unprotected sites showed alarming losses in wet and species-rich mesic meadows in the past 50 years (> 80%). Wet meadows were substituted by species-poor, intensively managed grasslands (26-60% of the former area), arable fields (0-47%) or set-asides (2-33%). Species-rich mesic meadows were transformed to arable fields (42-72%) or species-poor, intensively managed meadows (14-72%). Decreases in effective mesh size and patch size indicated increasing fragmentation of wet meadows, whilst changes in landscape structure were less consistent in mesic meadows. Only slight changes in the protected floodplain study area indicate that landscape change is mostly caused by local effects such as fertilisation and drainage, but not by general trends such as atmospheric N deposition or climate warming. Despite the contrasting political systems in West and East Germany with different agroeconomic frames, all unprotected study areas showed similar losses and increasing fragmentation of floodplain meadows, which may negatively influence the natural dynamics of, and the gene flow between, meadow plant populations. We conclude that floodplain meadows in north Germany urgently call for high-priority conservation measures.

AB Question: What are the composition, structure and extent of contemporary, common woody vegetation communities in New Zealand? How do the woody plant communities we describe, based on representative sampling, compare to those of previous New Zealand classifications?
   Methods: We used cluster analysis to classify data from 1177 systematically located vegetation plots, calculated spatial extent and ecological statistics for each alliance defined, and combined forest alliances into groups to assess correspondence with earlier mapped classifications. We used plot-based data on vegetation structure to infer potential community changes.
   Results: Twenty-four alliances were recognized, each of 19 to 105 plots, with estimated extents of 144 000-794 000 ha. Stand structure data suggest that 15 alliances are largely stable whereas nine may undergo compositional change. Among alliances, the proportion of exotic species ranged from 0 to 50%. Our forest and shrubland classification is another stage in progressively revising such classifications (i.e. forest class maps, vegetative cover map, ECOSAT woody classification and land cover database) produced over the last five decades.
   Conclusions: Compared to the previous classifications, our new classification incorporates alliances in disturbed landscapes, as well as those that are compositionally dynamic and which are also invaded by exotic species. It also provides greater partitioning within Nothofagus forests, but fails to distinguish some rare forest types, such as those dominated by Agathis australis. Our classification can contribute to a framework for national reporting of ecological indicators and management of woody vegetation.

AB Quantifying the current carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems requires that we translate spatially sparse measurements into consistent, gridded flux estimates at the regional scale. This is particularly challenging in heterogeneous regions such as the northern forests of the United States. We use a network of 17 eddy covariance flux towers deployed across the Upper Midwest region of northern Wisconsin and Michigan and upscale flux observations from towers to the regional scale. This region is densely instrumented and provides a unique test bed for regional upscaling. We develop a simple Diagnostic Carbon Flux Model (DCFM) and use flux observations and a data assimilation approach to estimate the model parameters. We then use the optimized model to produce gridded flux estimates across the region. We find that model parameters vary not only across plant functional types (PFT) but also within a given PFT. Our results show that the parameter estimates from a single site are not representative of the parameter values of a given PFT; cross-site (or joint) optimization using observations from multiple sites encompassing a range of site and climate conditions considerably improves the representativeness and robustness of parameter estimates. Parameter variability within a PFT can result in substantial variability in regional flux estimates. We also find that land cover representation including land cover heterogeneity and the spatial resolution and accuracy of land cover maps can lead to considerable uncertainty in regional flux estimates. In heterogeneous, complex regions, detailed and accurate land cover maps are essential for accurate estimation of regional fluxes.

AB 1. Regional above-ground biomass estimates for tropical moist forests remain highly inaccurate mostly because they are based on extrapolations from a few plots scattered across a limited range of soils and other environmental conditions. When such conditions impact biomass, the estimation is biased. The effect of soil types on biomass has especially yielded controversial results.
   2. We investigated the relationship between above-ground biomass and soil type in undisturbed moist forests in the Central African Republic. We tested the effects of soil texture, as a surrogate for soil resources availability and physical constraints (soil depth and hydromorphy) on biomass. Forest inventory data were collected for trees >= 20 cm stem diameter in 2754 0.5 ha plots scattered over 4888 km(2). The plots contained 224 taxons, of which 209 were identified to species. Soil types were characterized from a 1:1 000 000 scale soil map. Species-specific values for wood density were extracted from the CIRAD's data base of wood technological properties.
   3. We found that basal area and biomass differ in their responses to soil type, ranging from 17.8 m(2) ha(-1) (217.5 t ha(-1)) to 22.3 m(2) ha(-1) (273.3 t ha(-1)). While shallow and hydromorphic soils support forests with both low stem basal area and low biomass, forests on deep resource-poor soils are typically low in basal area but as high in biomass as forests on deep resource-rich soils. We demonstrated that the environmental filtering of slow growing dense-wooded species on resource-poor soils compensates for the low basal area, and we discuss whether this filtering effect is due to low fertility or to low water reserve.
   4. Synthesis. We showed that soil physical conditions constrained the amount of biomass stored in tropical moist forests. Contrary to previous reports, our results suggest that biomass is similar on resource-poor and resource-rich soils. This finding highlights both the importance of taking into account soil characteristics and species wood density when trying to predict regional patterns of biomass.

AB Variation in prenatal exposure to androgens is thought to be responsible for some of the individual differences in aggressive behavior among adults. A putative indicator of prenatal testosterone exposure, 2D:4D (the index to ring finger length) ratios have shown a weak correlation with aggression. Variation in sensitivity of the androgen receptor, resulting from polymorphism in the AR gene, is also thought to influence the relative expression of sexually dimorphic traits within each sex, including aggressive behavior and 2D:4D. Here we examine variation in aggression, 2D:4D, and polymorphism in the AR and MAO-A genes in a sample of 188 men. We find no evidence of AR gene influence on right hand 2D:4D, and a weak trend towards more feminine-typical left hand 2D:4D in men with more sensitive androgen receptors. Men with more sensitive androgen receptors tended to score lower on many of the subscales of the Aggression Questionnaire and Indirect Aggression Questionnaire. We found no influence of MAO-A allele on either digit ratio or aggressive behavior. We conclude that more masculine-typical 2D:4D does not reflect greater sensitivity to testosterone through variation in this locus on the AR gene, and that AR alleles conferring greater sensitivity to testosterone are associated with lower, not higher propensity to aggression.

AB For over 100 years, mountain treelines have been the subject of varied research endeavors and remain a strong area of investigation. The purpose of this paper is to examine aspects of the epistemology of mountain treeline research-that is, to investigate how knowledge on treelines has been acquired and the changes in knowledge acquisition over time, through a review of fundamental questions and approaches. The questions treeline researchers have raised and continue to raise have undoubtedly directed the current state of knowledge. A continuing, fundamental emphasis has centered on seeking the general cause of mountain treelines, thus seeking an answer to the question, "What causes treeline?" with a primary emphasis on searching for ecophysiological mechanisms of low-temperature limitation for tree growth and regeneration. However, treeline research today also includes a rich literature that seeks local, landscape-scale causes of treelines and reasons why treelines vary so widely in three-dimensional patterns from one location to the next, and this approach and some of its consequences are elaborated here. In recent years, both lines of research have been motivated greatly by global climate change. Given the current state of knowledge, we propose that future research directions focused on a spatial approach should specifically address cross-scale hypotheses using statistics and simulations designed for nested hierarchies; these analyses will benefit from geographic extension of treeline research.

AB In high-elevation forests, growth is limited by low temperatures, while in Mediterranean climates drought and high temperatures are the main limiting factors. Consequently, the climate-growth relationships on Mont Ventoux, a mountain in the Mediterranean area, are influenced by both factors. Two co-occurring species were studied: silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) and common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), whose geographical distribution depends on their low tolerance to summer drought at low altitude/latitude, and low temperatures (late frost and short length of the growing season) at high altitude/latitude. Firs and beeches distributed along an elevational gradient were investigated using dendroecological methods. Silver fir growth was found to be more sensitive to summer water stress than beech. On the other hand, beech growth was more impacted by extreme events such as the 2003 heat wave, and negatively related to earlier budburst, which suggests a higher sensitivity to late frost. These results are confirmed by the different altitudinal effects observed in both species. Beech growth decreases with altitude whereas an optimum of growth potential was observed at intermediate elevations for silver fir. Recent global warming has caused a significant upward shift of these optima. As found for the period 2000-2006, rising temperatures and decreasing rainfall may restrain growth of silver fir. If these trends continue in the future beech might be favored at low altitudes. The species will have a reduced capacity to migrate to higher altitudes due to its sensitivity to late frosts, although an upward shift of silver fir is likely.

AB Many jurisdictions in North America use a "mitigation sequence" to protect wetlands: First, avoid impacts; second, minimize unavoidable impacts; and third, compensate for irreducible impacts through the use of wetland restoration, enhancement, creation, or protection. Despite the continued reliance on this sequence in wetland decision-making, there is broad agreement among scholars, scientists, policy-makers, regulators, and the regulated community that the first and most important step in the mitigation sequence, avoidance, is ignored more often than it is implemented. This paper draws on literature published between 1989 and 2010, as well as 33 semi-structured, key-informant interviews carried out in 2009 and 2010 with actors intimately involved with wetland policy in Alberta, Canada, to address key reasons why "avoidance" as a policy directive is seldom effective. Five key factors emerged from the literature, and were supported by interview data, as being central to the failure of decision-makers to prioritize wetland avoidance and minimization above compensation in the mitigation sequence: (1) a lack of agreement on what constitutes avoidance; (2) current approaches to land-use planning do not identify high-priority wetlands in advance of development; (3) wetlands are economically undervalued; (4) there is a "techno-arrogance" associated with wetland creation and restoration that results in increased wetland loss, and; (5) compensation requirements are inadequately enforced. Largely untested but proactive ways to re-institute avoidance as a workable option in wetland management include: watershed-based planning; comprehensive economic and social valuation of wetlands; and long-term citizen-based monitoring schemes.

AB P>Low temperatures limit the fixation of photosynthates and xylogenesis. Here, we hypothesized that reduced longitudinal growth in trees at high altitude is related to the lower hydraulic efficiency of the transport system.
   Apical buds of Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees at high and low elevation were heated during 2006 and 2007. At the end of the experiment, trees were felled. Longitudinal increments and tracheid lumen areas were measured along the stem. Apical hydraulic conductivity (k) was estimated from anatomical data.
   Before heating, high-altitude trees showed fewer (P = 0.002) and smaller (P = 0.008) apical conduits, and therefore reduced k (P = 0.016) and stem elongation (P < 0.0001), in comparison with trees at low elevation. After 2 yr of heating, k increased at both high (P = 0.014) and low (P = 0.047) elevation. Only high-altitude trees showed increased stem elongation, which reached the same magnitude as that of controls at low elevation (P = 0.735). Heating around the apical shoots did not appear to induce significant changes in conduit dimension along the rest of the stem.
   The total number and size of xylem elements at the stem apex are strongly constrained by low temperatures. Trees at high altitude are therefore prevented from building up an efficient transport system, and their reduced longitudinal growth reflects strong hydraulic limitations.

AB Context. Global climate change will lead to increased climate variability, including more frequent drought and heatwaves, in many areas of the world. This will affect the distribution and numbers of wildlife populations. In south-west Queensland, anecdotal reports indicated that a low density but significant koala population had been impacted by drought from 2001-2009, in accord with the predicted effects of climate change.
   Aims. The study aimed to compare koala distribution and numbers in south-west Queensland in 2009 with pre-drought estimates from 1995-1997.
   Methods. Community surveys and faecal pellet surveys were used to assess koala distribution. Population densities were estimated using the Faecal Standing Crop Method. From these densities, koala abundance in 10 habitat units was interpolated across the study region. Bootstrapping was used to estimate standard error. Climate data and land clearing were examined as possible explanations for changes in koala distribution and numbers between the two time periods.
   Key results. Although there was only a minor change in distribution, there was an 80% decline in koala numbers across the study region, from a mean population of 59 000 in 1995 to 11 600 in 2009. Most summers between 2002 and 2007 were hotter and drier than average. Vegetation clearance was greatest in the eastern third of the study region, with the majority of clearing being in mixed eucalypt/acacia ecosystems and vegetation on elevated residuals.
   Conclusions. Changes in the area of occupancy and numbers of koalas allowed us to conclude that drought significantly reduced koala populations and that they contracted to critical riparian habitats. Land clearing in the eastern part of the region may reduce the ability of koalas to move between habitats.
   Implications. The increase in hotter and drier conditions expected with climate change will adversely affect koala populations in south-west Queensland and may be similar in other wildlife species in arid and semiarid regions. The effect of climate change on trailing edge populations may interact with habitat loss and fragmentation to increase extinction risks. Monitoring wildlife population dynamics at the margins of their geographic ranges will help to manage the impacts of climate change.

AB The Neotropical Phyllomedusa burmeisteri treefrog group includes four diploid (P. bahiana, P. burmeisteri, P. distincta and P. iheringii) and one tetraploid (P. tetraploidea) forms. Here we use mitochondrial and nuclear sequence variation from across its range to verify if recognized morphospecies correspond to phylogenetic clades, examine the origin of the polyploid P. tetraploidea, and compare range wide patterns of diversification to those of other BAF organisms. We compared single gene trees with one Bayesian multi-gene tree, and one Bayesian species tree inferred under a coalescent framework. Our mtDNA phylogenetic analyses showed that P. bahiana, P. burmeisteri and P. iheringii correspond to monophyletic clades, while P. distincta and P. tetraploidea were paraphyletic. The nuclear gene trees were concordant in revealing two moderately supported groups including (i) P. bahiana and P. burmeisteri (northern species) and (ii) P. distincta, P. tetraploidea and P. iheringii (southern species). The multi-gene tree and the species tree retrieved similar topologies, giving high support to the northern and southern clades, and to the sister-taxa relationship between P. tetraploidea and P. distincta. Estimates of 'MRCA suggest a major split within the P. burmeisteri group at approximate to 5 Myr (between northern and southern groups), while the main clades were originated between approximate to 0.4 and 2.5 Myr, spanning the late Pliocene and Pleistocene. Patterns of geographic and temporal diversification within the group were congruent with those uncovered for other co-distributed organisms. Independent paleoecological and geological data suggest that vicariance associated with climatic oscillations and neotectonic activity may have driven lineage divergence within the P. burmeisteri group. P. tetraploidea probably originated from polyploidization of P. distincta or from a common ancestor. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We performed simulations of future biophysical vegetation-climate feedbacks with a regional Earth System Model, RCA-GUESS, interactively coupling a regional climate model and a process-based model of vegetation dynamics and biogeochemistry. Simulated variations in leaf area index and in the relative coverage of evergreen forest, deciduous forest, and open land vegetation in response to simulated climate influence atmospheric state via variations in albedo, surface roughness, and the partitioning of the land-atmosphere heat flux into latent and sensible components. The model was applied on a similar to 50 x 50 km grid over Europe under a future climate scenario. Three potential "hot spots" of vegetation-climate feedbacks could be identified. In the Scandinavian Mountains, reduced albedo resulting from the snow-masking effect of forest expansion enhanced the winter warming trend. In central Europe, the stimulation of photosynthesis and plant growth by "CO2 fertilization" mitigated warming, through a negative evapotranspiration feedback associated with increased vegetation cover and leaf area index. In southern Europe, increased summer dryness restricted plant growth and survival, causing a positive warming feedback through reduced evapotranspiration. Our results suggest that vegetation-climate feedbacks over the European study area will be rather modest compared to the radiative forcing of increased global CO2 concentrations but may modify warming projections locally, regionally, and seasonally, compared with results from traditional "off-line" regional climate models lacking a representation of the relevant feedback mechanisms.

AB Bacteria and fungi drive the cycling of plant litter in forests, but little is known about their role in tropical rain forest nutrient cycling, despite the high rates of litter decay observed in these ecosystems. However, litter decay rates are not uniform across tropical rain forests. For example, decomposition can differ dramatically over small spatial scales between low-diversity, monodominant rain forests, and species-rich, mixed forests. Because the climatic patterns and soil parent material are identical in co-occurring mixed and monodominant forests, differences in forest floor accumulation, litter production, and decomposition between these forests may be biotically mediated. To test this hypothesis, we conducted field and laboratory studies in a monodominant rain forest in which the ectomycorrhizal tree Dicymbe corymbosa forms > 80% of the canopy, and a diverse, mixed forest dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal trees. After 2 years, decomposition was significantly slower in the monodominant forest (P < 0.001), but litter production was significantly greater in the mixed forest (P < 0.001). In the laboratory, we found microbial community biomass was greater in the mixed forest (P = 0.02), and the composition of fungal communities was distinct between the two rain forest types (P = 0.001). Sequencing of fungal rDNA revealed a significantly lower richness of saprotrophic fungi in the monodominant forest (19 species) relative to the species-rich forest (84 species); moreover, only 4% percent of fungal sequences occurred in both forests. These results show that nutrient cycling patterns in tropical forests can vary dramatically over small spatial scales, and that changes in microbial community structure likely drive the observed differences in decomposition.

AB Freshwater conservation efforts require an understanding of how natural and anthropogenic factors shape the present-day biogeography of native and non-native species. This knowledge need is especially acute for imperiled native fishes in the highly modified Lower Colorado River Basin (LCRB), USA. In the present study we employed both a taxonomic and functional approach to explore how natural and human-related environmental drivers shape landscape-scale patterns of fish community composition in the LCRB. Our results showed that hydrologic alteration, watershed land use, and regional climate explained 30.3% and 44.7% of the total variation in fish community taxonomic and functional composition, respectively. Watersheds with greater dam densities and upstream storage capacity supported higher non-native functional diversity, suggesting that dams have provided additional "niche opportunities'' for non-native equilibrium life-history strategists by introducing new reservoir habitat and modifying downstream flow and thermal regimes. By contrast, watersheds characterized by greater upstream land protection, lower dam densities, and higher variation in spring and summer precipitation supported fish communities with a strong complement of native species (opportunistic-periodic strategists). In conclusion, our study highlights the utility of a life-history approach to better understand the patterns and processes by which fish communities vary along environmental gradients.

AB P>1. Broad-scale assessment of stream health is often based on correlative relationships between catchment land-use categories and measurements of stream biota or water chemistry. Few studies have attempted to characterise the response curves that describe how measures of ecosystem function change along gradients of catchment land use, or explored how these responses vary at broad spatial scales.
   2. In autumn 2008, we conducted a survey of 84 streams in three bioregions of New Zealand to assess the sensitivity of functional indicators to three land-use gradients: percentage of native vegetation cover, percentage of impervious cover (IC) and predicted nitrogen (N) concentration. We examined these relationships using general linear models and boosted regression trees to explore monotonic, non-monotonic and potential threshold components of the response curves.
   3. When viewing the responses to individual land-use gradients, four of five functional indicators were positively correlated with the removal of native vegetation cover and N. In general, weaker and less responsive models were observed for the IC gradient. An analysis of the response to multiple stressors showed delta 15N of primary consumers and gross primary productivity (GPP) to be the most responsive functional indicators to land-use gradients. The multivariate models identified thresholds for change in the relationship between the functional indicators and all three land-use gradients. Apparent thresholds were < 10%IC, between 40 and 80% loss of native vegetation cover and at 0.5 and 3.2 mg L-1 N.
   4. The strength of regression models and the nature of the response curves suggest that measures of ecosystem function exhibit predictable relationships with land use. Furthermore, the responses of functional indicators varied little among three bioregions. This information provides a strong argument for the inclusion of functional indicators in a holistic assessment of stream health.

Here the Chinese rose bitterling, Rhodeus ocellatus, a freshwater fish with a resource-based mating system, was used to separate additive and nonadditive genetic benefits of female mate choice. A sequential blocked mating design was used to test female mate preferences, and a cross-classified breeding design coupled with in vitro fertilizations for fitness benefits of mate choice. In addition, the offspring produced by the pairing of preferred and nonpreferred males were reared to maturity and their fitness traits were compared. Finally, the MHC DAB1 gene was typed and male MHC genotypes were correlated with female mate choice. Females showed significant mate preferences but preferences were not congruent among females. There was a significant interaction of male and female genotype on offspring survival, rate of development, growth rate, and body size. No significant male additive effects on offspring fitness were observed. Female mate preferences corresponded with male genetic compatibility, which correlated with MHC dissimilarity. It is proposed that in the rose bitterling genetic compatibility is the mechanism by which females obtain a fitness benefit through mate choice and that male MHC dissimilarity, likely mediated by odor cues, indicates genetic compatibility.

AB Public participation is a key element of Integrated Water Resources Management and, in the European Union (EU), is a major challenge in the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), which was adopted in December 2000. When new legislation enters into force it is essential to set a baseline against which to measure the progress towards the established goals at significant milestones of its implementation. This paper presents an assessment of the quality of stakeholder participation at the beginning of the WFD implementation in twenty countries belonging to or with close institutional relationships with the EU. The evaluation was completed by environmental non-governmental organizations and it shows that already in 2003 there were positive examples of stakeholder participation in several countries but that, in general, the WFD implementation will require significant efforts to improve on participatory practices throughout Europe.

AB Background: Sexually deceptive orchids of the genus Ophrys attract their pollinators, male insects, on a highly specific basis through the emission of odour blends that mimic the female sex pheromone of the targeted species. In this study, we have investigated a contact site between Ophrys arachnitiformis and O. lupercalis, two sympatric orchid species that are usually reproductively isolated via the exploitation of different pollinator "niches", but occasionally hybridise despite their apparent combination of ethological and mechanical isolation barriers. In particular, we have investigated the extent to which these Ophrys hybrids generate "emergent" combinations (i.e. novel and unpredictable from the parents' phenotypes) of floral traits, and how these phenotypic novelties, particularly the odour blends emitted by the flower, could facilitate the invasion of a novel pollinator "niche" and induce the rapid formation of reproductive isolation, a prerequisite for adaptive evolutionary divergence.
   Results: Our chemical analyses of floral scents show that the Ophrys F1 hybrids investigated here produce more compounds, significantly different ratios (% of odour compounds in the total blend), as well as new compounds in their floral odour compared to their progenitors. When tested for their attractiveness to the pollinator of each parent orchid species, we found that floral scent extracts of the hybrids triggered less inspecting flights and contacts by the male bees with the scented dummy than those of the parental orchid species. However, a series of additional behavioural bioassays revealed that the novel floral scent of the hybrids was significantly more attractive than either of the two parents to a pollinator species not initially involved in the pollination of any of the parent Ophrys species.
   Conclusions: Collectively, our results illustrate that the process of hybridisation can lead to the generation of evolutionary novelties, and that novel combinations of floral traits can drive pollinator shifts and rapid reproductive isolation in highly specific plant-pollinator interactions.

AB Effects of urbanization on ground-dwelling spiders (Araneae) were studied using pitfall traps along an urban-suburban-rural forest gradient in Debrecen (Hungary). We found that overall spider species richness was significantly higher in the urban sites compared to the suburban and rural ones. The increased diversity was due to the significantly more open-habitat species in the assemblages at the urban sites. This suggests that species from the surrounding matrix (grasslands and arable lands) penetrated the disturbed urban sites. The ratio of forest species was significantly higher in the rural sites than in the suburban and urban ones, suggesting that forest species are indeed sensitive to the disturbance caused by urbanization. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that the species composition changed remarkably along the urbanization gradient. Open-habitat spiders were associated with the urban sites of higher ground and air temperature. Forest spiders were characteristic of the rural sites with higher amount of decaying woods. Our findings suggest that the overall diversity was not the most appropriate indicator of disturbance; species with different habitat affinity should be analyzed separately to get an ecologically relevant picture of the effect of urbanization.

AB In sexually dimorphic and polygynous mammals, sexual selection often favours large males with well-developed weaponry, as these secondary sexual characters confer advantages in intrasexual competition and are often preferred by females. Little is known, however, about the effects of sexually selected paternal traits on offspring phenotype in wild mammals, especially when considering that shared phenotypic traits and selection can also differ greatly between genders. Here, we conducted molecular parentage analyses in a long-term study population of mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), an ungulate exhibiting high sexual dimorphism in mass, to first assess the determinants of yearly reproductive success (YRS) in males. We then examined the effects of paternal characteristics on offspring mass at 1 year of age. Paternity was highly skewed, with 9 per cent of 57 males siring 51 per cent of 96 offspring assigned over 12 years. Male YRS increased with age until apparent reproductive senescence at 9 years, but mass was a stronger determinant of siring success than age, horn length or social rank. Mass of sons increased with paternal mass, but the mass of daughters was negatively related to that of their father, a finding consistent with recent theory on intralocus sexual conflict. Because early differences in mass persisted to early adulthood, sex-specific effects of paternal mass can have important fitness consequences, as adult mass is positively linked with reproduction in both sexes. Divergent father-offspring phenotypic correlations may partly explain the maintenance of sexual dimorphism in mountain goats and the large variance observed for this homologous trait within each gender in polygynous mammals.

AB Estimation of photosynthetic light use efficiency (s) from satellite observations is an important component of climate change research. The photochemical reflectance index, a narrow waveband index based on the reflectance at 531 and 570 nm, allows sampling of the photosynthetic activity of leaves; upscaling of these measurements to landscape and global scales, however, remains challenging. Only a few studies have used spaceborne observations of PRI so far, and research has largely focused on the MODIS sensor. Its daily global coverage and the capacity to detect a narrow reflectance band at 531 nm make it the best available choice for sensing E from space. Previous results however, have identified a number of key issues with MODIS-based observations of PRI. First, the differences between the footprint of eddy covariance (EC) measurements and the MODIS footprint, which is determined by the sensor's observation geometry make a direct comparison between both data sources challenging and second, the PRI reflectance bands are affected by atmospheric scattering effects confounding the existing physiological signal. In this study we introduce a new approach for upscaling EC based E measurements to MODIS. First, EC-measured S values were "translated" into a tower-level optical PRI signal using AMSPEC, an automated multi-angular, tower-based spectroradiometer instrument. AMSPEC enabled us to adjust tower-measured PRI values to the individual viewing geometry of each MODIS overpass. Second, MODIS data were atmospherically corrected using a Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm, which uses a time series approach and an image-based rather than pixel-based processing for simultaneous retrievals of atmospheric aerosol and surface bidirectional reflectance (BRDF). Using this approach, we found a strong relationship between tower-based and spaceborne reflectance measurements (r(2)=0.74, p<0.01) throughout the vegetation period of 2006. Swath (non-gridded) observations yielded stronger correlations than gridded data (r(2)=0.58, p<0.01) both of which included forward and backscatter observations. Spaceborne PRI values were strongly related to canopy shadow fractions and varied with different levels of c. We conclude that MAIAC-corrected MODIS observations were able to track the site-level physiological changes from space throughout the observation period. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB With incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), the genealogy of closely related species differs along their genomes. The amount of ILS depends on population parameters such as the ancestral effective population sizes and the recombination rate, but also on the number of generations between speciation events. We rise a hidden Markov model parameterized according to coalescent theory to infer the genealogy along a four species genome alignment of closely related species and estimate population parameters. We analyze a basic, panmictic demographic model and study its properties using an extensive set of coalescent simulations. We assess the effect of the model assumptions and demonstrate that the Markov property provides a good approximation to the ancestral recombination graph. Using a too restricted set of possible genealogies, necessary to reduce the computational load, can bias parameter estimates. We propose a simple correction for this bias and suggest directions for future extensions of the model. We show that the patterns of ILS along a sequence alignment can be recovered efficiently together with the ancestral recombination rate. Finally, we introduce an extension of the basic model that. allows for mutation rate heterogeneity and reanalyze human-chimpanzee-gorilla-orangutan alignments, using the new models. We expect that this framework will prove useful for population genomics and provide exciting insights into genome evolution.

AB Tropical South America vegetation cover projections for the end of the century differ considerably depending on climate scenario and also on how physiological processes are considered in vegetation models. In this paper we use a potential vegetation model (CPTEC-PVM2) to analyze biome distribution in tropical South America under a range of climate projections and a range of estimates about the effects of increased atmospheric CO2. We show that if the CO2 "fertilization effect'' indeed takes place and is maintained in the long term in tropical forests, then it will avoid biome shifts in Amazonia in most of the climate scenarios, even if the effect of CO2 fertilization is halved. However, if CO2 fertilization does not play any important role on tropical forests in the future or if dry season is longer than 4 months (projected by 2/14 GCMs), then there is replacement of large portions of Amazonia by tropical savanna.

AB We modelled the present and future sub-Saharan winter distributions of 64 trans-Saharan migrant passerines to predict the potential impacts of climate change. These predictions used the recent ensemble modelling developments and the latest IPCC climatic simulations to account for possible methodological uncertainties. Results suggest that 37 species would face a range reduction by 2100 (16 of these by more than 50%); however, the median range size variation is L13 per cent (from -97 to +980%) under a full dispersal hypothesis. Range centroids were predicted to shift by 500 +/- 373 km. Predicted changes in range size and location were spatially structured, with species that winter in southern and eastern Africa facing larger range contractions and shifts. Predicted changes in regional species richness for these long-distance migrants are increases just south of the Sahara and on the Arabian Peninsula and major decreases in southern and eastern Africa.

AB Forest floor chemistry and microbial communities can be influenced by forest land management, such as harvesting and prescribed burning. Here, we used phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and multiple carbon-source substrate-induced respiration (MSIR) analyses to characterize microbial communities of deciduous, mixedwood and coniferous boreal forest floors with different silvicultural treatments. The sites were stem-only harvested with 10% retention, and silvicultural treatments consisting of slash being evenly distributed on the site and then burned, or not burned. The burned sites exhibited lower microbial biomass and greater NO3- concentrations than the unburned sites. However, burning appeared to have no effect on forest floor microbial community structure or function. On the other hand, during drier months (August sampling), the composition of forest floor microbial communities appeared to be strongly influenced by topographic position rather than stand related differences. Harvested sites located at higher elevations had similar microbial communities, regardless of the overstory composition, while coniferous and mixedwood sites located at lower elevations had similarly structured microbial communities that were distinct from deciduous sites. Differences in microclimatic conditions of the forest floor between higher elevation sites and lower elevations sites may select for some microbial groups over others. Indicator analysis found a strong association of a fungal PLFA biomarker (20:1 omega 9c), with sites at higher elevation, while a biomarker for actinomycetes (10Me19:0) was strongly associated with deciduous sites at lower elevation. Structural differences in microbial communities observed between sites at higher and lower elevations appear to be linked to seasonal patterns in moisture, as previous studies in this region found no apparent effect of elevation during times of higher monthly precipitation.

AB There is a growing appreciation of impacts of late-Quaternary climate fluctuations on spatial patterns of species and genetic diversity. A major challenge is to understand how and why species respond individualistically to a common history of climate-induced habitat fluctuation. Here, we combine modelling of palaeo-distributions and mitochondrial-DNA phylogeographies to compare spatial patterns of population persistence and isolation across three species of rainforest skinks (Saproscincus spp.) with varying climatic preferences. Using Akaike Information Criterion model-averaged projections, all three species are predicted to have maintained one or more small populations in the northern Wet Tropics, multiple or larger populations in the central region, and few if any in the south. For the high-elevation species, Saproscincus czechurai, the warm-wet climate of the mid Holocene was most restrictive, whereas for the generalist S. basiliscus and lower-elevation S. tetradactyla, the cool-dry last glacial maximum was most restrictive. As expected, S. czechurai was the most genetically structured species, although relative to modelled distributions, S. basiliscus had surprisingly deep phylogeographical structure among southern rainforest isolates, implying long-term isolation and persistence. For both S. basiliscus and S. tetradactyla, there was high genetic diversity and complex phylogeographical patterns in the central Wet Tropics, reflecting persistence of large, structured populations. A previously identified vicariant barrier separating northern and central regions is supported, and results from these species also emphasize a historical persistence of populations south of another biogeographical break, the Tully Gorge. Overall, the results support the contention that in a topographically heterogeneous landscape, species with broader climatic niches may maintain higher and more structured genetic diversity due to persistence through varying climates.

AB We use an individual-based simulation model to investigate factors influencing progress toward ecological speciation. We find that environmental differences can quickly lead to the evolution of substantial reproductive barriers between a population colonizing a new environment and the ancestral population in the old environment. Natural selection against immigrants and hybrids was a major contributor to this isolation, but the evolution of sexual preference was also important. Increasing dispersal had both positive and negative effects on population size in the new environment and had positive effects on natural selection against immigrants and hybrids. Genetic divergence at unlinked, neutral genetic markers was low, except when environmental differences were large and sexual preference was present. Our results highlight the importance of divergent selection and adaptive divergence for ecological speciation. At the same time, they reveal several interesting nonlinearities in interactions between environmental differences, sexual preference, dispersal and population size.

AB The levels-of-integration concept in ecology suggests that while the population and community levels of biological organization provide understanding, they do not provide an adequate basis for predicting future states of populations, communities or ecosystems. Empirical models of populations and communities are implicitly ecosystem level because they are based on measures of the results of all past determinants that affected the populations and communities in question. They can be good predictors under unchanging conditions, but they are not able to predict for changing conditions, which requires the explicit representation of those ecological processes that are anticipated to change. The question addressed in this paper is: how does the performance of a "simple" stand-level model change as representations of these processes are added, and how much complexity is enough? Examples are given of change in performance of the ecosystem management model FORECAST run as a light competition model as nutrient regulation of growth and understory interactions are added singly or in combination. These examples are framed in comparisons of simulations for a white spruce stand in the in boreal mixedwood region in northern British Columbia, for a long-term thinning-fertilization trial in a Douglas-fir stand on southern Vancouver Island, and for yield decline in Chinese fir in south eastern China. It is concluded that the effect of adding complexity on the predictions of this model depends on the time scale of the simulation and the management or natural disturbance regime that is being simulated. The results supported Occam's razor: that models should be as simple as possible but as complex as necessary. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Genetic data are currently providing a large amount of new information on past distribution of species and are contributing to a new vision of Pleistocene ice ages. Nonetheless, an increasing number of studies on the 'time dependency' of mutation rates suggest that date assessments for evolutionary events of the Pleistocene might be overestimated. We analysed mitochondrial (mt) DNA (COI) sequence variation in 225 Parnassius mnemosyne individuals sampled across central and eastern Europe in order to assess (i) the existence of genetic signatures of Pleistocene climate shifts; and (ii) the timescale of demographic and evolutionary events. Our analyses reveal a phylogeographical pattern markedly influenced by the Pleistocene/Holocene climate shifts. Eastern Alpine and Balkan populations display comparatively high mtDNA diversity, suggesting multiple glacial refugia. On the other hand, three widely distributed and spatially segregated lineages occupy most of northern and eastern Europe, indicating postglacial recolonization from different refugial areas. We show that a conventional 'phylogenetic' substitution rate cannot account for the present distribution of genetic variation in this species, and we combine phylogeographical pattern and palaeoecological information in order to determine a suitable intraspecific rate through a Bayesian coalescent approach. We argue that our calibrated 'time-dependent' rate (0.096 substitutions/million years), offers the most convincing time frame for the evolutionary events inferred from sequence data. When scaled by the new rate, estimates of divergence between Balkan and Alpine lineages point to c. 19 000 years before present (last glacial maximum), and parameters of demographic expansion for northern lineages are consistent with postglacial warming (5-11 000 years before present).

ID INTRODUCTIONS; SUCCESS; PLANT
AB Nonnative species that harm or have the potential to cause harm to the environment, economy, or human health are known as invasive species. Propagule pressure may be the most important factor in establishment success of nonnative species of various taxa in a variety of ecosystems worldwide, and strong evidence is emerging that propagule pressure determines both the scale of invasion extent and impact. In a limited way, the US government is applying a "propagule pressure approach" in a variety of prevention policy contexts aimed at minimizing the impact of harmful organisms. However, there are also readily apparent opportunities for enacting propagule pressure-based measures to fill current gaps in invasive species prevention and control at national, state, and local levels. An explicit focus on propagule pressure-based policies could substantially increase the effectiveness of US efforts to prevent the introduction of invasive species through by intentional and unintentional introductions.

AB Despite the recent renaissance in studies of ecological speciation, the connection between ecological selection and the evolution of reproductive isolation remains tenuous. We tested whether habitat adaptation of cytoplasmic genomes contributes to the maintenance of reproductive barriers in hybridizing sunflower species, Helianthus annuus and Helianthus petiolaris. We transplanted genotypes of the parental species, reciprocal F1 hybrids and all eight possible backcross combinations of nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes into the contrasting xeric and mesic habitats of the parental species. Analysis of survivorship across two growing seasons revealed that the parental species' cytoplasms were strongly locally adapted and that cytonuclear interactions (CNIs) significantly affected the fitness and architecture of hybrid plants. A significant fraction of the CNIs have transgenerational effects, perhaps due to divergence in imprinting patterns. Our results suggest a common means by which ecological selection may contribute to speciation and have significant implications for the persistence of hybridizing species.

AB The phytoplankton community of river-floodplain ecosystems shows significant temporal fluctuations in response to hydrosedimentological regime. The aim of our study was analyze the effect of the hydrosedimentological regime of the Parani and Ivinhema Rivers on the interannual variation in the composition, biovolume and functional groups of phytoplankton in an isolated floodplain lake (Ventura Lagoon) of the Ivinhema River State Park, located in the Upper Parani River floodplain (Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil). Samples of phytoplankton were taken at the sub-surface of the pelagic zone of the lake from February 2000 to December 2005. A total of 132 taxa were recorded, and the species that represented greater contributions to the phytoplankton biovolume were grouped into five functional groups (FG) (H1, H2, M, MP and Y). The distribution of the FGs were linked to the high and low water periods in Ventura lagoon. Functional groups MP and Y were the highest contributors to the phytoplankton biovolume during the high water periods, whereas FGs H1, H2 and M contributed more during the low water periods. The FGs were also useful for the interannual characterization of Ventura Lagoon by taking the changes caused by climatological factors into account. There was a strong dominance of Cyanobacteria (H2 and M) in 2000 and 2001 (La Nina periods) coincident with low precipitation and low hydrometric levels of the Parani and Ivinhema Rivers and, consequently, lower water depths of Ventura Lagoon. In 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 (El Nino periods), when higher precipitation, higher hydrometric levels, higher discharge of the Parani and Ivinhema Rivers and an increased depth of Ventura Lagoon were observed, Cyanobacteria (H1, H2 and M) were dominant, followed by Bacillariophyceae (MP) and Cryptophyceae (Y). These results reported here corroborate the utility of using FGs as indicators of interannual and seasonal variability in floodplain lakes.

AB 1. Wetlands in urban regions are subjected to a wide variety of anthropogenic disturbances, many of which may promote invasions of exotic plant species. In order to devise management strategies, the influence of different aspects of the urban and natural environments on invasion and community structure must be understood.
   2. The roles of soil variables, anthropogenic effects adjacent to and within the wetlands, and vegetation structure on exotic species occurrence within 21 forested wetlands in north-eastern New Jersey, USA, were compared. The hypotheses were tested that different vegetation strata and different invasive species respond similarly to environmental factors, and that invasion increases with increasing direct human impact, hydrologic disturbance, adjacent residential land use and decreasing wetland area. Canonical correspondence analyses, correlation and logistic regression analyses were used to examine invasion by individual species and overall site invasion, as measured by the absolute and relative number of exotic species in the site flora.
   3. Within each stratum, different sets of environmental factors separated exotic and native species. Nutrients, soil clay content and pH, adjacent land use and canopy composition were the most frequently identified factors affecting species, but individual species showed highly individualistic responses to the sets of environmental variables, often responding in opposite ways to the same factor.
   4. Overall invasion increased with decreasing area but only when sites > 100 ha were included. Unexpectedly, invasion decreased with increasing proportions of industrial/commercial adjacent land use.
   5. The hypotheses were only partially supported; invasion does not increase in a simple way with increasing human presence and disturbance.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The results suggest that a suite of environmental conditions can be identified that are associated with invasion into urban wetlands, which can be widely used for assessment and management. However, a comprehensive ecosystem approach is needed that places the remediation of physical alterations from urbanization within a landscape context. Specifically, sediment, inputs and hydrologic changes need to be related to adjoining urban land use and to the overlapping requirements of individual native and exotic species.

AB Plants engage in diverse and intimate interactions with unrelated taxa. For example, aboveground. oral visitors provide pollination services, while belowground arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) enhance nutrient capture. Traditionally in ecology, these processes were studied in isolation, reinforcing the prevailing assumption that these above- and belowground processes were also functionally distinct. More recently, there has been a growing realization that the soil surface is not a barrier to many ecological interactions, particularly those involving plants (who live simultaneously above and below ground). Because of the potentially large impact that mycorrhizae and. oral visitors can have on plant performance and community dynamics, we designed an experiment to test whether these multi-species mutualisms were interdependent under field conditions. Using benomyl, a widely used fungicide, we suppressed AMF in a native grassland, measuring plant, fungal, and floral-visitor responses after three years of fungal suppression. AMF suppression caused a shift in the community of. oral visitors from large-bodied bees to small-bodied bees and flies, and reduced the total number of. oral visits per flowering stem 67% across the 23 flowering species found in the plots. Fungal suppression has species-specific effects on. oral visits for the six most common flowering plants in this experiment. Exploratory analyses suggest these results were due to changes in. oral-visitor behavior due to altered patch-level. oral display, rather than through direct effects of AMF suppression on. oral morphology. Our findings indicate that AMF are an important, and overlooked, driver of. oral-visitor community structure with the potential to affect pollination services. These results support the growing body of research indicating that interactions among ecological interactions can be of meaningful effect size under natural field conditions and may influence individual performance, population dynamics, and community structure.

AB The North American woody species, Prunus serotina Ehrh., is an aggressive invader of forest understories in Europe. To better understand the plant invasion process, we assessed understorey plants and Prunus serotina seedlings that have colonized a 35-year-old replicated common-garden experiment of 14 tree species in south-western Poland. The density and size of established (> 1 year old) P. serotina seedlings varied among overstorey species and were related to variation in light availability and attributes of the understorey layer. In a multiple regression analysis, the density of established P. serotina seedlings was positively correlated with light availability and understorey species richness and negatively correlated with understorey species cover. These results suggest that woody invader success is adversely affected by overstorey shading and understorey competition for resources. Simultaneously, however, invader success may generally be positively associated with understorey species richness because both native and invasive plant colonization respond similarly to environmental conditions, including those influenced by overstorey tree species. Identification of characteristics of forests that increase their susceptibility to invasion may allow managers to target efforts to detect invasives and to restore forests to states that may be less invasible.

AB This critical review describes the confused application of significance tests in environmental toxicology and chemistry that often produces incorrect inferences and indefensible regulatory decisions. Following a brief review of statistical testing theory, nine recommendations are put forward. The first is that confidence intervals be used instead of hypothesis tests whenever possible. The remaining recommendations are relevant if hypothesis tests are used. They are as follows: Define and justify Type I and II error rates a priori; set and justify an effect size a priori; do not confuse p(E vertical bar H-0) and p(H-0 vertical bar E); design tests permitting Positive Predictive Value estimation; publish negative results; estimate a priori, not post hoe, power; as warranted by study goals, favor null hypotheses that are not conventional nil hypotheses; and avoid definitive inferences from isolated tests.

However, for other taxa, predictive models have been used successfully to relate conservation assessment with the impact of global warming. We investigated the distribution of the various diadromous species regularly encountered in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East at the beginning of the 20th century. For each species, we related the observed distribution to a set of environmental variables describing the prevailing climate in the basins, the physical nature of the basins and reflecting historical events known to have affected freshwater fish distribution. We successfully built twenty-one accurate species-specific models out of twenty-eight during both the calibration and the validation phases. Longitude, a factor we interpret as related to biogeographical history, was selected in all models and temperature was included in fifteen models, in six it was the most explanatory variable. These models allowed us to separate the roles of ecology and history in explaining distribution patterns at species level. Historical events such as glaciations constrained the continental distribution of all diadromous species and six of these were also highly temperature-dependent. Based on these results, we claim that these models can be used to predict the potential distribution under changing climatic conditions and provide two relevant examples (i.e. for Alosa alosa and Pe tromyzon marinus). Predictive models could be useful as a preliminary tool to prepare long-term conservation plans on European, national and regional scales. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Here we define a "biogeochemical niche" characterized by the species position in the multivariate space generated by its content not only of macronutrients like N, P or K, but also of micronutrients such as Mo, Mg and Ca, and trace toxic elements such as Pb and As. We then hypothesize that the flexibility of the species "biogeochemical niche" will influence the quality of plant tissue, which may have implications for herbivores, and will affect the species capacity to respond to disturbances and climate change and to adapt to the new climate conditions. We show with a simple multivariate procedure, a principal component analysis (PCA), first, that there is a strong differentiation in the total and relative (stoichiometry) content of the different elements in coexisting plant species, and, second, that there is species-specific plasticity in the response of this elemental composition to experimental climate change. The concentrations of foliar macro and micronutrients, as well as trace elements were measured in several tree species (Quercus ilex L., Phillyrea latifolia L. and Arbutus unedo L. in a Mediterranean broad leaf forest (Prades Mts) and in shrub species (Erica multiflora L., Globularia alypum L. and Dorycnium pentaphyllum Scop.) in a Mediterranean shrubland (Garraf Mts) in control plants and in plants grown in experimental drought and warming plots. The climate conditions were monitored during the period 1999-2005. During this period, in the Prades experiment the drought plots had on average a soil moisture content 9% lower than the control plots, whereas in the Garraf experiment the drought treatment led to a mean reduction in soil moisture of 21% and the warming treatment to 0.9 degrees C rise. The species with greater changes in biogeochemical niche under increased warming or drought, Arbutus unedo, Erica multiflora and Globularia alypum, were those that were also more affected in growth, photosynthetic capacity and other eco-physiological traits. The species differentiations indicate a strong biogeochemical niche, and that the changes in biogeochemical niche are probably an underlying factor in community structure shifts.

AB We characterised the remarkable heterogeneity following the large, severe fires of 1988 in Yellowstone National Park (YNP), in the northern Rocky Mountains, Wyoming, USA, by focussing on spatial variation in post-fire structure, composition and ecosystem function at broad, meso, and fine scales. Ecological heterogeneity at multiple scales may enhance resilience to large, severe disturbances by providing structural, biological and functional redundancy. Post-fire heterogeneity in stand age, coarse wood abundance, microbial and understorey communities reflected interactions between existing pre-fire patterns and fire severity at different scales, suggesting that environmental context plays an important role in successional responses to large fires. In response to these post-fire patterns, heterogeneity in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage, N mineralisation, decomposition, and productivity was also evident at multiple scales and may confer resiliency to large fires. For example, at broad scales, C storage in YNP appears resistant to changes in age-class structure associated with large stand-replacing fires. In summary, the YNP landscape is recovering rapidly from the 1988 fires through natural mechanisms, owing to the abundance and spatial heterogeneity of post-fire residuals, but other systems with fewer biotic legacies may be less resilient to such large, severe fires.

AB During the last 10 years, an increasing number of studies have explored evolutionary aspects of biological invasions. It is becoming increasingly clear that evolutionary processes play an important role during the establishment of non-native species. Genetic drift during the colonization process followed by strong selection imposed through a change in biotic conditions and co-evolutionary disequilibrium set the conditions for rapid evolutionary change in introduced populations. Different hypotheses, which have been proposed to explain how evolutionary and genetic processes, can facilitate invasiveness are explored and their relevance for fish invasions is discussed. Empirical evidence increasingly suggests that admixture after multiple introductions, hybridization between native and non-native species and enemy release can all catalyse the evolution of invasiveness. A number of studies also suggest that genetic bottlenecks might represent less of genetic paradox than previously thought. Much of the theoretical developments and empirical evidence concerning the importance of evolution during biological invasions has been provided from studies on invasive plants. Despite their prominence, fish invasions have received little attention from evolutionary biologists. Recent advances in population genetic analysis such as non-equilibrium methods and genomic techniques such as microarray technology provide suitable tools to address such issues.

AB In 1996, Schluter showed that the direction of morphological divergence of closely related species is biased toward the line of least genetic resistance, represented by g(max), the leading eigenvector of the matrix of genetic variance-covariance (the G-matrix). G is used to predict the direction of evolutionary change in natural populations. However, this usage requires that G is sufficiently constant over time to have enough predictive significance. Here, we explore the alternative explanation that G can evolve due to gene flow to conform to the direction of divergence between incipient species. We use computer simulations in a mainland-island migration model with stabilizing selection on two quantitative traits. We show that a high level of gene flow from a mainland population is required to significantly affect the orientation of the G-matrix in an island population. The changes caused by the introgression of the mainland alleles into the island population affect all aspects of the shape of G (size, eccentricity, and orientation) and lead to the alignment of g(max) with the line of divergence between the two populations' phenotypic optima. Those changes decrease with increased correlation in mutational effects and with a correlated selection. Our results suggest that high migration rates, such as those often seen at the intraspecific level, will substantially affect the shape and orientation of G, whereas low migration (e.g., at the interspecific level) is unlikely to substantially affect the evolution of G.

AB Functional groups (FG) are an useful generalization to investigate environmental change effects on biotic communities. Assigning species to FGs is a contextual task and carries an arbitrary element, regardless of whether the grouping is obtained a priori or by sophisticated numerical methods. Using two grassland community case studies, we show that even simple FG allocation based on growth form, architecture and longevity (plants and mosses), or foraging characteristics (above-ground invertebrates) can be useful to increase our understanding of community processes. For example, the sensitivity of organisms to climate change increases with trophic rank and is higher in disturbed than in undisturbed communities. Complexity of interaction webs (in terms of web connectance), however, is larger in undisturbed than in disturbed communities. A significant and important relationship is likely to exist between anthropogenic disturbances, community complexity and the ecosystem effects of climate change. Trophic interactions may be disrupted much easier by climate changes in disturbed than in undisturbed communities where complexity may be buffering these effects.

AB Phyto-pigments play an important role in plant physiological processes and primary production. Because different groups of pigments absorb light in distinctive ways, spectroscopy can be used as a tool for phyto-pigment quantification. While technical restrictions have prevented the use of remote sensing for pigment detection in the past, the advent of fine spectral resolution radiometers has offered opportunities to detect leaf-pigment concentrations at a range of scales from portable spectro-radiometers to airborne instruments. This paper describes the development of a fully automated spectral data collection system composed of a radiometer, a motor driven probe, and a datalogger mounted on a tower to measure year round spectral reflectance under different view and sun angles. The instrument features a motor driven probe pointing at the canopy which is able to sample spectra in a near 360 degrees view around the tower by completing a full rotation every 15 min. The view zenith angle is adjustable and currently set to 62 degrees one scan is completed within 3 s and the probe is forwarded about 11.5 degrees every 30 s. Simultaneous measurement of solar irradiance and reflectance facilitates sampling under various sky conditions. The height of the tower is 45 m, and the sensor is located about 10 m above the canopy. Over a 6-month test period, nearly 2 million scans have been collected and compiled at a field site, where ongoing eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements are being undertaken as part of the Fluxnet-Canada research network.

AB Coordinated variation has been reported for leaf structure, composition and function, across and within species, and theoretically should occur across populations of a species that span an extensive environmental range. We focused on Hawaiian keystone tree species Metrosideros polymorpha, specifically, 13-year old trees grown (2-4 m tall) in a common garden (approximately 1 ha field with 2-3 m between trees) from seeds collected from 14 populations along an altitude-soil age gradient. We determined the genetic component of relationships among specific leaf area (SLA), the concentrations of nitrogen (N) and pigments (chlorophylls, carotenoids, and anthocyanins), and photosynthetic light-use efficiency. These traits showed strong ecotypic variation; SLA declined 35% with increasing source elevation, and area-based concentrations of N, Chl a + b and Car increased by 50, 109 and 96%, respectively. Concentrations expressed on a mass basis were not well related to source elevation. Pigment ratios expressed covariation that suggested an increased capacity for light harvesting at higher source elevation; Chl/N and Car/Chl increased with source elevation, whereas Chl a/b declined; Chl a/b was higher for populations on younger soil, suggesting optimization for low N supply. Parallel trends were found for the photosynthetic reactions; light-saturated quantum yield of photosystem II (phi(PSII)) and electron transport rate (ETR) increased with source elevation. Correlations of the concentrations of photosynthetic pigments, pigment ratios, and photosynthetic function across the ecotypes indicated a stoichiometric coordination of the components of the light-harvesting antennae and reaction centers. The constellation of coordinated morphological, biochemical and physiological properties was expressed in the leaf reflectance and transmittance properties in the visible and near-infrared wavelength region (400-950 nm), providing an integrated metric of leaf status among and between plant phenotypes.

AB The role of sperm number and quality in male competitiveness was investigated using in vitro fertilization experiments with bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). Bluegill males use one of three mating tactics: 'sneakers', which streak spawn; 'satellites', which mimic females; and 'parentals', which are territorial. The in vitro experiments mimicked natural spawning by incorporating these males' mean proximity to eggs and timing of sperm release. Using a maximum-likelihood algorithm, raffle equations were fit to paternity data, which revealed a strong effect of sperm number on male competitiveness. There was no difference in sperm flagellum length, curvilinear swim speed or path linearity among the three male mating types, and these traits did not explain any additional variation in male competitiveness. It was estimated that, given closer proximity to eggs, satellites need release only 0.34 times as many sperm as parentals to obtain equal paternity. Despite being farther from the eggs and releasing sperm about half a second after parentals, sneakers need only release 0.58 times as many sperm as parentals to obtain equal paternity. Thus, the increased competitiveness of sneakers' sperm must come from a component of sperm quality other than speed or length.

AB Plumage coloration is generally perceived as a static trait and therefore not a good indicator of current condition. However, changing of feather colors after molt does occur and may have important implications for signal function and sexual selection. We studied longitudinal changes in blue tit (Parus caeruleus) crown ultraviolet (UV)/blue color, a sexually selected trait, by repeatedly measuring the same individuals between early winter and late spring. Whereas crown UV reflectance (UV chroma and hue) decreased dramatically over time, brightness and saturation did not show consistent patterns of change. The magnitude of the decline in coloration exceeded sexual and age dichromatism in hue and UV chroma, respectively. Hence, seasonal color changes could have strong effects on blue tit sexual signaling. Between-individual variation in the decline in UV coloration was large and related to attributes of male, but not female, quality, such as size and condition. Thus, conspecifics could potentially gain information about male phenotypic quality by assessing color change over the year. However, the degree of decline in male UV color did not affect breeding success because neither the number of within-pair nor the number of extrapair offspring produced correlated with changes in crown color. Seasonal changes in the expression of plumage coloration are probably widespread, and maintaining plumage coloration could thus constitute an additional honesty-enforcing mechanism after molt is completed.

AB The influence of different primary productivity regimes on live (Rose Bengal stained) and dead benthic foraminiferal distribution, as well as on the stable carbon isotopic composition of foraminiferal tests, was investigated in sediment surface samples (0-1 cm) from the upwelling region off Morocco between Cape Ghir (31 degrees N) and Cape Yubi (27 degrees N). A combination of factor analysis, detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was applied to the benthic foraminiferal data sets. Five major assemblages for both the live and dead fauna were revealed by factor analysis. In the cape regions organic matter fluxes are enhanced by high chlorophyll-a concentrations in the overlying surface waters. Here, benthic foraminiferal faunas are characterized by identical live and dead assemblages, high standing stocks, and low species delta C-13 values, indicating constant year-round high productivity. Bulimina marginata dominates the unique fauna at the shallowest station off Cape Ghir indicating highest chlorophyll-a concentrations. Off both capes, the succession of the Bulimina aculeata/Uvigerina mediterranea assemblage, the Sphaeroidina bulloides/Gavelinopsis translucens assemblage, and the Hoeglundina elegans assemblage from the shelf to the deep sea reflects the decrease in chlorophyll-a concentrations, hence the export flux. In contrast, the area between the capes is characterized by differently composed live and dead assemblages, low standing stocks, and less depleted delta C-13 values, thus reflecting low primary productivity. High foraminiferal numbers of Epistominella exigua, Eponides pusillus, and Globocassidulina subglobosa in the dead fauna indicate a seasonally varying primary productivity signal. Significantly lower mean delta C-13 values were recorded in Bulimina mexicana, Cibicidoides kullenbergi, H. elegans, U. mediterranea and Uvigerina peregrina. Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi is a faithful recorder of bottom water delta C-13 in the Canary Islands regions. The mean delta C-13 signal of this species is not significantly influenced by constant high organic matter fluxes. The species-specific offset between live and dead specimens is the same.

AB Studies of hybrid inviability, sterility and 'speciation genes' in Drosophila have given insight into the genetic changes that result in reproductive isolation. Here, I survey some extraordinary and important advances in Drosophila speciation research. However, 'reproductive isolation' is not the same as 'speciation', and this Drosophila work has resulted in a lopsided view of speciation. In particular, Drosophila are not always well-suited to investigating ecological and other selection-driven primary causes of speciation in nature. Recent advances have made use of far less tractable, but more charismatic organisms, such as flowering plants, vertebrates and larger insects. Work with these organisms has complemented Drosophila studies of hybrid unfitness to provide a more complete understanding of speciation.

AB Habitat-suitability modelling is being increasingly used as a tool for conservation biology. Although studies at large spatial scales are more appropriate for reserve design and management, there is a scarcity of published work on local, high-resolution applications of such models. In this work we develop high-resolution habitat models (1 ha) and study habitat preferences (focal points) of Dupont's lark Chersophilus duponti, an endangered shrub-steppe passerine, in the partially overlapping Special Protected Area for birds (SPA) and Important Bird Area (IBA) of "paramos de Layna" (NW Spain), to assess both the adequacy of the reserve's limits and the effect of land-use changes on the species' population size. Both analytical approaches show that the Dupont's lark favours flat areas characterized by small shrubs with bare ground, so that, for example, a conversion of dry crops to shrubs promoted by agri-environment schemes under CAP could increase the population size up to 80%. Although the IBA and SPA are similar in size - as compelled by EU environmental policy - the latter shows rugged topography typically avoided by the species. We further discuss the possible conflict between EU environmental and agricultural policies on the conservation of this species and suggest it can be addressed with our study approach.

AB 1. The spatial distribution of cereal aphids infesting a field of winter wheat during the population establishment, development and decline phases were studied using a field-scale grid of sampling locations.
   2. The distribution of two generalist predators, Pterostichus melanarius and P. madidus, were sampled contemporaneously.
   3. Using spatial analysis by distance indices (SADIE), spatial pattern in the aphid population, predator activity-density, predator hunger and aphid predation was detected and mapped.
   4. We tested the hypothesis that carabids and aphids were spatially associated with one another through predation. Aphid predation by individual beetles was detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and hunger was assessed by measurement of foregut weights.
   5. Initially, there was a strong spatial dissociation between aphids and P. melanarius activity-density. While the aphid population was increasing there was a strong spatial association between aphids and both P. melanarius and P. madidus activity-density. During aphid population decline there was no measurable association between aphids and predatory activity-density.
   6. Predation of aphids was strongly locally associated with predator activity-density on all sample dates for both predator species, regardless of the association with aphid spatial pattern.
   7. Areas within the field most isolated from P. melanarius predation had the highest rates of aphid population increase.
   8. Although the proportion of P. melanarius individuals consuming aphids was much lower compared to P. madidus, it was concluded that it was a more effective biological control agent due to its comparative abundance.

AB Human activities within fluvial corridors and surrounding landscapes have persistently stressed riparian ecosystems, particularly in Iberian Mediterranean-type streams. The impact of human disturbance relative to natural environmental factors in shaping riparian vegetation is still poorly understood. Both regional variables (such as altitude and precipitation), and site-specific characteristics (such as substrate and riverbank modifications) were analysed as potential determinants of riparian vegetation patterning to determine the relative influences of the diverse land-use types and environmental factors on the composition (including floristic species richness and percentage cover of trees, shrubs and woody climbers) and integrity (width of riparian woods and patterns of longitudinal continuity) of riparian woods in eight river basins of the Tagus fluvial system (Portugal). There was patchy establishment of riparian woods, with generally low average width and low species richness, as well as significant inter-basin differences and upstream-downstream variations in riparian features. Species distribution was clearly determined by environmental factors, such as human disturbance on the riverbanks and geological background, and the environmental variables and the land use in the river valley partially explained the integrity of riparian woody vegetation. The results highlight the predictive capability of reach-level features; it appears that, linked with the geomorphological and climate context, small-scale human disturbances on riparian corridors play a major role in explaining the remaining biological variability.

AB We tested whether the landscape occupancy and local population size of the monophagous butterfly Cupido minimus can be predicted by patch size and isolation of its host plant or by other habitat characteristics. C mininius and its larval food plant Anthyllis vulneraria are classified as rare and endangered in northern Germany. Adults of C minimus are ranked as the most sedentary butterfly species in northern Europe.
   Around the city of Gottingen (Germany), we checked all known locations of A. vulneraria (n = 70) in June 2002 for butterfly eggs (in blooming flowerheads) and adult butterflies (within 20-min transects).
   We found eggs of C minimus or a high number of adults (>7) in all habitats with A. vulneraria (which are calcareous grasslands) even when isolated up to 2-4 km. In multiple regression analyses, local population size of adult butterflies was positively related to the cover of its larval food plant A. vulneraria explaining 65% of variance. Cover of A. vulneraria increased with increasing habitat area and increasing cover of plant species in flower and decreased with increasing cover of shrub layer. Habitat isolation and further factors describing habitat quality were not related to C. minimus population size or cover of its larval food plant.
   The results suggest that dispersal ability of C minimus is greater than expected and that management should focus to increase A. vulneraria patches. For conservation, low impact grazing once a year and removing of excessive shrubs in winter seems to be the most appropriate strategies. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Capsule Jays Garrulus glandarius are the most common predators, but carnivorous mammals and some other species also predate nests.
   Aim To uncover the mechanisms and consequences of nest predation.
   Methods I used video-recording equipment to record the fates of 132 nests of Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla over a three-year period. An additional 69 nests without video-recording equipment were monitored for comparison.
   Results I found a total of 11 species depredating eggs and young of Blackcap. The main predator was Jay, which hunted during the day and was responsible for 21% of nest fates and 46% of nest losses. Many other predators were recorded, mainly carnivorous mammals (Stone Marten Martes foina, Red Fox Vulpes vulpes, Least Weasel Mustela nivalis), which hunted from dusk until dawn and accounted for 25% of nest losses. Wild Boar Sus scrofa and Tawny Owl Strix aluco also predated nests. Whereas mammals needed up to 15 minutes at a nest to consume nest contents, Jays stayed only a few seconds to remove eggs or young, often taking them one by one. When scared off, adults returned to the nest within 15 minutes. Nests were abandoned if only one egg or no young were left and the adults spent up to nine hours and 12 visits before abandoning the nest completely. The overall impact of the video equipment on nest success was low.
   Conclusion This study underlines the potential of video recording in science and management and the method is recommended for studies on other open-cup-nesting songbirds.

AB Scientists are increasingly challenged by the call to develop more effective methods for working across disciplines in landscape analysis projects. The aim of this study was to improve our understanding of the barriers and facilitators to integration of perspectives across disciplinary and organizational boundaries. Two research projects with similar objectives served as cases. The projects were the assessment phase of the North American Interior Columbia River Basin Ecosystem Management Project and the Danish Boundaries in the Landscape. An inductive research design using qualitative data analysis methods was applied. Data sources included in-depth interviews, observations, and archival documents. Comparison of the two research projects, each conducted in a different western culture, revealed a set of similar barriers to cooperation and integration: individual-based, group-based, group- and individual-based, and organization culture-based boundaries. In three of the four boundary categories, barriers in one project were identified as facilitators in the other project. Furthermore, there were also barriers and facilitators that were only listed in one of the projects. Differences in barriers and facilitators in the two projects may be related to the scope, size, and political context of the projects, as well as the differences in national culture. We conclude the paper with a set of recommendations to scientists working across disciplines in landscape level assessments. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Six variable microsatellite loci were used to examine genetic structuring in the closely related shy albatross (Thalassarche cauta) and white-capped albatross (T. steadi). First, levels of genetic differentiation between the species, and among three populations within each species, were analysed using AMOVA, F-ST and R-ST. We found high levels of genetic structuring and detected many unshared alleles between the species, which provide strong evidence against any contemporary gene flow between them. Within each species, shy albatross populations were found to be genetically distinct whereas white-capped albatross populations were undifferentiated, which implies that dispersal events are much rarer in the former than in the latter. These results formed the basis for the recommendation that the three white-capped albatross populations (as a whole) and each shy albatross population be treated as separate units for conservation. Second, levels of genetic diversity and allelic patterns in shy and white-capped albatrosses were assessed for whether they support earlier mtDNA results suggesting that shy albatrosses arose through range expansion of white-capped albatrosses. All measures indicated lower genetic diversity within shy albatrosses than within white-capped albatrosses and upheld the hypothesis that shy albatrosses were founded by white-capped albatrosses.

AB Spatio-temporal variability in assemblages of pelagic fish in Chesapeake Bay from 1995 to 2000 was documented based on midwater trawl surveys conducted three times annually (April, July, and October). Numerically dominant pelagic and benthopelagic fishes, 30-256mm TL, were included in the analysis. Species assemblages, diversity indices, biomass distributions, and a correspondence analysis revealed that physical forcing, primarily driven by freshwater input, shaped the structure of fish communities, both annually and regionally. But, seasonal succession occurred, with adults dominating in the spring and recruited juveniles dominating in the fall. The dominant species were bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli), Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), white perch (Morone americana), spot (Leiostomus xanthurus), weakfish (Cynoscion regalis), and Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus). Young-of-the-year (YOY) and age-1+ fish were concentrated in different regions and different seasons. A correspondence analysis showed that salinity was the most important environmental factor explaining annual differences in the upbay-downbay gradients in fish community structure. In 1997-2000, following a surge of freshwater input and nutrient loadings in 1996, October baywide fish biomass increased by 120% and mean baywide dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration below the pycnocline in summer decreased by 30%. These interannual variabilities in baywide fish biomass and mean DO suggest a relationship between bay plankton productivity and fish production. Species composition shifted markedly in 1996 when YOY and age-1+ anadromous fishes became dominant, but returned progressively in subsequent years to the usual structure in which bay anchovy and other polyhaline species were dominant.

AB The multiscale distribution of macroinvertebrate assemblages may correspond to the hierarchical arrangement of river systems because geomorphological processes manifest characteristic environmental conditions at different scales. Macroinvertebrates were sampled according to a nested hierarchical design incorporating 4 geomorphologically derived scales: catchment, zone, reach, and riffle. Analysis of Similarity, mean similarity dendrograms, and nested analysis of variance were used to determine the scale(s) at which macroinvertebrate assemblages differed. Macroinvertebrate assemblages were similar among riffles within a reach, but were dissimilar at the zone and catchment scales. There also was a regional-scale pattern of macroinvertebrate distribution that was larger than the geomorphologically derived catchment scale. Subsequent partitioning of macroinvertebrate data into regions revealed a relationship between macroinvertebrate distribution and the catchment and zone scales of river system organization. Consideration of the hierarchical organization of river systems from a purely physical perspective may fail to encompass scales relevant to the biota, indicating that biological information should be included as a primary hierarchical component in multiscale stream studies.

AB Phylogeographic analyses can yield valuable insights into the geographic and historical contexts of contact and hybridization between taxa. Two species of char (Salmonidae), Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma) and bull trout (S. confluentus) have largely parapatric distributions in watersheds of northwestern North America. They are, however, sympatric in several localities and hybridization and some introgression occurs across a broad area of contact. We conducted a comparative phylogenetic analysis of Dolly Varden and bull trout to gain a historical perspective of hybridization between these species and to test for footprints of historical introgression. We resolved two major Dolly Varden mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) clades (with 1.4-2.2% sequence divergence between haplotypes) that had different geographical distributions. Clade N is distributed across most of the range of Dolly Varden, from southern British Columbia through to the Kuril Islands in Asia. Clade S had a much more limited distribution, from Washington state, at the southern limit of the Dolly Varden range, to the middle of Vancouver Island. The distribution and inferred ages of the mtDNA clades suggested that Dolly Varden survived the Wisconsinan glaciation in a previously unsuspected refuge south of the ice sheet, and that Dolly Varden and bull trout were probably in continuous contact over most of the last 100,000 years. When bull trout were included in the phylogenetic analysis, however, the mtDNA of neither species was monophyletic: Clade S Dolly Varden clustered within the bull trout mtDNA clade. This pattern was discordant with two nuclear phylogenies produced (growth hormone 2 and rRNA internal transcribed sequence 1), in which Dolly Varden and bull trout were reciprocally monophyletic. This discordance between mtDNA- and nDNA-based phylogenies indicates that historical introgression of bull trout mtDNA into Dolly Varden occurred. Percent sequence divergence within these introgressed Dolly Varden (clade S) was 0.2-0.6%, implying that the introgression occurred prior to the most recent glaciation. Our analysis and other evidence of contact between divergent lineages in northwestern North America strongly suggests that the area may be the site of previously unsuspected suture zones of aquatic biotas.

AB Acanthocephalan parasites are known to alter the reproductive biology and physiology of their hosts in various ways. In this study we investigated the influence of two acanthocephalan parasites. Pomphorhynchus laevis and Polymorphus minutus, on the fecundity and pairing success of female Gammarus pulex. The results show that P. laevis and P. minutus affect female intermediate host reproduction in different ways. Females infected with P. minutus were totally castrated. whereas those infected with P. laevis only showed reduced fecundity. The oocytes of P. laevis-infected females showed a similar structure to those of uninfected females, although infected females had a higher proportion of oocytes that had failed to reach complete maturity. In comparison. the oocytes of P. minutus-infected females demonstrate a clearly altered structure that suggests a major disruption to the process of vitellogenesis. In the field. males paired more frequently with uninfected females than with infected ones. and is a stronger effect for P. minutus-infected females than P. laevis-infected females. We suggest that the difference in pairing success of P. minutus-infected and P. laevis-infected females is a direct result of the different effects that the two parasites have on female fecundity.

AB Populations of endemic soil entomopathogens (nematodes and fungi) were monitored in vegetable production systems incorporating varying degrees of sustainable practices in Fletcher, NC. Two tillage types (conventional plow and disk versus conservation tillage), two input approaches (chemically versus biologically based), and two cropping schedules (continuous tomato versus 3-yr rotation of corn, cucumber, cabbage, and tomato) were employed in large plots from 1995 to 1998. A Galleria mellonella (L.) trap bioassay was used to identify and monitor activity of Steinernema carpocapsae, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, Beauveria bassiana, and Metarhizium anisopliae populations during the vegetable growing season (April-September). Seasonal detection of entomopathogens was significantly higher in conservation compared with conventional tillage systems. The strip-till operation did not affect levels of detection of S. carpocapsae. Pesticide use significantly reduced detection of entomopathogenic fungi. Type of ground cover significantly affected temperature in the upper 12 cm of soil; highest soil temperatures were observed under black plastic mulch and bare ground, whereas lowest temperatures were observed under rye mulch and clover intercrop. The high soil temperatures associated with certain ground covers may have reduced entomopathogen detection or survival. Although type of tillage appeared to be the primary factor affecting survival of endemic soil entomopathogens in our system, other factors, such as pesticide use and type of ground cover, can negate the positive effects of strip-tillage.

AB In order to investigate which biotic and abiotic factors may have an impact on the community composition of bacterioplankton, five mesotrophic lakes were studied. The composition of the bacterioplankton communities was determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rDNA. Multivariate statistical analyses of the gel patterns, in relation to each other and to the chemical, biological, and physical parameters of the lakes, were performed. The analyses showed that the import of allochthonous bacteria and the interaction with other plankton organisms (for example, grazing) in the lakes probably had an impact on the composition of the communities.

AB Mechanisms underlying competitive interactions are important in understanding the structure of planktonic communities, particularly the coexistence of similar species. Here we present experimental results of exploitative competition among three sympatric sibling species of the Brachionus plicatilis complex for two differently-sized species of food microalgae. These three rotifer species are to be found in seasonal succession in brackish ponds on the Spanish Mediterranean coast; they can, however, co-occur for long periods. The functional and numerical responses of the three Brachionus species to both food microalgae, although similar, differed. Neither rotifer population growth nor grazing rates showed a clear positive correlation between rotifer and alga sizes. Tilman's models were applied to these results in order to predict the outcome of competition in two rotifer, two resources systems. For testing predictions and addressing the possibility of rotifer coexistence, we performed pairwise competition experiments in semicontinuous cultures, which introduces periodic disturbance as an additional factor. Results confirmed the pattern expected from Tilman's models regarding the competitive superiority of each rotifer species, when food composition was biased toward one of the two resources. This shows the relevance of the food threshold concept to predict the superior competitor. However, coexistence of rotifers was found in conditions in which Tilman's models had predicted an unstable equilibrium, with the winning species depending on the initial conditions. We hypothesize that variance in food availability mediated coexistence. Our results suggest that both food partitioning and disturbance are important in explaining the coexistence of these sibling species in nature.

AB Where both sexes invest substantially in offspring, both females and males should discriminate between potential partners when choosing mates. The degree of choosiness should relate to the costs of choice and to the potential benefits to be gained. We measured offspring quality from experimentally staged matings with preferred and non-preferred partners in a sex-role-reversed pipefish, Syngnathus typhle L. Here, a substantial male investment in offspring results in a lower potential reproductive rate in males than in females, and access to males limits female reproductive success rather than vice versa. Thus, males are choosier than females and females compete more intensely? over mates than do males. Broods from preferred matings were superior at escaping predation, when either males or females were allowed to choose a partner. However, only 'choosing' females benefited in terns of faster-growing offspring. Our results have important implications for mate-choice research: here we show that even the more competitive and less choosy sex may contribute significantly to sexual selection through mate choice.

AB The long-finned pilot whale, Globicephala melas, is a social, pelagic odontocete distributed widely in the cold temperate waters of the North Atlantic. Despite genetic, morphometric, physiological and observational studies, it remains unclear whether any population substructure exists. We have used eight highly polymorphic microsatellite loci to analyse samples from four disparate sampling sites: USA East Coast (Cape Cod), West Greenland, the Faeroe Islands and the UK. Our results indicate that substructure does exist, and is particularly pronounced between West Greenland and other sites. The magnitudes of the various pairwise comparisons do not support a simple isolation-by-distance model. Instead, the patterns of genetic differentiation suggest that population isolation occurs between areas of the ocean which differ in sea surface temperature. Such a mechanism is supported by the observation that temperature is a primary factor determining the relative distributions of two short-finned pilot whale (G. macrorhynchus) populations off the Pacific coast of Japan.

AB Sustaining ecosystem services important to humans while providing a dependable water supply for agriculture and urban needs is a major challenge raced by managers of human-dominated watersheds. Modification of natural flow regimes alters the abundance and composition of native plant and animal communities, affecting ecosystem services such as water storage and nutrient cycling that depend on particular species or functional groups. Because complete restoration of natural hydrology is generally not an option in human-dominated watersheds, there is a need to determine which specific flow manipulations are necessary to restore species-dependent ecosystem services in particular systems. Mere we propose a framework for predicting ecological consequences of flow manipulations that is based on the role of hydrology in linking population, community, and ecosystem processes. We use a case-study approach to examine how interactions among the flow regime and species' functional traits help organize local biotic communities and generate alternate states of ecosystem functioning. Results indicate the importance of integrating hydrology and biology to predict ecological consequences of flow regime manipulations and the need to apply general flow-restoration principles on a case-by-case basis.

AB The validity of methods used to measure diet selection has often been overlooked. This paper examines problems associated with the scale of food availability, perception of food by animals, measures of dietary composition, measures of food availability and diet selection indices. Most problems can be reduced by the choice of techniques consistent with the objective and degree of accuracy required, both of which should be clearly stated. In particular, the measured sample of food utilized by the animal should be spatially and temporally matched to the scale of food availability under consideration. In the past, researchers have tended to overstate the accuracy of their results. We support the view that the most appropriate analysis of diet selection is ranking food items in order of selection according to the value of the selection index.

AB A plant sociological survey of tall-tussock grasslands in the Mackenzie country was repeated after an interval of 26-28 years.  Changes in physiognomy of the grasslands which have been inferred from earlier studies have been found to be continuing on many sites.  A noteworthy feature of most sites has been a reduction in number of indigenous species found.  An increase in abundance of Hieracium pilosella or H. praealtum has occurred at most sites.  About 140 species and 9 variables from 53 sites were interrelated in a direct unimodal ordination (canonical correspondence analysis).  Ordination results of the 1960s and the 1989 data were compared and interpreted with respect to spread of Hieracium pilosella and H. praealtum.  The dynamics of Hieracium infestation was studied within changing community structure.  A distinct trend is demonstrated of increasing infestation with increasing grassland degradation.

AB Accurately forecasting the response of global biota to warming is a fundamental challenge for ecology in the Anthropocene. Within-species variation in thermal sensitivity, caused by phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation of thermal limits, is often overlooked in assessments of species responses to warming. Despite this, implicit assumptions of thermal niche conservatism or adaptation and plasticity at the species level permeate the literature with potentially important implications for predictions of warming impacts at the population level. Here we review how these attributes interact with the spatial and temporal context of ocean warming to influence the vulnerability of marine organisms. We identify a broad spectrum of thermal sensitivities among marine organisms, particularly in central and cool-edge populations of species distributions. These are characterized by generally low sensitivity in organisms with conserved thermal niches, to high sensitivity for organisms with locally adapted thermal niches. Important differences in thermal sensitivity among marine taxa suggest that warming could adversely affect benthic primary producers sooner than less vulnerable higher trophic groups. Embracing the spatial, temporal and biological context of within-species variation in thermal physiology helps explain observed impacts of ocean warming and can improve forecasts of climate change vulnerability in marine systems.
   This article is part of the theme issue 'Physiological diversity, biodiversity patterns and global climate change: testing key hypotheses involving temperature and oxygen'.

AB Aim Although species distribution models (SDMs) traditionally link species occurrences to free-air temperature data at coarse spatio-temporal resolution, the distribution of organisms might instead be driven by temperatures more proximal to their habitats. Several solutions are currently available, such as downscaled or interpolated coarse-grained free-air temperatures, satellite-measured land surface temperatures (LST) or in-situ-measured soil temperatures. A comprehensive comparison of temperature data sources and their performance in SDMs is, however, currently lacking. Location Northern Scandinavia. Time period 1970-2017. Major taxa studied Higher plants. Methods We evaluated different sources of temperature data (WorldClim, CHELSA, MODIS, E-OBS, topoclimate and soil temperature from miniature data loggers), differing in spatial resolution (from 1 '' to 0.1 degrees), measurement focus (free-air, ground-surface or soil temperature) and temporal extent (year-long versus long-term averages), and used them to fit SDMs for 50 plant species with different growth forms in a high-latitudinal mountain region. Results Differences between these temperature data sources originating from measurement focus and temporal extent overshadow the effects of temporal climatic differences and spatio-temporal resolution, with elevational lapse rates ranging from -0.6 degrees C per 100 m for long-term free-air temperature data to -0.2 degrees C per 100 m for in-situ soil temperatures. Most importantly, we found that the performance of the temperature data in SDMs depended on the growth forms of species. The use of in-situ soil temperatures improved the explanatory power of our SDMs (R-2 on average +16%), especially for forbs and graminoids (R-2 +24 and +21% on average, respectively) compared with the other data sources. Main conclusions We suggest that future studies using SDMs should use the temperature dataset that best reflects the ecology of the species, rather than automatically using coarse-grained data from WorldClim or CHELSA.

AB The reported progressive change of vegetation activity along elevational gradients has important aesthetic and conservation values. With climate change, cooler locations are suggested to warm faster than warmer ones, raising concerns of a more homogenized landscape along the elevation. Here, we use global satellite data to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of the elevational gradient (EG) in vegetation greenness (NDVImax3), spring (SOS) and autumn phenology (EOS) during 1982-2015. Although we find clear geographical patterns of the EG in NDVImax3 and SOS, there are no prevalent trends of vegetation homogenization or phenology synchronization along elevational gradients. Possible mechanisms, including spatially heterogeneous temperature lapse rate changes, different vegetation sensitivities to climate change, and human disturbances, may play diverse roles across different regions. Our finding of mixed EG trends and no general rules controlling EG dynamics poses challenges for mitigating possible adverse impacts of climate change on mountainous biological diversity and ecosystem services.

AB Colonization of new ecological niches has triggered large adaptive radiations. Although some lineages have made use of such opportunities, not all do so. The factors causing this variation among lineages are largely unknown. Here, we show that deficiency in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an essential w-3 fatty acid, can constrain freshwater colonization by marine fishes. Our genomic analyses revealed multiple independent duplications of the fatty acid desaturase gene Fads2 in stickleback lineages that subsequently colonized and radiated in freshwater habitats, but not in close relatives that failed to colonize. Transgenic manipulation of Fads2 in marine stickleback increased their ability to synthesize DHA and survive on DHA-deficient diets. Multiple freshwater ray-finned fishes also show a convergent increase in Fads2 copies, indicating its key role in freshwater colonization.

AB What kind of genetic variation contributes the most to adaptation is a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. By resequencing genomes of 80 individuals, we inferred the origin of genomic variants associated with a complex adaptive syndrome involving multiple quantitative traits, namely, adaptation between high and low altitudes, in the vinous-throated parrotbill (Sinosuthora webbiana) in Taiwan. By comparing these variants with those in the Asian mainland population, we revealed standing variation in 24 noncoding genomic regions to be the predominant genetic source of adaptation. Parrotbills at both high and low altitudes exhibited signatures of recent selection, suggesting that not only the front but also the trailing edges of postglacial expanding populations could be subjected to environmental stresses. This study verifies and quantifies the importance of standing variation in adaptation in a cohort of genes, illustrating that the evolutionary potential of a population depends significantly on its preexisting genetic diversity. These findings provide important context for understanding adaptation and conservation of species in the Anthropocene.

AB Genetic erosion is a major threat to biodiversity because it can reduce fitness and ultimately contribute to the extinction of populations. Here, we explore the use of quantitative metrics to detect and monitor genetic erosion. Monitoring systems should not only characterize the mechanisms and drivers of genetic erosion (inbreeding, genetic drift, demographic instability, population fragmentation, introgressive hybridization, selection) but also its consequences (inbreeding and outbreeding depression, emergence of large-effect detrimental alleles, maladaptation and loss of adaptability). Technological advances in genomics now allow the production of data the can be measured by new metrics with improved precision, increased efficiency and the potential to discriminate between neutral diversity (shaped mainly by population size and gene flow) and functional/adaptive diversity (shaped mainly by selection), allowing the assessment of management-relevant genetic markers. The requirements of such studies in terms of sample size and marker density largely depend on the kind of population monitored, the questions to be answered and the metrics employed. We discuss prospects for the integration of this new information and metrics into conservation monitoring programmes.

AB 1. Plant traits can be used to predict ecosystem responses to environmental change using a response-effect trait framework. To do this, appropriate traits must be identified that explain a species' influence on ecosystem function (effect traits) and the response of those species to environmental change (response traits). Response traits are often identified and measured along gradients in plant resources, such as water availability; however, precipitation explains very little variation in most plant traits globally. Given the strong relationship between plant traits and ecosystem functions, such as net primary productivity (NPP), and between NPP and precipitation, the lack of correlation between precipitation and plant traits is surprising.
   2. We address this issue through a systematic review of >500 published studies that describe plant trait responses to altered water availability. The overarching goal of this review was to identify potential causes for the weak relationship between commonly measured plant traits and water availability so that we may identify more appropriate response traits.
   3. We attribute weak trait-precipitation relationships to an improper selection of traits (e.g., nonhydraulic traits) and a lack of trait-based approaches that adjust for trait variation within communities (only 4% of studies measure community-weighted traits). We then highlight the mechanistic value of hydraulic traits as more appropriate response traits with regard to precipitation, which should be included in future community-scale trait surveys.
   4. based ecology has the potential to improve predictions of ecosystem responses to predicted changes in precipitation; however, this predictive power depends heavily on the identification of reliable response and effect traits. To this end, trait surveys could be improved by a selection of traits that reflect physiological functions directly related to water availability with traits weighted by species relative abundance.

AB The functional trait approach has, as a central tenet, that plant traits are functional and shape individual performance, but this has rarely been tested in the field. Here, we tested the individual-based trait approach in a hyperdiverse Amazonian tropical rainforest and evaluated intraspecific variation in trait values, plant strategies at the individual level, and whether traits are functional and predict individual performance.
   We evaluated > 1300 tree saplings belonging to > 383 species, measured 25 traits related to growth and defense, and evaluated the effects of environmental conditions, plant size, and traits on stem growth.
   A total of 44% of the trait variation was observed within species, indicating a strong potential for acclimation. Individuals showed two strategy spectra, related to tissue toughness and organ size vs leaf display. In this nutrient- and light-limited forest, traits measured at the individual level were surprisingly poor predictors of individual growth performance because of convergence of traits and growth rates.
   Functional trait approaches based on individuals or species are conceptually fundamentally different: the species-based approach focuses on the potential and the individual-based approach on the realized traits and growth rates. Counterintuitively, the individual approach leads to a poor prediction of individual performance, although it provides a more realistic view on community dynamics.

AB Wild boar populations are expanding throughout the world and intruding into periurban and urban areas. In the last years, wild boar has colonized several European cities, including our study area, the city of Barcelona. It is required to identify the main factors driving wild boar into urban areas prior to establish management measures. We built Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) using 3148 wild boar presences registered in the urban area of Barcelona from 2010 to 2014 to identify the variables correlated with these presences. The variables analysed included proxies for distance to source population, urban food resources, climate and urban habitat structure.
   Wild boars enter the urban area from close natural habitat using corridors such as streams, preferably in fragmented urban environment, looking for food such as urban green areas or dry pet food from cat colonies. Wild boar presence is higher in spring possibly due to the births of piglets and the dispersion of yearlings during that season, and also when natural resources in the Mediterranean habitat fail to satisfy the nutritional requirements of the wild boar population during the summer season.
   Management measures derived from this study are currently being applied in the city of Barcelona, including vegetation clearings in the wild boar entrance areas and an awareness campaign aimed at reducing the anthropogenic food availability for wild boars. The methodology used can be applied to other cities with wild boar or even other wildlife species issues. The comparison between the factors attracting wild boars into different urban areas would be helpful to understand the global phenomenon. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Spatially and temporally continuous estimation of plant photosynthetic carbon fixation (or gross primary production, GPP) is crucial to our understanding of the global carbon cycle and the impact of climate change. Besides spatial, seasonal and interannual variations, GPP also exhibits strong diurnal variations. Satellite retrieved solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) provides a spatially continuous, but temporally discrete measurement of plant photosynthesis, and has the potential to be used to estimate GPP at global scale. However, it remains unclear whether the seasonal time series of SIF snapshots taken at a fixed time of the day can be used to infer daily total GPP variation at spatial and seasonal scales. In this study, we first used GPP estimates from 135 eddy covariance flux sites, covering a wide range of geographic locations and biome types, to investigate the relationship between the instantaneous GPP (GPP(inst)) and daily GPP (GPP(daily)) on the seasonal course for different times of the day. Latitudinal and diurnal patterns were found to correspond to variations in photo-synthetically active radiation (PAR) and light use efficiency (LUE), respectively. We then used the Soil-Canopy Observation Photosynthesis and Energy Balance (SCOPE) model and the FluxCom GPP product to investigate the instantaneous and daily SIF-GPP relationships at five flux tower sites along a latitudinal gradient and at a global scale for different biome types. The results showed that daily SIF had a stronger linear correlation with daily GPP than instantaneous SIF at the seasonal scale, with an instantaneous to daily SIF conversion factor following the latitudinal and seasonal pattern driven by PAR. Our study highlights the necessity to take the latitudinal and diurnal factors into consideration for SIF-GPP relationship analyses or for physiological phenology analyses based on SIF.

AB Climate change is expected to cause geographic shifts in tree species' ranges, but such shifts may not keep pace with climate changes because seed dispersal distances are often limited and competition-induced changes in community composition can be relatively slow. Disturbances may speed changes in community composition, but the interactions among climate change, disturbance and competitive interactions to produce range shifts are poorly understood. We used a physiologically based mechanistic landscape model to study these interactions in the northeastern United States. We designed a series of disturbance scenarios to represent varied disturbance regimes in terms of both disturbance extent and intensity. We simulated forest succession by incorporating climate change under a high-emissions future, disturbances, seed dispersal, and competition using the landscape model parameterized with forest inventory data. Tree species range boundary shifts in the next century were quantified as the change in the location of the 5th (the trailing edge) and 95th (the leading edge) percentiles of the spatial distribution of simulated species. Simulated tree species range boundary shifts in New England over the next century were far below (usually < 20 km) that required to track the velocity of temperature change (usually more than 110 km over 100 years) under a high-emissions scenario. Simulated species` ranges shifted northward at both the leading edge (northern boundary) and trailing edge (southern boundary). Disturbances may expedite species' recruitment into new sites, but they had little effect on the velocity of simulated range boundary shifts. Range shifts at the trailing edge tended to be associated with photosynthetic capacity, competitive ability for light and seed dispersal ability, whereas shifts at the leading edge were associated only with photosynthetic capacity and competition for light. This study underscores the importance of understanding the role of interspecific competition and disturbance when studying tree range shifts.

AB Most processes within organisms, and most interactions between organisms and their environment, have distinct time profiles. The temporal coordination of such processes is crucial across levels of biological organization, but disciplines differ widely in their approaches to study timing. Such differences are accentuated between ecologists, who are centrally concerned with a holistic view of an organism in relation to its external environment, and chronobiologists, who emphasize internal timekeeping within an organism and the mechanisms of its adjustment to the environment. We argue that ecological and chronobiological perspectives are complementary, and that studies at the intersection will enable both fields to jointly overcome obstacles that currently hinder progress. However, to achieve this integration, we first have to cross some conceptual barriers, clarifying prohibitively inaccessible terminologies. We critically assess main assumptions and concepts in either field, as well as their common interests. Both approaches intersect in their need to understand the extent and regulation of temporal plasticity, and in the concept of 'chronotype', i.e. the characteristic temporal properties of individuals which are the targets of natural and sexual selection. We then highlight promising developments, point out open questions, acknowledge difficulties and propose directions for further integration of ecological and chronobiological perspectives through Wild Clock research.
   This article is part of the themed issue 'Wild Clocks: integrating chronobiology and ecology to understand timekeeping in free-living animals'.

AB There is renewed interest in how transgenerational environmental effects, including epigenetic inheritance, contribute to adaptive evolution. The contribution of across-generation plasticity to adaptation, however, needs to be evaluated within the context of within-generation plasticity, which is often proposed to contribute more efficiently to adaptation because of the potentially greater accuracy of progeny than parental cues to predict progeny selective environments. We highlight recent empirical studies of transgenerational plasticity, and find that they do not consistently support predictions based on the higher predictive ability of progeny environmental cues. Wediscuss these findings within the context of the relative predictive ability of maternal and progeny cues, costs and constraints of plasticity in parental and progeny generations, and the dynamic nature of the adaptive value of within-and across-generation plasticity that varies with the process of adaptation itself. Such contingent and dynamically variable selection could account for the diversity of patterns of within-and across-generation plasticity observed in nature, and can influence the adaptive value of the persistence of environmental effects across generations.

AB Ecological carrying capacity (ECC) is an important indicator in evaluating sustainable development in an ecosystem. However, a standard method to systematically evaluate an ecosystem's carrying capacity, particularly marine ecosystems, is rarely existent. This study proposes a general conceptual model for systematic evaluation of the carrying capacity of marine ecosystems. The proposed model involves (1) identification of carriers, (2) determination of carrying objects and (3) construction of evaluation index framework. An index system was developed based on a case study conducted in Dongtou Islands in China. Moreover, this case study demonstrates the application of the conceptual model in ECC evaluation.

AB Undoubtedly, sustainable development has inspired a generation of scholars and practitioners in different disciplines into a quest for the immense opportunities created by the development of sustainable urban forms for human settlements that will enable built environments to function in a more constructive and efficient way. However, there are still significant challenges that need to be addressed and overcome. The issue of such forms has been problematic and difficult to deal with, particularly in relation to the evaluation and improvement of their contribution to the goals of sustainable development. As it is an urban world where the informational and physical landscapes are increasingly being merged, sustainable urban forms need to embrace and leverage what current and future ICT has to offer as innovative solutions and sophisticated methods so as to thrive-i.e. advance their contribution to sustainability. The need for ICT of the new wave of computing to be embedded in such forms is underpinned by the recognition that urban sustainability applications are deemed of high relevance to the contemporary research agenda of computing and ICT. To unlock and exploit the underlying potential, the field of sustainable urban planning is required to extend its boundaries and broaden its horizons beyond the ambit of the built form of cities to include technological innovation opportunities. This paper explores and substantiates the real potential of ICT of the new wave of computing to evaluate and improve the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development. This entails merging big data and contextaware technologies and their applications with the typologies and design concepts of sustainable urban forms to achieve multiple hitherto unrealized goals. In doing so, this paper identifies models of smart sustainable city and their technologies and applications and models of sustainable urban form and their design concepts and typologies. In addition, it addresses the question of how these technologies and applications can be amalgamated with these design concepts and typologies in ways that ultimately evaluate and improve the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development. The overall aim of this paper suits a mix of three methodologies: literature review, thematic analysis, and secondary ( qualitative) data analysis to achieve different but related objectives. The study identifies four technologies and two classes of applications pertaining to models of smart sustainable city as well as three design concepts and four typologies related to models of sustainable urban form. Finally, this paper proposes a Matrix to help scholars and planners in understanding and analyzing how and to what extent the contribution of sustainable urban forms to sustainability can be improved through ICT of the new wave of computing as to the underlying novel technologies and their applications, as well as a data-centric approach into investigating and evaluating this contribution and a simulation method for strategically optimizing it.

AB Eutrophication increases primary production and changes the relative abundance, taxonomic composition and spatial distribution of primary producers within an aquatic ecosystem. The changes in composition and location of resources alter the distribution and flow of energy and biomass throughout the foodweb. Changes in productivity also alter the physico-chemical environment, which has further effects on the biota. Such ecological changes influence the direction and strength of natural and sexual selection experienced by populations. Besides altering selection, they can also erode the habitat gradients and/or behavioural mechanisms that maintain ecological separation and reproductive isolation among species. Consequently, eutrophication of lakes commonly results in reduced ecological specialization as well as genetic and phenotypic homogenization among lakes and among niches within lakes. We argue that the associated loss in functional diversity and niche differentiation may lead to decreased carrying capacity and lower resource-use efficiency by consumers. We show that in central European whitefish species radiations, the functional diversity affected by eutrophication-induced speciation reversal correlates with community-wide trophic transfer efficiency (fisheries yield per unit phosphorus). We take this as an example of how evolutionary dynamics driven by anthropogenic environmental change can have lasting effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

AB Within a large carnivore guild, subordinate competitors (African wild dog, Lycaon pictus, and cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus) might reduce the limiting effects of dominant competitors (lion, Panthera leo, and spotted hyena, Crocuta crocuta) by avoiding them in space, in time, or through patterns of prey selection. Understanding how these competitors cope with one other can inform strategies for their conservation. We tested how mechanisms of niche partitioning promote coexistence by quantifying patterns of prey selection and the use of space and time by all members of the large carnivore guild within Liuwa Plain National Park in western Zambia. Lions and hyenas specialized on wildebeest, whereas wild dogs and cheetahs selected broader diets including smaller and less abundant prey. Spatially, cheetahs showed no detectable avoidance of areas heavily used by dominant competitors, but wild dogs avoided areas heavily used by lions. Temporally, the proportion of kills by lions and hyenas did not detectably differ across four time periods (day, crepuscular, early night, and late night), but wild dogs and especially cheetahs concentrated on time windows that avoided nighttime hunting by lions and hyenas. Our results provide new insight into the conditions under which partitioning may not allow for coexistence for one subordinate species, the African wild dog, while it does for cheetah. Because of differences in responses to dominant competitors, African wild dogs may be more prone to competitive exclusion (local extirpation), particularly in open, uniform ecosystems with simple (often wildebeest dominated) prey communities, where spatial avoidance is difficult.

AB Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a radiation flux emitted by chlorophyll molecules in the red (RSIF) and far red region (FRSIF), and is considered as a potential indicator of the functional state of photosynthesis in remote sensing applications. Recently, ground studies and space observations have demonstrated a strong empirical linear relationship between FRSIF and carbon uptake through photosynthesis (GPP, gross primary production). In this study, we investigated the potential of RSIF and FRSIF to represent the functional status of photosynthesis at canopy level on a wheat crop. RSIF and FRSIF were continuously measured in the O-2-B (SIF687) and O-2-A bands (SIF760) at a high frequency rate from a nadir view at a height of 21 m, simultaneously with carbon uptake using eddy covariance (EC) techniques. The relative fluorescence yield (Fyield) and the photochemical yield were acquired at leaf level using active fluorescence measurements. SIF was normalized with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to derive apparent spectral fluorescence yields (ASFY687, ASFY760). At the diurnal scale, we found limited variations of ASFY687 and ASFY760 during sunny days. We also did not find any link between Fyield and light use efficiency (LUE) derived from EC, which would prevent SIF from indicating LUE changes. The coefficient of determination of the linear regression between SIF and GPP is found to be highly variable, depending on the emission wavelength, the time scale of observation, sky conditions, and the phenological stage. Despite its photosystem II (PSII) origin, SIF687 correlates less than SIF760 with GPP in any cases. The strongest SIF-GPP relationship was found for SIF760 during canopy growth. When canopy is in a steady state, SIF687 and SIF760 are almost as effective as PAR in predicting GPP. Our results imply some constraints in the use of simple linear relationships to infer GPP from SIF, as they are expected to be better predictive with far red SIF for canopies with a high dynamic range of green biomass and a low LUE variation range.

AB Daytime warming and nighttime warming have the potential to influence plant community structure and ecosystem functions. However, their impacts on ecological stability remain largely unexplored. We conducted an eight-year field experiment to compare the effects of daytime and nighttime warming on the temporal stability of a temperate steppe in northern China. Our results showed that the cover and stability of dominant species, stability of subordinate species, and compensatory dynamics among species strongly influenced community-level stability. However, daytime, but not nighttime, warming significantly reduced community temporal stability mainly through the reduction in the abundance of dominant, stable species. These findings demonstrate the differential effects of daytime and nighttime warming on community stability and emphasize the importance of understanding the changes of dominant species for accurately predicting community dynamics under climate warming.

AB Community assembly processes generate shifts in species abundances that influence ecosystem cycling of carbon and nutrients, yet our understanding of assembly remains largely separate from ecosystem-level functioning. Here, we investigate relationships between assembly and changes in microbial metabolism across space and time in hyporheic microbial communities. We pair sampling of two habitat types (i.e., attached and planktonic) through seasonal and sub-hourly hydrologic fluctuation with null modeling and temporally explicit multivariate statistics. We demonstrate that multiple selective pressures imposed by sediment and porewater physicochemistry-integrate to generate changes in microbial community composition at distinct timescales among habitat types. These changes in composition are reflective of contrasting associations of Betaproteobacteria and Thaumarchaeota with ecological selection and with seasonal changes in microbial metabolism. We present a conceptual model based on our results in which metabolism increases when oscillating selective pressures oppose temporally stable selective pressures. Our conceptual model is pertinent to both macrobial and microbial systems experiencing multiple selective pressures and presents an avenue for assimilating community assembly processes into predictions of ecosystem-level functioning.

AB 1. There has been an intense focus on the response of species to environmental changes, and more recently, the interactions of species have been examined in a similar way in order to understand the stability of entire communities and networks of interacting species. As a consequence, ecological networks have been placed in spatial and temporal contexts in order to reveal what may drive network variability. Understanding the spatial and temporal variability of ecological networks, and in particular the underlying forces facilitating changes, seems pertinent in our attempts to understand and anticipate how ecological networks may vary and respond to future environmental scenarios.
   2. Network variability has been studied at widely differing temporal and spatial scales. For example, studies exploring temporal variability ranges from within-season comparisons to comparisons over vast geological time spans, and the spatial extent ranges from the scale of a single pond to global analyses. Here, we highlight the outcomes from such studies and emphasize the identified mechanisms driving spatio-temporal variability in ecological networks. Specifically, we describe how ecological networks vary over different temporal (years, centuries and millennia) and spatial (local, regional and global) scales, discuss how this variability is monitored and identify potential future directions.
   3. Present knowledge allows some tentative generalizations. First, ecological networks tend to exhibit considerable spatial and temporal stability in several macroscopic features (e.g. connectance, nestedness), but studies also show that macroscopic features may change, for example, in relation to mass extinction or steep environmental gradients. Secondly, microscopic features (e.g. individual specialization levels, species roles and partner affiliations), albeit less studied, seem to show strong variability, and in several cases, microscopic instability co-occurs with macroscopic stability. We therefore recommend a stronger focus on this macro-micro interplay and list ideas (e.g. temporal species centrality measures and interaction phenologies), towards expanding the microscopic toolbox of network ecologists.

AB Delaying maize (Zea mays L.) sowing date can diminish grain yields through reductions in the number, size and activity of growing grains (sink strength) and/or reductions in the assimilate supply (source capacity) to grains during the grain filling period. Whether the source capacity or the sink strength is the limiting factor for grain yield in late sown maize still remains unclear. Understanding source-sink relationships is relevant to optimize crop management practices, to identify critical processes for crop modelling and to develop breeding strategies. The objective of this work was to assess the effect of delays in maize sowing date on grain yield components and on the source-sink relationship during the grain filling period. Three well irrigated and fertilized maize field experiments were conducted at Balcarce, Argentina (37 degrees 45' S, 58 degrees 18' W; 130 m a.s.l.) during 2009-10; 2010-11 and 2011-12 cropping seasons. Sowing dates ranged from October to January covering a broad range of the seasonal photo-thermal variation. Grain yield was affected by sowing date and varied from 1680 g m(-2) (early sowings) to 203 gm(-2) (late sowings). Grain number per unit area was reduced proportionally less than weight per grain as sowing date was delayed. Variations in grain yield were related to the harvest index, and were closely associated with dry matter accumulation during the post-silking period. The variation of source capacity was higher than that of sink strength during the grain filling period and the source/sink ratio decreased from early to late sowing dates. Results indicate that crop growth during the grain filling period was limited by the sink strength in early sowing dates and by the photosynthetic source capacity in the late ones.

AB Understanding the role of biodiversity (B) in maintaining ecosystem function (EF) is a foundational scientific goal with applications for resource management and conservation. Two main hypotheses have emerged that address B-EF relationships: niche complementarity (NC) and the mass-ratio (MR) effect. We tested the relative importance of these hypotheses in a subtropical old-growth forest on the island nation of Taiwan for two EFs: aboveground biomass (ABG) and coarse woody productivity (CWP). Functional dispersion (FDis) of eight plant functional traits was used to evaluate complementarity of resource use. Under the NC hypothesis, EF will be positively correlated with FDis. Under the MR hypothesis, EF will be negatively correlated with FDis and will be significantly influenced by community-weighted mean (CWM) trait values. We used path analysis to assess how these two processes (NC and MR) directly influence EF and may contribute indirectly to EF via their influence on canopy packing (stem density). Our results indicate that decreasing functional diversity and a significant influence of CWM traits were linked to increasing AGB for all eight traits in this forest supporting the MR hypothesis. Interestingly, CWP was primarily influenced by NC and MR indirectly via their influence on canopy packing. Maximum height explained more of the variation in both AGB and CWP than any of the other plant functional traits. Together, our results suggest that multiple mechanisms operate simultaneously to influence EF, and understanding their relative importance will help to elucidate the role of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem function.

AB Honeybees might outcompete wild bees by depleting common resources, possibly more so in simplified landscapes where flower-rich habitats have been lost. We tested this by experimentally adding honeybee hives to nine sites while ensuring that ten additional sites were free from hives. The landscape surrounding each geographically separated site either held low (homogeneous landscape) or high (heterogeneous landscape) proportions of semi-natural grassland. Adding honeybees suppressed bumblebee densities in field borders and road verges in homogeneous landscapes whereas no such effect was detected in heterogeneous landscapes. The proportional abundance of bumblebee species with small foraging ranges was lower at honeybee sites than at control sites in heterogeneous landscapes, whereas bumblebee communities in homogeneous landscapes were dominated by a single species with long foraging range irrespective of if honeybees were added or not. We conclude that honeybees can impact bumblebee densities, but that landscape heterogeneity modified this effect.

AB Many tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) trees are capable of foliar water uptake (FWU) during leaf-wetting events. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that maintenance of leaf turgor during periods of fog exposure and soil drought is related to species' FWU capacity.
   We conducted several experiments using apoplastic tracers, deuterium labeling and leaf immersion in water to evaluate differences in FWU among three common TMCF tree species. We also measured the effect of regular fog exposure on the leaf water potential of plants subjected to soil drought and used these data to model species' response to long-term drought.
   All species were able to absorb water through their leaf cuticles and/or trichomes, although the capacity to do so differed between species. During the drought experiment, the species with higher FWU capacity maintained leaf turgor for a longer period when exposed to fog, whereas the species with lower FWU exerted tighter stomatal regulation to maintain leaf turgor. Model results suggest that without fog, species with high FWU are more likely to lose turgor during seasonal droughts.
   We show that leaf-wetting events are essential for trees with high FWU, which tend to be more anisohydric, maintaining leaf turgor during seasonal droughts.

AB Nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) play a crucial role in xylem formation and represent, with water, the main constraint to plant growth. We assessed the relationships between xylogenesis and NSCs in order to (1) verify the variance explained by NSCs and (2) determine the influence of intrinsic (tissue supplying carbon) and extrinsic (water availability and temperature) factors. During 2 years, wood formation was monitored in saplings of black spruce (Picea mariana) subjected to a dry period of about 1 month in June and exposed to different temperature treatments in a greenhouse. In parallel, NSC concentrations were determined by extracting the sugar compounds from two tissues (cambium and inner xylem), both potentially supplying carbon for wood formation. A mixed-effect model was used to assess and quantify the potential relationships. Total xylem cells, illustrating meristematic activity, were modeled as a function of water, sucrose, and D-pinitol (conditional r(2) of 0.79). Water availability was ranked as the most important factor explaining total xylem cell production, while the contribution of carbon was lower. Cambium stopped dividing under water deficit, probably to limit the number of cells remaining in differentiation without an adequate amount of water. By contrast, carbon factors were ranked as most important in explaining the variation in living cells (conditional r(2) of 0.49), highlighting the functional needs during xylem development, followed by the tissue supplying the NSCs (cambium) and water availability. This study precisely demonstrates the role of carbon and water in structural growth expressed as meristematic activity and tissue formation.

AB Urban sprawl is a widely recognized phenomenon in many major cities worldwide and is a significant land use planning and management issue. This process has many impacts on the ecological function and structure of the landscape. In this article, we analyze the effects of urban sprawl on the ecological patterns and processes in the Montreal Metropolitan Region (MMR) between 1966 and 2010. The dispersed sprawl of low-density urban areas within the territory during this period sharply increased the fragmentation of the territory, isolating the few remaining natural spaces and decreasing their ecological connectivity and, ultimately, biodiversity. The results obtained clearly show that land-use changes that occurred in the MMR have caused profound changes in landscape properties, both structurally and functionally, and especially from 1981 to 2010. In 1966, around 45% of the land had a high or very high level of connectivity, and almost 38% in 1981. By 2010 only 6.5% of the landscape was connected and 73% of the territory possessed no or low connectivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A substantial amount of oil & gas products are transported and distributed via pipelines, which can stretch for thousands of kilometers. In British Columbia (BC), Canada, alone there are over 40,000 km of pipelines currently being operated. Because of the adverse environmental impact, public outrage and significant financial losses, the integrity of the pipelines is essential. More than 37 pipe failures per year occur in BC causing liquid spills and gas releases, damaging both property and environment. BC oil & gas commission (BCOGS) has indicated metal loss due to internal corrosion as one of the primary causes of these failures. Therefore, it is of a paramount importance to timely identify pipelines subjected to severe internal corrosion in order to improve corrosion mitigation and pipeline maintenance strategies, thus minimizing the likelihood of failure. To accomplish this task, this paper presents a Bayesian belief network (BBN)-based probabilistic internal corrosion hazard assessment approach for oil & gas pipelines. A cause-effect BBN model has been developed by considering various information, such as analytical corrosion models, expert knowledge and published literature. Multiple corrosion models and failure pressure models have been incorporated into a single flexible network to estimate corrosion defects and associated probability of failure (PoF). This paper also explores the influence of fluid composition and operating conditions on the corrosion rate and PoF. To demonstrate the application of the BBN model, a case study of the Northeastern BC oil & gas pipeline infrastructure is presented. Based on the pipeline's mechanical characteristics and operating conditions, spatial and probabilistic distributions of corrosion defect and PoF have been obtained and visualized with the aid of the Geographic Information System (GIS). The developed BBN model can identify vulnerable pipeline sections and rank them accordingly to enhance the informed decision-making process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Network-based approaches are emerging as valuable tools for the analysis of complex genetic structure in wild and captive populations. NETVIEW P combines data quality control with the construction of population networks through mutual k-nearest neighbours thresholds applied to genome-wide SNPs. The program is cross-platform compatible, open-source and efficiently operates on data ranging from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of SNPs. The pipeline was used for the analysis of pedigree data from simulated (n = 750, SNPs = 1279) and captive silver-lipped pearl oysters (n = 415, SNPs = 1107), wild populations of the European hake from the Atlantic and Mediterranean (n = 834, SNPs = 380) and grey wolves from North America (n = 239, SNPs = 78 255). The population networks effectively visualize large-and fine-scale genetic structure within and between populations, including family-level structure and relationships. NETVIEW P comprises a network-based addition to other population analysis tools and provides user-friendly access to a complex network analysis pipeline through implementation in PYTHON.

AB Recruitment processes are critical components of a plant's life cycle. However, in comparison with later stages in the plant life cycle (e.g. competition among adults), relatively little is known about their contribution to the regulation of plant species distribution. Particularly, little is known about the individual contributions of the three main recruitment processes - germination, seedling survival and seedling growth - to community assembly, while quantitative information on these contributions is essential for a more mechanistic understanding of the regulation of plant species distribution and biodiversity.
   Riparian zones along streams provide a globally-relevant case study for evaluating the importance of the different stages of plant recruitment. The natural hydrological gradients of stream riparian zones are currently being restored after a period of world-wide habitat degradation. To identify how recruitment contributes to vegetation patterns and biodiversity in riparian zones, we carried out field experiments at restored lowland streams. We quantified the germination of introduced seeds, and survival and growth of introduced seedlings of 17 riparian plant species across a gradient from the stream channel to upland.
   The hydrological gradient of riparian zones acted as a strong environmental filter on all three recruitment processes, through imposing an abiotic limitation (excess water) at low elevations and a resource limitation (water shortage) at higher elevations. Other variables, suchas soil organic matter content and nutrient availability, only affected recruitment marginally.
   Species-specific patterns of environmental filtering initiated niche segregation along the riparian gradient during all three recruitment processes, but particularly during germination and seedling growth. These recruitment niches appeared strongly related to indicator values for adult distribution optima, suggesting that at least some riparian plant species may have evolutionary adaptations that promote recruitment under favourable hydrological conditions for adult growth and reproduction.
   Our results suggest that strong environmental filtering during germination and seedling growth plays an important role in determining later adult distributions, by forming the spatial template on which all subsequent processes operate. In addition to well-known mechanisms, such as competitive exclusion at the adult stage, environmental filtering during early recruitment stages already strongly affect plant distribution and diversity.

AB Despite collaborative governance's popularity, whether collaboration improves policy performance remains uncertain. This study assesses the link between collaborative decision making and licensed environmental management protocols in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC's) process for licensing hydropower facilities in the United States. Using results from a previous study of FERC relicensing (Ulibarri, forthcoming), one high-, one medium-, and one low-collaboration case were selected. Using documents including meeting minutes, public comments, and issued licenses, I assessed collaboration and license outputs, then conducted process tracing to examine whether and how differences in collaboration produced differences in license quality. High collaboration resulted in jointly developed and highly implementable operating regimes designed to improve numerous resources, while low collaboration resulted in operating requirements that ignored environmental concerns raised by stakeholders and lacked implementation provisions. These results support the hypothesis that collaboration can improve environmental outcomes, revealing the pragmatic value of collaboration.

AB Future climate change has the potential to increase drought in many regions of the globe, making it essential that land surface models (LSMs) used in coupled climate models realistically capture the drought responses of vegetation. Recent data syntheses show that drought sensitivity varies considerably among plants from different climate zones, but state-of-the-art LSMs currently assume the same drought sensitivity for all vegetation. We tested whether variable drought sensitivities are needed to explain the observed large-scale patterns of drought impact on the carbon, water and energy fluxes. We implemented data-driven drought sensitivities in the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) LSM and evaluated alternative sensitivities across a latitudinal gradient in Europe during the 2003 heatwave. The model predicted an overly abrupt onset of drought unless average soil water potential was calculated with dynamic weighting across soil layers. We found that high drought sensitivity at the most mesic sites, and low drought sensitivity at the most xeric sites, was necessary to accurately model responses during drought. Our results indicate that LSMs will over-estimate drought impacts in drier climates unless different sensitivity of vegetation to drought is taken into account.

AB Herbivorous birds are hypothesized to migrate in spring along a seasonal gradient of plant profitability towards their breeding grounds (green wave hypothesis). For Arctic breeding species in particular, following highly profitable food is important, so that they can replenish resources along the way and arrive in optimal body condition to start breeding early. We compared the timing of migratory movements of Arctic breeding geese on different flyways to examine whether flyways differed in the predictability of spring conditions at stopovers and whether this was reflected in the degree to which birds were following the green wave. Barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) were tracked with solar GPS/ARGOS PTTs from their wintering grounds to breeding sites in Greenland (N=7), Svalbard (N=21) and the Barents Sea (N=12). The numerous stopover sites of all birds were combined into a set of 16 general stopover regions. The predictability of climatic conditions along the flyways was calculated as the correlation and slope between onsets of spring at consecutive stopovers. These values differed between sites, mainly because of the presence or absence of ecological barriers. Goose arrival at stopovers was more closely tied to the local onset of spring when predictability was higher and when geese attempted breeding that year. All birds arrived at early stopovers after the onset of spring and arrived at the breeding grounds before the onset of spring, thus overtaking the green wave. This is in accordance with patterns expected for capital breeders: first, they must come into condition; at intermediate stopovers, arrival with the food quality peak is important to stay in condition, and at the breeding grounds, early arrival is favoured so that hatching of young can coincide with the peak of food quality. Our results suggest that a chain of correlations between climatic conditions at subsequent stopovers enables geese to closely track the green wave. However, the birds' precision of migratory timing seems uninfluenced by ecological barriers, indicating partly fixed migration schedules. These might become non-optimal due to climate warming and preclude accurate timing of long-distance migrants in the future.

TI Symbiont-Supplemented Maternal Investment Underpinning Host's Ecological
   Adaptation
SO CURRENT BIOLOGY
LA English

AB Maternal investment for offspring's growth and survival is widespread among diverse organisms [1-3]. Vertical symbiont transmission via maternal passage is also pivotal for offspring's growth and survival in many organisms [4-6]. Hence, it is expected that vertical symbiont transmission may coevolve with various organismal traits concerning maternal investment in offspring. Here we report a novel phenotypic syndrome entailing morphological, histological, behavioral, and ecological specializations for maternal investment and vertical symbiont transmission in stinkbugs of the family Urostylididae [7-9]. Adult females develop huge ovaries exaggerated for polysaccharide excretion, possess novel ovipositor-associated organs for vertical transmission of a bacterial symbiont ("Candidatus Tachikawaea gelatinosa"), and lay eggs covered with voluminous symbiont-supplemented jelly. Newborns hatch in midwinter, feed solely on the jelly, acquire the symbiont, and grow during winter. In spring, the insects start feeding on plant sap, wherein the symbiont localizes to a specialized midgut region and supplies essential amino acids deficient in the host's diet. The reduced symbiont genome and host-symbiont co-speciation indicate their obligate association over evolutionary time. Experimental deprivation of the jelly results in nymphal mortality, whereas restoration of the jelly leads to recovered nymphal growth, confirming that the jelly supports nymphal growth in winter. Chemical analyses demonstrate that the galactan-based jelly contains a sufficient quantity of amino acids to sustain nymphal growth to the third instar. The versatile biological roles of the symbiont-containing egg-covering jelly highlight intricate evolutionary interactions between maternal resource investment and vertical symbiont transmission, which are commonly important for offspring's growth, survival, and ecological adaptation.

AB Root knot nematodes (RKN) can infect most of the world's agricultural crop species and are among the most important of all plant pathogens. As yet however we have little understanding of their origins or the genomic basis of their extreme polyphagy. The most damaging pathogens reproduce by obligatory mitotic parthenogenesis and it has been suggested that these species originated from interspecific hybridizations between unknown parental taxa. We have sequenced the genome of the diploid meiotic parthenogen Meloidogyne floridensis, and use a comparative genomic approach to test the hypothesis that this species was involved in the hybrid origin of the tropical mitotic parthenogen Meloidogyne incognita. Phylogenomic analysis of gene families from M. floridensis, M. incognita and an outgroup species Meloidogyne hapla was carried out to trace the evolutionary history of these species' genomes, and we demonstrate that M. floridensis was one of the parental species in the hybrid origins of M. incognita. Analysis of the M. floridensis genome itself revealed many gene loci present in divergent copies, as they are in M. incognita, indicating that it too had a hybrid origin. The triploid M. incognita is shown to be a complex double-hybrid between M. floridensis and a third, unidentified, parent. The agriculturally important RKN have very complex origins involving the mixing of several parental genomes by hybridization and their extreme polyphagy and success in agricultural environments may be related to this hybridization, producing transgressive variation on which natural selection can act. It is now clear that studying RKN variation via individual marker loci may fail due to the species' convoluted origins, and multi-species population genomics is essential to understand the hybrid diversity and adaptive variation of this important species complex. This comparative genomic analysis provides a compelling example of the importance and complexity of hybridization in generating animal species diversity more generally.

AB Oceanic islands offer special opportunities for understanding the patterns and processes of evolution. The availability of molecular markers in recent decades has enhanced these opportunities, facilitating the use of population genetics to reveal divergence and speciation in island systems. A common pattern seen in taxa on oceanic islands is a decreased level of genetic variation within and among populations, and the founder effect has often been invoked to explain this observation. Founder effects have a major impact on immigrant populations, but, over millions of years, the original genetic signature will normally be erased as a result of mutation, recombination, drift and selection. Therefore, the types and degrees of genetic modifications that occur must often be caused by other factors, which should be considered when explaining the patterns of genetic variation. The age of the island is extremely important because oceanic islands subside on their submarine plates over time. Erosion caused by wind, rain and wave action combine to grind down soft volcanic substrates. These geomorphological events can have a dramatic impact on population number and size, and hence levels of genetic diversity. The mode of speciation is also of significance. With anagenesis, genetic variation accumulates through time, whereas, with cladogenenesis, the gene pool splits into populations of adaptively radiating species. Breeding systems, population sizes and generation times are also important, as is hybridization between closely related taxa. Human disturbance has affected plant population number and size through the harvesting of forests and the introduction of invasive plants and animals. Therefore, the explanation of the observed levels of genetic variation in species of oceanic islands requires the consideration of many interconnected physical, biological and anthropomorphic factors.

ID LAND-COVER CHANGE; VULNERABILITY; SYSTEM
AB An analysis and multi-model approach, based on a statistically derived Global Environmental Stratification (GEnS) and using a downscaled ensemble (n = 63) of CIMP5 Earth System Models applied across four representative concentration pathways (RCP), has been used to project the impact of climate change on spatial distribution of bioclimatic zones and ecosystems within the biodiverse rich Xishuangbanna Prefecture, Yunnan Province, by the year 2050. Four bioclimatic zones and 9 strata were identified, overlaid with protected areas, and associated with on-going landuse change, i.e. a rapid increase in rubber plantation from 8% to 22% of total area between 2002 and 2010. Significant changes in the areal extent and distribution of all zones and strata are projected, with an averaged mean annual temperature increase ranging from 1.6 degrees C to 2.4 degrees C By 2050, there are significant geographical shifts in all identified strata, with an average upward shift of 309 m of elevation for all strata. On average, more than 75% of Xishuangbanna is predicted to shift to a different zone, with 96% shifting to a different stratum. The area conducive to rubber plantations, currently limited by climatic conditions, expands to nearly 75% of the total area. Climatic change potentially removes the bioclimatic barriers to further expansion of rubber plantations within the area and increases pressure on remaining biodiversity both within and outside of protected areas. The analysis provides the basis for understanding potential impacts of changing bioclimatic conditions on managed and unmanaged ecosystems and landuse change trends, within the context of ongoing rapid change and agricultural expansion in the area. Current efforts to conserve forests, biodiversity and traditional landuse systems require an improved understanding of both the projected climatic changes and the responses of biodiversity and traditional agricultural systems to changing conditions.

AB Large-scale multi-species data on population changes of alpine or arctic species are largely lacking. At the same time, climate change has been argued to cause poleward and uphill range shifts and the concomitant predicted loss of habitat may have drastic effects on alpine and arctic species. Here we present a multi-national bird indicator for the Fennoscandian mountain range in northern Europe (Finland, Sweden and Norway), based on 14 common species of montane tundra and subalpine birch forest. The data were collected at 262 alpine survey plots, mainly as a part of geographically representative national breeding bird monitoring schemes. The area sampled covers around 1/4 million km(2), spanning 10 degrees of latitude and 1600 km in a northeast-southwest direction. During 2002-2012, nine of the 14 bird species declined significantly in numbers, in parallel to higher summer temperatures and precipitation during this period compared to the preceding 40 yr. The population trends were largely parallel in the three countries and similar among montane tundra and subalpine birch forest species. Long-distance migrants declined less on average than residents and short-distance migrants. Some potential causes of the current decline of alpine birds are discussed, but since montane bird population sizes may show strong natural annual variation due to several factors, longer time series are needed to verify the observed population trends. The present Fennoscandian monitoring systems, which from 2010 onwards include more than 400 montane survey plots, have the capacity to deliver a robust bird indicator in the climate-sensitive mountainous regions of northernmost Europe for conservation purposes.

AB AimTo document the species richness pattern of birds in the Hengduan Mountains and to understand its causes.
   LocationHengduan Mountains, China.
   MethodsSpecies richness of 738 breeding bird species was calculated for each 100-m elevational band along a gradient from 100 to 6000m a.s.l. Climate data were compiled based on monthly records from 182 meteorological stations in the Hengduan Mountains from 1959 to 2004. We calculated the planimetric area, predicted richness under geometric constraints, three-year average NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and EVI (enhanced vegetation index) in each elevational band. Simple and multiple regression models were used to test the explanatory power of variables associated with different factors proposed to account for elevational species richness gradients.
   ResultsThe elevational pattern in species richness, for all breeding birds, was hump-shaped, with the peak occurring at 800-1800m elevation. Endemic and non-endemic species, as well as four elevational range size categories of birds, also showed the general hump-shaped patterns of species richness, but with peaks at different elevations. In most data sets, species richness correlated well with climatic and energy factors along the elevational gradients; seasonality and productivity had a strong statistical relationship with species richness of montane birds in this study, with geometric constraints contributing to richness patterns for larger-ranged species endemic to the gradient.
   Main conclusionsWe found that climatic and energy factors correlate well with the richness pattern of birds, and that on the surveyed subtropical mountain, the elevational bands with highest seasonality harbour fewer species than areas with less seasonal variation in temperature. The results, however, vary somewhat among taxonomic groups. The most diverse species groups and species with the broadest ranges have a disproportionate influence on our perception of the overall diversity pattern and its underlying explanatory factors.

DE Delivery system; Design-bid-build; Design-build; Project; Cost;
   Duration; Comparison; Contracting
AB The choice of construction delivery system is one of the most important decisions that a public highway agency will make with regard to a highway, bridge, or transit construction project. Although several research projects have been conducted on the subject of comparing costs and project duration, there has been no study that statistically analyzes these factors specifically for transportation projects, much less one that eliminates the largest variable of all: different public agencies. The objective of the research reported in this paper was to determine which of two delivery methods, design-bid-build (DBB) and design-build (DB), delivers highway and bridge construction projects at the lowest cost and in the shortest time period, and to back up the findings with a rigorous statistical analysis of the data. Data were taken from the databases of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) and arithmetically and statistically compared through Levene's test, the independent samples t-test, the Welch unequal variances t-test, and the Mann-Whitney U test. In fact, this paper's unique contribution is its rigorous statistical analysis of data gathered directly from FDOT, comparing the performance of the two delivery systems in Florida over a finite period of time. In this comparison, DBB projects performed significantly better in terms of cost according to all statistical and arithmetic tests. DBB projects did not compare as favorably in terms of duration. Some tests showed a statistically insignificant advantage to the use of DB over DBB, whereas other tests showed no difference between the two. Other public agencies can replicate the research and determine whether the same findings hold true in their situation.

AB 1. Environmental factors, such as wind, may have a strong influence on the detection probability and detection rate of acoustic telemetry tags. The effect of environmental factors may obscure biological effects and distort the interpretation of acoustic telemetry data.
   2. This study was undertaken with fish internally tagged with acoustic transmitters containing depth sensors and monitored by an array of automatic receivers. The influence of environmental factors on the hourly detection rate was evaluated using environmental data from a nearby climate station. The signal detection probability was modelled within the framework of general theory of sound propagation in water.
   3. Wind was found to have the strongest influence on the detection rate. Transmitter depth range and rain also contributed significantly to the variation in detection rate.
   4. By modelling the attenuation coefficient as a function of wind speed, we show that the probability of detecting a free-swimming acoustically tagged animal can be successfully modelled using general sound propagation theory.
   5. The approach of modelling detection probability as a function of the attenuation coefficient offers a wide applicability, as it implies a direct link between detection probability and physical characteristics of the water at the study site. Correcting for varying detection probability is in many cases extremely important to do, since rhythms in biological/behavioural factors are often confounded with environmental variables that influence detection probability (e.g. sea breeze, tide).

AB This study examined the long-term changes in community assembly, resistance, and resilience of macroinvertebrates following 10 years of experimental floods in a flow regulated river. Physico-chemistry, macroinvertebrates, and periphyton biomass were monitored before and sequentially after each of 22 floods, and drift/seston was collected during six separate floods over the study period. The floods reduced the density and taxon richness of macroinvertebrates, and a nonmetric dimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis distinguished temporal shifts in community assembly. Resistance (measured as the relative lack of loss in density) to floods varied among taxa, and the abundance of resistant taxa was related to the temporal changes in community assembly. Community resistance was inversely related to flood magnitude with all larger floods (> 25 m(3)/s, > 16-fold over baseflow) reducing densities by > 75% regardless of flood year, whereas smaller floods (< 20 m(3)/s) reduced taxon richness approximately twofold less than larger floods. No relationship was found between flood magnitude and the relative loss in periphyton biomass. Resilience was defined as the recovery slope (positive slope of a parameter with time following each flood) and was unrelated to shifts in community assembly or resistance. Macroinvertebrate drift and seston demonstrated hysteresis (i.e., a temporal response in parameter quantity with change in discharge) during each flood, although larger floods typically had two peaks in both parameters. The first peak was a response to the initial increases in flow, whereas the second peak was associated with streambed disturbance (substrate mobility) and side-slope failure causing increased scour. Drift density was 3-9 times greater and that of seston 3-30 times greater during larger floods than smaller floods. These results demonstrate temporal shifts in macroinvertebrate community assembly toward a pre-dam assemblage following sequential floods in this flow regulated river, thus confirming the ecological role of habitat filtering in organism distribution and abundance. Community resistance and resilience were unrelated to shifts in community assembly, suggesting that they are mostly evolutionary properties of ecosystems as populations adapt to changing environmental (disturbance regimes) and biotic (novel colonists) conditions. As these systems show behaviors similar to dispersal-limited ecosystems, a long-term perspective is required for management actions targeted toward regulated and fragmented rivers.

AB Functional traits, their plasticity and their integration in a phenotype have profound impacts on plant performance. We developed structural equation models (SEMs) to evaluate their relative contribution to promote invasiveness in plants along resource gradients. We compared 20 invasivenative phylogenetically and ecologically related pairs. SEMs included one morphological (root-to-shoot ratio (R/S)) and one physiological (photosynthesis nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE)) trait, their plasticities in response to nutrient and light variation, and phenotypic integration among 31 traits. Additionally, these components were related to two fitness estimators, biomass and survival. The relative contributions of traits, plasticity and integration were similar in invasive and native species. Trait means were more important than plasticity and integration for fitness. Invasive species showed higher fitness than natives because: they had lower R/S and higher PNUE values across gradients; their higher PNUE plasticity positively influenced biomass and thus survival; and they offset more the cases where plasticity and integration had a negative direct effect on fitness. Our results suggest that invasiveness is promoted by higher values in the fitness hierarchy -- trait means are more important than trait plasticity, and plasticity is similar to integration -- rather than by a specific combination of the three components of the functional strategy.

ID INDIVIDUAL TRANSFERABLE QUOTAS; INDICATORS; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS
AB Fisheries management based on catch shares divisions of annual fleet-wide quotas among individuals or groups has been strongly supported for their economic benefits, but biological consequences have not been rigorously quantified. We used a global meta-analysis of 345 stocks to assess whether fisheries under catch shares were more likely to track management targets set for sustainable harvest than fisheries managed only by fleet-wide quota caps or effort controls. We examined three ratios: catch-to-quota, current exploitation rate to target exploitation rate and current biomass to target biomass. For each, we calculated the mean response, variation around the target and the frequency of undesirable outcomes with respect to these targets. Regional effects were stronger than any other explanatory variable we examined. After accounting for region, we found the effects of catch shares primarily on catch-to-quota ratios: these ratios were less variable over time than in other fisheries. Over-exploitation occurred in only 9% of stocks under catch shares compared to 13% of stocks under fleet-wide quota caps. Additionally, over-exploitation occurred in 41% of stocks under effort controls, suggesting a substantial benefit of quota caps alone. In contrast, there was no evidence for a response in the biomass of exploited populations because of either fleet-wide quota caps or individual catch shares. Thus, for many fisheries, management controls improve under catch shares in terms of reduced variation in catch around quota targets, but ecological benefits in terms of increased biomass may not be realized by catch shares alone.

AB Aim To test for a possible effect of environmental harshness on large-scale latitudinal and elevational patterns in taxon richness of macrofauna in arctic and alpine glacier-fed streams. Location Svalbard (79 degrees N), Iceland (65 degrees N), Norway (62 degrees N), Switzerland and Italy (46 degrees N), France (43 degrees N), New Zealand (43 degrees S) and Ecuador (0 degrees), covering an elevational gradient from sea level to 4800 m a.s.l. Methods We gathered data from 63 sites along 13 streams and created an index of glacial influence (the glacial index, GI) as an integrative proxy for environmental harshness. The explicative power of the GI, environmental variables, latitude and elevation on taxon richness was tested in generalized linear models. Taxon richness along geographical gradients was analysed at standardized levels of GI in contour plots. Beta diversity and assemblage similarity was calculated at different GI intervals and compared with a null-model. Results Overall, taxon richness decreased exponentially with increased GI (r2= 0.64), and of all included factors, GI had the highest explicative power. At low values of GI we found that local taxon richness varied along the coupled gradients of latitude and elevation in a hump-shaped manner. However, this pattern disappeared at high values of GI, i.e. when environmental harshness increased. Beta diversity increased, while similarity among assemblages decreased towards high GI values. Main conclusions In our study system, the number of taxa able to cope with the harshest conditions was largely independent of the regional taxon pool, and environmental harshness constituted a fixed constraint for local richness, irrespective of latitude and elevation. Contrary to expectations, we found that beta diversity was highest and similarity lowest among the harshest sites, suggesting that taxon richness was not solely driven by niche selection based on environmental tolerances, but also stochastic ecological drift, leading to dispersal-limited communities.

AB Life-history traits describe parameters associated with growth, size, survival, and reproduction. Life-history variation is a hallmark of biological diversity, yet researchers commonly observe that one of the major axes of life-history variation after controlling for body size involves trade-offs among growth, reproduction, and longevity. This persistent pattern of covariation among these specific traits has engendered a search for shared mechanisms that could constrain or facilitate production of variation in life-history strategies. Endocrine traits are one candidate mechanism that may underlie the integration of life history and other phenotypic traits. However, the vast majority of this research has been on the effects of steroid hormones such as glucocorticoids and androgens on life-history trade-offs. Here we propose an expansion of the focus on glucocorticoids and gonadal hormones and review the potential role of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in shaping the adaptive integration of multiple life-history traits. IGF-1 is a polypeptide metabolic hormone largely produced by the liver. We summarize a vast array of research demonstrating that IGF-1 levels are susceptible to environmental variation and that IGF-1 can have potent stimulatory effects on somatic growth and reproduction but decrease lifespan. We review the few studies in natural populations that have measured plasma IGF-1 concentrations and its associations with life-history traits or other characteristics of the organism or its environment. We focus on two case studies that found support for the hypothesis that IGF-1 mediates adaptive divergence in suites of life-history traits in response to varying ecological conditions or artificial selection. We also examine what we view as potentially fruitful avenues of research on this topic, which until now has been rarely investigated by evolutionary ecologists. We discuss how IGF-1 may facilitate adaptive plasticity in life-history strategies in response to early environmental conditions and also how selection on loci controlling IGF-1 signaling may mediate population divergence and eventual speciation. After consideration of the interactions among androgens, glucocorticoids, and IGF-1 we suggest that IGF-1 be considered a suitable candidate mechanism for mediating life-history traits. Finally, we discuss what we can learn about IGF-1 from studies in free-ranging animals. The voluminous literature in laboratory and domesticated animals documenting relationships among IGF-1, growth, reproduction, and lifespan demonstrates the potential for a number of new research questions to be asked in free-ranging animals. Examining how IGF-1 mediates life-history traits in free-ranging animals could lead to great insight into the mechanisms that influence life-history variation.

AB Consistent individual differences in behaviour, and behavioural correlations within and across contexts, are referred to as animal personalities. These patterns of variation have been identified in many animal taxa and are likely to have important ecological and evolutionary consequences. Despite their importance, genetic and environmental sources of variation in personalities have rarely been characterized in wild populations. We used a Bayesian animal model approach to estimate genetic parameters for aggression, activity and docility in North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). We found support for low heritabilities (0.080.12), and cohort effects (0.070.09), as well as low to moderate maternal effects (0.070.15) and permanent environmental effects (0.080.16). Finally, we found evidence of a substantial positive genetic correlation (0.68) and maternal effects correlation (0.58) between activity and aggression providing evidence of genetically based behavioural correlations in red squirrels. These results provide evidence for the presence of heritable variation in red squirrel behaviour, but also emphasize the role of other sources of variation, including maternal effects, in shaping patterns of variation and covariation in behavioural traits.

ID CHALLENGES
AB 1. Volunteers have helped in scientific surveys of birds and other organisms for decades, but more recently, the use of the Internet has enormously widened the opportunity for citizen science and greatly increased its practice. There is now a need to share experience of which methods work and which do not. Here, we describe how we planned and executed the Evolution MegaLab, one of the largest surveys of polymorphism in wild species so far undertaken. 2. The aim of the Evolution MegaLab was to exploit the occasion of Charles Darwin's double centenary in 2009 to mobilize the widest possible section of the general public in Europe to help survey shell polymorphism in the banded snails Cepaea nemoralis and Cepaea hortensis. These data were then compared with historical records to detect evolutionary change that may have taken place in the decades between samples. 3. Records of polymorphism in over 7000 populations sampled throughout the natural range of the two species were captured frompublished and unpublished sources and added to an online database. These data could be explored by the general public via a Google Maps interface on the project website (http:// evolutionmegalab. org). The website contained a welcome page that explained what evolution is and how recent changes in climate, and the abundance of predatory birds (song thrushes Turdus philomelos) might have caused an evolutionary change in the shell patterns of banded snails. 4. A network of collaborators in 15 European countries was formed, with each country responsible for translating the website and associated materials, recruiting volunteers and raising any funds required locally. A total of 6461 users registered with the site, and 7629 records were submitted. We used an online quiz to train users and to test their ability, to recognize the correct snails and their morphs. Every user received automated, immediate feedback that compared their data with nearby records fromthe historical database. 5. The critical tasks achieved by the EvolutionMegaLab that any citizen science projectmust tackle are as follows: (i) design of an appropriate project, (ii) recruitment, motivation and training of volunteers, and (iii) ensuring data quality.

AB Sexual segregation in foraging and migratory behaviour is widespread among sexually dimorphic marine vertebrates. It has also been described for a number of monomorphic species, yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We examined variation among years, seasons and age-classes in sex-specific foraging and over-wintering behaviour in the northern gannet Morus bassanus, a species with slight sexual dimorphism. Our results revealed consistent sexual differences in the stable isotope ratios of breeding birds: over 3 different breeding periods, adult females consistently consumed prey with significantly lower delta C-13 and delta N-15 values than adult males. Additionally, GPS tracking data showed that breeding females foraged further offshore than breeding males (a result consistent with the delta C-13 data), and the home ranges of the 2 sexes were distinct. Analyses of stable isotope ratios using a Bayesian mixing model (SIAR) revealed that breeding males consumed a higher proportion of fishery discards than females. Analysis of stable isotope ratios in red blood cells of immature gannets (aged 2 to 4) indicated that sexual segregation was not present in this age-class. Although sample sizes were small and statistical power correspondingly low, analysis of geolocator data and of stable isotope ratios in winter-grown flight feathers revealed no clear evidence of sexual segregation during the non-breeding period. Together these results provide detailed insight into sex-specific behaviour in gannets throughout the annual cycle, and although the mechanisms remain unclear they are unlikely to be explained by slight differences in size.

AB Studying geographic variation in the rate of hybridization between closely related species could provide a useful window on the evolution of reproductive isolation. Reinforcement theory predicts greater prezygotic isolation in areas of prolonged contact between recently diverged species than in areas of recent contact, which implies that old contact zones would be dominated by parental phenotypes with few hybrids (bimodal hybrid zones), whereas recent contact zones would be characterized by hybrid swarms (unimodal hybrid zones). Here, we investigate how the hybrid zones of two closely related Chinese oaks, Quercus mongolica and Q.similar to liaotungensis, are structured geographically using both nuclear and chloroplast markers. We found that populations of Q.similar to liaotungensis located around the Changbai Mountains in Northeast China, an inferred glacial refugium, were introgressed by genes from Q.similar to mongolica, suggesting historical contact between the two species in this region. However, these introgressed populations form sharp bimodal hybrid zones with Q.similar to mongolica. In contrast, populations of Q.similar to liaotungensis located in North China, which show no sign of ancient introgression with Q.similar to mongolica, form unimodal hybrid zones with Q.similar to mongolica. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that selection against hybrids has had sufficient time to reinforce the reproductive barriers between Q.similar to liaotungensis and Q.similar to mongolica in Northeast China but not in North China.

AB This study presents a method for assessing conservation opportunity on private land based on landholders' socio-economic, behavioral, and farm characteristics. These characteristics include age, gender, education, level of off-farm income, farm size, proportion of remnant native vegetation on-farm, and ecological value of native vegetation on-farm. A sample of landholders who own greater than 2 ha of land in the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin region were sent a mail-based survey about their values and preferences for environmental management (N = 659, 52% response). Cross-tabulations and ANOVA statistical analysis techniques were used to compare the socio-economic attributes across three landholder classes: disengaged, moderately engaged, and highly engaged in native vegetation planting. Results indicate that highly engaged landholders were more likely to be female, formally educated, hobby farmers who managed small parcels of land and have high off-farm incomes, whereas disengaged landholders held significantly stronger farming connections (more farming experience, family have lived on the farm for more generations). Spatial analysis revealed area-specific differences in conservation opportunity and conservation priority. In some areas, properties of high ecological value were managed by highly engaged landholders, but nearby properties of high value were managed by moderately engaged or disengaged landholders. Environmental managers therefore cannot assume areas of high conservation priority will be areas of high conservation opportunity. At the regional scale, the potential for revegetation seems most promising within the moderately engaged landholder group considering the vast amount of land managed by this group in areas of high ecological value, particularly within the less represented Mallee and Coorong and Rangelands sub-regions. We suggest that incentive schemes which purchase conservation need to be targeted at disengaged landholders: mentoring schemes led by commercial farmers highly engaged in native vegetation planting should be directed at moderately engaged landholders, and; awards programs which acknowledge conservation successes should be targeted at highly engaged landholders.

AB We examined the patterns of tree species richness, density and basal area in the Eastern Himalayan elevation gradient, and evaluated the roles of geometric constraints and environmental factors for the observed pattern. We followed the quadrat sampling method for this study at 23 different locations along a 300-4700 m elevation gradient in Sikkim. We used regression analysis to establish elevational pattern of trees (species richness, density and basal area) and to relate environmental factors with tree species and density. We also tested geometric constraints on species distribution by comparing empirical species richness with null model predictions generated by a Monte Carlo Simulation Programme (McCain, 2004). We observed a total of 3874 individual trees belonging to 171 species and 58 families. Tree species richness depicted unimodal pattern with a peak at 1500 m, whereas basal area peaked at 1900 m. Although density did not follow a uniform pattern, maximum value was observed at 3050 m. Climatic and energy related factors rainfall, temperature, moisture index (MI) and actual evapotranspiration (AET)-correlated positively with tree species richness. The Mid-domain effect null model showed significant deviation of empirical richness from simulated species richness. Stepwise regression revealed that combined effects of energy (surrogated by temperature), productivity (surrogated by AET) and precipitation (reflected by MI) influenced observed tree species patterns in the Eastern Himalayan elevation gradient although historical and spatial factors might interplay.

AB P>1. An organism's environment, particularly early in development, can profoundly shape its future phenotypes. While the long-term consequences of embryonic temperature are well studied in vertebrates, insects have complex life cycles that may uncouple temperature's effects in one stage from physiology in the next.
   2. This study examines how egg temperature affects insect performance across all subsequent life stages. We focused on the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, and examined how egg temperatures affected hatching time, hatchling mass, larval growth, development time, head capsule size, pupal mass and adult fecundity. Eggs were exposed to either diurnal temperature cycles or a single heat shock; in both experiments, temperatures were within the range to which eggs are typically exposed in the field.
   3. Although the consequences of egg temperature varied depending on the type of treatment, both cycling temperatures and heat shock affected egg development time and initial larval growth rate, which likely have fitness consequences for M. sexta in nature. In contrast, egg temperature had no persistent effect on any trait measured in later larval stages, pupae or adults.
   4. Organisms with complex life cycles -Manduca has four distinct life stages and multiple larval sub-stages - may benefit from rapid compensation for poor early conditions. Additionally, the modularity of insect life cycles may help insects cope with environmental variability by insulating later stages from disturbances during embryogenesis.

AB 1. Using experimental atmospheric CO2 enrichment, we tested for tree growth stimulation at the high-elevation treeline, where there is overwhelming evidence that low temperature inhibits growth despite an adequate carbon supply. We exposed Larix decidua (European larch) and Pin us mugo ssp. uncinata (mountain pine) to 9 years of free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) in an in situ experiment at treeline in the Swiss Alps (2180 m a.s.l.).
   2. Accounting for pre-treatment vigour of individual trees, tree ring increments throughout the experimental period were larger in Larix growing under elevated CO2 but not in Pinus. The magnitude of the CO2 response in Larix ring width varied over time, with a significant stimulation occurring in treatment years 3-7 (marginal in year 6).
   3. After 9 years of treatment, leaf canopy cover, stem basal area and total new shoot production were overall greater in Larix trees growing under elevated CO2, whereas Pinus showed no such cumulative growth response. The Larix ring width response in years 3-7 could have caused the cumulative CO2 effect on tree size even if no further stimulation occurred, so it remains unclear if responsiveness was sustained over the longer term.
   4. Larix ring width was stimulated more by elevated CO2 in years with relatively high spring temperatures and an early snowmelt date, suggesting that temperatures were less limiting in these years and greater benefit was gained from extra carbon assimilated under elevated CO2. The magnitude of CO2 stimulation was also larger after relatively high temperatures and high solar radiation in the preceding growing season, perhaps reflecting gains due to larger carbon reserves.
   5. Synthesis. Contrasting above-ground growth responses of two treeline tree species to elevated CO2 concentrations suggest that Larix will have a competitive advantage over less responsive species, such as co-occurring Pinus, under future CO2 concentrations. Stimulation of Larix growth might be especially pronounced in a future warmer climate.

AB Background: Mesoamerica is one of the most threatened biodiversity hotspots in the world, yet we are far from understanding the geologic history and the processes driving population divergence and speciation for most endemic taxa. In species with highly differentiated populations selective and/or neutral factors can induce rapid changes to traits involved in mate choice, promoting reproductive isolation between allopatric populations that can eventually lead to speciation. We present the results of genetic differentiation, and explore drift and selection effects in promoting acoustic and morphological divergence among populations of Campylopterus curvipennis, a lekking hummingbird with an extraordinary vocal variability across Mesoamerica.
   Results: Analyses of two mitochondrial genes and ten microsatellite loci genotyped for 160 individuals revealed the presence of three lineages with no contemporary gene flow: C. c. curvipennis, C. c. excellens, and C. c. pampa disjunctly distributed in the Sierra Madre Oriental, the Tuxtlas region and the Yucatan Peninsula, respectively. Sequence mtDNA and microsatellite data were congruent with two diversification events: an old vicariance event at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (c. 1.4 Ma), and a more recent Pleistocene split, isolating populations in the Tuxtlas region. Hummingbirds of the excellens group were larger, and those of the pampa group had shorter bills, and lineages that have been isolated the longest shared fewer syllables and differed in spectral and temporal traits of a shared syllable. Coalescent simulations showed that fixation of song types has occurred faster than expected under neutrality but the null hypothesis that morphological divergence resulted from drift was not rejected.
   Conclusions: Our phylogeographic analyses uncovered the presence of three Mesoamerican wedge-tailed sabrewing lineages, which diverged at different time scales. These results highlight the importance of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and more recent Pleistocene climatic events in driving isolation and population divergence. Coalescent analyses of the evolution of phenotypic traits suggest that selection is driving song evolution in wedge-tailed sabrewings but drift could not be rejected as a possibility for morphological divergence.

AB Accurate bone modeling from medical images is essential in the diagnosis and treatment of patients because it supports the detection of abnormal bone morphology, which is often responsible for many musculoskeletal diseases (MSDs) of human articulations. In a clinical setting, images of the suspected joints are acquired in a high resolution but with a small field of view (FOV) in order to maximize the image quality while reducing acquisition time.
   However bones are only partially visible in such small FOVs. This presents difficult challenges in automated bone segmentation and thus limits the application of sophisticated algorithms such as statistical shape models (SSM), which have been generally proven to be an efficient technique for bone segmentation. Indeed, the reduced image information affects the initialization and evolution of these deformable model-based approaches.
   In this paper, we present a robust multi-resolution SSM algorithm with an adapted initialization to address the segmentation of MRI bone images acquired in small FOVs for modeling and computer-aided diagnosis. Our innovation stems from the derivation of a robust SSM based on complete and corrupted shapes, as well as from a simultaneous optimization of transformation and shape parameters to yield an efficient initialization technique.
   We demonstrate our segmentation algorithm using 86 clinical MRI images of the femur and hip bones. These images have a varied resolution and limited FOVs. The results of our segmentation (e.g., average distance error of 1.12 +/- 0.46 mm) are within the needs of image-based clinical diagnosis. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO BMC GENOMICS

   RECOMBINATION; SUBSTITUTIONS; POLYMORPHISM; ALIGNMENT; PATTERNS
AB Background: A well-informed choice of genetic locus is central to the efficacy of DNA barcoding. Current DNA barcoding in animals involves the use of the 5' half of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 gene (CO1) to diagnose and delimit species. However, there is no compelling a priori reason for the exclusive focus on this region, and it has been shown that it performs poorly for certain animal groups. To explore alternative mitochondrial barcoding regions, we compared the efficacy of the universal CO1 barcoding region with the other mitochondrial protein-coding genes in eutherian mammals. Four criteria were used for this comparison: the number of recovered species, sequence variability within and between species, resolution to taxonomic levels above that of species, and the degree of mutational saturation.
   Results: Based on 1,179 mitochondrial genomes of eutherians, we found that the universal CO1 barcoding region is a good representative of mitochondrial genes as a whole because the high species-recovery rate (> 90%) was similar to that of other mitochondrial genes, and there were no significant differences in intra-or interspecific variability among genes. However, an overlap between intra-and interspecific variability was still problematic for all mitochondrial genes. Our results also demonstrated that any choice of mitochondrial gene for DNA barcoding failed to offer significant resolution at higher taxonomic levels.
   Conclusions: We suggest that the CO1 barcoding region, the universal DNA barcode, is preferred among the mitochondrial protein-coding genes as a molecular diagnostic at least for eutherian species identification. Nevertheless, DNA barcoding with this marker may still be problematic for certain eutherian taxa and our approach can be used to test potential barcoding loci for such groups.

AB Natural hybrid zones provide opportunities to study a range of evolutionary phenomena from speciation to the genetic basis of fitness-related traits. We show that widespread hybridization has occurred between two neo-tropical stream fishes with partial reproductive isolation. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial sequence data showed that the swordtail fish Xiphophorus birchmanni is monophyletic and that X. malinche is part of an independent monophyletic clade with other species. Using informative single nucleotide polymorphisms in one mitochondrial and three nuclear intron loci, we genotyped 776 specimens collected from twenty-three sites along seven separate stream reaches. Hybrid zones occurred in replicated fashion in all stream reaches along a gradient from high to low elevation. Genotyping revealed substantial variation in parental and hybrid frequencies among localities. Tests of F-IS and linkage disequilibrium (LD) revealed generally low F-IS and LD except in five populations where both parental species and hybrids were found suggesting incomplete reproductive isolation. In these locations, heterozygote deficiency and LD were high, which suggests either selection against early generation hybrids or assortative mating. These data lay the foundation to study the adaptive basis of the replicated hybrid zone structure and for future integration of behaviour and genetics to determine the processes that lead to the population genetic patterns observed in these hybrid zones.

AB Background and Aims Functional trait differences and trait adjustment in response to influences of the biotic environment could reflect niche partitioning among species. In this study, we tested how variation in above-ground plant traits, chosen as indicators for light and nitrogen acquisition and use, differs among taxonomically closely related species (Poaceae) to assess their potential for niche segregation at increasing plant diversity.
   Methods Traits of 12 grass species were measured in experimental grasslands (Jena Experiment) of varying species richness (from 1 to 60) and presence of particular functional groups (grasses, legumes, tall herbs and small herbs).
   Key Results Grass species increased shoot and leaf length, investment into supporting tissue (stem mass fraction) and specific leaf area as well as reduced foliar delta C-13 values with increasing species richness, indicating higher efforts for light acquisition. These species-richness effects could in part be explained by a higher probability of legume presence in more diverse communities. Leaf nitrogen concentrations increased and biomas s : N ratios in shoots decreased when grasses grew with legumes, indicating an improved nitrogen nutrition. Foliar delta N-15 values of grasses decreased when growing with legumes suggesting the use of depleted legume-derived N, while decreasing delta N-15 values with increasing species richness indicated a shift in the uptake of different N sources. However, efforts to optimize light and nitrogen acquisition by plastic adjustment of traits in response to species richness and legume presence, varied significantly among grass species. It was possible to show further that trait adjustment of grass species increased niche segregation in more diverse plant communities but that complementarity through niche separation may differ between light and nutrient acquisition.
   Conclusions The results suggest that even among closely related species such as grasses different strategies are used to cope with neighbours. This lack in redundancy in turn may facilitate complementary resource use and coexistence.

AB Funding agencies are dedicating substantial resources to tackle helminth infections. Reliable maps of the distribution of helminth infection can assist these efforts by targeting control resources to areas of greatest need. The ability to define the distribution of infection at regional, national and subnational levels has been enhanced greatly by the increased availability of good quality survey data and the use of model-based geostatistics (MBG), enabling spatial prediction in unsampled locations. A major advantage of MBG risk mapping approaches is that they provide a flexible statistical platform for handling and representing different sources of uncertainty, providing plausible and robust information on the spatial distribution of infections to inform the design and implementation of control programmes. Focussing on schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis, with additional examples for lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis, we review the progress made to date with the application of MBG tools in large-scale, real-world control programmes and propose a general framework for their application to inform integrative spatial planning of helminth disease control programmes.

AB Changes in catchment land-use and sedimentation have large ecological effects on rivers, but there is limited transferable understanding of the consequences for river conservation. In the Usk river system (Wales. UK), we assessed whether catchment-scale change in land-use and patch-scale sedimentation (i) affected organisms with specific life-history traits and (ii) resulted in nested assemblages with species-poor sites occupied mostly by sub-sets of organisms from richer sites.
   Reaches in catchments converted to agriculture had nested species assemblages characterised by greater representation of organisms with small body size, shorter life cycle and effective dispersal capacity. In contrast, richer sites in semi-natural catchments supported taxa with longer life cycles. Patch-scale sedimentation was also accompanied by nested patterns in which depauperate patches supported taxa mostly with shorter life cycles, small size and detrital feeding habits. Sediment-free patches were richer and characterised by larger taxa, poor dispersers and predators. Trait diversity was reduced by habitat modification at both scales.
   We conclude that habitat modification in this river catchment has led to the systematic drop-out at two different scales of specific groups of organisms with particular trait character. Large-scale agricultural intensification appears to have removed larger, longer-lived invertebrates that probably require stable conditions, and we advocate further studies to appraise whether such organisms are at risk more globally from land-use conversion. This river case study is one of the first to combine nestedness analysis with biological trait assessment and it might help in developing transferable methods to predict the conservation impacts of land-use change.

AB Paleoecological analyses that test for spatial or temporal variation in diversity must consider not only sampling and preservation bias, but also the effects of temporal scale (i.e., time-averaging). The species-time relationship (STR) describes how species diversity increases with the elapsed time of observation, but its consequences for assessing the effects of time-averaging on diversity of fossil assemblages remain poorly explored. Here, we use a neutral, dispersal-limited model of metacommunity dynamics, with parameters estimated from living assemblages of 31 molluscan data sets, to model the effects of within-habitat time-averaging on the mean composition and multivariate dispersion of assemblages, on diversity at point (single station) and habitat scales (pooled multiple stations), and on beta diversity. We hold sample size constant in STRs to isolate the effects of time-averaging from sampling effects. With increasing within-habitat time-averaging, stochastic switching in the identity of species in living (dispersal-limited) assemblages (1) decreases the proportional abundance of abundant species, reducing the steepness of the rank-abundance distribution, and (2) increases the proportional richness of rare, temporally short-lived species that immigrate from the neutral metacommunity with many rare species. These two effects together (1) can shift the mean composition away from the non-averaged (dispersal-limited) assemblages toward averaged assemblages that are less limited by dispersal, resembling that of the metacommunity; (2) allow the point and habitat diversity to increase toward metacommunity diversity under a given sample size (i.e., the diversity in averaged assemblages is inflated relative to non-averaged assemblages); and (3) reduce beta diversity because species unique to individual stations become shared by other stations when limited by a larger but static species pool. Surprisingly, these scale-dependent changes occur at fixed sample sizes and can become significant after only a few decades or centuries of time-averaging, and are accomplished without invoking ecological succession, environmental changes, or selective postmortem preservation. Time-averaging results in less inflation of diversity at habitat than at point scales; paleoecological studies should thus analyze data at multiple spatial scales, including that of the habitat where multiple bulk samples have been pooled in order to minimize time-averaging effects. The diversity of assemblages that have accumulated over 1000 years at point and habitat scales is expected to be inflated by an average of 2.1 and 1.6, respectively. This degree of inflation is slightly higher than that observed in molluscan death assemblages at these same spatial scales (1.8 and 1.3). Thus, neutral metacommunity models provide useful quantitative constraints on directional but predictable effects of time-averaging. They provide minimal estimates for the rate of increase in diversity with time-averaging because they assume no change in environmental conditions and in the composition of the metacommunity within the window of averaging.

AB P>1. Modelling growth strategies among tropical trees is an important objective in predicting the response of tree dynamics to selective logging and in gaining insights into the ecological processes that structure tree communities in managed tropical forests.
   2. We developed a disturbance index to model the effects of distance to and area of logging gaps on stem radial growth rates. This index was tested using census data of 43 neotropical tree species, representing a variety of life-history strategies and developmental stages, from a selectively logged forest at Paracou, French Guiana. Growth strategies were analyzed in light of two indicators: the inherent species growth rate (when disturbance index is null) and the species reaction (change in growth rate) to logging gaps.
   3. Across species, the predicted inherent growth rates in unlogged forest ranged from 0 center dot 25 to 6 center dot 47 mm year-1, with an average growth of 2 center dot 29 mm year-1. Ontogenetic shifts in inherent growth rate were found in 26 of the 43 species.
   4. Species growth response to logging gaps varied widely among species but was significantly positive for 27 species. The effect of ontogeny on growth response to logging was retained for 14 species, and species with inherent fast growth rate (5 mm year-1) responded less to logging gap disturbances than did species with slow inherent growth (1 mm year-1).
   5. Functional traits explained 19-42% of the variation in the inherent growth rate and in species' response across all developmental stages. Whereas maximum diameters and seed mass were strong predictors of inherent growth rate, maximum height, wood density, mode of germination and stem architecture were additionally involved in tree growth response.
   6. Synthesis and applications: This study provides a necessary framework for developing predictive post-logging growth models for the thousands of species comprising tropical forests and is sufficiently general to apply to a broad range of managed tropical forests.

AB Mounting evidence shows that contrasting selection pressures generate variability in dispersal patterns among individuals or populations of the same species, with potential impacts on both species dynamics and evolution. However, this variability is hardly considered in empirical works, where a single dispersal function is considered to adequately reflect the species-specific dispersal ability, suggesting thereby that within-species variation is negligible as regard to inter-specific differences in dispersal abilities. We propose here an original method to make the comparison of intra- and inter-specific variability in dispersal, by decomposing the diversity of that trait along a phylogeny of closely related species. We used as test group European butterflies that are classic study organisms in spatial ecology. We apply the analysis separately to eight metrics that reflect the dispersal propensity, the dispersal ability or the dispersal efficiency of populations and species. At the inter-specific level, only the dispersal ability showed the signature of a phylogenetic signal while neither the dispersal propensity nor the dispersal efficiency did. At the within-species level, the partitioning of dispersal diversity showed that dispersal was variable or highly variable among populations: intra- specific variability represented from 11% to 133% of inter-specific variability in dispersal metrics. This finding shows that dispersal variation is far from negligible in the wild. Understanding the processes behind this high within-species variation should allow us to properly account for dispersal in demographic models. Accordingly, to encompass the within species variability in life histories the use of more than one value per trait per species should be encouraged in the construction of databases aiming at being sources for modelling purposes.

AB Midge (Insecta: Diptera: Nematocera) assemblages were examined in surface sediment samples from Lake Pieni-Kauro and the Saavanjoki River, eastern Finland, using their sedimentary remains. The aim was first to identify the forcing factors behind midge distribution within an aquatic ecosystem and second to develop new midge-based calibration models for the reconstruction or past environmental conditions, with a special focus on paleohydrology. The third objective was to apply the models to a midge stratigraphy. The effect of sampling-point selection in paleolimnological studies and its possible influence on chironomid-inferred temperature reconstructions was also assessed. The species assemblages in Lake Pieni-Kauro showed high levels of heterogeneity within the surface sediment samples, signifying that the assemblages predominantly incorporate locally dwelling fauna, instead of integrating remains from a larger area. Stream flow and water depth were the most important factors explaining the midge distributions in the lake. In addition, sampling distance from littoral vegetation (DLV), proximity of wetland, distance from shore, and organic content of the sediment were significantly correlated statistically with the midge assemblages. In the lacustrine samples, absolute midge abundance and taxon richness were highest at intermediate water depths. Because hydrological variables were the most important factors controlling the species' distributions, paleohydrological calibration models for water depth and stream flow were developed. Additionally, a transfer function for the sampling DLV was developed that can be used to track changes in the past location of littoral vegetation stands, which is often closely related to hydrological factors. The models' test use on the subfossil midge assemblages of the previously available downcore sediment sequence showed coherent and expected results, compared with previous studies and the modern observed environmental conditions of the lake. Based on the results of this study, these models can provide reliable estimates of past hydrological variability that is closely related to climatic changes and thus may provide a valuable tool for environmental management and global change assessments. This study also indicates that care should be taken in choosing the sampling point in chironomid-based calibration studies because the influence or depth may distort the temperature estimations.

AB Mutualisms provide benefits to interacting species, but they also involve costs. If costs come to exceed benefits as population density or the frequency of encounters between species increases, the interaction will no longer be mutualistic. Thus curves that represent benefits and costs as functions of interaction frequency are important tools for predicting when a mutualism will tip over into antagonism. Currently, most of what we know about benefit and cost curves in pollination mutualisms comes from highly specialized pollinating seed-consumer mutualisms, such as the yucca moth-yucca interaction. There, benefits to female reproduction saturate as the number of visits to a flower increases (because the amount of pollen needed to fertilize all the flower's ovules is finite), but costs continue to increase (because pollinator offspring consume developing seeds), leading to a peak in seed production at an intermediate number of visits. But for most plant-pollinator mutualisms, costs to the plant are more subtle than consumption of seeds, and how such costs scale with interaction frequency remains largely unknown. Here, we present reasonable benefit and cost curves that are appropriate for typical pollinator-plant interactions, and we show how they can result in a wide diversity of relationships between net benefit (benefit minus cost) and interaction frequency. We then use maximum-likelihood methods to fit net-benefit curves to measures of female reproductive success for three typical pollination mutualisms from two continents, and for each system we chose the most parsimonious model using information-criterion statistics. We discuss the implications of the shape of the net-benefit curve for the ecology and evolution of plant-pollinator mutualisms, as well as the challenges that lie ahead for disentangling the underlying benefit and cost curves for typical pollination mutualisms.

AB In ecology and biogeography it is often recognized that the species richness of different groups of organisms is spatially congruent (and thus positively correlated). However, ecological phenomena are often scale dependent and can change with spatial scale (i.e., grain size and extent). Because species richness gradients are also correlated with environmental gradients and plant species richness is thought to influence animal species richness, the relative roles of environment and plant richness in influencing cross-taxon congruence of animal richness at different spatial scales remain poorly explored. In this study, we examine the spatial concordance in species richness among terrestrial vertebrates and vascular plants at two spatial grain sizes (local and regional) across China. We hypothesize that (H-1) cross-taxon richness relationships are weaker at the local scale; (H-2) climatic predictors of species richness are stronger at the regional scale; (H-3) effects of habitat heterogeneity on species richness are stronger at the local scale; (H-4) plant richness positively affects vertebrate richness after accounting for environmental effects; and (H-5) the plant-vertebrate richness relationship is weaker at the regional. scale. We found significant and positive correlations between species richness of the groups, with correlations being stronger at the regional scale than at the local scale (supporting H-1). Climate has weaker effects on species richness at the regional scale than at the local scale (rejecting H-2), and for vertebrates (but not for plants) effects of habitat heterogeneity are stronger at the local scale (supporting hypothesis H-3). Plant richness positively affects vertebrate richness after accounting for environmental effects (supporting H-4), but the effect is stronger for the two endothermic groups (mammals and birds) than for the two ectothermic groups (reptiles and amphibians). In contrast to hypothesis H-5, the effect of plant richness on species richness of vertebrates is stronger at the regional scale than at the local scale. Our study suggests that plant richness has a significant influence on animal species richness across spatial scales and that the strength of the effects of plant species richness, climate, and topographic heterogeneity on animal species richness depends on the spatial grain size of sampling units.

AB 1. Understanding the assembly of ecological communities is central to managing such communities for conservation, restoration and invasion resistance. A central plank of modern theory is limiting similarity, i.e. a finite limit to the similarity of coexisting species.
   2. Here, we test the theory of limiting similarity in a roadside plant community that has been monitored for almost 50 years. We measure differences between observed trait distributions ('functional diversity, FD') and those expected on the basis of three different null models, several trait combinations and four different methods of measuring FD.
   3. The general pattern was of lower observed than expected FD, or no difference between observed and expected FD, independent of FD measure and trait set. Some rare species had 'unusual' traits; thus if the null model assumed all species had equal chance of occurring, observed FD was generally lower than expected by chance, but if the null model assumed the probability of occurrence of rare species was proportional to the observed frequency of occurrence or excluded rare species, observed FD was not significantly different from expected.
   4. Synthesis. The results do not support the idea that niche differences are central to the assembly of this plant community. However, they do suggest that rare species may be functionally unusual, and that the patterns revealed by this kind of analysis can be strongly influenced by the choice of null model, and much less so by the choice of FD measure.

AB 1. Identifying the mechanisms that facilitate invasion is crucial for the design of preventative measures and understanding the invasion process, but not necessarily for the design of effective control strategies.
   2. When a novel disturbance is identified as facilitating invasion, the intuitive control strategy is to restore the previous disturbance regime. This recommendation is implicitly based on traditional models of succession, which explain the dynamics of few natural ecosystems. We investigate whether the application and/or manipulation of novel disturbances designed explicitly under an alternative states model are more effective for restoration.
   3. Using a field trial, we manipulated a relatively new disturbance (ungulate grazing), a facilitator of invasion, to determine its effects on the invasive grass species, Eragrostis curvula and the rest of the plant community. The split-plot design used excluded and permitted grazing and was combined with reductions in the biomass of the invader using mowing and selective application of herbicides. We also altered soil nutrient conditions and monitored responses over two growing seasons characterized by different rainfall patterns.
   4. We found that the control strategy based implicitly on traditional successional models (removing the causal disturbance and killing the invasive grass) was not the most effective option for restoring a desirable native community. While this control strategy reduced the abundance of the invader and increased native grasses, it led to an increase in the abundance of an undesirable exotic forb, Verbena tenuisecta. The most effective control strategy was based on alternative states models and involved the maintenance of grazing and the use of fertilizers to increase the palatability of the invader. With this strategy, the abundance of the invader decreased because grazing pressure increased, native grasses increased and the exotic forb was maintained at low levels.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The control strategy based on the alternative states models initially appears at odds with restoration efforts, because livestock grazing and nutrient addition are associated with the degradation of plant communities worldwide. However, for effective restoration, we found approaches that take into consideration the dynamics of the novel invader-dominated system were the most effective in the short term.

AB Studies examining how wildlife populations perceive and respond to habitat are common, and many attempt to understand how the quality of available habitats influences population processes such as survival and recruitment. Traditional methods to estimate habitat quality (e.g. population density) have not led to great advancement in our understanding of relationships between habitat and fitness in recent years. Metrics from the discipline of conservation physiology could help researchers to address these difficulties and to meet the challenges that habitat alteration poses to biodiversity. Incorporating physiological metrics that relate energetics or environmental stress to habitats may be powerful measures of habitat quality. By quantifying field metabolic rates, body condition, or concentrations of stress hormones in individual organisms, researchers may identify mechanisms associated with habitat that underlie observed patterns in vital rates (survival and fecundity). Physiological metrics offer useful tools that may identify mechanisms of habitat quality and detect the causes of declines in biodiversity. However, integration among physiologists, ecologists and conservation biologists will require new partnerships and approaches to respond to complex ecological issues.

AB The identity and impact of trophic linkages within subterranean arthropod communities are challenging to establish, a fact that hinders the development of conservation biological control programs of subterranean herbivores. Diabrotica virgifera (the western corn rootworm) is a severe agricultural pest that lives subterraneously during its pre-imaginal stages and succumbs to high levels of pre-imaginal mortality from unknown agents. The guts of 1500 field-collected arthropod predators were analyzed for D. virgifera-specific DNA sequences using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). These gut analyses were used to generate relative and taxon-specific prey consumption indices for the major predator taxa and to determine relative consumption levels during D. virgifera egg and larval stages by predator feeding guilds. Laboratory feeding assays were used to determine the meal size consumed during 5 min and digestion rates of D. virgifera DNA of four predators abundant in D. virgifera-infested cornfields. More than 17 taxa consumed D. virgifera in the field. Harvestmen and small rove beetles were the most abundant predators captured, and the most frequent predators within the community to consume D. virgifera. The largest proportions of individual species' populations testing positive for D. virgifera DNA were found in ground beetles (Scarites quadriceps and Poecilus chalcites) and spiders, wolf spiders, and predaceous mites. Because of the longer duration of the egg stage, significantly more predators consumed D. virgifera eggs than larvae, but a similar proportion of the predator community fed on eggs and larvae. Predators with sucking mouthparts had a higher consumption index than chewing predators. Laboratory assays confirmed that sucking predators consume more D. virgifera DNA during 5 min than the chewing predators, and all four predators digested this DNA at a similar rate. This research substantiates that a diverse community of soil-dwelling and subterranean predators contribute to the high level of mortality incurred by D. virgifera in cornfields (similar to 99% pre-adult mortality). Moreover, qPCR is a useful tool for describing trophic relationships within subterranean food webs, a crucial step in determining the relative contributions of a diverse predator community to the population dynamics of an herbivorous arthropod.

AB Tropical ecosystems play a key role in the global carbon cycle, but their response to global warming is not well understood. Altitudinal gradients offer the unique possibility of undertaking in situ experimental studies of the influence of alterations in climate on the carbon (C) cycle. In a soil-translocation experiment we took replicate soil cores at 3030 m, 1500 m, 1000 m and 200 m above sea level along an altitudinal gradient in tropical forest in Peru, and exchanged (i.e. translocated) them among these sites to observe the influence of altered climatic conditions on the decomposition of soil organic matter under natural field conditions. Soil respiration rates of the translocated soil cores and adjacent undisturbed soils were measured twice a month from April 2007 to October 2007. The temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic respiration in each core was examined using a Lloyd & Taylor function and a simple modified third-order polynomial fit. Calculated Q(10) values decreased with decreasing altitude using both mathematical functions (2.53-1.24 according to the Lloyd & Taylor function, and 2.56-0.63 using the polynomial fit). Soil organic C-stocks increased markedly and linearly with altitude, but surprisingly the average total soil respiration rate did not vary significantly with altitude along the transect (3.98-4.31 mu mol CO(2) m-2 s-1). This implies an increase with elevation of absolute C allocation to below-ground allocation.

AB The nitrogen stable isotope ratio of biological tissue has been proposed as an indicator of anthropogenic N inputs to aquatic ecosystems, but overlap in the isotopic signatures of various N sources and transformations make definitive attribution of processes difficult. We collected primary consumer invertebrates from streams in agricultural settings in Wisconsin, USA, to evaluate the relative influence of animal manure, inorganic fertilizer, and denitrification on biotic delta(15)N. Variance in biotic delta(15)N was explained by inorganic fertilizer inputs and the percentage of wetland land cover in the watershed, but not by animal manure inputs. These results suggest that denitrification of inorganic fertilizer is the primary driver of delta(15)N variability among the study sites. Comparison with previously collected stream water NO(3)-N concentrations at the same sites supports the role of denitrification; for a given N application rate, streams with high biotic delta(15)N had low NO(3)-N concentrations. The lack of a manure signal in biotic delta(15)N may be due its high ammonia content, which can be dispersed outside the range of its application by volatilization. Based on our findings and on agricultural census data for the entire United States, inorganic fertilizer is more likely than manure to drive variability in biotic delta(15)N and to cause excessive nitrogen concentrations in streams.

These strains exhibit differential temporal patterns of female calling and copulation during scotophase, with the corn strain more active earlier in the night. We investigated strain-specific constraints in reproductive timing, mating interactions between the two strains, and the mode of inheritance of timing of female calling, male calling, copulation and oviposition. We observed an allochronic shift of all reproductive behaviours by approximately 3 h and a parallel shift of nonreproductive locomotor activity, suggesting involvement of the circadian clock. The corn strain was more variable in the timing of calling and copulation than the rice strain. Rice strain females were more restricted in the timing of copulation than rice strain males, while such differences between the sexes were not apparent in the corn strain. There were significant interactions between the strains affecting onset times of copulation and male calling. The four investigated reproductive traits differed in their modes of inheritance: timing of female and male calling exhibited strong maternal effects, timing of copulation was controlled by a combination of maternal effects and corn strain dominant autosomal factors, and timing of oviposition was inherited in a corn strain dominant fashion. We conclude that the allochronic separation of reproduction between fall armyworm strains is asymmetric, less pronounced than previously thought, and under complex genetic control.

AB The Red Queen coevolutionary hypothesis predicts that parasites drive oscillations in host genotype frequencies due to frequency-dependent selection where common hosts are at disadvantage. However, examples of this phenomenon in natural populations are scarce. To examine if the Red Queen theory operates in the wild, we studied the genetic structure of populations of the crustacean waterflea (Daphnia), in relation to their infection levels, for which we collected multiple samples from a variety of lakes. The most common clone in a given population was often underinfected. This advantage, however, did not remain stable over time. Instead, the most common clone decreased in frequency over subsequent generations, indicating that parasites can track common clones. Such decreases were not observed in uninfected populations. Moreover, host clonal evenness was higher across the set of infected lakes compared to uninfected lakes; suggesting that any common clone is selected against when parasites are present. These results strongly suggest that Red Queen dynamics do operate in the wild.

AB The genus Cytinus is composed of rootless, stemless and leafless parasites whose flowers are only visible during the reproductive period when they arise from the host tissues. Most of the taxa occur in Madagascar and South Africa, where mammal pollination has been suggested for one species. There is only one species in the Mediterranean region, and its pollination system has been unknown. Here, a long-term field observation study is combined with experimental pollination treatments in order to assess the pollination biology and reproductive system in the Mediterranean species Cytinus hypocistis.
   Field studies were carried out in six populations in southern Spain over 4 years. Temporal and spatial patterns of variation in the composition and behaviour of floral visitors were characterized. Pollen loads and pollen viability were observed, and exclusion and controlled-pollination treatments were also conducted.
   Cytinus hypocistis is a self-compatible monoecious species that relies on insects for seed production. Ants were the main visitors, accounting for 97.4 % of total floral visits, and exclusion experiments showed that they act as true pollinators. They consistently touched reproductive organs, carried large pollen loads and transported viable pollen, although the different ant species observed in the flowers differed in their pollination effectiveness. The abundance of flying visitors was surprisingly low, and only the fly Oplisa aterrima contributed to fruit production and cross-pollination.
   Mutualistic services by ant are essential for the pollination of Cytinus hypocistis. Although this parasite does not exhibit typical features of the 'ant-pollination syndrome', many other characteristics indicate that it is evolving to a more specialized ant-pollination system. The striking interspecific differences in the pollination systems of Mediterranean Cytinus (ant-pollinated) and some South African Cytinus (mammal-pollinated) make this genus an excellent model to investigate the divergent evolution of pollination systems in broadly disjunct areas.

AB Short-term changes in plant species number, frequency and composition were studied along an altitudinal gradient crossing four summits from the treeline ecotone to the subnival zone in the South Alps (Dolomites, Italy). Large-scale (summit areas) and small-scale patterns (16 plots of 1 mA(2)/summit) were monitored. After 5 years, a re-visitation of the summit areas revealed a considerable increase of species richness at the upper alpine and subnival zone (10% and 9%, respectively) and relatively modest increases at the lower alpine zone and the treeline ecotone (3% and 1%, respectively). At the small scale, the results were partly different, with species richness decreasing at the lower summits and increasing at the higher summits. The changes can most likely be attributed to climate warming effects and to competitive interactions. The main newcomers at the lower three summits were species from the treeline and the lower altitudinal zones. Only at the highest summit, the newcomers came from the alpine species pool. At the treeline ecotone, the abundance of Pinus cembra, of dwarf shrubs and clonal graminoid species increased. Here, displacements of alpine species may be predicted for the near future. At the higher summits, expansions of the established alpine species and further invasions of species from lower altitudes are forecasted.

AB Females that are socially bonded to a single male, either in a social monogamy or in a social polygyny, are often sexually polyandrous. Extrapair copulations (EPC) have often been suggested or rejected, on both empirical and theoretical grounds, as an important mechanism that enables females to avoid fertility risks in case their socially bonded male is infertile. Here, we explore this possibility in two steps. First, we present a mathematical model that assumes that females have no precopulatory information about male fertility, and shows that a female EPC strategy increases female reproductive success only if certain specific conditions are upheld in the nature of male infertility. In particular, these conditions require both (i) that fertile sperm precedence (FSP) is absent or incomplete within ejaculates of the same male (i.e. that an infertile male is, at least partly, truly infertile), and (ii) the existence of FSP among ejaculates of different males (such that infertile spermatozoa of the infertile male are at a disadvantage when competing against spermatozoa of a fertile male). Second, to evaluate their potential role in the evolution of female EPC, we review the abundance and FSP patterns of the different male infertility types. The conclusion is drawn that some common infertility types, such as poor sperm count or motility, contribute to the evolution of female EPC, whereas other common infertility types, such as sperm depletion or allocation in a social monogamy (but not in a social polygyny), and in particular male driven polyspermy, do not. Also, a deeper look at the arms race between sperm fertilization efficiency and female barriers to sperm may answer the non-trivial question: "why are some types of infertility so common?".

AB Environmental conditions affect growth and development and, through developmental plasticity, create phenotypic variation. In suboptimal conditions current survival is traded-off against development. Corticosterone, the main glucocorticoid in birds, may be involved in the reallocation of energy from growth to maintenance, but its effect on growth has rarely been investigated in altricial birds under natural conditions in the wild. In free-living Eurasian kestrel Falco tinnunculus nestlings, we artificially elevated corticosterone to stress-induced levels over 2-3days in the middle of the nestling stage by implanting biodegradable implants, controlling the treatment with a placebo group. We measured the length of primary feather 8, hand length, tarsus length, body mass and subcutaneous fat stores from day 10 to 25. During corticosterone elevation, primary growth of cort-nestlings was significantly reduced to 71% of placebo-nestlings, hand and tarsus growth were significantly reduced to 14% and 26% of placebo-nestlings, respectively, and body mass increase stopped, while subcutaneous fat-store growth was not affected. Over the following 5 days, primary growth was still significantly suppressed to 84% of placebo-nestlings, while hand, tarsus and body mass growth were back to normal. During the subsequent 4 days, cort-nestlings partly compensated for the lag in body mass by significantly accelerating the body mass increase compared with placebo-nestlings. Before fledging, primary length was 10% shorter, hand and tarsus 5% and 4% shorter and body mass 8.5% lower in cort- nestlings than in placebo-nestlings, while fat score did not differ significantly between the two groups. Thus, we have shown that in free-living, altricial nestlings a few days of elevated plasma corticosterone levels alone, without food restriction, suppressed growth and this could only partly be compensated for afterwards. Feather, bone and body mass growth were reduced to different degrees, indicating that corticosterone had a differential effect on different structures. This demonstrates that corticosterone is probably involved in the control of developmental plasticity.

   GRASSLANDS; CLIMATE; DIFFERENTIATION; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; ECOLOGY
AB Studying plant invasions along environmental gradients is a promising approach to dissect the relative importance of multiple interacting factors that affect the spread of a species in a new range. Along altitudinal gradients, factors such as propagule pressure, climatic conditions and biotic interactions change simultaneously across rather small geographic scales. Here we investigate the distribution of eight Asteraceae forbs along mountain roads in both their native and introduced ranges in the Valais (southern Swiss Alps) and the Wallowa Mountains (northeastern Oregon, USA). We hypothesised that a lack of adaptation and more limiting propagule pressure at higher altitudes in the new range restricts the altitudinal distribution of aliens relative to the native range. However, all but one of the species reached the same or even a higher altitude in the new range. Thus neither the need to adapt to changing climatic conditions nor lower propagule pressure at higher altitudes appears to have prevented the altitudinal spread of introduced populations. We found clear differences between regions in the relative occurrence of alien species in ruderal sites compared to roadsides, and in the degree of invasion away from the roadside, presumably reflecting differences in disturbance patterns between regions. Whilst the upper altitudinal limits of these plant invasions are apparently climatically constrained, factors such as anthropogenic disturbance and competition with native vegetation appear to have greater influence than changing climatic conditions on the distribution of these alien species along altitudinal gradients.

AB Given that urban landscapes often act as a point of entry for many non-native species and urban development continues to increase as the human population rapidly expands, an understanding of the interaction between urbanization and non-native plant species is important both in the control of potentially invasive species and in the conservation of native biodiversity. We investigated the spatial and temporal relationship between urban land cover and the distribution of non-native species in Britain using two floristic data sets collected at two different time periods: 1987-88 and 2003-04.
   UK.
   Using floristic data collected by the Botanical Society of the British Isles in 1987-88 (Monitoring Scheme) and 2003-04 (Local Change) in conjunction with habitat data obtained from the Land Cover Map of the UK, we conducted multiple regression analyses both within and between years on both groups of species (natives, neophytes and archaeophytes) and individual species.
   Neophytes (alien species introduced after 1500) were very strongly associated with urban land cover in both time periods and do not appear to be spreading out of urban habitats into the wider countryside. Archaeophytes (alien species introduced before 1500), however, showed a strong association with urban habitats in the earlier 1988 data set but no longer showed this association in the 2004 data set. Analysis at the individual species level showed that a large percentage of alien plant species, particularly archaeophytes, were not strongly associated with urban land cover or were negatively associated with such habitats.
   Our results suggest that there has been a reduction in the urban association of archaeophytes that is likely to have resulted from the recovery of archaeophytes associated with non-urban (especially arable) habitats, following their decline in mid-20th century, rather than from the movement of aliens into the wider countryside from urban habitats.

AB The effects of seasonal inundation on the biology of fishes on floodplains of large Amazonian rivers are well studied. However, the small seasonal changes in headwater streams are generally considered to have little effect on fish assemblages.
   In this study, we analysed seasonal changes in the species composition and abundance of fish in small Amazonian forest streams. We sampled fish with hand and seine nets in headwater streams in a 10 000 ha terra-firme forest reserve near Manaus, Brazil. Each stream was surveyed at the end of the 2005 dry season, at the beginning of the 2006 rainy season and at the beginning of the 2006 dry season, by means of a standardized sampling effort.
   The numbers of individuals and species caught were higher in the dry season, but rarefaction analyses indicated that greater species numbers could have been due simply to the larger number of individuals caught.
   Between the dry and rainy season, the direction of changes in species composition in multivariate space varied among sites, especially for quantitative (abundance) data. However, the observed variation among sites was the less than expected if the directions of change were random.
   Fish assemblages in the second dry season were more similar to those in the previous dry season than expected if changes in species composition among seasons were random. This indicates that a general seasonal pattern in fish assemblages can be detected, despite the existence of some erratic site-specific changes.
   Most of the species that showed large seasonal variations in density occupy temporary ponds during the rainy season, when much of the valley is inundated and pond networks form adjacent to streams. Short-duration lateral migrations to these ponds may play an important role in the seasonal fish-assemblage dynamics in Amazonian headwater streams.
   Our results contrast with previous studies on small Amazonian streams, which have found little seasonal change in fish assemblages, and highlight the importance of the abundance of common species as an indicator of general fish assemblage structure in biological monitoring programmes.

TI Avian Incubation Inhibits Growth and Diversification of Bacterial
   Assemblages on Eggs
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Microbial infection is a critical source of mortality for early life stages of oviparous vertebrates, but parental defenses against infection are less well known. Avian incubation has been hypothesized to reduce the risk of trans-shell infection by limiting microbial growth of pathogenic bacteria on eggshells, while enhancing growth of commensal or beneficial bacteria that inhibit or competitively exclude pathogens. We tested this hypothesis by comparing bacterial assemblages on naturally incubated and experimentally unincubated eggs at laying and late incubation using a universal 16S rRNA microarray containing probes for over 8000 bacterial taxa. Before treatment, bacterial assemblages on individual eggs from both treatment groups were dissimilar to one another, as measured by clustering in non-metric dimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination space. After treatment, assemblages of unincubated eggs were similar to one another, but those of incubated eggs were not. Furthermore, assemblages of unincubated eggs were characterized by high abundance of six indicator species while incubated eggs had no indicator species. Bacterial taxon richness remained static on incubated eggs, but increased significantly on unincubated eggs, especially in several families of Gram-negative bacteria. The relative abundance of individual bacterial taxa did not change on incubated eggs, but that of 82 bacterial taxa, including some known to infect the interior of eggs, increased on unincubated eggs. Thus, incubation inhibits all of the relatively few bacteria that grow on eggshells, and does not appear to promote growth of any bacteria.

AB 1. Natural climatic driven tree line positions follow a mean growing season temperature of around 6 degrees C in seasonal as well as non-seasonal climates. The influence of constant vs. variable temperature regimes on growth was explored by experimentally exposing 2-year-old seedlings of two montane conifer species (Larix decidua and Pinus mugo) to either constant temperatures of 6 degrees C or 12 degrees C, or seasonally and diurnally changing temperatures that varied around the same means (covering a 13-K amplitude across the season).
   2. In both species, exposure to 6 degrees C during a 20-week growing season reduced growth dramatically in constant as well as variable temperature treatments. Nevertheless, new biomass production was still measurable at 6 degrees C, indicating that a complete cessation of growth occurs at a lower temperature.
   3. The biomass increment by the end of the season was hardly influenced by the presence or absence of temperature variation for both, the 6 degrees C and 12 degrees C mean treatments. While seasonal and diurnal variable temperatures had a slightly positive effect on growth compared to a full season at constant temperatures in the deciduous Larix, biomass increments of the evergreen Pinus were the same at constant and variable temperature treatments.
   4. End of season sugar and starch concentrations in different tissues revealed higher concentrations in cold treated seedlings at constant and varying temperatures. In line with previous field data, low temperatures did not lead to carbon depletion (carbon limitation). We thus assume a stronger impact of cool temperatures on meristematic processes (sink activity) than on photosynthesis (source activity).
   5. Synthesis. The similar growth rates of trees in experimentally constant vs. variable growing season temperatures match field observations. Although metabolic responses to temperature are nonlinear, this implies an overall quasi-linear' response of growth to temperature in trees at their lower temperature limit, which awaits further explanation. The higher concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates in cold treated seedlings support the sink-limitation hypothesis of plant growth in cold climates.

AB Traditionally, it has been suggested that variation in locomotor mode should be correlated with variation in the anatomy of the structures responsible for locomotion. Indeed, organisms can expand their ecological niche by using specialized traits of the locomotor system including hooks, claws, adhesive pads, etc. Despite the fact that claws are the most common biological mechanism of clinging in vertebrates, little is known about their function or evolutionary relationship to habitat use. The present study focuses on claw morphology in 57 species of iguanian lizards occupying different microhabitats. Qualitative differences in claw shape were explored by means of digital photographs, and quantitative measurements of the length, height and curvature of the claws of both fingers and toes were taken and correlated to information on microhabitat use obtained from the literature. Our analyses showed a strong phylogenetic component that obscured relationships between morphology and ecology. Our results also show differences in claw morphology between species that appear to be related to microhabitat use (climbing versus terrestrial species), with the best ecological descriptors being claw length and height. Performance measures and biomechanical analyses of claw function may consequently be better suited to explain the evolution of claw shape in relation to habitat use in this group.

AB Proximate and ultimate causes of dispersal in vertebrates vary, and relative importance of these causes is poorly understood. Among populations, inter- and intrasexual social cues for dispersal are thought to reduce inbreeding and local mate competition, respectively, and specific emigration cue may affect dispersal distance, such that inbreeding avoidance dispersal tends to be farther than dispersal to reduce local competition. To investigate potential occurrence of multiple proximate and ultimate causes of dispersal within populations, we radio-marked 363 juvenile male white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in 2 study areas in Pennsylvania. Natal dispersal probability and distance were monitored over a 3-year period when large-scale management changes reduced density of adult females and increased density of adult males. Most dispersal (95-97%) occurred during two 12-week periods: spring, when yearling males still closely associate with related females, and prior to fall breeding season, when yearling males closely associate with other breeding-age males. Following changes to sex and age structure that reduced potential for inbreeding and increased potential for mate competition, annual dispersal probability did not change; however, probability of spring dispersal decreased, whereas probability of fall dispersal increased. Spring dispersal distances were greater than fall dispersal distances, suggesting that adaptive inbreeding avoidance dispersal requires greater distance than mate competition dispersal where opposite-sex relatives are philopatric and populations are not patchily distributed. Both inbreeding avoidance and mate competition are important ultimate causes of dispersal of white-tailed deer, but ultimate motivations for dispersal are proximately cued by different social mechanisms and elicit different responses in dispersers.

AB 1. The recognition that both local and regional processes act together in shaping local communities makes determining their relative roles in natural communities central to understanding patterns in community structure.
   2. We investigated the relative influence of these processes on the phytoplankton communities of a highly interconnected pond system. We sampled the phytoplankton communities of 28 ponds concurrently with 20 local environmental variables.
   3. We found that phytoplankton community variation, in terms of both phytoplankton community composition (PCC) and diversity, was only significantly explained by local environmental variables. These were mainly associated with the contrasting clear-water and turbid ecological states of the shallow ponds studied. Clear-water conditions favoured only a few taxa, resulting in a significantly lower taxon diversity and richness under these conditions.
   4. The failure to explain variation in PCC by a dispersal model based on the water flow between ponds points at very effective species sorting. This is attributed to the high population turn-over rates and sensitivity to environmental conditions of phytoplankton communities. Some evidence was found, however, that dispersal influences local communities through mass effects between neighbouring ponds.
   5. Overall, our results emphasize both the strong selection pressure that components of the food web exert on phytoplankton communities and the high potential of these communities to respond to such environmental change, thereby effectively opposing the homogenizing effects of continuous dispersal.

AB Natural hybrid zones between distinct species have been reported for many taxa, but so far, few examples involve carnivores or Neotropical mammals in general. In this study, we employed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and nine microsatellite loci to identify and characterize a hybrid zone between two Neotropical felids, Leopardus geoffroyi and L. tigrinus, both of which are well-established species having diverged from each other c. 1 million years ago. These two felids are mostly allopatric throughout their ranges in South America, with a narrow contact zone that includes southern Brazil. We present strong evidence for the occurrence of hybridization between these species and identify at least 14 individuals (most of them originating from the geographical contact zone) exhibiting signs of interspecific genomic introgression. The genetic structure of Brazilian L. tigrinus populations seems to be affected by this introgression process, showing a gradient of differentiation from L. geoffroyi correlated with distance from the contact zone. We also corroborate and extend previous findings of hybridization between L. tigrinus and a third related felid, L. colocolo, leading to an unusual situation for a mammal, in which the former species contains introgressed mtDNA lineages from two distinct taxa in addition to its own.

AB There is great interest in using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers because they are inexpensive and easy to produce. It is, therefore, possible to generate a large number of markers that have a wide coverage of species genotnes. Several statistical methods have been proposed to study the genetic structure using AFLP's but they assume Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and do not estimate the inbreeding coefficient, F-IS. A Bayesian method has been proposed by Holsinger and colleagues that relaxes these simplifying assumptions but we have identified two sources of bias that can influence estimates based on these markers: (i) the use of a uniform prior on ancestral allele frequencies and (ii) the ascertainment bias of AFLP markers. We present a new Bayesian method that avoids these biases by using an implementation based on the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) algorithm. This new method estimates population-specific F-IS and F-ST values and offers users the possibility of taking into account the criteria for selecting the markers that are used in the analyses. The software is available at our web site (http://www-leca.uif-grenoble.fi-/logiciels.htm). Finally, we provide advice on how to avoid the effects of ascertainment bias.

AB Characterizing the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS), USA, has gained much attention over the past several decades because of apparent changes in the benthic community structure over space and time representative of patterns occurring in the Caribbean region. We used a 5-year dataset (1996-2000) of macroalgal and sponge cover and water quality measurements as predictor variables of hard coral community structure in the FKNMS. The 16 water quality variables were summarized into 4 groups by principal component analysis (PCA). Hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis of the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the principal component scores of water quality variables separated the reef sites into two main groups (and five sub-groups), referred to as reefs of similar influence (RSI). The main groups corresponded with their geographical locations within the Florida Keys: the reefs in the Upper and Middle Keys being homogeneous and collectively, having lower water quality scores relative to reefs in the Lower Keys. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) between hard coral cover and key predictor variables (i.e., water quality, macroalgal cover and sponge cover) also separated the reefs in the Lower Keys from reefs in the Upper-Middle Keys, consistent with results of the cluster analysis, which categorized reefs based on RSI. These results suggest that the prevailing gradient of predictor variables may have influenced the structuring of coral reef communities at a spatial scale larger than the individual reef. Furthermore, it is conceivable that these predictor variables exerted influence for a long time rather than being a recent event. Results also revealed a pattern showing reduction in hard coral cover and species richness, and subsequent proliferation of macroalgae and sponges during the study period. Our analyses of the Florida Keys present a pattern that is consistent with the characteristics of a reef that has undergone a "phase-shift," a phenomenon that is widely reported in the Caribbean region.

AB Changes in species composition and diversity are the inevitable consequences of climate change, as well as land use and land cover change. Predicting species richness at regional spatial scales using remotely sensed biophysical variables has emerged as a viable mechanism for monitoring species distribution. In this study, we evaluate the utility of MODIS-based productivity (GPP and EVI) and surface water content (NDSVI and LSWI) in predicting species richness in the semi-arid region of Inner Mongolia, China. We found that these metrics correlated well with plant species richness and could be used in biome- and life form-specific models. The relationships were evaluated on the basis of county-level data recorded from the Flora of Inner Mongolia, stratified by administrative (i.e., counties), biome boundaries (desert, grassland, and forest), and grouped by life forms (trees, grasses, bulbs, annuals and shrubs). The predictor variables included: the annual, mean, maximum, seasonal midpoint (EVImid), standard deviation of MODIS-derived GPP, EVI, LSWI and NDSVI. The regional pattern of species richness correlated with GPP(SD) (R-2=0.27), which was also the best predictor for bulbs, perennial herbs and shrubs (R-2=0.36, 0.29 and 0.40, respectively). The predictive power of models improved when counties with >50% of cropland were excluded from the analysis, where the seasonal dynamics of productivity and species richness deviate patterns in natural systems. When stratified by biome, GPPSD remained the best predictor of species richness in grasslands (R-2=0.3 0), whereas the most variability was explained by NDSVImax in forests (R-2=0.26), and LSWIavg in deserts (R-2=0.61). The results demonstrated that biophysical estimates of productivity and water content can be used to predict plant species richness at the regional and biome levels. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Algal cell size exerts a fundamental influence on the stable isotopic fractionation during photosynthesis and biocalcification, as well as the incorporation of trace elements in coccolith calcite by calcifying haptophytes (the coccolithophores). Therefore, it is important to evaluate the influence of ancient coccolithophore cell size on coccolithophorid-derived geochemical proxies that are applied in paleoceanographic studies. However, in contrast to planktonic foraminifera, for which cell size may be directly estimated from their fossilized calcite shells, the reconstruction of ancient coccolithophore cell dimensions appears hampered because the sediment record is dominated by single coccoliths, rather than intact coccospheres - the armor of multiple interlocking calcite platelets that surround live cells.
   Solving this apparent problem, this paper presents quantitative constraints on coccolith size, coccosphere and cell diameters, for three main Cenozoic genera of coccolithophore (Reticulofenestra, Cyclicargolithus and Coccolithus) through detailed biometry of rarely fossilized coccospheres of middle Eocene to early Miocene age. Together, these taxa are most dominant in Cenozoic deep-sea sediments, providing an exquisitely detailed record of their evolution and the bulk of biogenic carbonate burial through time. Accurate estimates of coccolithophore cell size can be made by relatively simple size measurements of individual coccoliths in fossil assemblages, since coccolith size is strongly linearly correlated to both coccosphere- and cell diameter. Additional general coccolith 'size rules' are confirmed by the morphometric data: (1) coccolith thickness increases with size, (2) elliptical placoliths are more circular at larger size, and (3) the number of coccoliths per coccosphere is rather invariable within the investigated Cenozoic genera. The latter observation offers better control on (minimum) estimates of cellular calcite quota in the ancestors of today's prolific bloom-forming species Emiliania huxleyi, Gephyrocapsa spp. and Coccolithus pelagicus.

AB Understanding the local and regional patterns of species distributions has been a major goal of ecological and evolutionary research. The notion that these patterns can be understood through simple quantitative rules is attractive, but while numerous scaling laws exist (e. g., metabolic, fractals), we are aware of no studies that have placed individual traits and community structure together within a genetics based scaling framework. We document the potential for a genetic basis to the scaling of ecological communities, largely based upon our long-term studies of poplars (Populus spp.). The genetic structure and diversity of these foundation species affects riparian ecosystems and determines a much larger community of dependent organisms. Three examples illustrate these ideas. First, there is a strong genetic basis to phytochemistry and tree architecture (both above- and belowground), which can affect diverse organisms and ecosystem processes. Second, empirical studies in the wild show that the local patterns of genetics based community structure scale up to western North America. At multiple spatial scales the arthropod community phenotype is related to the genetic distance among plants that these arthropods depend upon for survival. Third, we suggest that the familiar species-area curve, in which species richness is a function of area, is also a function of genetic diversity. We find that arthropod species richness is closely correlated with the genetic marker diversity and trait variance suggesting a genetic component to these curves. Finally, we discuss how genetic variation can interact with environmental variation to affect community attributes across geographic scales along with conservation implications.

AB Various exogenous or endogenous factors may induce an emergency response in birds, redirecting current activity towards survival. In fasting, breeding penguins, the achievement of a critical energy depletion was suggested to induce egg abandonment and departure to sea for re-feeding. How such a behavioral shift is hormonally controlled remains unknown. The possible involvement of corticosterone and prolactin was examined by characterizing the nutritional and hormonal states of king penguins at egg abandonment. Further, we tested if these states differ according to whether an egg or a chick is abandoned, and according to the timing of breeding. In every case of abandonment, birds were in phase III fasting characterized by accelerated protein catabolism. However, body condition at egg abandonment was lower in early than in late breeders, suggesting that king penguins are willing to tolerate a larger energy depletion when their potential breeding success is high. At egg and chick abandonment, plasma corticosterone levels were, respectively, increased by 2- and 4-fold, whereas plasma prolactin levels were, respectively, depressed by 3- and 1.4-fold. The increase in plasma corticosterone and the decrease in plasma prolactin could be involved in the control of abandonment by, respectively, stimulating the drive to re-feed and diminishing the drive to incubate or brood. The smaller decrease in prolactin levels and the greater increase in corticosterone levels observed at chick vs egg abandonment suggest that, in addition to nutritionally-related stimuli, tactile or audible stimuli from the egg or chick could intervene in the endocrine control of abandonment.

AB The distribution of genetic variability across a species' range can provide valuable insights into colonization history. To assess the relative importance of European and Asian refugia in shaping current levels of genetic variation in the greater horseshoe bats, we applied a microsatellite-based approach to data collected from 56 localities ranging from the UK to Japan. A decline in allelic richness from west Asia to the UK and analyses of F-ST both imply a northwestward colonization across Europe. However, sharp discontinuities in gene frequencies within Europe and between the Balkans and west Asia (Syria/Russia) are consistent with suture zones following expansion from multiple refugia, and a lack of recent gene flow from Asia Minor. Together, these results suggest European populations originated from west Asia in the ancient past, and experienced a more recent range expansion since the Last Glacial Maximum. Current populations in central Europe appear to originate from the Balkans and those from west Europe from either Iberia and/or Italy. Comparisons of R-ST and F-ST suggest that stepwise mutation has contributed to differentiation between island and continental populations (France/UK and China/Japan) and also among distant samples. However, pairwise R-ST values between distant populations appear to be unreliable, probably due to size homoplasy. Our findings also highlight two priorities for conservation. First, stronger genetic subdivision within the UK than across 4000 km of continental Eurasia is most likely the result of population fragmentation and highlights the need to maintain gene flow in this species. Second, deep splits within China and between Europe and China are indicative of cryptic taxonomic divisions which need further investigation.

AB Waterfowl and shorebirds are common reservoirs of the low pathogenic subtypes of avian influenza (LPAI), which are easily transmitted to poultry and become highly pathogenic. As the risk of virus transmission depends on the prevalence of LPAI in host-reservoir systems, there is an urgent need for understanding how host ecology, life history and behaviour can affect virus prevalence in the wild. To test for the most important ecological correlates of LPAI virus prevalence at the interspecific level, we applied a comparative analysis by using quantitative data on 30 bird species. We controlled for similarity among species due to common descent, differences in study effort and for covariance among ecological variables. We found that LPAI prevalence is a species-specific attribute and is a consequence of virus susceptibility, as it was negatively associated with the relative size of the bursa of Fabricius, an estimate of juvenile immune function. Species that migrate long distances have elevated prevalence of LPAI independent of phylogeny and other confounding factors. There was also a positive interspecific relationship between the frequency of surface feeding and virus prevalence, but this was sensitive to phylogenetic relatedness of species. Feeding in marine habitats is apparently associated with lower virus prevalence, but the effect of water salinity is likely to be indirect and affected by phylogeny. Our results imply that virus transmission via surface waters and frequent intra- and interspecific contacts during long migration are the major risk factors of avian influenza in the wild. However, the link between exploitation of surface waters and LPAI prevalence appears to be weaker than previously thought. This is the first interspecific study that provides statistical evidence that host ecology, immunity and phylogeny have important consequence for virus prevalence.

AB In polyandrous species, females may influence paternity by biasing sperm usage in favour of particular males. In the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, the number of sperm inseminated in a copulation depends on the female's perception of male attractiveness. We videorecorded copulations in the laboratory to test the hypothesis that there is a positive correlation between the number of sperm inseminated and the duration of the copulation. Duration was positively correlated with the number of sperm retrieved from the female's gonoduct. Once copulation duration was statistically controlled for, more sperm were retrieved from the gonoduct in courtship copulations than in coercive copulations, and in postpartum females than in virgin females. Copulation duration was positively correlated with the degree of carotenoid coloration of the male, suggesting that copulation duration might be the proximate mechanism of cryptic female choice in this species. The intensity of 'jerking', a postcopulatory behaviour of male guppies, was positively correlated with the number of sperm inseminated, suggesting a possible signalling function of this display.

AB Biological indicators are being increasingly used to rapidly monitor changing river quality. Among these bioindicators are macroinvertebrates. A short-coming of macroinvertebrate rapid assessments is that they use higher taxa, and therefore lack taxonomic resolution and species-specific responses. One subset of invertebrate taxa is the Odonata, which as adults, are sensitive indicators of both riparian and river conditions. Yet adult Odonata are not necessarily an umbrella taxon for all other taxa. Therefore, we investigated whether the two metrics of aquatic macroinvertebrate higher taxa and adult odonate species might complement each other, and whether together they provide better clarity on river health and integrity than one subset alone. Results indicated that both metrics provide a similar portrait of large-scale, overall river conditions. At the smaller spatial scale of parts of rivers, Odonata were highly sensitive to riparian vegetation, and much more so than macroinvertebrate higher taxa. Odonate species were more sensitive to vegetation structure than they were to vegetation composition. Landscape context is also important, with the odonate assemblages at point localities being affected by the neighbouring dominant habitat type. Overall, benthic macroinvertebrates and adult Odonata species provide a highly complementary pair of metrics which together provide large spatial scale (river system) and small spatial scale (point localities) information on the impact of stressors such as riparian invasive alien trees. As adult Odonata are easy to sample and are sensitive to disturbance at both small and large spatial scales, they are valuable indicators for rapid assessment of river condition and riparian quality.

AB Landscape fragmentation is increasingly considered an important environmental indicator in the fields of sustainable land use and biodiversity. To set goals for future development and to plan appropriate measures, suitable empirical data on the degree of landscape fragmentation are needed to identify trends and compare different regions. However, there is still a significant lack of data on landscape fragmentation as an indicator, despite the substantial scientific literature on this topic, likely because of confusion over the definition of "fragmentation," questions associated with scale and data issues, and lack of general agreement on a fragmentation measure. This study presents a state-wide quantitative analysis of landscape fragmentation in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany, by means of the " effective mesh size" (m(eff)), which characterizes the anthropogenic penetration of landscapes from a geometric point of view and is based on the probability that two randomly chosen points in a landscape are connected, i.e., not separated by barriers such as roads, railroads, or urban areas. Baden-Wurttemberg is fragmented to a far greater extent than indicated by previous studies. The m(eff) has decreased by 40% since 1930. This development is strongly related to the growing number of inhabitants, the increased use of motorized vehicles, and the hierarchical regional planning system based on the central place theory. To illustrate the suitability of the meff method for environmental monitoring, as a planning instrument and as an assessment instrument for impact assessment studies, we explored several variations of applying the method with regard to choice of fragmenting elements, consideration of noise bands, spatial differentiation (e. g., administrative districts vs. ecoregions), and way of dealing with patches at the boundaries of the reporting units. Depending on the objectives of the investigation (e. g., recreational quality vs. suitability for wildlife habitat), different variations may be most appropriate. The insights and quantitative results from Baden-Wurttemberg provide a yardstick for analyzing and assessing landscape fragmentation in other countries.

AB Understanding the processes that develop and maintain diversity in coastal communities is an important challenge, particularly given the conservation and management needs of these ecosystems. Such diversity patterns include not only species distributions and interactions, but also variation in genetic diversity. Alongshore variations in allele frequency along coastal oceans are controlled by interactions between physical and biological forces. Here we model these interactions in terms of Lagrangian descriptors of nearshore physical oceanography, the life history dynamics of an individual species and habitat quality. This model allows us to define population boundaries within the species range as a function of ocean circulation, spatial habitat variability and larval characteristics. From this, we can find quantitative criteria for the persistence of regions of alongshore genetic variation. Our results show quantitatively that the existence of phylogeographic patterns in species with high dispersal capacity along uniform coasts with typical mean currents is surprising, and requires either strong selection gradients, alongshore variation in ocean currents and/or habitat quality, or a mixture of both. Our model suggests that marine reserves and the harvesting of marine recources can dramatically modify spatial gradients in genetic diversity.

AB Ecologists are under pressure to anticipate the ecological effects of climate change. Therefore many ecological publications (and most grant proposals) related to climate claim relevance to the projection of future climate change effects. Yet the steps leading from ecological description and understanding to reliable projection are rarely explicit. A good understanding of the factors which allow the ecological effects of climate change to be effectively anticipated is critical to both the quality of basic science and its application to public policy. We used research performed on mammals to explore scientific approaches to anticipation of climate change effects. We distinguished forecasting models based on correlations from predictive models based on cause-effect relationships. These categories represent extremes along a continuous gradient between pattern description and causal understanding. We suggest that the constraints to our capacity to anticipate fall into 6 broad categories rooted in the development and application of forecasting and predictive models. These categories help to identify the conditions that allow or prevent projection of the effects of climate change on ecosystems. This approach should also help to identify which research avenues will likely be most fruitful.

AB Alcoa World Alumina Australia has been rehabilitating bauxite mines in the jarrah forest of Western Australia for more than 35 years. An experiment was established in 1988 using three different seed treatments (legume and small understorey mix, small understorey mix only, and no seed) and two fertilizer treatments (N and P, and P only). The objectives of this study were to (1) document vegetation changes in the first 14 years after bauxite mining; (2) assess whether the vegetation is becoming more similar to the unmined forest; and (3) gain a better understanding of successional processes. Seed treatments significantly affected 13 of the 14 measured vegetation characteristics. Native species richness was higher in seeded than in unseeded sites at 1, 2, and 5 years of age, whereas diversity and evenness were generally higher at all assessment ages. Exotic species density was higher in unseeded than in seeded sites from 5 years onward, whereas richness was higher from 8 years onward. Nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased exotic species richness, density, and cover. Ephemerals dominated plant density in all rehabilitation treatments over time, whereas seeder species dominated cover. In contrast, resprouting species dominated density and cover in the unmined forest. Orchids were the only species that were not present in the first year in rehabilitated sites but increased in abundance over time. Vegetation composition in rehabilitated areas did not become more similar to the unmined forest during the 14 years since seeding, instead strongly reflected the initial species mix. Rehabilitated bauxite mines appear to follow the initial floristic composition model of succession.

AB Phenotypic plasticity is thought to be a major mechanism allowing sessile organisms such as plants to adapt to environmental heterogeneity. However, the adaptive value of many common plastic responses has not been tested by linking these responses to fitness. Even when plasticity is adaptive, costs of plasticity, such as the energy necessary to maintain regulatory pathways for plastic responses, may constrain its evolution. We used a greenhouse experiment to test whether plastic physiological responses to soil water availability (wet vs. dry conditions) were adaptive and/or costly in the congeneric wildflowers Lobelia cardinalis and L. siphilitica. Eight physiological traits related to carbon and water uptake were measured. Specific leaf area (SLA), photosynthetic rate (A), stomatal conductance (g(s)), and photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) responded plastically to soil water availability in L. cardinalis. Plasticity in A(max) was maladaptive, plasticity in A and g(s) was adaptive, and plasticity in SLA was adaptively neutral. The nature of adaptive plasticity in L. cardinalis, however, differed from previous studies. Lobelia cardinalis plants with more conservative water use, characterized by lower g(s), did not have higher fitness under drought conditions. Instead, well-watered L. cardinalis that had higher g(s) had higher fitness. Only A(max) responded plastically to drought in L. siphilitica, and this response was adaptively neutral. We detected no costs of plasticity for any physiological trait in either L. cardinalis or L. siphilitica, suggesting that the evolution of plasticity in these traits would not be constrained by costs. Physiological responses to drought in plants are presumed to be adaptive, but our data suggest that much of this plasticity can be adaptively neutral or maladaptive.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate spider assemblages of the Italian vineyards of Langa Astigiania (northwest Italy). Pitfall trapping and standardized hand collecting were combined to have an overall idea of the spider fauna living in this agroecosystem. A total of 138 samples for pitfall sampling and 92 for hand collecting sites were collected at 23 different times over a period of 2 yr (2003 and 2004). The vineyards differ mainly from agricultural practices (certified organic production, production according to EEC's Council Regulation 2092/91. on biological agriculture and intensive production) and for the heterogeneity of landscape matrix surrounding them. We studied the influence of these two factors on spider assemblages applying canonical correspondence analysis and multiresponse permutation procedures (MRPPs). Significant results of MRPP were analyzed in terms of hunting strategies. Significant differences are found among groups according to both landscape heterogeneity and agricultural practices, the first resulting more significantly. Analyzed in terms of hunting strategies, an increase in landscape heterogeneity seems to provide an increase in ambush spiders and specialized predators, whereas an increase in sheet web weavers seems to be related to homogeneous landscapes.

AB Evolutionary change results from selection acting on genetic variation. For migration to be successful, many different aspects of an animal's physiology and behaviour need to function in a co-coordinated way. Changes in one migratory trait are therefore likely to be accompanied by changes in other migratory and life-history traits. At present, we have some knowledge of the pressures that operate at the various stages of migration, but we know very little about the extent of genetic variation in various aspects of the migratory syndrome. As a consequence, our ability to predict which species is capable of what kind of evolutionary change, and at which rate, is limited. Here, we review how our evolutionary understanding of migration may benefit from taking a quantitative-genetic approach and present a framework for studying the causes of phenotypic variation. We review past research, that has mainly studied single migratory traits in captive birds, and discuss how this work could be extended to study genetic variation in the wild and to account for genetic correlations and correlated selection. In the future, reaction-norm approaches may become very important, as they allow the study of genetic and environmental effects on phenotypic expression within a single framework, as well as of their interactions. We advocate making more use of repeated measurements on single individuals to study the causes of among-individual variation in the wild, as they are easier to obtain than data on relatives and can provide valuable information for identifying and selecting traits. This approach will be particularly informative if it involves systematic testing of individuals under different environmental conditions. We propose extending this research agenda by using optimality models to predict levels of variation and covariation among traits and constraints. This may help us to select traits in which we might expect genetic variation, and to identify the most informative environmental axes. We also recommend an expansion of the passerine model, as this model does not apply to birds, like geese, where cultural transmission of spatio-temporal information is an important determinant of migration patterns and their variation.

AB Introductions of non-native predators and competitors appear to contribute to worldwide amphibian declines; however, potential negative impacts of invasive plants on habitat quality and amphibian populations have not been examined. Loss of diversity and alterations in ecosystem function associated with plant invasions may disrupt food webs, potentially leading to further declines of already threatened amphibian populations. We used a combination of small bins, mesocosms, and field experiments to examine the impacts of Eurasian purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) replacing native cattails (Typha latifolia) in North American freshwater wetlands on survival, developmental rate, and diet (freshwater algae) of American toad (Bufo americanus) tadpoles. Tadpoles developed slower in L. salicaria compared to tadpoles developing in T. latifolia. This effect was consistent across experimental venues, although mesocosms showed this effect only in the second year of our study. Survival and development rates were always more variable in purple loosestrife than in cattail. In bins, tadpoles showed significantly reduced survival when raised in purple loosestrife extract and addition of leaf litter exacerbated this negative effect. Tadpole survival rates in mesocosms and field cages were not significantly different between plant species, most likely an effect of high variability among replicates. We suspect a combination of direct toxicity of high tannin concentrations in L. salicaria leaves and their indirect negative impacts on aquatic food webs are responsible for these results. Tadpole gut analyses revealed differences in algal communities among venues and between L. salicaria and T. latifolia suggesting that alterations in tadpole food quality and quantity contribute to the observed reduced tadpole performance. The replacement of native wetland plant species by L. salicaria does not represent a simple exchange of ecological equivalents and the function of invaded habitats for native species has clearly changed. While we were investigating only a single amphibian species, our results suggest that the impact of L. salicaria on ecosystem processes and aquatic food webs may be more general and likely to negatively affect other wetland species. The threats non-indigenous plants represent for amphibian populations and food webs may be underestimated, and warrant further investigation.

AB Twenty-five sites located in five wetland zones within Donana, south-west Spain were studied for copepod and cladoceran species richness and composition in relation to habitat characteristics from January to March 2004. The gamma-diversity of copepods and cladocerans combined varied between wetland zones, which differed significantly in conductivity, surface area and abundance of vegetation. However, there were no significant differences between zones in local species richness of either copepods or cladocerans or the two combined. Species richness was significantly higher in sites with intermediate hydroperiods (duration between 3 and 5 months) than in sites with shorter or longer hydroperiods. CCA analyses performed separately for copepods and cladocerans extracted conductivity, surface area, and vegetation cover as the main factors structuring species composition of both groups. Ours is one of the first studies of zooplankton in the natural marshes of the Donana World Heritage Site, and we recorded five species new to the Donana area.

AB Temperature increase and altered precipitation are facets of "Global Change", along with enhanced tropospheric ozone (O-3) and CO2 levels. Both O-3 and drought may curtail the probably limited capacity of "extra" carbon fixation in forest trees under a CO2-enriched atmosphere. in view of the exceptionally dry year of 2003 in Central Europe, this mini-review highlights O-3/drought interactions in biochemical and ecophysiological responses of trees. Such interactions appear to vary, depending on the genotype and factorial scenarios. If O-3 perturbs stomatal regulation, tolerance to both drought and persisting O-3 exposure may be weakened, although drought preceding O-3 stress may "harden" against O-3 impact. Stomatal closure under drought may shield trees against O-3 uptake and injury, which indeed was the case in 2003. However, the trees' "tuning" between O-3 uptake and defence capacity is crucial in stress tolerance. Defence may be constrained due to limited carbon fixation, which results from the trade-off with O-3 exclusion upon stomatal closure. Drought may cause a stronger reduction in stem growth than does ozone on an annual basis.

AB Extremely high levels of intraspecific mtDNA differences in pulmonate gastropods have been reported repeatedly and several hypotheses to explain them have been postulated. We studied the phylogeny and phylogeography of 51 populations (n = 843) of the highly polymorphic terrestrial slug Arion subfuscus (Draparnaud, 1805) across its native distribution range in Western Europe. By combining the analysis of single stranded conformation polymorphisms (SSCP) and nucleotide sequencing, we obtained individual sequence data for a fragment of the mitochondrial 16S rDNA and a fragment of the nuclear ITS1. Additionally, five polymorphic allozyme loci were scored. Based on the 16S rDNA phylogeny, five monophyletic haplotype groups with sequence divergences of 9-21% were found. Despite this deep mitochondrial divergence, the haplotype groups were not monophyletic for the nuclear ITS1 fragment and haplotype group-specific allozyme alleles were not found. Although there is evidence for an accelerated mtDNA clock, the divergence among the haplotype groups is older than the Pleistocene and their current allopatric ranges probably reflect allopatric divergence and glacial survival in separate refugia from which different post-glacial colonization routes were established. A range-overlap of two mtDNA groups (S1 and S2, 21% sequence divergence) stretched from Central France and Belgium up to the North of the British Isles. The nuclear data suggest that this secondary contact resulted in hybridization between the allopatrically diverged groups. Therefore, it seems that, at least for two of the groups, the deep mtDNA divergence was only partially accompanied by the formation of reproductive isolation.

AB The recent sediments from two deep arctic lakes, Mitrofanovskoe and Vanuk- ty, situated in the permafrost belt within the Bol'shezemel'skaya Tundra in the northern Ural region, were studied for diatoms, chironomids, spheroidal carbonaceous particles and stable lead isotopes. The magnitudes and rates-of-change in diatom and chironomid assemblages were numerically estimated. Instrumental climate records were used to assess statistically the amount of variance in diatom and chironomid data explained by temperature. August and September air temperatures have a statistically signi. cant effect on diatom composition at both lakes. At Mitrofanovskoe Lake, major compositional changes in diatom and chironomid assemblages occurred at the turn of the 20th century and might be related to the regional increase in temperature. Chironomidinferred air temperature also increased by approximately 1 degrees C since the early 1900s. At both lakes diatom compositional changes, coincident with the increase in June and September temperatures, also occurred in the late 1960s. These compositional changes are correlated with the increase in diatom production, sediment organic content and diatom species richness, and are likely to be a diatom response to the lengthening of the growing season. These changes are also correlated with the circum- Arctic temperature increase from the 1960s. A chironomid response to the late 1960s temperature increase was less pronounced at both lakes. Pollution levels are relatively low and pollution history is unrelated to ecological changes. Both lead isotopes and spheroidal carbonaceous particles show a clear atmospheric pollution signal, peaking in the 1980s.

AB Variations in the structure and dynamics of a phytoplankton community were determined during two periods in 2001, along five cascading reservoirs of the Iguacu River, Parana State (Brazil). The vertical dynamics of the phytoplankton was related to underwater light availability and the water column-mixing regime. Correlations between physical and chemical variables and phytoplankton abundance were evaluated by Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). No significant cascading effect throughout the serial reservoirs was obtained. Thus, the main factor affecting the structure of the phytoplankton assemblages of each reservoir was the hydrodynamic pattern. The instability of the water column during the winter favored the development of R-strategist species such as Aulacoseira granulata, Urosolenia longiseta and U. eriensis in most reservoirs. In the period of the highest hydraulic stability and temperature, the greatest contribution to biomass came from Cyanophyceae S-strategists such as Aphanocapsa sp.l, Anabaena planctonica and A. crassa. The phytoplanktonic associations recorded were important indicators of the environmental conditions of these reservoirs.

AB In the increasingly important domain of insular invasion ecology, the role of facilitation between different introduced taxa has been mentioned, but rarely studied. This paper outlines facilitation between introduced mammals and the invasive succulents Carpobrotus edulis and C. aff. acinaciformis on offshore islands in southeast France. Rats and rabbits are the primary seed dispersers of Carpobrotus sp. on the islands studied. No such dispersal activity was detected on the adjacent mainland. Seed digestion by rats and rabbits also enhanced percent seed germination and speed, in spite of an associated reduction in seed size. In return, Carpobrotus provides a water/energy-rich food source during the dry summer season, thus demonstrating a clear case of mutualism between invaders.

AB Ecological and life history characteristics such as population size, dispersal pattern, and mating system mediate the influence of genetic drift and gene flow on population subdivision. Bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) and mountain whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni) differ markedly in spawning location, population size and mating system. Based on these differences, we predicted that bull trout would have reduced genetic variation within and greater differentiation among populations compared with mountain whitefish. To test this hypothesis, we used microsatellite markers to determine patterns of genetic divergence for each species in the Clark Fork River, Montana, USA. As predicted, bull trout had a much greater proportion of genetic variation partitioned among populations than mountain whitefish. Among all sites, F-ST was seven times greater for bull trout (F-ST = 0.304 for bull trout, 0.042 for mountain whitefish). After removing genetically differentiated high mountain lake sites for each species F-ST, was 10 times greater for bull trout (F-ST = 0.176 for bull trout; F-ST = 0.018 for mountain whitefish). The same characteristics that affect dispersal patterns in these species also lead to predictions about the amount and scale of adaptive divergence among populations. We provide a theoretical framework that incorporates variation in ecological and life history factors, neutral divergence, and adaptive divergence to interpret how neutral and adaptive divergence might be correlates of ecological and life history factors.

AB Organisms respond to their surroundings at multiple spatial scales, and different organisms respond differently to the same environment. Existing landscape models, such as the "fragmentation model" (or patch-matrix-corridor model) and the "variegation model," can be limited in their ability to explain complex patterns for different species and across multiple scales. An alternative approach is to conceptualize landscapes as overlaid species-specific habitat contour maps. Key characteristics of this approach are that different species may respond differently to the same environmental conditions and at different spatial scales. Although similar approaches are being used in ecological modeling, there is much room for habitat contours as a useful conceptual tool. By providing an alternative view of landscapes, a contour model may stimulate more field investigations stratified on the basis of ecological variables other than human-defined patches and patch boundaries. A conceptual model of habitat contours may also help to communicate ecological complexity to land managers. Finally, by incorporating additional ecological complexity, a conceptual model based on habitat contours may help to bridge the perceived gap between pattern and process in landscape ecology. Habitat contours do not preclude the use of existing landscape models and should be seen as a complementary approach most suited to heterogeneous human-modified landscapes.

AB Eurasian badgers, Meles meles (L., 1758), have an extensive geographic range throughout which their social organization varies. Their capacity for intraspecific variation can now best be understood by studying them in landscapes that differ from the lush, lowland farmland where their tendency to form large groups has been most intensively investigated. Badgers in cork oak (Quercus suber L.) woodland are thus a priority for study, as this Mediterranean landscape provides an extreme contrast to those studied elsewhere. In this habitat in Portugal, we found 0.36-0.48 badgers/km(2), one of the lowest population densities recorded in Western Europe. Here, individuals used seasonally stable home ranges that averaged 4.46 km(2) and that were occupied by 3-4 adults plus 3-4 cubs of the year. In this landscape, badgers selectively used cork oak woodland with understory and riparian vegetation. As predicted by the resource dispersion hypothesis, home-range size was positively correlated with food-patch dispersion. In southwestern Portugal, badgers depend upon an environmental mosaic such as olive groves and orchards and vegetable gardens for food and cork oak woodlands for shelter and protection.

AB Forest genetic resources are considered here in a global perspective, including both cultivated and wild populations. Human interference on global genetic resources results from the impact of different activities: (i) breeding and selection, (ii) seed transfer, (iii) plant population management activities, (iv) alteration of the environment. Expected genetic consequences of these activities were reviewed and revised according to the recent literature. Research on domestication in crop plants reveals that drastic selection can still retain a significant level of genetic diversity including diversity of some genes involved in the selected traits. More important than the impact of breeding and selection in trees, the impact of seed transfer on the whole resource is complex, depending on the origin and genetic diversity of the transplanted material, as well as on the environmental conditions and genetic diversity of the local population in the destination site. Among silvicultural practices, the regeneration phase has a great potential for reducing genetic diversity, but various regeneration practices may result in high genetic diversity. Other treatments, like thinning, may also interfere with the demographic parameters which shape genotic diversity. Thus, different silvicultural systems will have different impacts on the genetic resources of target species but no simple ranking can be made in that respect. Attention should also be given to the genetic resources of non-target species which may be severely affected. Finally, a major impact is suspected from modifications in the biotic and abiotic environment: this should be further investigated. Monitoring the genetic resources globally requires the development of criteria and indicators: some, recent research orientations serving this objective were listed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Several insect groups have adapted to fire cycles in boreal forests, and can efficiently use new habitats created by fire. Our study aimed at producing a first characterization of post-fire Coleoptera assemblages of black spruce forests of eastern North America. For two years, we sampled Coleoptera using flight-interception traps in burned stands of contrasting age and structure in a 5097-ha wildfire and in neighbouring unburned mature stands. More than 40 species were exclusively captured in burned stands. Time elapsed since fire and proximity of unburned forests were the most significant parameters affecting Coleoptera assemblages. Stand age and structure had limited effects on assemblage structure; the Scolytid Polygraphus rufipennis Kirby was the only common species to clearly favor older stands. Fire-associated Coleoptera assemblages found in our study area were clearly distinct from those found in similar unburned stands; we should thus be conservative in our management approach concerning recently burned stands.

AB We documented a density-dependent age of first reproduction using a population of Spanish Imperial Eagles (Aquila adalberti) in Dohana National Park (southwestern Spain). Then, a stochastic individual-based simulation was designed to analyze the effect of variations in the age of first reproduction on the fluctuation of small populations. This is a discrete-time simulation model that uses the age structure, mortality rates, reproductive rate, and density-dependent relationships from empirical studies. Age of breeding in the real population was positively related,to population density. The probability of persistence of simulated populations was affected by both breeding population ceiling and age-of first breeding. Our simulations were compared to the historical evolution of the Donana population, assuming an age of first reproduction of three years. Density-dependent variation in age of first breeding increased the mean time of persistence, allowing the population to stay at carrying capacity longer. This buffer mechanism could be crucial for the persistence of small populations.

AB We estimated the below-ground net plant productivity (BNPP) of different biomass components in an intensively and continuously 45-ha grazed site and in a neighbouring exclosure ungrazed for 16 years for a natural mountain grassland in central Argentina. We measured approximately twice as much dead below-ground biomass in the grazed site as in the ungrazed site, with a strong concentration of total below-ground biomass towards the upper 10 cm of the soil layer in both sites. The main contribution to total live biomass was accounted for by very fine (<0.5 mm) and fine roots (0.5-1.0 mm) both at the grazed (79%) and at the ungrazed (81%) sites. We measured more dead biomass for almost all root components, more live biomass of rhizomes, tap roots and bulbs, and less live biomass of thicker roots (>1 mm) in the grazed site. The seasonal variation of total live below-ground biomass mainly reflected climate, with the growing season being limited to the warmer and wetter portion of the year, but such variation was higher in the grazed site. Using different methods of estimation of BNPP, we estimated maximum values of 1241 and 723 g m(-2) year(-1) for the grazed and ungrazed sites, respectively. We estimated that very fine root productivity was almost twice as high at the grazed site as at the ungrazed one, despite the fact that both sites had similar total live biomass, and root turnover rate was twofold at the grazed site.

ID HISTORY; REGIMES
AB To analyze the effect of landscape structure (viz. amount of wetlands) on the past forest fire regime in boreal Sweden, we reconstructed detailed fire histories by cross-dating fire scars in living and dead Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in two different landscape types: mire-free landscapes with a low proportion (1%-2%) of mires and mire-rich landscapes with a high proportion (21%-33%) of mires. Two localities were selected and at each one, adjacent mire-free and mire-rich areas of 256-601 ha were sampled. Over the studied 650-year period, the two landscape types differed primarily in the fire intervals and sizes of fires. In the mire-rich landscapes, fires had frequently stopped against mire elements. The net effect was significantly longer fire intervals in the mire-rich than in the mire-free landscape (on average, 32 versus 56 years). The mire-rich areas also had a tail of very long fire intervals lacking in the mire-free areas (maximal interval 292 years). We conclude that mires can have a profound effect on both spatial and temporal patterns of forest fires in the boreal forest, but only when they are effective fuel breaks (i.e., they are wet enough) at the time the fires burn and if they truly dissect the nonmire portion of the forest landscape.

AB Measurement of nitrogen isotopic composition (delta(15)N) of plants and soil nitrogen might allow the characteristics of N transformation in an ecosystem to be detected. We tested the measurement of delta(15)N for its ability to provide a picture of N dynamics at the ecosystem level by doing a simple comparison of delta(15)N between soil N pools and plants, and by using an existing model. delta(15)N of plants and soil N was measured together with foliar nitrate reductase activity (NRA) and the foliar NO3- pool at two sites with different nitrification rates in a temperature forest in Japan. delta(15)N of plants was similar to that of soil NO3- in the high-nitrification site. Because of high foliar NRA and the large foliar NO3- pool at this site, we concluded that plant delta(15) N indicated a great reliance of plants on soil NO3- there. However, many delta(15)N of soil N overlapped each other at the other site, and delta(15)N could not provide definitive evidence of the N source. The existing model was verified by measured delta(15) N of soil inorganic N and it explained the variations of plant delta(15)N between the two sites in the context of relative importance of nitrification, but more information about isotopic fractionations during plant N uptake is required for quantitative discussions about the plant N source. The model applied here can provide a basis to compare delta(15) N signatures from different ecosystems and to understand N dynamics.

AB Climate change and biological invasions, two of the hottest topics in ecology, both have ecological and societal implications, but they have developed on separate and parallel paths. Both are likely to have global impacts, yet researchers seldom explicitly consider their interaction. We argue that changes in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and subsequent climate change may facilitate biological invasions, both directly and indirectly, and that our research agenda to date has left us poorly prepared to predict the consequences for communities and ecosystems. Forecasting the impact of biological invaders or elevated CO2 is a challenge for ecologists, and it is therefore prudent and timely to investigate the greater challenge, namely predicting the combined effects of invaders and elevated CO2 on native ecological systems.

ID CONSERVATION; ECOSYSTEMS; DIVERSITY
AB Protected areas as biodiversity benchmarks allow a separation of the direct effects of human impact on biodiversity loss from those of other environmental changes. We illustrate the use of ecological baselines with a case from the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania. We document a substantial but previously unnoted loss of bird diversity in agriculture detected by reference to the immediately adjacent native vegetation in Serengeti. The abundance of species found in agriculture was only 28% of that for the same species in native savannah. Insectivorous species feeding in the grass layer or in trees were the most reduced. Some 50% of both insectivorous and granivorous species were not recorded in agriculture, with ground-feeding and tree species most affected. Grass-layer insect abundance and diversity was much reduced in agriculture, consistent with the loss of insectivorous birds. These results indicate that many species of birds will become confined to protected areas over time. We need to determine whether existing protected areas are sufficiently large to maintain viable populations of insectivorous birds likely to become confined to them. This study highlights the essential nature of baseline areas for assessing causes of change in human-dominated systems and for developing innovative strategies to restore biodiversity.

AB It is nearly 100 years since the first studies on variation in the shell patterns of land snails. Subsequently, snails have come to play an important role in our understanding of natural selection in the wild. In particular, snails have been an ideal model to understand the roles of history and selection in the origins of diversity. More recently, many studies have investigated the molecular genetic variation within snails. It is clear that snails are unusual, because some genes may vary by 10%-30% within a species. This molecular variation affords an excellent opportunity to further understand the action of natural selection in shaping the present-day phenotypic diversity. In the first part of this review, I illustrate the distinction between the historical and selective interpretations using one of the best-studied species, Cepaea nemoralis, and the example of "area effects." In the second part, studies that have compared patterns of morphological and molecular variation (especially DNA) are examined.

AB The tundra-taiga interface is a dominant vegetation boundary that is related to climate and has an importance at a global level for its contribution to land atmosphere interactions, biodiversity and land use. However, our understanding of the precise location, dynamics and characteristics of the boundary, and its environmental and biotic drivers at a circumpolar level is poor. Our understanding has been constrained for various reasons, perhaps including a quest by researchers to denote 2- or even 3-dimensional tree distribution limits to a single line on a map. Current rapid sociological and environmental changes in the north necessitate better definitions to be made of characteristics associated with the tundra-taiga interface so that changes can be monitored and identified, and implications of these changes can be assessed. This concept paper introduces some of the complexities of adequately defining the boundary and suggests characteristics and processes that could focus future research at a collaborative, circumpolar level to create baseline data and to monitor and predict changes in the boundary zone.

AB In relation to the drought-prone and nutrient-poor habitat, vascular epiphytes are routinely referred to as inherently slow-growing plants, although actual evidence is rare. To test this notion we measured in situ growth of the understorey orchid Aspasia principissa and the tank bromeliad Vriesea sanguinolenta, and, for the latter species, also the growth under favourable conditions in the greenhouse. Using growth analysis we show: (1) that in an intraspecific comparison, small to intermediate individuals yield the highest relative,growth rates (RGR) in situ A. principissa: 1.6 10(-3) d(-1); V. sanguinolenta: 3.3 10(-3) d(-1); (2) that the bromeliad reaches maximum size after ca. 15 yr, while the orchid needs at least 20 yr; and (3) small V. sanguinolenta plants exhibit a highly plastic growth response to favourable conditions in the greenhouse, reaching an almost 10-fold increase in RGR. In spite of a substantial increase in growth under more favourable conditions, our results are consistent with the notion that epiphytes are inherently slow growing organisms.

AB We compared genetic diversity estimated from allozymes and from random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDs) in a sample of 210 Great Basin bristlecone pines (Pinas longaeva Bailey) from three groves in tire While Mountains, California, USA. The White Mountains are the most westerly extension of bristlecone pine and home to the oldest known living trees. We assayed two forks of each tree to determine whether they originated from multiple seed caches of the Clark's nutcracker. Despite the limited and fragmented distribution of bristlecone pine, its level of genetic diversity was comparable to that of other pines, but lower than that reported for eastern populations of Great Basin bristlecone pine. Twenty-six of 36 allozymes were polymorphic (p(gs) = 38.9%: p = 63.0%), with observed heterozygosity (H-o) of 0.122 and expected heterozygosity (H-e) of 0.134. The proportion of the total variation among populations (G(ST)) was only 0.011. The high proportion of trees with multiple sterns was not due to germination in seed caches, only six of 210 forked trees had multiple allozyme genotypes. Of the 42 RAPD loci scored. 27 were monomorphic. Genetic diversity for RAPDs was nearly the same as that for allozymes (p(gs) = 34.1%, H-e = 0.130). However, the estimates of diversity and differentiation were much higher (H-e = 0.321, G(ST) = 0.039) after excluding monomorphic loci.

AB 1. The influence of fire upon biodiversity has been investigated in many ecosystems under a wide range of environmental conditions. However, there is no information on how fire affects faunal biodiversity in deciduous forest ecosystems prone to winter fires, such as those on the southern slopes of the Alps.
   2. The main aim of this study was to analyse the effects of single and repeated fires on the structure and species diversity of spider communities in chestnut forests in southern Switzerland. A second objective was to interpret the ecological response of forest-floor habitats to wildfires, using epigeic spiders as bioindicators.
   3. One-hundred and thirty-three spider species were found in pitfall trap samples collected between April and September in burnt and control sites in chestnut coppices. Species richness and community composition were influenced by fire frequency and the time elapsed since the last fire. About 19% of the species were trapped exclusively in sites that had been repeatedly burnt, while 11% occurred only in unburnt coppice. Post-fire development of the spider community was chiefly from individuals that survived in situ. We found no characteristic pioneer species in any of the burnt sites. There were indirect effects of fire on the spider community, through interactions between species arising from the changing environmental conditions following a fire.
   4. After a single fire, changes in community composition were only observable during the first 2 years. At sites that had experienced repeated fires, there was a more persistent influence on community composition. These sites were characterized by an increase in species richness and species diversity. The presence of a wide ecological range of species in 'repeated fire' sites was probably due to the mosaic structure of the environment and the wide range of microclimate conditions at the soil surface, with a predominance of xeric conditions.
   5. The spider communities of chestnut forests were resilient to disturbance by fire. Both the formerly intensive management of these forests (until the 1950s) and a history of frequent fires that goes back to the Neolithic period have played an important part in the development of the spider community in these forests.

AB The amount, variability, quality and spatial pattern of coarse woody debris (CWD) on mineral soil sites was studied within a natural Pinus sylvestris L. dominated boreal forest landscape in Russian Viena Karelia. Data on the total CWD was collected on 27 sample plots (20 m x 100 m) and data on large CWD was surveyed along four transects (40 in wide and up to 1000 m long). The mean volume of CWD (standing and down combined) was 69.5 m(3)ha(-1), ranging from 22.2 m(3)ha(-1) to 158.7 m(3)ha(-1) from plot to plot. On average, 26.9 m(3)ha(-1) (39%) of CWD was standing dead wood and 42.7 m(3)ha(-1) (61%) down dead wood. The CWD displayed a wide range of variation in tree species, tree size, stage of decay, dead tree type and structural characteristics, creating a high diversity of CWD habitats for saproxylic organisms. Large CWD was almost continuously present throughout the landscape and its overall spatial distribution was close to random, although a weak autocorrelation pattern was found at distances less than about 50 m. On small spatial scales total CWD showed wide variation up to a sample area of about 0.1 ha, beyond which the variation stabilized. The fire history variables of the sample plots were not related to the amount of CWD. This and the spatial pattern of CWD suggest that the CWD dynamics in this landscape was not driven by fire, but by more or less random mortality of trees due to autogenic causes of death.

AB An accumulated body of theory and empirical evidence suggests that habitat selection by animals is a scale-dependent, hierarchical process. Hierarchy theory predicts that habitat suitability is influenced by the interaction of factors at multiple spatial scales from the microsite to the landscape and that higher-order factors impose constraints at lower levels. For instance, large-scale factors such as landscape context may make a site unsuitable for a species even if the vegetation structure and composition are appropriate. In addition, the spatial arrangement of habitat elements at all scales must be considered when planning restoration efforts. For example, the presence of snags does not ensure that the site will be suitable for snag-dependent species. The size, age, and spacing of snags and their juxtaposition to other habitat elements must also be considered. Finally, all habitats are dynamic, and therefore the ecological processes that contribute to those dynamics must be maintained or suitable substitutes included in the recovery plan. When considering restoring habitat for wildlife, we recommend that managers: (1) identify the wildlife species they want to target for restoration efforts, (2) consider the size and landscape context of the restoration site and whether it is appropriate for the target species, (3) identify the habitat elements that are necessary for the target species, (4) develop a strategy for restoring those elements and the ecological processes that maintain them, and (5) implement a long-term monitoring program to gauge the success of the restoration efforts.

AB Recent findings from Michigan suggest that recombination may play a role in the survival and evolution of sensitivity to the fungicide mefenoxam in populations of Phytophthora capsici on cucurbit hosts. In 1998, 63 mefenoxam insensitive isolates were recovered from a squash field in which mefenoxam had been applied. Additional isolates were recovered from untreated squash fields planted at this location in 1999 (200 isolates) and the spring of 2000 (34 isolates). Isolates from 1998 and 1999 were characterized using fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers and all isolates were screened for compatibility type and mefenoxam sensitivity. In 1998 and 1999, 92 and 71% of the isolates, respectively, had unique multilocus AFLP genotypes with no identical isolates recovered between years. Seventy-two identical AFLP markers were clearly resolved in both the 1998 and 1999 sample sets, and fixation indices for the 37 polymorphic AFLP loci indicate little differentiation between years. There was no decrease in the frequency of resistant isolates during the 2 years without mefenoxam selection. We conclude that oospores play a key role in overwintering and that the frequency of mefenoxam insensitivity may not decrease in an agriculturally significant time period (2 years) once mefenoxam selection pressure is removed.

AB During the first 10-20 Kyr of the Eocene temperatures warmed by 4-8degreesC in middle and high latitudes, then cooled again over the succeeding similar to200 Kyr. Major changes in the composition of marine and terrestrial faunas, including one of the largest mammalian turnover events of the Cenozoic, occurred during this temperature excursion. To better understand the effects of rapid climatic change on continental biotas, we studied 60 fossil pollen samples collected from 900 m of section spanning approximately three million years of the late Paleocene and early Eocene; the samples come from the Fort Union Formation and Willwood Formation in the Bighorn Basin of northwestern Wyoming, paleolatitude approximately 47degreesN. There are 40 samples from the 500 m of rock deposited during the one million year interval centered on the Paleocene/Eocene boundary, although pollen was not preserved well in rocks representing the short warm interval at the base of the Eocene.
   Overall, the palynoflora shows moderate change in composition and diversity. Two pollen taxa clearly expanded their ranges to include North America in the first 400 Kyr of the Eocene, Platycarya (Juglandaceae), and Intratriporopollenites instructus (cf. Tilia), but they account for less than 5% of pollen grains in the early Eocene. There are no last appearances of common taxa associated with the Paleocene/Eocene boundary. The most noticeable palynological changes are the decrease in abundance of Caryapollenites spp. and Polyatriopollenites vermontensis (Juglandaceae), and the increase in abundance of Taxodiaceae (bald cypress family), Ulmaceae (elm family), and Betulaceae (birch family), particularly Alnipollenites spp, (alder). There are 22% more species in the Eocene samples than in the Paleocene samples; mean richness of Eocene samples is 17% higher than the mean of Paleocene samples. The mean evenness of Eocene samples is higher than that of Paleocene samples, but the difference is not significant.
   The modest level of floral change during the late Paleocene and early Eocene contrasts with the major taxonomic turnover and ecological rearrangement of North American mammalian faunas observed at the same time. Faunal change probably resulted from intercontinental range expansion across Arctic land bridges that became habitable as a result of high-latitude warming, so it is surprising that climatically sensitive plants did not also experience a major episode of interchange. The absence of fossil plants from the temperature excursion interval itself could prevent us from recognizing a transient shift in floral composition, but it is clear that the flora did not undergo a major and permanent restructuring like that seen in the mammals. The contrast between the moderate floral response to warming and the strong faunal response is consistent with the idea that interactions between immigrant and native taxa, rather than climate directly, were the primary cause of terrestrial biotic change across the Paleocene/Eocene boundary.

AB 1, The size and proximate composition of eggs and alevins (larvae) were measured from six full sibling families of Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar), at six stages between fertilization and first feeding.
   2, Egg and alevin size measures (diameter, wet mass, dry mass) and proximate composition attributes (water, protein, fat, energy) were all highly correlated with each other (r = 0.89-0.99), suggesting that each is a reasonable surrogate for any other.
   3, Most of the variation in egg size (95.0-97.0%) and composition attributes (95.5-97.9%) was partitioned between, rather than within, females. Most of this variation was attributable to differences in female size, owing to the length of time spent at sea.
   4, Fat, protein and energy content varied less on a relative basis (controlling for egg size variation) than on an absolute basis, suggesting that certain combinations of egg attributes are optimal regardless of egg size.
   5, Stored fat decreased by 9.6 mug day(-1) before hatching but increased by 27.4 mug day(-1) after hatching. The increase after hatching suggests that alevins actively synthesize (probably from protein) and store lipids between hatching and first feeding.
   6. Stored protein decreased by 8.8 mug day(-1) before hatching and by 181.3 mug day(-1) after hatching. Assuming all metabolic energy was derived from stored protein, metabolic rate increased logarithmically from 0.115 3 day(-1) to 5.43 J day(-1). Rates of oxygen consumption estimated from protein loss (6.09-288.9 mul O-2 d(-1)) were similar to those reported in studies that measured oxygen consumption using respirometry.
   7. Alevins appear to convert protein to fat, a change that their mothers were unable or unwilling tin an evolutionary sense) to make. This may reflect the conflicting goals of parents and offspring for maximizing fitness.

AB The natterjack toad Bufo calamita is rare in Britain, which is at the northwestern edge of its biogeographical range. We investigated the level of genetic differentiation amongst almost all (34 out of 38) of the surviving British populations of this species, and among six new populations established by translocations during the 1980s. For eight microsatellite loci, allele sizes and frequencies were analysed using samples from each of these populations. The populations clustered into three robustly differentiated groups, each of which corresponded with a geographical region (east/southeast England, Merseyside and Cumbria). The Cumbrian populations showed a further weak geographical substructuring into northern and southern clades. The populations in south Cumbria were genetically more diverse than those in any of the other regions, as judged by the mean numbers of alleles per locus and the mean heterozygosity estimates. The translocated populations clustered close to their founders and, with one exception, did not differ significantly with respect to mean allele numbers, heterozygosity or polymorphism level. However, significant genetic differentiation las measured by unbiased R-ST was found between all but one of the founder-translocation pairs. The implications of this phylogeographic study for the future conservation of B. calamita in Britain are discussed.

AB A high-resolution pollen and diatom stratigraphy has been studied from late-glacial annually laminated sediments of Holzmaar (425 m a.s.l., Germany). The sediment sequence studied comprises 475 varves and includes two environmental perturbations of different type and duration: the short, abrupt deposition of the late Allerempty setd tephra layer of the Laacher See volcano (LST, 11000 yr B.P.), and the more gradual onset of the 'Younger Dryas climatic cooling.
   Numerical analyses involving (partial) redundancy analyses in connection with Monte Carlo permutation tests suggest that the deposition of 78 mm of Laacher See Tephra had a statistically significant effect on the pollen stratigraphy (percentage and accumulation rates), most probably because of the proximity of the site to the volcano. The diatom accumulation rates also show a statistically significant change, whereas the diatom percentage data do not change significantly. The between-sample rates-of-change in both biostratigraphies are higher at and just are higher at and just after the LST event than at the transition to the Younger Dryas biozone. Sequence splitting of pollen and diatom accumulation rate data also shows a clustering of significant splits at the LST event. A close correlation between changes in the pollen and diatom percentage data for the investigated time-interval suggests a common underlying climatic signal, whereas the accumulation rates of both biostratigraphies behave more individualistically and show more short-term variability due, in part, to the inherent noise in the two data sets. Variance partitioning shows that the local pollen and diatom assemblage zones explain much of the variance in the data-sets. Statistical modelling using redundancy analysis shows that the changes in the diatom assemblages are best predicted by the Younger Dryas biozone and the main changes in the pollen stratigraphy (as represented by the first PCA axis of the pollen data).
   The results suggest that the biostratigraphies studied at Holzmaar reflect generally stable systems which were disturbed by the deposition of the Laacher See Tephra. After a phase of recovery both systems again reached a new g-term Younger Dryas climatic deterioration that perturbed the assemblages again. The very close and statistically significant parallelism between the major stratigraphical patterns in the pollen and diatom percentage data highlights the responses of the two biological systems to environmental perturbations at different temporal scales.

AB Using the family of poison-dart frogs (Dendrobatidae), this study investigates the hypothesis that a trait should evolve to become more specialized: i.e., that diets should evolve to become narrower. I propose and then test a specific hypothesis that specialist diets evolved from generalist diets in the Dendrobatidae, by explicitly defining ''specialist'' in the context of the foraging ecology of these frogs and by following guidelines for the comparative method proposed by Harvey and PageI. Overall, the genera judged to be more basal in the phylogeny (Colostethus, Epipedobates, Phyllobates) had wider and more generalist diets, in contrast to taxa higher in the clade (Dendrobates, Minyobates) which had narrower and more specialist diets. However, some genera (Phyllobates, Minyobates) did not fit neatly into this sequence, exhibiting wider and narrower diets, respectively, than expected based on other traits. I tentatively conclude that a narrow diet specializing on ants and mites is a derived trait and that a generalist or opportunistic diet is an ancestral trait in the Dendrobatidae. Moreover, suites of traits related to diet and foraging suggest that foraging ecology may have been a significant force driving radiation of the family at the generic level.

AB We used multivariate analyses to examine which Variables among the environmental and spatial components can best account for dietary variation in a freshwater fish, brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis. The diet composition of brook trout was quantified in 37 lakes of the Laurentian Shield, Quebec, Canada. Among the 25 measured environmental variables, fish species composition, sampling date, macrophyte abundance, and trout body length were the best predictors of diet composition. The total variation in diet composition was partitioned into four components: pure environmental 21.6%, pure spatial 23.2%, shared 19.9%, and unexplained 35.3%. A significant spatial trend in diet composition existed even after accounting for the main effects measured by the environmental variables. The two sets of spatial variables, when combined with the environmental descriptors, extracted different components of the dietary variation. The study allowed us to (1) highlight the role of spatial structure in diet variation of brook trout, (2) determine the relative contribution of both environmental and spatial components, and (3) generate testable hypotheses concerning mechanisms underlying the observed structure. Dependent variables other than diet composition, such as the density of different species at different sampling sites, can be used within the same statistical framework in studies of community ecology.

   RELATION TO FOREST FRAGMENTATION
SO OIKOS
LA English
DT Article
ID ISLANDS
AB A population of Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) in south-central Sweden showed a strong preference for forest older than 35 years and with more than 25% Norway spruce (Picea abies). This preferred habitat constituted 24% of the study area. The proportion of avoided habitats was 30%, and the remaining 46% could be described as used but not preferred habitats. Given these proportions, the squirrels can be shown theoretically to be able to reach all preferred patches by moving across the used, although not preferred habitat patches, or within the preferred ones. Males had larger home ranges (mean 121.6 ha) than females (mean 23.0 ha). Mean daily movement was 430 m for males and 180 m for females; the maximum movement was 2800 m for males and 680 m for females. Most of the preferred habitat occurred in fragments larger than the area requirement of an individual squirrel, and even the most isolated fragments were within a trivial range for squirrels. Therefore, we predict that the random sample hypothesis will give a good prediction of the effects of forest fragmentation on the red squirrel in this landscape. However, if the proportion of avoided habitats increases, isolation and fragment size might affect the population density of red squirrels and the population size would be smaller than predicted from the random sample hypothesis.

AB 1. We studied age at niche shift and sexual maturity of Arctic chaff Salvelinus alpinus (L.) from a Norwegian lake in relation to their energy budget.
   2. Young Arctic charr (age -2) fed successfully on zooplankton giving them a significant energy surplus for somatic growth. Energy intake, however, levelled off at age -3 to -4, and decreased with age among older fish. Similarly, energetic costs increased from age -2 to -3 and then the costs levelled off and decreased, probably as a consequence of a niche shift from zooplankton to zoobenthos feeding in deeper water. This shift did not increase energy intake, but reduced costs, probably through higher feeding efficiency on the larger zoobenthos in the deeper water and reduced metabolism at lower ambient temperature.
   3. Growth rate influences the age at niche shift and maturity. Fast-growing males attained maturity, and changed feeding niche, younger and at a smaller body size than their more slow-growing conspecifics. By contrast, female size at maturity was largely independent of age. The association between growth rate and these life-history traits is probably an effect of the close connection between growth rate and rate of metabolism in fish. We develop a model where the timing of niche shift and sexual maturation are a function of metabolic rate.
   4. The estimated maximum weight from energy budget considerations was very close to the observed asymptotic size for Arctic charr in this population. Females matured at a size above the estimated optimum (c. 30 g) and close to maximum size (c. 61 g). Male size at maturity, however, was more variable; some matured close to optimum size while others matured at twice that size. The concept of optimal size thus appears irrelevant in connection with size at sexual maturity of wild fish.

TI HETEROGENEOUS CURRENTS AND ALGAL RESOURCES MEDIATE IN SITU FORAGING
   ACTIVITY OF A MOBILE STREAM GRAZER
SO OIKOS
LA English
DT Article
AB The importance of spatial heterogeneity in near-bed currents and algal resource patchiness in regulating the movement patterns, foraging activities, and distribution of the mobile stream insect, Agapetus boulderensis Milne (Glossosomatidae: Trichoptera) was investigated with field observational studies and field experiments. Near-bed current velocities were characterized for topographically-complex substrata concurrently with spatial patterns of algal density and taxonomic composition. Activities of self-marked mobile larvae were examined in relationship to mapped current and algal resources. Near-bed currents alone influenced the distribution and local abundance of individuals in a size-dependent fashion - fifth (final) instar larvae occurred across a velocity range of < 5 to 50 cm s-1, while smaller third and fourth instar larvae were found only at currents ranging from < 5 to 30 cm s-1. Agapetus movement was also constrained by local current. Direction of movement on stone surfaces was significantly into or lateral to oncoming flow. Rate of movement was inversely related to local current speed and positively related both to temperature and to travel in the upstream direction. Agapetus movement and foraging were also related to algal density and taxonomic composition. Movement rate was inversely correlated with estimated diatom density but positively correlated with densities of green and blue-green algae for larvae on one stone. Gut analysis revealed a significant positive preference by Agapetus for diatoms, particularly Cocconeis placentula, which was overrepresented in the gut relative to other diatoms or to blue-green algae. Together, patterns of local current and of algal distribution and composition were important descriptors of movement and foraging activity of this mobile grazer under naturally heterogeneous field conditions. A field experiment under controlled conditions of current and algal density showed both factors were independent and non-interactive determinants of grazer movement rates. This study supports previous research showing the importance of algal patchiness in mediating grazer foraging activity and distribution, but it further indicates that patterns of resource use by grazers may be constrained by heterogeneous local currents, independent of the effects of food distribution and abundance.

AB The environmental effects of aquaculture manifest themselves on different space and time scales, ranging from internal effects which affect only a single cage or farm site to regional impacts covering an entire body of water. These distinct effects lead to different types of analysis and require different mitigation strategies. Even though complete scientific data on environmental impacts are seldom available, models based on existing scientific theory provide a better basis for regulation of aquaculture than ad hoc guidelines. Several models corresponding to different scales and types of impact are developed and the implications for management are discussed. The emphasis is on marine systems, although the models and analyses can also be adapted to freshwater aquaculture.

AB Three metrics of species diversity - species richness, the Shannon index and the Simpson index - are still widely used in ecology, despite decades of valid critiques leveled against them. Developing a robust diversity metric has been challenging because, unlike many variables ecologists measure, the diversity of a community often cannot be estimated in an unbiased way based on a random sample from that community. Over the past decade, ecologists have begun to incorporate two important tools for estimating diversity: coverage and Hill diversity. Coverage is a method for equalizing samples that is, on theoretical grounds, preferable to other commonly used methods such as equal-effort sampling, or rarefying datasets to equal sample size. Hill diversity comprises a spectrum of diversity metrics and is based on three key insights. First, species richness and variants of the Shannon and Simpson indices are all special cases of one general equation. Second, richness, Shannon and Simpson can be expressed on the same scale and in units of species. Third, there is no way to eliminate the effect of relative abundance from estimates of any of these diversity metrics, including species richness. Rather, a researcher must choose the relative sensitivity of the metric towards rare and common species, a concept which we describe as 'leverage.' In this paper we explain coverage and Hill diversity, provide guidelines for how to use them together to measure species diversity, and demonstrate their use with examples from our own data. We show why researchers will obtain more robust results when they estimate the Hill diversity of equal-coverage samples, rather than using other methods such as equal-effort sampling or traditional sample rarefaction.

AB We review changes in the status of butterflies in Europe, focusing on long-running population data available for the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Belgium, based on standardized monitoring transects. In the United Kingdom, 8% of resident species have become extinct, and since 1976 overall numbers declined by around 50%. In the Netherlands, 20% of species have become extinct, and since 1990 overall numbers in the country declined by 50%. Distribution trends showed that butterfly distributions began decreasing long ago, and between 1890 and 1940, distributions declined by 80%. In Flanders (Belgium), 20 butterflies have become extinct (29%), and between 1992 and 2007 overall numbers declined by around 30%. A European Grassland Butterfly Indicator from 16 European countries shows there has been a 39% decline of grassland butterflies since 1990. The 2010 Red List of European butterflies listed 38 of the 482 European species (8%) as threatened and 44 species (10%) as near threatened (note that 47 species were not assessed). A country level analysis indicates that the average Red List rating is highest in central and mid-Western Europe and lowest in the far north of Europe and around the Mediterranean. The causes of the decline of butterflies are thought to be similar in most countries, mainly habitat loss and degradation and chemical pollution. Climate change is allowing many species to spread northward while bringing new threats to susceptible species. We describe examples of possible conservation solutions and a summary of policy changes needed to conserve butterflies and other insects.
